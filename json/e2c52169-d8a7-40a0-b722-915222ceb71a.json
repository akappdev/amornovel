We cannot feel the warmth of the sun without knowing cold; we cannot feel the joy of a smile without knowing heartache. But sometimes I wonder how we could know joy without ever experiencing it, either.</p><p>My life would end today, when I hopped in the car at the end of the driveway and saw David in the rear-view, waving. It would be enough to crush me. But right now, in his arms, safe and protected from that fate, I could imagine this was what joy felt like.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Ara.\u201d He stepped back from our embrace. \u201cIt\u2019s only goodbye if you say it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, David. I\u2019ve never said goodbye to anyone I\u2019ve lost\u2014doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly, brushing his thumb over my cheek. \u201cWell, who knows, maybe I\u2019ll turn up some positive information on your bloodline\u2014perhaps you were adopted after all, and you\u2019ll be saying hello to a whole new family you never knew you had.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep the dad I have, but I\u2019d like a sister.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cThen, a sister I shall find you.\u201d</p><p>We both looked up to the car when Mike cleared his throat for the tenth time, leaning on the hood, his arms folded, the passenger door sitting open.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s your cue to go,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cNo, the last four huffs before that were. He\u2019s one grunt short of physically removing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we run away then?\u201d His eyes, as I looked up at him, offered only humour, not the proposition I hoped for.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could. But then who\u2019d catch the big bad vamp?\u201d</p><p>He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cLet the humans do it.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and wrapped my arms all the way around his ribs, disappearing from the warmth of the near-summer sun against the shade of his towering height. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will.\u201d He kept one hand around my neck as I backed slightly away. \u201cI\u2019ll find Drake for you, Ara\u2014and I\u2019ll be at the manor by the end of summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cToo many promises have not been kept, my love. I won\u2019t promise this, but I will promise not to rest until I find that son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake. It\u2019s not his fault there\u2019s a prophecy that states he\u2019s going to be killed by a kid. I mean, we\u2019d be hunting us down if we were Drake. I feel sorry for him.\u201d</p><p>David let a breath out through his nose. \u201cAnd this is why children should not take on adult responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Me? A child?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019re nineteen. You\u2019re a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are, too. You\u2019re nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over a hundred and twenty years old. My body is nineteen. But my mind is wise beyond that\u2014far wiser than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now I\u2019m dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot dumb, my love, I\u2019d never say that about you\u2014you\u2019re a very smart girl, but sometimes you just see things with the innocence of a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. I think I\u2019m right about Drake.\u201d</p><p>He half turned away, looking back at the house. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, in time. Your decisions will directly affect others now, mon amour, and I can only warn you so far. There will come a point where you will have to see the damage you\u2019ve done before my words finally sink in.\u201d</p><p>I huffed, dropping my hands onto my hips. \u201cWell, if you think you know so much, you go rule those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be ruling. Once we catch Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then you can do it alone. I quit. If I know nothing, why should I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Mike grabbed my arm from behind and tugged me away a little. \u201cStop arguing, baby. We gotta go; the Lilithians are rallying to meet their princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shrugged from his grasp. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. How can I find one ounce of faith in myself, when no one else seems to have any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do, baby. We\u2019re all just stressed, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe I\u2019m too young to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d Mike said; I looked at him, but he was looking at David.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d David said, staring Mike down.</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d I stomped my foot. \u201cStop doing that. I know you\u2019ve been talking about me when I can\u2019t hear you. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Mike took a breath. \u201cHe\u2019s not worried about your abilities as queen, Ara.\u201d</p><p>David stepped forward a little, his body language holding no bars back, warning Mike not to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, mate, she deserves to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about the spirit bind.\u201d</p><p>David sunk back, silently cursing.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, this is exactly why I was worried,\u201d David said. \u201cYou swore you wouldn\u2019t tell her. You just can\u2019t do it, can you? You just can\u2019t separate yourself from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m marrying Emily, David. There is nothing going on between Ara and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be.\u201d He turned away and gave the picket fence a little kick with his toe, gentle enough not to knock it down.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. You think because I\u2019m bound to him I\u2019m going to betray our wedding vows?\u201d I stomped over to David. \u201cHow can you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know your heart, Ara.\u201d He faced me again, hunching slightly, his hands in his pockets. \u201cI know you\u2019d follow it to your own detriment. I\u2014\u201d He looked at Mike for a second, his eyes narrowed, a thousand words not found in the dictionary being aimed at him across the lawn. \u201cI love you, okay, but you\u2019ve never loved just me. And I\u2019m sending you away for God knows how long, to live in a place without me, without my touch. If you get lonely or scared or\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go to him for comfort.\u201d</p><p>My mouth wouldn\u2019t close. I looked at Mike, then David, and back again a few times, unsure what to say. And Mike didn\u2019t say anything either, maybe because he\u2019d already had this argument with David, or maybe because he believed I was incapable of fidelity.</p><p>\u201cBut, of course I\u2019ll go to Mike for a hug or some companionship, David\u2014he\u2019s my friend. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to forget I love you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t stopped you in the past. Nay, the lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Is this say whatever you can think of to hurt me day? Christ, David. You\u2019re such an arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara.\u201d He grabbed my arm. \u201cI just love you. And I am so sick of losing you that the very idea of you getting in that car right now has me blinded with madness.\u201d</p><p>I sniffled, shaking a little despite the heat. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose me, David. I have to go away, yes, but I won\u2019t let myself be with Mike. I swear it.\u201d I touched my chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t swear it, Ara; promises have never stopped you from doing what you want to do. So don\u2019t make a promise to me, because I know you can\u2019t keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, that\u2019s a horrid thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d He licked his lips, shaking his head as several sentences came to fruition, but only one came out; \u201cSomething\u2019s different\u2014it\u2019s not like it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur love.\u201d</p><p>The world rocked beneath me. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grabbed his arm again. \u201cI won\u2019t just forget it. David, tell me what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d He towered over me as he walked closer. \u201cAll we do is fight. I can\u2019t read your thoughts; I can\u2019t even read your heart, anymore. Whatever the connection we used to have...\u201d He looked over at Mike, then back at me. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d My heart dropped into my knees. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d His voice softened, his eyes flicking over my face.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I don\u2019t trust you\u2014like I did before. And I don\u2019t even know why. I just know there\u2019s something different about you, and I don\u2019t trust it, whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it.\u201d He turned away again. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should.\u201d I followed him. \u201cThat\u2019s the real problem with this relationship, David. You never say anything. You never tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I have good reason for that,\u201d he said, walking faster.</p><p>\u201cWhat reason? What have I ever done to prove you can\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never listen,\u201d he hissed as he spun around. \u201cYou make misinformed decisions about what\u2019s best; you let your heart control everything you do. If you would just grow up, just\u2014\u201d He held his hands up, shaping his sentence into a ball of frustration. \u201cNone of this would\u2019ve happened if you were even a little bit more mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of what would\u2019ve happened, David?\u201d I challenged, wearing my hands in a gesture of authority.</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cThink about it. Just trace over everything we\u2019ve suffered, Ara. It\u2019s all because you couldn\u2019t make up your mind\u2014all because you have some deluded idea of what right and wrong is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeluded? Deluded! Damn it, David. Killing is wrong. That\u2019s all I ever had a problem with. Why can\u2019t you see that? Why do I have to take the blame for all of this, when, at any point, you could have shared yourself with me? Told me how you killed Rochelle, told me to watch out for your brother\u2014that he might come after me. You could\u2019ve warned me he could mind-link, saved me all this anguish for being in lo\u2014\u201d I zipped my words back in. He couldn\u2019t know the truth of those dreams I had. Couldn\u2019t know Jason ever mind-linked with me, other than the dream where he bound me.</p><p>David stepped carefully toward me, becoming taller as he grabbed my arm. \u201cBeing in what, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cNo one\u2019s to blame here. Okay. Things happen, David. We can\u2019t blame each other, or we\u2019ll never get through this.\u201d</p><p>He let go of my arm. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping something from me. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>He stared me down, and I stared back, with the wall of everything at stake rising up in front of my thoughts, protecting them in case he got through. If he ever found out that I had loved Jason, anywhere in my heart, I\u2019d never see him again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I took the route of deflection. \u201cI do love Mike. And the spirit bind complicates things. But it always has. It\u2019s never been any different.\u201d</p><p>Mike wandered back to the car then, shaking his head. David and I watched him for a minute.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to worry. I promise\u2014\u201d I emphasised the word he said I could never use, \u201c\u2014that nothing will happen between Mike and I.\u201d</p><p>David looked to be caving, like he might take me in his arms and kiss my head. But he stiffened, becoming that hard man I\u2019d seen a few times now, and looked over at Mike before glaring back down at me. \u201cI wish I could take your word. I really do. But I don\u2019t trust either of you,\u201d he said, and disappeared, leaving me in the wake of his suspicion.</p><p>My chest heaved and my gut churned, calling up the rise of bile I\u2019d held down all day. I folded over.</p><p>\u201cAra, baby, he\u2019s just scared, okay?\u201d Mike lifted me to stand.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, searching the entire lakeside park for my vampire. \u201cNo. He believes it. He really believes I\u2019m going to cheat on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He made me walk to the car. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about it later, okay. You can send him a message on Facebook when we get you settled at the manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shut his Facebook account down, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Dead people don't go on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Well, you can send him a text. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not feeling any better. \u201cHow can he have so little faith in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, baby. But he knows you better than any of us. Maybe he\u2019s right.\u201d He shrugged; I glared at him. \u201cOr maybe not. I don\u2019t know. But, he clearly thinks very little of me, too, to think I\u2019d ever cheat on Em. I may love ya, baby, but I\u2019m not that sort of man. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I looked back at the house as I hopped in the passenger seat of the car. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got dragged into that, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress it.\u201d He shut the door and appeared in the driver\u2019s seat a breath later, smiling widely. \u201cLet\u2019s just go have some fun training some knights.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his seatbelt into place, and I offered a smile, exhaling, though, inside, my gut was missing\u2014still left on the ground where David\u2019s words tore it out.</p><p>The grass arched outward like a parting sea, green and thick, flat under his outstretched leg; he tapped his foot to a beat only he could hear, while the pages of the tatty old book in his hand flickered in the warm summer breeze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRead me a line?\u201d a girl said, swinging one leg over the branch of the tree above him.</p><p>He looked up and his closed lips spread wide with a smile for a moment, then he flipped through a few pages and read aloud.</p><p>The girl sat back; one leg tucked under her knee, her dress hanging loosely past the branch, twirling a strand of her long brown hair. \u201cI like the sound of your voice when you read. It\u2019s so soothing.\u201d</p> <p>The boy stopped and closed the book. \u201cThat was my aunt\u2019s favourite passage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever asked her. My uncle told me he used to read this one passage to her, sometimes three or four times in a row\u2014sitting under this very tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder this tree?\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is my dream. How can they have been here?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s smiling eyes rested on his book again, a secret hiding behind them that he could share if he wanted, but chose not to.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was your uncle\u2019s favourite passage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he had one. I\u2019m not even sure he liked this book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he read it then?\u201d</p><p>The boy rested his head against the trunk of the tree. \u201cHe told me once that he never felt good enough for Arietta\u2014that he always felt like a monster, darkening her purity. He read this story to her because he liked to believe even one who is deemed a monster can truly be good inside\u2014that we all deserve love no matter what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grinned and stood up, leaving the book on the grass. \u201cI like it because it has a tragic ending.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiar.\u201d The girl smiled and sat with both legs over the same side of the branch, the boy right beside her knees. \u201cYou like it because you can relate to Quasimodo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelate? Is that because the beastly creature falls in love with the beautiful girl?\u201d He hooked a hand over the branch and swung himself outward a little. \u201cI never said I was in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d She jumped down. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant...that you\u2019ve always been misunderstood. David is like the good guy\u2014the one they all think is beautiful on the inside\u2014the hero, while you, who truly means to do only good by all, have been labelled the bad guy, the hideous beast. You\u2019re just misunderstood.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cLike Quasimodo.\u201d</p><p>The boy stared forward, his arms folded over his chest. \u201cYou have a very unique way of analysing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I just know good when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think I\u2019m the good guy, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>He scratched his brow and smiled, then dropped his arms to his sides. \u201cWell, you were right about one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s that?\u201d the girl asked, tilting her head.</p><p>\u201cI do lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>A groggy hold stuck in the back of my throat as I lifted my head off the window, wiping a sliver of moisture from the indent left in my chin where I\u2019d been leaning on the lock.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Mike said, then grimaced as he looked at me. \u201cOr should I say Beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I whacked his arm then flipped the visor down to look in the mirror. Oh, my dear God.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a brush in the glove compartment,\u201d Mike said, reaching across to open it.</p><p>\u201cYou keep a brush in your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge.\u201d He eyed the road, smiling. \u201cA guy likes neat hair, too.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the brush and fixed my hair as best I could, huffing when it stood its ground as a frizzy monstrosity. \u201cArgh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I ditched the brush into its home and slammed the little door shut. \u201cI think I\u2019m just a bit blood hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, didn\u2019t you eat before you left?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, toying with the lone white-gold band on my finger. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the taste of David on my lips all the way here today. It would\u2019ve been too much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Eric\u2019s at the manor, you can feed from him when we get there.\u201d He turned his head and smiled at me. \u201cUnless you want some of mine\u2014to hold you over for now. You do look a little pale.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again, watching his proffered wrist. \u201cNo. Blood lust combined with spirit bind and missing my husband could be a bad combination.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew his arm. \u201cRight. Good thinking.\u201d</p><p>I shuffled in my seat, wishing I\u2019d taken his offer. My throat burned and my stomach twisted in knots\u2014which could\u2019ve just been nerves. \u201cHey, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid doesn\u2019t really like me drinking Eric\u2019s blood. Are those Sacrificials at the manor yet? The \u2018you call; we deliver\u2019 blood guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few there, posing as guests under protection. But we can\u2019t call them Sacrificials yet, remember, until we let the secret out about blood immunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, until then, I just have to let people think I\u2019m killing vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr just not biting them to feed. We have the Upper House convinced we\u2019re using prisoners to feed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that I\u2019m killing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. That was how Lilith lived. Her food was sent to her by Set leaders who had sentenced vampires to death for their crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Lilith never discovered immunity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had reason to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I rubbed my face a few times, readjusting my seat to get comfortable. \u201cSo, who knows about the immunity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust your Private Council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even the other one? What did you call it? The Upper something?\u201d</p><p>Mike scoffed. \u201cNo. They don\u2019t know. And they don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, so, when do we tell them?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled once, practically snorting. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen we catch Drake, Ara. Until then, venom is our only weapon against him,\u201d he said, his voice pitching like a schoolgirl\u2019s. \u201cIf anyone at the manor were to let the secret of immunity slip into the wrong hands, people would not only ask why King David died when you bit him, but it might somehow get back to Drake that a; David might not be dead and that, b; armies, immune to our only weapon, could be created.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I slid down further in my seat.</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve taken your oath, that promise should give you increased powers. It\u2019s rumoured that you would be as, if not more, powerful than Drake. We won\u2019t need to worry as much if that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. I liked the idea of that. Maybe then I could protect everyone else for once. \u201cHow do the Sacrificials get immunity from my venom if I'm not feeding them?\u201d</p><p>He nodded at his own arm. \u201cMy blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I forgot your venom\u2019s like mine.\u201d I looked out the window for a second. \u201cSo, does that make you tired\u2014donating blood to so many vampires?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI drink a lot of OJ.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. I didn't really feel like laughing, but I\u2019d not heard the word OJ since I was living in Oz.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working on new weapons,\u201d Mike said out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyself, Morgaine and a few others. We\u2019re developing weapons that may be able to kill vampires, even if they were immune to venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Cool. What kinds of weapons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know about how they invented Lilithian steel back in the late fourteenth century?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the metal that\u2019s strong enough to imprison vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and also strong enough to cut them, even when wielded by the hand of a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Didn\u2019t know that bit, but, anyway...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had swords commissioned, but\u2014and this is only in experimental stage\u2014we\u2019re hoping that if we cut in the right place and bleed the vampires out quickly, the venom tips of the swords might be enough to deteriorate them\u2014kill them or at least render them useless long enough to escape\u2014even if they had immunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could work. But you\u2019d have to bleed them out pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, smiling at the road. \u201cThere are certain points you can cut on the body that\u2019ll bleed a human out in seconds. We\u2019re finding that, with most things, thinking human seems to be giving us the advantage.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and looked out at the rolling green hills.</p><p>\u201cOf course, this is Private Council talk, right. You know not to say this to anyone else\u2014especially Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Make sure you don\u2019t. Not even accidentally, or you could ruin everything. Drake is a master of strategy\u2014we\u2019re going to have enough trouble finding and catching him as it is. If he knows any of our plans, we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, Mike. It\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I looked up to his sweet tone.</p><p>\u201cGood girl for refusing my blood. That\u2019s the first smart choice I\u2019ve seen you make in a long time.\u201d</p><p>I was sure he meant that genuinely, and that just made it even more condescending, but it also made me smile. He was kind of right. \u201cThanks, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>We sat in companionable silence for a while longer; the radio off, the sound of the tyres whirring over the road, until I looked at the clock and realised it was past three in the afternoon. \u201cHow much longer \u2018til we get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, yawning.</p><p>\u201cYeah, look.\u201d He nodded forward.</p><p>I sat taller and peered out the front windshield at the wide expanse of countryside; lush, green grass lining endless fields, yellow flowers sprinkling a touch of colour across it, and a blue sky that went on forever over the distant trees. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think it\u2019d be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe marshland, creaky branches and a grey sky.\u201d</p><p>Mike chuckled. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. The manor is all light colours and big windows, with gardens outside every door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. I like gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did Lilith, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And when Drake built the manor, he actually planted a special garden, just for her; it\u2019s closed off by high walls. No one\u2019s allowed in there except you and the gardener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. A secret garden.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded. \u201cIt was named the Garden of Lilith, but it\u2019s been nicknamed Eden over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why did Drake build her a garden if he hated her so much?\u201d</p><p>Mike turned his head at a half an inch, then shook it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt just amazes me how you can switch off that much that you know absolutely nothing about Lilithian history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014did Morgaine add that in the politics speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesson, Ara. You mean lesson.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. Maybe I should have paid more attention. \u201cI had a lot on my mind, okay, Mike. David was in agony in the next room. All I wanted was to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, shaking his head again. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to take to the library and read some books, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a library?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled, eyes on the road, while my blood rushed warm with excitement, imagining bookshelves to the ceiling and winding staircases leading up to them.</p><p>\u201cWill I be okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t even know what the Upper Council is. Am I gonna make a fool of myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Upper House. Not Council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure you at least remember that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Upper House,\u201d I said to myself a few times. \u201cSo, what do they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have the same authority as your Private Council. Most of them were servants to the throne when Lilith was alive. Some of them are professors of politics or were generals in the human armed forces back in fourteen hundred. They\u2019re old, traditional, and have strong political influence within our monarchy. You don\u2019t want to mess with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they enforce the laws\u2014including the laws that keep you in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what laws? I\u2019m gonna be queen. Do I even have any laws?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has laws to follow, Ara.\u201d The bored tone of a cop giving a ticket to a defensive teen dominated his voice. \u201cTreason, for example; if you commit an act that goes against the throne\u2014something morally improper or something that puts your people in great jeopardy\u2014they could overthrow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So, don\u2019t mess with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And, I know it\u2019ll be hard for you being chastised all the time, but they\u2019ll be the ones who debate your decisions and question everything you do. However,\u201d he said, raising an index finger, \u201cthey have centuries of experience, and you\u2019ll do well to listen to them. They have the Lilithian peoples\u2019 best interests at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who speaks for the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEssentially, we do\u2014your Private Council. But there\u2019s also the Lower House.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so there\u2019s two other Councils; one is made up of six vampires, who will, when we get control of the Sets, be the new Set leaders, and the other six are Lilithians, who are Lords of the lands our people live on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike vassals and fiefs and all that stuff?\u201d I sat up straight, turning in my seat to look at his face.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cExactly like that. Actually, Arthur was the Lord of Loslilian\u2014back when David was human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? But wasn\u2019t he a Set leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. His Set resided here for that period\u2014in the houses you\u2019ll see over those hills in a minute.\u201d He nodded out his window. \u201cAnyway, do you understand more about the political side of things now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You just condensed Morgaine\u2019s eight-week speech into eight minutes, and I totally get all that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve always had a way with words.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019d make a great teacher.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded to himself, his lips arching downward with thought. \u201cBut I make a better Security Chief.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and looked out at the seemingly state-wide expanse of fields. \u201cSo, how much land do we own out here?\u201d</p><p>The Chief rattled off a bunch of numbers, then, seeing my concentration waver, said, \u201cYou can fit four or five suburbs on our land. And we own the beach, too. No one can access it without approval\u2014well, no humans. Those at the manor can go down there as they please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the sand like? Is it white and smooth, like Perth, or is it covered in shells and sea-weed?\u201d</p><p>Mike hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s white. Smooth. But I don\u2019t want you down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a dangerous beach, Ara. It\u2019s a narrow strip of sand, caged in by two massive cliffs that get thrashed by ferocious waves. It\u2019s private and secluded and you have to go down a really steep set of stone stairs to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d his voice became high. \u201cYou could get swept out to sea if you\u2019re not careful\u2014or bashed against rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m too weak to swim in the ocean?\u201d</p><p>He just raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cFine. I won\u2019t go down there...\u201d When you\u2019re around.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be a jerk, but I promised David I\u2019d take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mike.\u201d I reached across and tapped his knee, then drew my hand away. \u201cSo, will I get to see the manor over the hill before we get there?\u201d I sat a little taller.</p><p>\u201cYep, just watch over that rise.\u201d He nodded out his side window. \u201cWe\u2019ll come to a forest soon, so you won\u2019t see it for long, but you\u2019ll get a glimpse.\u201d</p><p>I did see a glimpse then, of something other than a manor. \u201cIs that the houses you were talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had them all refurbished. We\u2019re moving Lilithians back in there this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the vampires who lived there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they\u2019re faithful to the new queen, they\u2019ve been evicted.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>\u201cAra, the Lilithians we\u2019re moving back into those houses have been living underground in cells for hundreds of years\u2014working as slaves. Their only food has been the vampires that were sent to Loslilian for torture and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So, don\u2019t feel sorry for the vampires. They never felt sorry when they marched in and ripped human children from their adoptive Lilithian mothers, then burned them in a bonfire in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cThey had children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were a nation of very human creatures, Ara. Lilithians lived for their families, for the love of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they be allowed to start families again\u2014adopt children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Upper House disapproves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they do.\u201d He huffed, re-gripping the steering wheel. \u201cLook, no discussing politics outside Council meetings, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. Just...just shut up for a bit. I\u2019m not used to all this talking\u2014you\u2019re actually doing my head in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I sunk back in my chair and folded my arms, my frown dropping when the grand cream fascia of a colossal building crept over the hill. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold ya it\u2019s big.\u201d Mike\u2019s tone had completely changed.</p><p>\u201cBig? It must be six storeys high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d he said in short. \u201cBut each level has high ceilings, so I guess it would equate to the height of a six storey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a castle from a fairy-tale,\u201d I said, not taking my eyes from the magnificent glow of the midday sun, bouncing off a dome roof, marking the centre of the large, seemingly rectangle building.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it has an undeniable charm about it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, savouring the image as a forest swallowed the day around us, but the warmth of the cream bricks set among bright green hedges, with windows on every wall, stayed in my heart while the car followed the winding path, further and further away from the sun. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will.\u201d Mike smiled, taking the turns in the road as if he\u2019d lived here his whole life.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you like it.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cThis has been the best few months of my life. I\u2014well, it\u2019s been hard leaving Em behind, but I\u2019ve kept busy getting the manor and the knights ready for your arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Emily visiting this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish David could visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t talk to me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was really mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was mad, Ara, but you know it\u2019s not really you he\u2019s mad at, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. He is mad at me. He\u2019s mad that I let myself be bound to Jason. He\u2019s mad that I do stupid things because my heart tells me to. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s mad at me for still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t say things like that. You know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon it is. Think about it; he lived his whole life serving one king. Then, I not only came along and ruined his beliefs in his law system, but I happen to be a Lilithian, who is gonna throw everything out of order for the sake of a prophecy. I\u2019ve turned his world upside down\u2014just by existing.\u201d</p><p>Mike sighed. \u201cAra. Grow up. You know David doesn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Whatever.\u201d I let out a long breath, feeling queasy again with the way the road tipped downward, taking us on a steep decline to where the trees stopped abruptly at the base, parting only for a wide, multi-coloured brick wall with stones of red, yellow, and pale blues\u2014natural colours, mostly. It looked charming, in a secret garden kind of way, but the spear-tipped iron gates took the fairy-tale out of the scene, screaming graveyard. Back behind me, I could see where the trees thinned out again as the road led away. \u201cThey\u2019re not natural are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Mike looked sideways at me as we pulled up beside a speaker box in front of the gate.</p><p>\u201cThe trees? They didn\u2019t grow around this wall, did they\u2014someone put them here? I mean, trees don\u2019t just grow in a line like that in the middle of an empty field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh\u2014yeah. I think so. I don\u2019t really notice things like that, Ara.\u201d He wound his window down and leaned out slightly, then turned back for a second. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Morgaine\u2014she knows all about this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge? You there, mate?\u201d Mike asked the box.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014it\u2019s Mikey,\u201d a jolly, old-sounding voice came through the speaker.</p><p>\u201cHey, George. You wanna open the gates? I got a future queen in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, sir. I\u2019ll be down in a jiffy.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the car engine\u2014something usually quite soothing\u2014was only a filler for the intimidating silence that swallowed my ability to breathe. \u201cWhere are all the people? I thought they were rallying to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be up at the manor, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d I squirmed in my seat.</p><p>\u201cNot too many. The Ninth and the First Orders aren\u2019t here. It\u2019s only the Fifth and the Upper House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the other ones are across international waters, Ara, and besides, the knights just gave them back their homes\u2014they\u2019re all refurbishing and setting up their new lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Cool, so, how many people, er...Lilithians are gonna be there?\u201d</p><p>Mike scratched his head and the gate opened before us. \u201c\u2019Bout a hundred.\u201d</p><p>As we pulled forward, nerves pinched my chest, and Mike dipped his head to the old man by the gate, whose stark white hair looked transparent in the sun, his skinny legs barely holding his bent frame.</p><p>\u201cPleasant drive, sir?\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cAs always, George,\u201d Mike said, then looked along the sides of the road for a second, frowning. \u201cWhere are all the cars? Surely the people haven\u2019t parked up by the fountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d George wrapped his fingers over the doorframe, through the open window. \u201cMiss Morgaine called a stop to all visitors \u2018til our princess is settled. Just the Upper House up there today.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s jaw went tight and he gave the steering wheel a soft whack with the ball of his palm. \u201cI told her not to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe felt it best, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the old man, clearly wanting to shoot the messenger. \u201cAll right, thanks, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe well,\u201d George said and stepped back, saluting Mike as we drove slowly away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you get your wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? No fan club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay.\u201d I sat taller and looked to the road ahead, closed in by the trees that concealed the brick wall. I half expected to have grey hairs by the time they parted and the manor rose up in front of me again. My eyes widened to allow for the sheer height of it, sitting on a long gravel drive that ended in a turn-circle, wrapping a giant fountain. Along the sides of the road, the trees spread all the way back past grassy lawns, lined with hedge fences. A large section of the manor sat further forward, double white doors at the centre, with stairs leading up to a group of about seven people.</p><p>\u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said as we came closer\u2014close enough to count the walls as three windows high and at least sixteen long on each side of the front door. Waiting in a line at the base of the stairs were a neat party of women in pale grey dresses with white aprons. \u201cThe staff, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d I pointed to them.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, are all those people on the porch the Upper Council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse. Upper House. Do you remember which ones are of highest authority, from what Morgaine taught you?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cUm, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Mike laughed.</p><p>My neck shrunk between my shoulders. \u201cOh crap. I really should\u2019ve paid more attention.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, shaking his head. \u201cIf you paid any attention, you would\u2019ve been better off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I hid my brow in my hand, looking off to the side.</p><p>Mike pulled my hand away from my face. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t need to know that, right now. Just nod and smile, baby.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and smiled, turning my head when Mike suddenly appeared at my door, offering his hand.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you just love that new speediness, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His fingers, so thick and strong, tightened around mine as he closed the car door behind me. \u201cDo you even need to ask?\u201d</p><p>The stillness and quiet that came from the day then made my footsteps, crunching over the gravel, sound like pebbles being jiggled in a small bag. The only other sound was the soothing trickle of water falling into the round bath at the base of the fountain.</p><p>Despite the glaring sun making me squint, I looked all the way up at the statue\u2019s smiling face; she seemed to hide a secret behind her eyes, perhaps one whispered by the snake on her shoulder, its lips to her ear. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>Mike looked up at her. \u201cLilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said distractedly, closing the trunk as he grabbed my suitcase. \u201cThe snake is said to represent the original Lilith\u2014the one who conned Eve into eating the Fruit of Wisdom.\u201d</p><p>My eyes rounded. \u201cWow. I remember Dad talking about God\u2019s Lilith in a lecture once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So, you are capable of retaining information.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his shoulder as he stood beside me. \u201cI remember everything you ever tell me.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cPity you never give my words any value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I take on board all your advice, Mike. I just choose to follow the bits that appeal to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, none of it appeals to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou annoy me,\u201d he said in a deep, humoured tone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, all.\u201d Eric popped up out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara. Good to see you again.\u201d He embraced me; a guise to whisper closely; \u201cI can smell him all over you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d he said, rubbing my arms then my back, as if it were just a friendly gesture. \u201cNo one else here will recognise the scent, but I\u2019ll just cover it up with mine anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I gave him a tighter squeeze, half laughing.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, nice, isn\u2019t she?\u201d He cleared his throat and nodded up to Lilith, stuffing his thumbs in his pockets as he stepped back. \u201cThis is the only statue Drake didn\u2019t destroy when he took control of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he leave this one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause he sculpted it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot from the statue to Eric\u2019s. \u201cSerious?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cAmara!\u201d someone practically squealed my name; I looked up to the steps as a small body burst from among the crowd and flew into my arms. \u201cOh, I know it\u2019s only been a week since I saw you, Princess, but I missed you. I\u2019ve been so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, holding Morgaine tight. It was like hugging myself, with her small frame, skinny arms and the strawberry shampoo she\u2019d started using since she fell in love with mine. \u201cI missed you, too. And, hey, thanks for getting rid of the crowd.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back from the hug and ducked her head from Mike\u2019s vehemence. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I knew you weren\u2019t ready for that yet.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cYou \u2018get\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>We both looked at Mike, who rolled his eyes and wandered forward, carrying my suitcase rather than dragging it over the gravel.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Morgaine took my hand. \u201cI want you to meet your House.\u201d</p><p>I tried to pay attention to introductions, but all the names and faces blurred together. By the time it was over, I\u2019d nicknamed everyone, but could only remember three; one of them being Moustache Man, another was Portly Woman who Speaks Her Mind When No One Asks and, last, Man With Grey Sideburns. Eventually the crowd dissipated and Mike came back through the white doors again, with a newspaper tucked under his arm and an eager smile accompanying his warm eyes. \u201cReady for the grand tour, then, baby?\u201d</p><p>I yawned again. \u201cI\u2019m ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine linked her arm through mine. \u201cCome on. You\u2019ll wake up when you\u2019ve seen your new room.\u201d</p><p>As I stepped over the threshold of the manor, my gaze followed two marble staircases that parted over double doors, stopping on the second floor landing where it seemed the doorway had simply duplicated and moved up a level, like an elevator. One sitting over the other. I wondered why they needed two doors to what was probably the same room.</p> <p>Somewhere in the distance, the click of heels on the white marbled floors and quiet chatter of what I assumed was staff made the manor feel more like a museum than a supposed home. But the warm, soft scent of fresh-baked bread gave me an instant smile. \u201cWow,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cLook up.\u201d</p><p>Above me, the high ceilings, rising all the way through each floor of the manor, opened out to a stained-glass dome; its picture looked like something inspired by Michelangelo, shining gloriously with the afternoon sun reaching through the colours. \u201cWho is that? In the glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Queen Lilith and Peter\u2014her betrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetrothed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In order to rule the Three Worlds, Lilith had to marry into certain politically influential families. Peter was a vampire of noble blood, and the two were forced to marry by their fathers. But they hated each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the end, though, after Peter tried to kill her, they fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, and I thought my relationship was weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Believe me\u2014\u201d Morgaine started walking, dragging me along, \u201c\u2014you have no idea. They were the most twisted, messed-up couple in the history of our kind. So, anyway, there are two more like this dome on the other ends of the manor. Each one depicts Lilith\u2019s story from beginning, to middle\u2014\u201d she pointed up, \u201c\u2014and end.\u201d</p><p>Mike cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Mike?\u201d I spun to look at him, standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cMike\u2019s bed is positioned under the portrayal of Lilith\u2019s end.\u201d Morgaine tried to hold back her smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I go to sleep every night only too aware of the horrible things Drake could do if he catches you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d need more than an army to get past you.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>Mike nodded, his inner \u2018knight\u2019 rising. \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we continue?\u201c Morgaine took my hand and walked me forward a few steps. \u201cThrough those doors between the staircases is the Great Hall. You\u2019ll need to remember that because we hold most of our gatherings there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for House meetings,\u201d Mike added. \u201cWe hold those in a function room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Private Council meetings in the Round Room,\u201d Morg said.</p><p>I nodded, remembering vague details about the Round Room.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you look down there\u2014\u201d Morgaine pointed to an archway on my left, \u201c\u2014at the end of the manor is the Throne Room. That\u2019s where we hold sessions of Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrone Room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that going a little far with the whole monarchy thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Amara, you are royalty\u2014royalty has a throne. Get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I have to sit on some big chair and tell people what to do all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all day, no. And you won\u2019t be sitting on the throne until you\u2019ve taken your oath and been crowned. So stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll pretty much lose focus and stare out the window at the trees all day.\u201d Mike patted my shoulder, as if doing that would make his insulting remark seem like a humoured observation among friends.</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me.\u201d I turned to Morgaine. \u201cThe trees around that wall at the gate\u2014are they natural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cThey just looked a little out of place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d she said. \u201cSome say the forest bordering Loslilian is enchanted\u2014that it grows legs and moves to protect things as needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird. So, how long have those trees been there then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the forest has been here since the beginning of time, really, but the trees at the gate grew up around the entrance shortly after Vampirie gave the throne to Lilith and she swore her oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Now, also through that archway\u2014\u201d she pointed to my left again, past a parlour with curvy, antique-looking furniture and floods of light brightening the pale colours, \u201c\u2014is the common rooms, kitchen and dining areas\u2014well, causal dining. We dine formal for dinner every night in the Great Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose tradition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilith\u2019s, actually. One she started when she ruled. The vamps didn\u2019t keep that tradition, or any others, when they took over, but we\u2019re keen to bring them all back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have to eat with a table full of people every night of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>Both Mike and I laughed in the back of our throats. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me very well, then, Morgaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad. You\u2019ll be queen soon, which means you, of all people, have more reason to adhere to tradition. You just have to get over it.\u201d She skipped ahead of me; I headed up the stairs slowly behind her, taking everything in.</p><p>\u201cThis place is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It has nineteen bedrooms in the west wing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest is right of the front door,\u201d Mike added from behind.</p><p>I looked down at him. \u201cThanks, that was my next question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nineteen bedrooms in the east wing, as well,\u201d Morgaine continued in her \u2018tour guide\u2019 voice. \u201cThere are thirty staff rooms, which, because the land slopes down on the south side of the manor, sit at ground level under the Great Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said\u2014\u201d I stopped on the landing and turned back to wait for Mike, who was too busy texting on his phone to keep up with Morgaine and I, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Morgaine stopped by another staircase, hidden from where we stood in the entranceway, leading upward, back toward the front wall of the manor. \u201cNow, hurry up. I have other guests arriving in a half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mike. Hurry up,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He stuffed his phone in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, this staircase\u2014\u201d Morgaine started up it, \u201c\u2014will lead you to the west wing\u2019s third floor, and the mirroring staircase will lead to the east wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the east wing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich wing has the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest wing,\u201d both my tour guides said.</p><p>I smiled widely, following Morgaine up the stairs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be spending a bit of time in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>When we reached the third floor, the windows that lined the entire front of the manor became floodgates for white sunlight to brighten the corridor, lighting a lengthy path from where we stood to where the corridor ended after about the fourteenth window.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Morgaine said, walking faster. \u201cRooms one and two are empty right now and rooms four and five, right beside the room at the end, are mine and Eric\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that one?\u201d I pointed to a set of mahogany doors, sitting grandly at the centre of the corridor, the frame intricately carved with detail. \u201cIs that the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s your private entrance.\u201d</p><p>And it was a perfect entrance. It stood out, unlike the portal sitting inconspicuously in the wall back at my old school.</p><p>Morgaine\u2019s tiny, cold little fingers tightened on mine. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cLibraries always make me miss David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can spend all afternoon in there, once we get you settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So, is it a big library\u2014like on Beauty and the Beast?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTrust you to ask that,\u201d Mike grumbled from behind; I smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cIt is. The main section is two floors deep; picture floor to ceiling bookshelves.\u201d</p><p>I walked with my eyes closed for a second. \u201cPicturing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a special section on the first floor, where we keep the scrolls and other ancient books. But it\u2019s closed off\u2014locked. You wouldn\u2019t even know it was there if I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it hidden behind a secret passage?\u201d I laughed, but Morgaine didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I frowned. \u201cWell, why is it locked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo keep people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why would you tell me about it then? You know I\u2019ll find a way to go down there.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine laughed, looking at Mike. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why I told you about it. If you\u2019d found out by snooping around, you would definitely go down there, but, if I tell you about it and request that you only go down there with me or Mike, even Arthur, then you can\u2019t get into any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The scrolls and parchments we keep are very old. If you handle them the wrong way, you could destroy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why is Arthur allowed to take me down there\u2014I thought we didn\u2019t trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t. Yet.\u201d She glanced at Mike. \u201cBut he\u2019s been handling those scrolls for hundreds of years. He\u2019s had access to them all\u2014we\u2019ve nothing to hide from him in the Scroll Room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when I can see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>At the very end of the corridor, another grand door greeted us; just like the library door, but white.</p><p>\u201cYour room,\u201d Morgaine said, letting go of my hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd on the east wing,\u201d Mike said, stopping behind me, \u201cit\u2019s identical. Only difference being there\u2019s no library, so there\u2019s an extra few rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, normally the rooms on the third floor are for high-ranking officials only, but we\u2019ve been forced to make an exception to that rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second room from the stairs there\u2014\u201d she pointed down the hall, \u201c\u2014will be Arthur\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, looking away from him. \u201cIs Mike gonna let him be on my council now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was a condition of his helping us that he get a room in the same wing as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the same floor,\u201d Mike added, the flaring nostrils spreading out to make his face go red.</p><p>Morgaine laughed. \u201cMike tried giving him a room on the ground floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was still in the west wing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Morgaine said with mocking sympathy. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t quite go to plan, did it, Mikey?\u201d</p><p>I laughed into my hand. \u201cHas he arrived yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mike and Morgaine said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about the rest of them\u2014the House\u2014where do they all sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the second floor. These windows\u2014\u201d she motioned down the front wall of the manor, \u201c\u2014are all bedrooms downstairs. The corridor runs through the manor in a straight line, from one end to the other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd our rooms are the biggest in the manor,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you get a big room\u2014why not Morgaine or Arthur or someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese rooms are given to people in the highest command.\u201d He patted my door, standing proudly. \u201cI\u2019m head of security. I am supreme.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him, seeing more of my \u2018best friend\u2019 Mike\u2014the one I grew up with\u2014than I\u2019d seen in ages. I think, in some ways, being so far from home, with no one here that I really knew, it made me feel closer to Mike, like he was a part of my family\u2014a bit like a brother, and not so much like a...well, let\u2019s just say some of the love confusion trickled away with the sense that he was my only family here.</p><p>I reached for his hand as Morgaine reached for the doorknob, and light spilled into the corridor; as my eyes adjusted to the unfamiliar space, I smiled and stepped through. \u201cOh. Morg. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Light colours cast softness around the L-shaped room; four windows on the south side of the manor showed nothing but a blue sky, and to my right was a parlour, furnished with pieces of white or mahogany furniture to tie in pleasantly with the airy, summery feel in here. My bed was white, wide enough to sleep six of me, and adorned with enough pillows to stuff a warehouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re happy with the colour scheme?\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMm-hm. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look at this\u2014\u201d Morgaine walked over to a dresser on my left. \u201cThis was Arietta\u2019s. David thought you might like to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArietta\u2019s? Why is Arietta\u2019s dressing table here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArietta and the boys came to stay here nearly every second summer until she died. This was Arthur\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I waltzed over and sat on the blanket box at the end of my bed. \u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t he be staying in here?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine opened her mouth to speak, but Mike scoffed loudly for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no,\u201d I said, then stood up and wandered over to the windows near my bed, realising, when a calm breeze blew in, billowing the soft white curtains, that the window was actually a door. \u201cI have a balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Morgaine stepped up and pushed the chiffon aside, tying it back with a ribbon on the wall. \u201cMike has one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse.\u201d She presented the path.</p><p>When I stepped onto the white marble floor, the world opened out around me, like the walls just slinked back into the shadows. The sky went on forever over a darker blue in the distance, what I assumed was the ocean, and the gardens Mike mentioned earlier shone proudly below us; greens and creams of grass and stone paths, and sprinklings of colour from cherry blossom trees and rose bushes. There was even a hedge maze at the base of a long, grassy walkway. Beyond that, the enchanted forest bordered the manor, and all the way toward the east wing, a sweeping breeze swayed the long grasses in a field, rising up over the stone edge of my balcony and brushing my hair back with the scent of the ocean. \u201cIf I say \u2018wow\u2019, do you think that would describe it?\u201d I reached for Morgaine\u2019s hand again.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, standing beside me. \u201cI think that about covers it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you look closely\u2014\u201d Mike pointed to the east, \u201c\u2014you can just make out the top of the lighthouse from here.\u201d</p><p>I looked along his arm, trying to see it.</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve been down there and you know where it is, you\u2019ll be able to spot it easier. It\u2019s white, so it kinda blends in with the day.\u201d He dropped his arm.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot alone, though. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, Majesty,\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sits on a steep cliff, about a four hundred foot drop\u2014only sharp rocks beneath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween the cliffs, left of the lighthouse. If you sit up on the roof, you can see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sit on the roof of the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Morgaine leaned on the railing. \u201cI like to sit up there when there\u2019s a storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo watch.\u201d She closed her eyes, smiling. \u201cSand as white as snow and waves made of pure violence. It\u2019s tempest meets tranquillity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as violent when there\u2019s no storm, too,\u201d Mike said sternly, his eyes clearly saying \u2018don\u2019t encourage her.\u2019</p><p>\u201cMike? Will you take me down there today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Morgaine cut in. \u201cHe\u2019s under strict recommendations to leave you alone until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecommendations? By who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d She puffed her chest out, then laughed. \u201cAll we\u2019ve heard this entire week is I can\u2019t wait to show Ar the barracks, I can\u2019t wait to show Ar the training hall, I can\u2019t wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d I propped a hand between her and her rant.</p><p>\u201cIf he takes you down to the \u2018beach\u2019, you\u2019ll end up at the barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they\u2014and what are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the living quarters of the knights. They\u2019re over the eastern quadrant of the manor\u2014still on manor grounds. Not quite far enough to be part of Lamia, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s Lamia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe houses you saw on the way in,\u201d Mike added.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I nodded and looked upon the forest of trees, all so green and thick, shading what I could only imagine were a hundred great spots to take one of those books from the library, then sit and read all day. The trees became thicker and taller the further inland they went. \u201cWell, I love it here already,\u201d I said after a few deep breaths of the pine-scented ocean air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it even more when you see your wardrobe and your bathroom.\u201d Morg stole me away from Mike, who followed, groaning.</p><p>Across from my bed, the sitting room had a homely look to it; there was a throw rug over a settee, and a fireplace set below a giant mirror. I pictured winters, snuggled up in that settee by the window, listening to the rain, reading a book.</p><p>\u201cOkay, behind door number one,\u201d Morgaine said and pushed it open. \u201cIs your bathroom.\u201d</p><p>The light was out, the curtains drawn, so all I really saw in the giant space was ceramic tiles and a giant bath in the nook of the window, facing the front of the manor. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d she said, then closed the door and dragged me to the second one. \u201cAnd behind door number two\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even need to hold my breath\u2014my body did it for me. White shelves covered nearly every wall, with clothes hanging from rails in between. There was a full-length mirror and a few fabric-covered squares I could sit on to tie my laces. I smiled, seeing the empty side of the wardrobe\u2014David\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cSo, you like?\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, all your stuff has been unpacked for you.\u201d She walked over and opened a drawer, showing the sweater I packed this morning. \u201cAnd those clothes we picked out of that catalogue are all here, too.\u201d She propped her hands on her hips, shutting the drawer with her shin. \u201cYou\u2019re all set to be queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said and stepped out of the wardrobe. \u201cBut...after a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d She moved away from me and linked arms with Mike. \u201cCome on, Soldier, time to let this princess sort her head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we leave her until she figures her head out, Morg, it\u2019ll be the turn of the century before we can return,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmpf!\u201d I looked at the pile of pillows on my bed and considered ditching one at his head.</p><p>They just laughed among themselves, closing my door behind them, leaving me standing alone in what felt like an empty space.</p><p>A clock on the wall in my sitting room kept the pace of my heart. I stood there, one foot on the corner of a Persian rug, the other on the hard wood floor, imagining myself in this space\u2014seeing my days, seeing moments I might spend with David, which made me think about our fight.</p><p>I pulled my phone from my back pocket and checked my messages and emails. Nothing. He was still mad at me, I knew it, but I didn\u2019t quite understand why. I mean, yeah, Mike and I had to be here, together, but that just didn\u2019t explain his \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but something\u2019s different\u201d comment. Or whatever it was he said.</p><p>\u201cHi, David. Got here okay. All is well. In case you care,\u201d I texted, but deleted the last line before pressing send, then wandered over and slumped down on the settee by the giant window, where I spent the better part of the afternoon in my own head. Never a good place to be.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The only real sign that my body had made the change from the weak, human girl I was to the strong, Lilithian vampire I was becoming, was the smooth skin under my wedding band. Sharp snaps of electricity weaved around the tips of my fingers, making them warm, making anything I touched hot or sometimes, if it was alive, dead. Flowers, grass\u2014they wilted under this blue light I could summon from within me, but my skin, despite my wedding band becoming almost red when I used this power, did not melt. And I always felt like it should; like I was pouring acid over glass, right above my hand; as if I\u2019d escaped a punishment I knew I deserved. Power of this magnitude always had a consequence. David had even made me take my engagement ring off\u2014afraid the electricity would reflect off the cut angles of the diamond and shoot something I hadn\u2019t intended to. But, it was more likely he was afraid I\u2019d lose it. I wasn\u2019t sure how much he paid for it, but when I found the receipt one day, he all but leaped across the room to stop me looking at it.</p><p>I hugged my knees to my chest, sitting on the settee, and smiled, remembering that moment; he was so human then, jumping around the house, holding that receipt out of my reach, with a big smile on his face. He could\u2019ve just run, vampire style, since I didn\u2019t know I was a vampire then, but he chose to play keep-off, the human way, because he liked the playful flirtation\u2014with me. He liked me. Wanted me.</p><p>I flicked the light from my fingers again, sending it into the fireplace, where it flamed blue against the lighter-fluid on the wood there for a second then flickered away to embers.</p><p>The stress of worrying about David, worrying why he hadn\u2019t texted me back, was making my flame weak, my shot less powerful, and the headache I got from using it more severe.</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head from my knee and looked over to my bedroom door. \u201cOh, hey, Morgaine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Um, just wanted to let you know Arthur Knight arrived a few hours ago. He\u2019s asked to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I stood up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was coming until later today.\u201d</p><p>She looked out the window. \u201cYour Majesty, it is later today.\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window, too, at the setting sun turning everything bright orange, casting scarlet shadows across my floor. \u201cOh. Right. Okay, tell him I\u2019ll be down in a sec. I just wanna get changed first.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cChanged? Why?\u201d</p><p>I wandered over to my wardrobe. \u201cBecause...I don\u2019t know, it seems almost wrong to go meet a High Councilman in a pair of jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s faithful to the new Order, Amara, he\u2019s no longer a High Councilman.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cStill. I\u2019m making myself more presentable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, but hurry up. I need to discuss a few things with you on the way down to the Great Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I said from my wardrobe, slipping into my blue cotton dress.</p><p>\u201cLike what you can and cannot say to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like David being al\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d She appeared in front of me, cupping her hand over my mouth. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>I giggled, peeling her fingers away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just don\u2019t. Not even in here. And especially not to Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Morgaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She softened. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot at stake.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI am reminded of that daily. But I really don\u2019t think Arthur\u2019s a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, he is a traitor. Maybe he doesn\u2019t plan to betray us, but that means he\u2019s betrayed a king he was loyal to for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that makes sense.\u201d I followed her out to the corridor, feeling the warmth of the ending day fill every corner of this manor, giving it a safe, kind of homely feel. As we reached the landing on the second floor, the spicy scent of curry and boiled rice made my stomach groan.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I lopped a hand across my gut. \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want something now.\u201d She stopped with her palm flat on the heavy white door leading into the Great Hall. \u201cArthur might get bludgeoned by the ogre if you don\u2019t eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head, more than a little eager to see what was beyond those doors. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will. It\u2019s Arthur I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, too. I have way too much respect for him to become...tempestuous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHm, yes, he does command a certain amount of respect, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I watched the memories of moments passed warm her eyes, then linked arms with her. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go see him.\u201d</p><p>The second floor landing continued into the Great Hall, opening to a grand staircase, like the one in the front entrance, while mahogany panelled walls and gold-framed mirrors made the huge space look majestic, like a palace. But all else in the world faded when my eyes travelled past the paintings and stopped on the west side of the room, where a grand piano sat proudly in the square of light coming through the giant window. \u201cNo one told me there was a piano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s been there for years. David learned to play on that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d She nodded. \u201cArietta taught him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. At Loslilian?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and started down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever meet them\u2014as boys?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes. Many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross. Didn\u2019t that make it kind of weird dating David, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really. I hadn\u2019t seen him for about twenty years before I dated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d She pointed to the middle of the room. \u201cThat table there is where we dine formally each night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I cringed at the length of it\u2014enough to seat about forty people. \u201cI was going to ask if that\u2019s where we sacrificed lambs, but, thanks for pointing out the obvious.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, her hand sliding over the railing as she continued down the stairs ahead of me. \u201cYou might wanna get that ogre in check, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t realise sarcasm was against the rules here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara. Stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d</p> <p>She just shook her head then tilted it so her voice projected further. \u201cArthur.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed him there, standing by the fireplace, looking up at a giant painting of a woman; he turned, taking his eyes off her brush-stroked face only as we approached. \u201cMorgaine.\u201d He took her hands and leaned down to kiss both her cheeks. \u201cLovely to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Arthur.\u201d She stood back, keeping hold of his hand for a second more. \u201cMay I present Princess Amara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure, my lady.\u201d Arthur bowed.</p><p>\u201cHello, Arthur.\u201d I walked the gap and took both his hands; it felt natural, normal, as if we\u2019d been friends our whole lives.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d he asked, his mysterious blue eyes seeming to search my soul\u2014maybe for the sadness of supposedly losing my husband, or maybe for happiness to see him, I wasn\u2019t sure, but I suddenly felt very naked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...coping.\u201d I looked at Morgaine; shadows crept into the room, sneaking under the walls and roof as the sun retreated, making her eyes glow, a bit like a cat\u2019s eyes at night, and it wasn\u2019t until I looked closer that I realised she was holding back tears. Arthur looked too.</p><p>\u201cOh, look at me. I\u2019ve gone and gotten myself all worked-up,\u201d she said, quickly wiping them away.</p><p>I did the same, though I didn\u2019t actually have any tears.</p><p>\u201cMy girls,\u201d Arthur said, touching both our shoulders. \u201cThere is little joy to be found when grieving. But David would not wish you to cry for him.\u201d He especially looked at Morgaine. \u201cYou know this.\u201d</p><p>We both nodded.</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d He tucked my wrist into the crook of his elbow. \u201cWalk with me\u2014in the gardens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I said, and we walked away, arm in arm. I caught a flash of Morgaine\u2019s grin as we turned, leaving her behind.</p><p>\u201cIt brings me great pleasure to be by your side again, Princess,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>I patted his forearm with my other hand. \u201cMe too. I always looked forward to your letters.\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly to himself. \u201cI know. And that fact not only gave me pleasure in writing them, but also made my days of waiting for this moment much brighter.\u201d</p><p>As we stepped through the tall glass doors, daylight spread around us, hidden by the walls of the Great Hall but still very much alive out here. The rounded balcony\u2019s marble railing opened out to stone steps, sitting grandly above a grassy, split-level path to the hedge maze. The sweet, sharp scent of lilies and cherry blossoms filtered summer perfume into the warm evening. \u201cI know you told me not to,\u201d I said, having thought about it for a second. \u201cBut I kept one of your letters.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened over mine. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded so genuine.\u201d</p><p>I expected an objection, but he only offered silence as we took the steps and a left turn to a small courtyard just in front of the staffs\u2019 ground floor bedroom windows.</p><p>\u201cMay I enquire as to which letter it was?\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cThe one about days being brighter\u2014pretty much what you just said before, but in writing.\u201d I grinned up at him, feeling the pinch of the small dimple by my lip.</p><p>He nodded and presented the bench-like garden swing nearby. \u201cWould you like to sit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, sweeping my skirt under my legs as I sat down carefully, trying not to rock it too much so I didn\u2019t tip over and land on my butt like a clumsy ox.</p><p>\u201cI wonder\u2014\u201d Arthur sat beside me \u201c\u2014if David ever told you he spent nearly every second summer of his human life at this manor. That he sat here, on this very bench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said and looked forward, imagining young David running through the hedge maze. \u201cI haven\u2019t really been told much about this place at all\u2014or about David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will learn. In time.\u201d</p><p>We sat silently for a while, a comfortable silence, and all I could think of was how great dinner smelled and how nice it would feel, all hot and solid in my belly. When the setting sun reached the greens of summer on this side of the manor, turning them orange and pink as it creeped closer and closer to the ocean behind the trees, I turned to Arthur, a question on my lips I knew I shouldn\u2019t ask; \u201cArthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get all the laws of the vampires straight in my head and figure out how things were before Drake took over\u2014\u201d</p><p>He scoffed loudly. \u201cDrake never took over, Princess. He merely took back the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, which ever way you want to look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, that is a fact. Drake built the monarchy. He designed the Sets, the rules\u2014he is the reason the human race was not wiped out centuries ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we have been wiped out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar among your kind, greed among vampires\u2014blood lust. He has stepped in many times to save humans from themselves. And from vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Everything we stand for, everything the community is today, is a result of Drake\u2019s empire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? If he\u2019s so evil, why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>Arthur seemed to sigh internally. \u201cYou know, as well as I do, that good and bad is not black and white. Drake, by human standards, may seem evil, but he is still a good man.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll buy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, back to your original question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, I was going to ask why Lilithians weren\u2019t allowed to mix with vampires, and how David got away with dating Morgaine if it was illegal.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always that way. For a time, Lilithians and vampires lived in peace. But Drake quickly realised that the control we had gained over the population of vampires was based mainly on the fear they had of punishment\u2014punishment carried out by Lilithians. In order to maintain that fear, we had to create a divide between the species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy a divide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstanding, my dear. When you understand something, there is little reason to fear it. If that happened, we could have lost control over the nation. So, Drake was none too concerned if council leaders wished to mingle with Lilithians, because they knew the importance of maintaining that divide, but average vampires were not permitted. He particularly had little issue with Morgaine, given that she was of high authority among her kind\u2014employed, rather than enslaved by Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmployed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She was...\u201d He let out a slow breath. \u201cGood at her job. Not to mention she was, at one point, rather close with Drake\u2014spent many nights in his company.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth.</p><p>\u201cConsensual, of course,\u201d Arthur added. \u201cSo, David and Morgaine being together was accepted\u2014here at Loslilian. This place\u2014\u201d he looked around fondly, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s like living in another time\u2014a separate world. But outside these walls, the rules of the Sets were always enforced. Vampires associating with Lilithians is...was illegal and frowned upon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was it so different at the manor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoslilian was always a very human place. Drake did not care much for the preservation of vampire customs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Arthur considered for a second. \u201cPerhaps it was because Lilith was always so human. Many of her servants and staff were human, and throughout history, even after Lilith died, this manor remained that way. Vampires brought their human mates here until they were ready for transformation, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t David do that with me?\u201d I sprung forward, raising my voice. \u201cBefore he knew I couldn\u2019t be a vampire. We could have run away here until I was ready.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin. \u201cI know. And I offered him this, but he refused.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a hard lump. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid...well, he had some inner truths he wished to keep from you. He told me once that you were a very moralistic girl\u2014that you challenged and questioned everything that was right and wrong, basing your friendships and feelings on how you measured a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIn the vampire community, that is a luxury we cannot afford. There are no exceptions. We have all committed unspeakable acts of cruelty. A council member, however, is known too well for their ability to separate themselves from the unpleasant\u2014disregarding compassion in order to instil fear as a means of maintaining control. David was afraid if you ever learned of the things he\u2019d done, you would not have the heart to love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I know what he\u2019s done. I know all about him. I\u2019d always have loved him.\u201d</p><p>Arthur laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would, my dear, but I can tell you, right now, you know not even one percent of the things my nephew did in his time on the council\u2014and you never will. Not as long as I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not see my words tarnish his memory or cause you to despise him.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be a good a thing? Then I could move on in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you would want?\u201d He leaned forward and looked around at my face. \u201cSo soon after losing him\u2014you wish to forget, to hate?\u201d</p><p>I shrunk a little. \u201cSometimes I wish I did hate him. I can handle hate easier than heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeartache,\u201d he said to himself, nodding.</p><p>I wondered what he expected me to feel. Heartache seemed pretty natural, given that David was apparently dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worried for you these past weeks,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes forward, even when I looked up at him; his jaw was stiff, slightly covered in stubble, a bit like David\u2019s, and he\u2019d obviously not taken too much care to cut or tidy his hair in this time we\u2019d been apart. I kind of laughed a little. He looked...messy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Arthur. Really. I...I guess I\u2019m used to losing people I love.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my smile, then down at his hands, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to make of that, my lady.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and pulled my dress down over my knees where it rose up. \u201cDon\u2019t think into it at all. No one has ever figured me out, Arthur, and I guarantee you won\u2019t be the one to do it.\u201d When the silence lasted uncomfortably long, I turned my head, reluctantly, as I could feel his glittering grin in my direction. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDo not be so sure, Princess, that I cannot figure you out.\u201d He looked away again. \u201cI believe I may be closer to your inner truths than you would allow.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. \u201cAnd what makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>His lip quirked; he looked so young, like the thirty years his face portrayed, not the hundreds his mannerisms did. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a while. You\u2019re not the first moody, complicated young girl I\u2019ve had the pleasure of befriending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He laughed, still not looking at me.</p><p>The orange glow all around us made his skin look tan and his eyes sparkle with a mix of blue and sunshine, looking almost green. I let myself picture David there, in his place, for just a second. \u201cAnd you think that gives you greater insight into who I am and how I work?\u201d</p><p>He turned to me then and took my hand delicately, the stiff, guarded Arthur gone, replaced by a guy with boyish charm. \u201cYou remind me very much of David\u2019s aunt. Did he speak much of her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cHe told me how she died.\u201d</p><p>Stiff Arthur reappeared, dropping my hand, a wave of darkness flooding his eyes. \u201cIt pains me to come back here. Her memory, and that of my nephews\u2019, infects every corner of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am, too. But, despite that, I am here\u2014for you, and if there is anything I can advise on or assist with, you need only ask it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is one thing.\u201d I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cSpeak it, my dear, and it shall be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to free the prisoners, but I don\u2019t know much about your law system\u2014how things worked or where the prisoners are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you wish to free them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause, I...I don\u2019t believe those vampires were imprisoned fairly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara\u2014\u201d He scratched his chin, sighing.</p><p>\u201cLook, just tell me where they are.\u201d I folded my arms, making myself taller beside him. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you agree with me or not, I mean, why would you\u2014you\u2019re probably the one who put them all away. But I\u2019m in charge now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. You have not taken your oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I will soon. And freeing those prisoners will be the first thing I take care of\u2014aside from disbanding the Sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisbanding!\u201d He sat taller. \u201cAmara, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s. Not. Open. For negotiation.\u201d I put a hand up between us. \u201cYou\u2019re here to advise, not tell me what I can and can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few extra times. \u201cAnd I endeavour only to advise, Princess. It is not my wish to govern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I can tell from your authorative stance\u2014seat\u2014that you want to make me do what you think I should do.\u201d</p><p>He sat back a little, becoming smaller. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. I did not mean to come across that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...can you please just tell me where they keep the prisoners?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cMost are held at le Chateau Elysium, the Lilithian First Order in Paris, a few are in New Zealand and some in China. But while Drake still rules the vampire domains, we can free only those in Paris and the ones held here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? There are prisoners here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014in the cellblock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe...we have a cellblock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His lips spread, giving in to the dimples in his cheeks\u2014his nephew\u2019s dimples.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great, then.\u201d I sat back and pushed my hair off my face, catching the slight hint of my vanilla honey hand cream as I did. \u201cWe\u2019ll get started freeing them after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t thought this through.\u201d</p><p>My mouth popped open. \u201cWhat would you know about what I have and have not thought through! I have thought about this\u2014for a long time, Arthur. And I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, the prisoners held here are the most vile creatures\u2014locked away for their inhumane behaviour. These are the worst kinds of vampires.\u201d</p><p>I softened. \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly, they are ones who massacred humans without need, disgracefully disposed of them or tortured them. Some of them are rapists, some, worse than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, did you think we allowed vampires to violate basic human rights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe had laws, Amara. We had respect among our community\u2014honour, principles\u2014brutal crimes were punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, when Jason kidnapped me, at the Masquerade, he said he was allowed to mutilate his kill any way he saw fit.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled. \u201cHe was just trying to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you aren\u2019t allowed to mutilate us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some ways, we are, but there are limits. You see, fear makes the blood warmer, so scaring a human a little is deemed acceptable, but, in the cases we store below, what they did went beyond a little fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jason kidnapping me didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Arthur swallowed. \u201cNot according to our standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your own, personal standards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, it is purely because you are a friend and I care for you that I see what my nephew did as unacceptable. Had he raped you, I would have skinned him alive, whether you were a friend or not, but, other than that...I\u2019m sorry, he did not hurt you enough to justify imprisonment. And don\u2019t look at me that way\u2014I had to see the same look on David\u2019s face the day Drake made that ruling.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet.</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d He took my hand, his tone commanding I look at him; it was hard to see now with only a dim light on the distant horizon, while pale lamps stepped in where the sun failed. \u201cJason never had any intentions of\u2014\u201d He inched closer, swallowing. \u201cHe was never going to rape you. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>There was a shift then, in energy; I felt it. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night of Karnivale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I nodded, realising I\u2019d probably said too much. I just assumed he already knew. I could almost hear Morgaine\u2019s disapproval.</p><p>Arthur remained silent.</p><p>\u201cArthur, you okay?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, his brows pinching in the middle. \u201cI\u2019m glad he had the chance to tell you that\u2014before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d My lip quivered. I thrust my shoulders back slightly and sat taller, swallowing the gut wrench Jason\u2019s death brought. \u201cBut, back to the issue at hand. The prisoners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should not be freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you. I\u2019ve been told Drake\u2019s methods were harsh and that he was unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you have been misinformed,\u201d Arthur added crossly. \u201cDrake ruled our nation for many centuries with an iron fist, and with good reason. Vampires misbehaving draws attention, spreads unrest, and, like a plague, encourages others to do the same. The only way to control them is to own their fears\u2014to be the very nightmare they run from in their sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound pretty passionate about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have served beside the king for my entire vampire life, Amara. We have fought for our freedom, our concealment and our community. To see a young girl become queen and make changes to all that we have spent centuries developing\u2014\u201d He sat forward and looked at the ground between his legs, breathing out heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s just difficult. I can see you making the very same mistakes Drake made in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made friends of vampires; an option, I\u2019m afraid, is not viable for those in power. He tried to rule by love of his people, and while that is a noble path, there are lines. And you must draw them. Second, you have a good heart, Princess, but you must learn not to use it when making decisions about members of our society that cannot fit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all very well, Arthur, but what Drake deems punishable, and what my kind do, are very different things.\u201d I thought about Pepper. \u201cLook, fact remains, I want to free the prisoners. Now, are you going to help me with that, or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I have little choice,\u201d he said to the ground.</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cArthur, I understand how you feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Princess\u2014\u201d he looked right at me, \u201c\u2014you do not. You cannot possibly fathom the nightmarish ordeals it took to gain control over the vampires, or the devastation they infected upon this earth in a time before Lilithians were even a thought in God\u2019s mind. I was there; I witnessed the terror\u2014I helped write many of the laws that see vampires punished and, yes, our methods are cruel, harsh, but if you could only see what I have seen, you would realise why, by freeing those depraved brutes, you are about to make your first big mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I disagree. It\u2019s a difference in opinion.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s that you, my dear, are not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve heard everything you, Morgaine and everyone else has had to say. But this is my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely,\u201d he said. \u201cNot right now. Until you have made your oath, all your decisions must be approved by the House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine then. Once I\u2019m queen, I\u2019ll free them. You can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not seek to stop you, but I would hope, after many conversations, you would see my point.\u201d</p><p>I slumped in my seat a little then took a deep breath and looked at the starry sky. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Arthur. I don\u2019t mean to argue with you. It\u2019s just that...I just don\u2019t like people telling me what to do\u2014telling me I know nothing.\u201d</p><p>He reached across and patted my hand. \u201cYou remind me of my nephew, in that sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at his hand on mine, softening away from spoiled-princess mode. \u201cSo, the imprisoned vampires are really that bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContemptible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just never imagined there\u2019d be vampires that did things like that\u2014horrible things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so very different to human\u2019s, Ara. If a human is capable of violence, then of course a vampire is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was only planning to free the ones I thought were punished unfairly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you determine that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo through each case, I guess. Maybe bring their lawyer back in, discuss each one with him.\u201d</p><p>Arthur shuffled in his seat, clearing his throat. \u201cThat would be impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the vampire who sentenced the prisoners we keep here is...dead.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d Ouch. I hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cThen, I guess I\u2019ll have to assign someone else I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Loslilian director of penalty would perhaps be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that? I thought Morgaine was head of, like, everything Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Arthur said with a smile. \u201cOnly in Paris. She was brought here purely to torture David. She would not know the finer details of Loslilian prisoners or punishment schedules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So, who\u2019s this director of penalty, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBernard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBernard?\u201d I said it quietly to myself. \u201cOkay, well, I guess I\u2019ll speak to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. But not alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s spent far too long trolling those dark corridors, my dear. He has little respect for anything or anyone. I\u2019d not put it past him to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle a person being rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be so, but I will not tolerate anyone disrespecting our princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, how sweet,\u201d I said, my lip in a false pout. But it faded away quickly with a question resonating from deep within my worry-spot. \u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to stuff all this up\u2014you know, wreck everything you\u2019ve built?\u201d I asked delicately.</p><p>He rubbed his face with both hands. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t want you to run in with guns blazing\u2014trying to change every law you oppose, all at once. As you spend more time in the community of vampires, you will see, more clearly with each passing day, that there is good reason for everything we have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is all I ask.\u201d</p><p>With the awkward first part of our conversation out of the way, I felt more comfortable to attempt a little probing. \u201cSo, you knew Drake pretty well, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow him well, yes. He is a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you haven\u2019t seen him\u2014since the attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve not even had word from him. I was told only that he was in Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re here at the manor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He would be aware I have taken my bi-annual leave, but he would not likely know where I have gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he think you should have stayed? You know, because of the whole Lilithian uprising and all.\u201d</p><p>Arthur shook his head. \u201cI have served my time. Friend to the king or not, I must take my leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s still alive? Like, after he was stabbed\u2014do you think he survived it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be certain of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he survive it, though\u2014if it was my venom on the sword, how could he live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no saying it was your venom. It could have been a ruse.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, perhaps it may be that he is a very powerful being and cannot be killed. I have not only heard stories of his dark magic, but seen him use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I...can I ask what sort of magic you saw?\u201d My eyes widened a little.</p><p>Arthur looked down at his open palm, as if he held something there. \u201cI watched him turn a red rose black\u2014suck the life from it\u2014then restore in the same breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So, maybe he is evil? Maybe I should seek to destroy him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your heart tell you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought about that for a second, trying to dislodge all the other voices in there that weren\u2019t mine. \u201cIt tells me to negotiate with him\u2014that he is capable of reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does your private council think of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mike thinks I\u2019m young and na\u00efve\u2014that I just don\u2019t have any idea what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d I looked down.</p> <p>\u201cMike is young, himself.\u201d Arthur smiled. \u201cYou are a bright girl, and I know you do not see good and evil in two dimensions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t. But, is that wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Princess, it\u2019s not. The world is so full of philosophy and opinion. And each individual has opposing concepts of harmony and peace. We all defend our beliefs, our perceptions of what is right or wrong\u2014and it is impossible sometimes to know which side to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a grey area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. One may ask himself if he should follow the leader that shares the majority of advocates, or the one whom he agrees with himself. And that\u2014\u201d he grinned, leaning back on the swing, making it rock a little, \u201c\u2014even I have not answered to this day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHm, well, it\u2019s a good question, Arthur. I guess, in the end, you just have to follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do not have that luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cHumans, especially, follow tyrants sometimes out of force, often just fear, but, I believe, mostly...naivety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think most people know what\u2019s right and wrong, Arthur. And in the end, we all always overthrow oppression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow little you know of history for a girl whose own father is a professor in this field.\u201d He sat forward a little. \u201cWhat you need to ask is not whether we overthrow oppression, but who is the oppressor\u2014who do we overthrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bad guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you decide who is bad?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cGuess it\u2019s a matter of opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose opinion counts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, not everyone agrees.\u201d He turned in the seat to face me. \u201cTake Hitler, for example; people followed him, convinced, as he was, that his madness was merely revolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but in time, they rose against him. Good did triumph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, not that I feel this way, but how do you know that was the right course of action? And who decides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all decide, Arthur, because bringing pain and suffering to anyone, for any reason, is never right.\u201d I tucked my hair behind my ear and looked up at him. \u201cThe world will not stop fighting for freedom and peace. That is what\u2019s right, and tyranny is wrong. I will always take the path that leads to freedom for my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your people\u2014exactly. And what if the path to freedom would result, ultimately, in the sacrifice of many others? Would you be any better than your tyrannical predecessors for opting to walk it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? How do you choose a side? What is right? What is wrong\u2014and according to whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s all separate from me. I\u2019ll find a way to bring the Three Worlds together\u2014we can live in peace. I know we can, and I know I can do it without causing any suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept to kill those who oppose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do? Imprison them? Set them free to start wars\u2014cause more damage, more deaths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur...this is too much for me. I\u2019m not ready to deal with this yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must, Princess. You are in a position of power and that brings with it the obligation of decision. You are in no way separate from this,\u201d his voice softened. \u201cIn the coming weeks, you will be queen, and then, every action you take, every decision you tactlessly regard, will single-handedly affect the lives of many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? This is why I didn\u2019t want to be the queen. I\u2019ve got you telling me I need to make decisions, Mike telling me not to because I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, and, inside, what I feel is right doesn\u2019t match what everyone says is right. I\u2019m just not ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have no choice.\u201d Arthur spoke louder. \u201cYou will be queen, you will have to decide what is right or wrong, and sometimes, it will be between the lesser of two evils. Sometimes, there is no circumventing the unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this, Arthur?\u201d I swallowed the shaky lump of anguish his ruthlessness created. \u201cWhat do you hope to achieve by making me feel even smaller, even more stupid than I already do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to wake up, my lady, and ask yourself what you plan to do, and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know why\u2014I just don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You know what you hope to achieve\u2014peace among all. But you do not ask yourself why that matters, or why you choose to care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need to ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the answer to the what should always come after the why.\u201d</p><p>His words filtered through me, passing every channel of self-doubt, meeting with the stark blankness of confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou must have a motive behind everything you do, Amara. Freeing the prisoners, disbanding the Sets, negotiating with Drake\u2014if you can\u2019t find a good reason why you feel this necessary, then perhaps it is the wrong course of action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think I should kill Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should be sure about what you want to do, before you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not my job to give opinion, my lady, only to help you find your own.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. He is so exhausting. \u201cHow will I know when I\u2019ve found it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you ask yourself why, and know the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll never know which path to take. Because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever approve of killing someone just because they oppose us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ask yourself why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you oppose death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his brow. \u201cI have seen many rise to power in my time\u2014all of them with the best of intentions, and it is those philanthropic aspirations that ruin them. You can\u2019t save everyone, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I stopped and thought about what I wanted to say. Shut up and leave me alone seemed to be all that came to mind.</p><p>Arthur breathed out and tore his blue eyes away from my face as he brushed his hand through his windswept, carelessly messed hair. \u201cYou\u2019re just a young girl,\u201d he said softly, \u201cAnd I do not mean to be harsh on you, but I do care; I care for you as a person and as ruler of a nation. I have lived many years, seen many political changes in the world. I know, from experience, that winning hearts can sustain dominance for only short periods. You will need cruel methods, possibly even death, to prevent opposition. And they will rise against you. I do not see vampires following wilfully, even when you capture Drake and imprison him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisbanding the Sets,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should win hearts for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would.\u201d He half laughed. \u201cBut it will see more problems than it will fix.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cProbably, but, really, I don\u2019t want to argue this topic, right now. I\u2019m tired, and I didn\u2019t come out here\u2014\u201d I motioned to the garden, \u201c\u2014for a political debate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my dear. That was not my intention, either. But the things you say\u2014your views and opinions\u2014they give me great cause for concern.\u201d He clasped his hands together, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cThere will come a time where you must choose a side and defend it. There will be no negotiating some things, and I just don\u2019t want to see you heartbroken when you\u2019re forced to make a decision that will cost lives. And one day, Princess, you will have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d I rolled my eyes behind his back. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but I feel strongly about this. I won\u2019t see the demise of vampires for Lilithians to live, and I won\u2019t see the same in reverse. We live in united peace, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there is much, much more to it. When two sides oppose, they fight until one yields, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to lead to war. No one has to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one, war does not always involve death, my dear, but without death, very rarely sees one side surrender. You do not wish to kill or be harsh to enforce your reign, but you want to be respected enough to be followed. You can't buy peace with daisy chains, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if we have to go to war to achieve peace, then I guess we\u2019ll go to war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now you approve killing to fight for your cause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don't know. Maybe\u2014if I have to.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips into a thin smile and looked to one side. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a girl who holds such strong values to be so easily led.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cYou disapprove of killing and violence, yet, if I were to forcefully disagree, convince you it was necessary, you would acquiesce\u2014despite what you felt was the right course of action.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands. \u201cI'm just trying to get this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen follow your heart, Amara. Do not allow yourself to be controlled by others\u2019 opinions. I can see you clearly have a great amount of respect for me, and while this is not only sweet but very flattering, it\u2019s also dangerous. Your council has warned you that I may be a traitor, yet you take my word as vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can't help it, Arthur. I just don't think you're the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled warmly. \u201cWell, that leads me back to the point I was trying to make in the beginning; not that you must either kill or not kill, but to be sure it is what you believe to be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I'm wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you make a mistake\u2014and you learn from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, if I'm queen, aren't I supposed to behead my advisor when things go wrong?\u201d I smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Arthur said in a light, laughing tone, \u201cif that\u2019s the way Her Majesty demonstrates strength and governance, then I say, behead me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cAside from the fact that it\u2019s impossible to behead a vampire, you know I wouldn\u2019t really do that, right?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cThat, my dear, is what worries me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I quickly learned that Lilithians and vampires shared one common ground; they liked their traditions and formalities. Everyone at the dining table had remained upstanding until I was seated. I felt ridiculous dressing formally for dinner as it was, but having someone push my chair in, bow at me and then motion everyone else to sit, made me just want to hide my face in my hand and laugh at them all.</p><p>The seat mirroring mine was the only empty one at the table; a place the king would sit when he returned, or, according to my people, when I took a new husband. The knowledge that my David should be sitting there, fourteen seats down from me, so far away but closer than he was now, made that chair seem like a vortex, ready to suck my composure up with one breath. I closed my eyes and rubbed my temples.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, baby?\u201d Mike whispered, leaning closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Just a bit of a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Morgaine said from the seat on my left. \u201cDinner will end soon enough, then we\u2019ll all leave you alone for the next twelve hours. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her and leaned back in my chair. Down the other end of the table, too far away to yell hello to, Eric sent me a warm smile. Arthur looked up at him, following the direction of his eyes, then leaned in and whispered something that made Eric look away.</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got better hearing than I do. What did Arthur just say to Eric?\u201d</p><p>She looked over at Arthur, who smiled across at us, obviously having heard what I just said.</p><p>\u201cHe just told him to remember that, in official gatherings, you are a queen, not his friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Eric,\u201d I said quietly, knowing he\u2019d hear me over the noisy dinner chatter; he smirked into his plate. I shot Arthur a narrowed glare to which he returned a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cWe may be worrying for no reason.\u201d My ears tuned in to the portly woman who speaks her mind when no one asks. \u201cDrake may already be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if it were a ploy\u2014a theatrical diversion?\u201d said Moustache Man. \u201cHe may be very much alive and waiting for us to drop our guard.\u201d</p><p>It seemed Arthur and I weren\u2019t the only ones with these theories.</p><p>\u201cYes, from what I hear, Lilithian venom is not enough to kill him. He has black magic spells that keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, an immunity spell?\u201d I grinned, looking at Mike, who kicked my foot under the table.</p><p>\u201cYes. If only we could get hold of that spell,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cWe Lilithians could feed off vampires without risk of hurting them from our bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Perhaps we should put a team together to start working on that,\u201d I added, offering Mike a wry smile; he was not impressed.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Morgaine added, stirring the pot of Mike\u2019s irritation. \u201cWe should start work on it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of resources,\u201d Mike said, glaring at her. \u201cMaybe after we catch Drake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do we need to catch him?\u201d asked a face I hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cWhy not just go in there now and kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d someone else said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we can\u2019t kill him, right?\u201d I said, looking at Mike. \u201cIsn\u2019t it only this prophecy child that can?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Eric said. \u201cThe prophecy says your child will be the one to do it, not that you or any other vampire can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis may be correct,\u201d said a man beside Eric. \u201cBut we must not mess with the will of Fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here.\u201d Another man nodded. \u201cBad things happen when you meddle in things that already have an order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad things happen when old vampires get superstitious, like a human, and start using those superstitions to make political decisions,\u201d a Lilithian said.</p><p>A couple of arguments broke out across the table; I looked at Arthur, who seemed to be staying out of this one. And I realised then that the table had been divided; to my left side were all the vampires and to my right were Lilithians. I wondered why they were seated that way\u2014if it was deliberate. The only exception to that seating arrangement was Morgaine\u2019s. It seemed kind of fitting that she was seated on the vampires\u2019 side, given that she\u2019d bedded with Drake. I gagged on my rice for a second, feeling the pinch of vomit rising up my oesophagus.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d Mike said loudly, raising both hands to end the arguments. \u201cThe fact is, we need to catch Drake, and it needs to be soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWe actually just need to gain control over all the Sets. All we\u2019re trying to achieve is the enforcement of the new rules so we can have peace between Lilithians and vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace? We should be imprisoning the vampires\u2014killing them all,\u201d one woman said.</p><p>\u201cI concur,\u201d a man on the Lilithian side added. \u201cRid the world of their kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would we eat, then?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cKeep some. Farm them. Store them.\u201d</p> <p>The vampires rose up in arms, voices reaching across the table, barely holding back violence.</p><p>\u201cThere are to be no more prisoners,\u201d I said loudly; everyone stopped\u2014to my amazement. This queen thing was suddenly growing on me. \u201cI will enforce equal rights for both vampires and Lilithians alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Drake is still breathing, that will never come to par.\u201d With that statement, the two species broke into heated conversations again\u2014their food untouched.</p><p>\u201cIf Drake wants to live in united peace, he can remain on the throne,\u201d I said in a calm, quiet voice, refusing to enter this shouting contest. \u201cMaybe we can rule together.\u201d</p><p>Conversations around the room ceased abruptly with a unified gasp.</p><p>The portly woman snorted. \u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d a Lilithian added harshly. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly presume to know what is wise\u2014you\u2019re just a baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere. Here,\u201d an old man said, tapping his finger on the table. \u201cYou were not even born when Drake stormed this manor and killed our queen. You did not hear of the horror, or the deaths of so many Lilithians that day. You cannot make a ruling about this, Princess, because you know nothing of our past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe past is inconsequential. I\u2019m thinking about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuture? Future!\u201d One man, so enraged, leaped from his seat, slamming his hands on either side of his plate. \u201cIf you want any kind of future, you will send your knights forth at once to seek out and kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI concur,\u201d a man said.</p><p>\u201cAs do I.\u201d</p><p>Several men from each side wrapped their knuckles on the tabletop, nodding, their mutters of agreement uniting them for the first time tonight.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is the wisest course of action. We should act immediately.\u201d Moustache man, who I was starting to think might be a position of authority among the House, had the final word, all going silent after.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d I addressed the entire table, \u201cI am your leader, and I have to decide which is the right course of action. I\u2019m sorry, but it won\u2019t necessarily always be the wise one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will lead us all to ruin,\u201d the portly woman scolded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Arthur glared at her. \u201cShow some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Arthur.\u201d I held my hand up, then smiled at the woman, who bowed her head apologetically. \u201cLook. I know you\u2019re all afraid because I\u2019m young. But I was born for this role, and I have a wise council to advise me. I won\u2019t see the Lilithians fall back into Drake\u2019s hands.\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cI honestly would die before I let that happen. But, I will lead us to the freedom we all desire, and I\u2019ll take whichever path is likely to cause the least damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast damage? What kind of a leader would be willing to sacrifice even one life for her na\u00efve, altruistic outcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good one,\u201d I said. \u201cLook, I am in a position of power. And in that\u2014\u201d I smiled at Arthur, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s sometimes impossible to circumvent the unpleasant. But it is, however, my job to determine the lesser evil. I\u2019m not a miracle worker or a god, I cannot do the impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Your Majesty, Drake will not quit. He will not stop until you and every other of our kind is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he must die,\u201d Portly Woman said.</p><p>\u201cIt is not for you to decide whether Drake should live or die,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen who does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. God, maybe. I don\u2019t know. All I know is that opposing that which is considered bad by most does not make you good\u2014only misinformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidered bad? Drake is bad!\u201d</p><p>I sipped my drink and took a breath, feeling more confident seeing Arthur\u2019s reassuring smile. \u201cWhen Drake took back the throne,\u201d I started, \u201che made the decision that our kind was dispensable. How did that feel? Are we dispensable?\u201d I looked directly into each eye. \u201cThere is good in everyone, and I believe we can negotiate with Drake. Enough blood has been shed. We must offer peace in order to restore it.\u201d</p><p>Mike dropped his fork onto his plate and all heads turned as the clatter startled the stunned silence in the room. His mouth closed, the ball in his throat shifting.</p><p>\u201cWell then\u2014\u201d Arthur stood and raised his glass. \u201cA toast\u2014to the princess and her insightful approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the princess,\u201d the table hummed.</p><p>With daylight gone, night darkened the stained-glass dome over my bed; what was blue or white glass in the sun became transparent, showing the stars beyond, hiding away up there in a world too high for me to ever reach. Those glistening entities made Lilith, her story, her life, seem like more of a mystery to me, but one that I, somehow, felt more connected to.</p><p>I\u2019d been told of her beginning; how she was conceived of Vampirie and a human girl, and how she was loved by all who knew her. But even though I knew this, when I first laid eyes on the dome above my bed\u2014depicting her beginning\u2014I was surprised not to see a shapely woman reaching across a clouded sky to an infant. Clich\u00e9, I know, but that\u2019s what I expected. Instead, my eyes feasted in the story-book scene of a little girl sitting in a garden full of roses, sharing tea with a man and two expressionless dolls. I wondered who this dark stranger was; his black hair and cloak seemed so out of place beside this girl in floral print, with a yellow ribbon in her hair. Perhaps he was Vampirie, or maybe even Lilith\u2019s grandfather. I couldn\u2019t see the image enough to make any real conclusions. My room was dark, lit only by the flickering glow of a gas lamp by my door, but even in such dim light, the man\u2019s electric blue eyes shone out like beacons, radiating with love for this little girl. It made me think of my own daughter\u2014the child of the prophecy\u2014made me think about tea parties we might have in the garden and the dolls we would play with together. And when I brushed a strand of hair from my face, feeling the youth of my barely twenty-year-old skin, I cringed. Once upon a time, I had everything planned; I\u2019d go to college, get married once I found a job as a teacher, then, when I was about twenty-eight, I\u2019d have started planning a family. A little boy first, then maybe a girl.</p><p>I dropped my hand onto my belly and felt the smooth skin under my pyjama top. For all I knew, after what David and I did on the piano this morning, there could be life forming inside me right now. It felt, at the same time as magic, also really scary. I wanted to make it stop, to make it all go away. But also wanted to feel it inside me\u2014feel the life growing, moving, becoming a possibility.</p><p>But my dad would be so disappointed\u2014when we sent another letter, this time announcing I\u2019d be a teen mother.</p><p>With a sigh, I rolled onto my belly and reached into my nightstand for a small rectangle envelope, then rolled onto my back again, running my fingers over the words Maple Terrace. I hadn\u2019t had time to respond to any of dad\u2019s letters in the last week, since David entered the world of the living again, and I knew Dad would be freaking out by now. So, I grabbed my phone, went into the email app and wrote Dear Dad and Vi....then backspaced a few times and wrote Mum. I told him all about Paris, all about the places David and I had been on our pretend honeymoon, using pictures from the Web to describe it, then told him how much I love him, and pressed send.</p><p>Another email came through almost instantly, like he\u2019d been sending it at the same time.</p><p>Ara-Rose. It said, and when I saw all the exclamation marks, I realised it was sent before he received mine.</p><p>How long are you planning to keep extending this honeymoon.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even bother with a question mark. Wow, he must be mad.</p><p>You\u2019ve been gone for over eight weeks. We haven\u2019t heard your voice even once in that time. We\u2019re getting worried! Very worried! Call me as soon as you get this. Or at least leave a new number. The one we have says disconnected. I\u2019m not joking, Ara. You call me as soon as you get this.</p><p>The fact that he missed punctuation, then forgot to sign with Love, Dad, meant it was probably from Vicki. I smiled and switched my phone off. The email I already sent would tie them over for now.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock.\u201d Mike pushed my door open and stood with a gleaming smile, carrying two steaming mugs.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike.\u201d I sat up in my bed.</p><p>\u201cWant company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove some.\u201d</p><p>He handed me a cup as he sat beside me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDad emailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been calling my phone non-stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m organising a phone line that redirects your calls and bounces them off cell towers all over the world so it won\u2019t show up on his bill that you\u2019re a local call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will that be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for about three weeks. We\u2019ve got a few other things on backorder as well, not to mention, telecommunications are a bit tricky out here because we don\u2019t exactly have state-of-the-art communications towers or underground network cables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve had two bars of service on my phone the whole time. I can only make calls if there are no birds flying past,\u201d I joked, sipping my drink.</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re getting it sorted. It just takes time.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d I smiled up at him.</p><p>He sighed and took my cup, placing it on my nightstand before slipping in bed next to me, shoes and all. \u201cI can read you like a book, girl. Is this about David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d I scowled at him. \u201cMorg says we can't talk about him in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara. Morg\u2019s just paranoid. You should be fine to talk openly in your room,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cSo, is it about him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded into his shoulder, winding my fingers through his.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s worrying you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t answering his phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried it\u2019s because he\u2019s mad at me, but I don\u2019t really understand why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be mad at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...we\u2019ve been arguing a lot\u2014even before the kidnapping and torture, you know, and...\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s fingers tightened on mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he went and said he doesn\u2019t trust me and all that other stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it like that, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. He always says what he means.\u201d</p><p>Mike looked down at our hands\u2014together, then pulled it across his waist and tucked it under his elbow, wrapping his arms snugly around me. \u201cYou wanna know what he told me\u2014when he called before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called you!\u201d I sat bolt upright.</p><p>\u201cHe called to apologise for what he said\u2014about my being capable of cheating on Em.\u201d</p><p>I sat back on my pillows, dead-weighted.</p><p>\u201cLook, baby, I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s not speaking to you. He loves you, and whatever reason, it\u2019s not because he\u2019s mad at you. So, I can\u2019t help you there, but...I can help you with what he said\u2014about the bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fight he started this morning\u2014\u201d He swiped his thumb over my chin, angling my face to look at him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t trust you, or even me. He didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you, but he\u2019s so mad, Ara\u2014at himself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s been eating him up\u2014that he wasn\u2019t there to protect you when Jason was binding you. He says he wishes he had been the creepy stalker vampire, now, because none of this would\u2019ve happened if he\u2019d taken better care of you.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth with slightly shaky fingers.</p> <p>\u201cHe also said he wishes he was more powerful, so he could get in your head and undo the bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor David.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he just tell me all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he feels weak, baby. He\u2019s a guy. Okay? He\u2019s not going to admit when he can\u2019t be the strong, dependable knight you need him to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need him to be that.\u201d I sat up a little more, as if my words might reach David through Mike. \u201cI just need him to be with me\u2014to be honest with me.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded. \u201cDid you tell him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9, Mike. Touch\u00e9.\u201d I pointed at him, then let all my emotions out with a sigh. \u201cDoes it bother you\u2014David and Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at the house\u2014alone, feeding from each other, hunting humans together. You know what the blood lust does. Are you worried they might\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you worried, Ara? David would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s Em I don\u2019t trust. She\u2019s always had a thing for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra! How can you say that? She\u2019s your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I shrunk a little. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014she can feel his thoughts. And...I mean, what does that mean anyway? How can you feel thoughts?\u201d</p><p>He laughed once, as if he\u2019d asked that very same question himself. \u201cShe says it\u2019s like when you have your own thoughts, they\u2019re always accompanied by a feeling; excitement, dread, lust, joy, warmth\u2014she can sense that. She said it\u2019s like a scent, like he changes cologne every few minutes. After a while, she started to recognise which scent went with which feeling, or thought.\u201d</p><p>I kind of imagined it for a second; David zipping off to spray himself with different coloured bottles every few minutes. \u201cWell, see, there\u2019s that\u2014that \u2018special\u2019 connection\u2014then there\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s a vampire, like him; she\u2019s pretty, blonde, carefree. She doesn\u2019t cause trouble like I do\u2014or fight with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t love her, Ara,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHe loves you. If anyone should be worried, it\u2019s David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should he be worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d He sat up a bit\u2014probably to be taller than me again. \u201cYou\u2019re here, miles from home, with a guy who\u2019s crazy about you\u2014a guy you\u2019re spirit bound to\u2014while David\u2019s forced to stay at home wondering what you\u2019re doing, praying the bad guy doesn\u2019t come back to take you away again while he\u2019s not here to protect you.\u201d He breathed out through his nose. \u201cAnd he knows what you\u2019re like, Ara. You never listen to anyone; you never do as you\u2019re told. He has to rely on the very guy, whom he doesn\u2019t trust to be with you, to protect you above all else and then comfort you when you\u2019re feeling low, care for you if you get sick\u2014stop you from doing stupid things. He should be worried, Ara. Not you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI guess I never thought of it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cNow\u2014\u201d Mike climbed out of bed, took my cup, and his warm, autumn eyes crinkled on the edges with his smile. \u201cGet some sleep. I\u2019ll see you in the morning for training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I snuggled down into the warmth Mike left behind. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet all the knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just as excited.\u201d He went to walk away then stopped. \u201cOh, and, Arthur wants to come watch you train, too\u2014he\u2019s eager to see your powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Should we let him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You tell me. You seem to be all buddy-buddy with him.\u201d Mike shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. If he is a mole, he won\u2019t attack now anyway. You just need to hurry up and figure out his plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has no plan, Mike,\u201d I said, rolling over. \u201cHe\u2019s opinionated, but he\u2019s not a mole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Mike blew out the flame in the lantern and closed my door.</p><p>My eyes stayed open, looking above me to the unspoilt sky through the glass dome. Across my room, the soft white curtains billowed in the summer breeze as it snuck through my open balcony door, blowing a gentle tickle of warm air across my nose and lips, like a goodnight kiss from the evening. I could hear the ocean in the distance now with the manor going quiet, room by room, all around me. It was peaceful, serene, but empty.</p><p>The walls seemed to swirl then, the open space narrowing me in to my own little world, and behind the loving eyes of the unknown man in the glass, sunlight suddenly shone through, making them sparkle, warming his whole smile. I smiled back at him as the light flooded down my walls, blotting out his face, my pillows, my dresser, until spring spread out around me\u2014my only cage the long grass, rising up past my shoulders and cheeks with the wet scent of soil and crushed daisies.</p><p>I slid my hand across the ground, knowing the boy next to me would reach out and wrap his fingers through mine.</p><p>\u201cCan you show me another?\u201d I asked, suddenly standing above this boy and girl, holding hands in the grass; the sun shone down, making the girl\u2019s yellow dress almost transparent, showing the outline of her thighs and hips in a shadow under the fabric.</p><p>The boy rolled up on his elbow, bringing his body closely alongside hers. \u201cI\u2019ve shown you so many already, Ara-Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShown you what?\u201d I asked, stepping closer.</p><p>She looked at me then, her blues eyes taking my breath as they reached right between my ribs, starting my heart. \u201cMemories,\u201d she said to me.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>She just smiled and looked back at Jason\u2014left behind in the realm of moments gone. \u201cWatch, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Dark sky swallowed us whole, taking Jason away again, leaving me alone in a windy clearing\u2014nothing but a stormy sky, the wide arms of our tree, and, in the distance, two boys\u2014running. A ring of light shone down onto the clearing over them, presenting their memory in daytime, while I stood on the cusp of dark and light.</p><p>\u201cDavid! Wait. I can\u2019t...\u201d The smaller boy folded over, dropping his hands to his dirt-covered knees. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d David called over his shoulder, laughing. \u201cThen I shall win\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>The boy tried to run for only a second more before flopping to the ground, tucked into a small ball, his shoulders lifting with each raspy, tight breath.</p><p>A shadow covered his face, taking the warmth of the sun, and he looked up, green eyes so bright, at his brother. \u201cWhat are you doing, Jason? Get up,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cGet...get Aunty.\u201d</p><p>But his brother only shook his head, his face lit with humour. He toed Jason\u2019s shoulder, rolling him onto his back. \u201cStop pretending. Arietta doesn\u2019t love you more because you\u2019re sick\u2014she only pities you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Jason reached up, his face going white around purple lips. \u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t bre\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather says it is God\u2019s will.\u201d David kicked Jason\u2019s hand away. \u201cHe says we should stop healing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother? Please?\u201d</p><p>But David backed away. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d Jason curled into a ball again, tucking his knees to his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to live, brother, perhaps you should pray.\u201d</p><p>But Jason didn\u2019t hear those words; his breath became short, shallow, as David walked away, disappearing into the glare of the sun.</p><p>I ran over and knelt beside the shuddering child. \u201cJason,\u201d I whispered, wishing I could be an entity of the past, reach out, touch him. But when he looked up suddenly, it was to a great, fluffy hound, licking his face, waking him from the drift of consciousness.</p><p>\u201cPetey?\u201d he said, wrapping his arm across the dog\u2019s neck. \u201cGet Aunty.\u201d</p><p>And Petey ran, bouncing over the fields faster than possible, barking, calling out for all who might be near.</p><p>When Jason opened his eyes again, the room was mostly dark, lit only by a fire burning nearby, while the softness of a mattress braced his tiny body. He looked up into the soulful blue eyes of a woman with honey blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d She touched his face.</p><p>\u201cAunty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she said, stroking his cheek over and over again. \u201cDon\u2019t try to speak, my love. Just rest. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and closed his eyes, but opened them quickly, revealing thoughts which took that sparkle from his soul. \u201cAunt Ari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweet boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true\u2014that I killed my mother?\u201d</p><p>Arietta paled, rising up slightly to lean right over Jason. \u201cWho said that to you?\u201d</p><p>The little boy looked away.</p><p>\u201cWas it your father?\u201d</p><p>His reluctance to say was all Arietta needed.</p><p>\u201cMy darling child, your mother died because the doctor couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding. She just didn\u2019t have enough strength to keep breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, if I had not been born, she would have lived. Father says she was smiling, happy, after David was born\u2014that she let go when I tried to enter the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jason\u2014\u201d Arietta couldn\u2019t find the words to make it all okay. I wondered if a part of her, too, believed this, or if maybe she was so horrified by this child\u2019s certainty of his existence destroying another\u2019s, that she couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cJason, your father was not even in the room when my sister passed. I was there. I saw her smile when the doctor told her there was another child. I saw her eyes light with joy for the fact that you would be born.\u201d She stroked his hair, her eyes touching every inch of his little face. \u201cOh, my sweet, sweet boy. She wanted nothing more than to hold you, I know this, because she was my sister, and we have the same heart\u2014\u201d She touched her chest. \u201cIf I love you this much, then she would have loved you just the same.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded into the cup of her hand, but I saw it in his eyes, that her truth couldn\u2019t change what was in his heart\u2014what he had been told since he was old enough to understand words.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry I can\u2019t stay here and be your mother, Jason. If your father would have me, I would not leave you at the end of the summer\u2014not ever, but\u2014\u201d She looked down, her eyes tearing. \u201cBut just know that, even though we can\u2019t be together, I never stop loving you\u2014or your brother.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, and when he opened them, watched tears fall between his fingertips, sinking through the blades of grass under his hands. Thunder made the day close in on him and the rain came down around his knees, over his shoulders, making the cold harsh and the pain go deeper. He swiped a hand across his nose, barely able to see the name on the headstone before him.</p><p>\u201cThis is the second woman our family has buried because of you.\u201d</p><p>Jason stood quickly and spun around to his brother\u2019s angered face. \u201cDavid, how can you say such things? I cannot be to blame for this.\u201d</p><p>The two thirteen-year-old versions of the twins stood face to face; one softened by grief, the other hardened, with hate-filled eyes barring his brother. \u201cYou tell yourself that, demon. Go ahead. If it eases your guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilt. Guilt for what? I ran. I told you this. I ran as fast as I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet it was not fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Jason reached out to gently clasp the lapel of David\u2019s coat. \u201cI will not be to blame. I could not have saved her if I\u2019d grown wings and flown to get uncle.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s stiff body seemed to shake, his lips tight, his nostrils flaring with each breath of hatred or grief or whatever he was carrying inside that made me take a step back. \u201cIt\u2019s not how fast you ran, brother; it\u2019s not how long it took you to bring Uncle\u2014it\u2019s your mere existence. You were never meant to be, and until your ashes are in this earth, balance can never be restored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that. And Arietta didn\u2019t believe that, either.\u201d</p><p>David looked at her grave, clenching his teeth so firmly his cheeks appeared hollow. \u201cShe could never see past your lies, and now she\u2019s dead. She is dead because you are an abomination.\u201d His arm shook, his finger aimed at the beastly creature across from him. \u201cBut I see you for what you are. I see you for what Father knew you were. As far as I\u2019m concerned, from this day forth, I have no brother,\u201d he said, not a shred of sympathy softening his rain-soaked face, and he backed away, leaving Jason to grieve the loss\u2014alone.</p><p>My heart saturated with sadness, but I couldn\u2019t allow it\u2014couldn\u2019t let pity change how I felt about either of them. I wanted to hate David as much as I wanted to fall beside Jason, as he sunk to the ground, and wrap my arms around him\u2014around his young self\u2014tell him everything would be okay. But it wouldn\u2019t. Not for him. From that day on, the one person who loved him, saw him as just a boy, would never lay eyes on him again, never lay a comforting hand to his cheek. He was alone now.</p><p>I backed away, too, my heart pounding in my chest.</p><p>He was truly all alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWalk with me.\u201d</p><p>I looked up suddenly to the other version of myself; she watched on to the scene before us, her eyes hollow, distant, like she wasn\u2019t aware she was beside me. But when she turned her head and looked directly into my eyes, I felt her presence, her sentience. I shuddered inside.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>She turned away, hugging her arms across her waist, her yellow dress falling softly around her knees, not blown by the wind that swept her hair. \u201cWalk with me,\u201d is all she said.</p><p>So I did. I followed her through the field, feeling the long grass between my toes, feeling every rock, every rise of soil touch the balls of my feet, while the warm wind did nothing to steal the chill radiating from her ghostly presence, like an icy cloth.</p><p>\u201cTell me where we\u2019re going,\u201d I called out.</p><p>\u201cTo find understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstanding? For what, who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to see.\u201d Her voice had a distant, resonating echo to it\u2014like she wasn\u2019t real, or the part of her that once had been, no longer was.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I need to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you loved him.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking, the world going dark, quiet all around me. \u201cThat love was never real. It was the spirit bind.\u201d</p> <p>When she stopped also, I felt the eerie weight of her madness creep across my shoulders; the very energy of her impatience made the air thick and heavy. \u201cThat is the lie you tell yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>She smiled conceitedly. \u201cThen why do you wish he never died?\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped; I took a few steps back. \u201cI wish no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I started walking away again. \u201cWe\u2019re all better off now he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that, then perhaps you\u2019re more like David than I wanted to imagine,\u201d she called out through the darkness.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you, like David, are no better than Drake.\u201d</p><p>I stopped again. \u201cDavid is nothing like Drake. How can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw his past. You saw the hate in his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a boy\u2014one who bullied his brother. He is nothing like Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you looked, but you did not see.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cEven if David was evil once, people are capable of change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you not feel that way for Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has done unspeakable things to my life!\u201d I stomped my foot. \u201cHe hurt David\u2014killed him. And maybe he isn\u2019t dead, but Jason never knew about immunity. He meant to kill him. He meant to end him. And I can\u2019t forgive that. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you forgive David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid never hurt me. David never did anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never hurt me!\u201d The girl appeared in front of me, teeth clenched, eyes suddenly black. \u201cBut where was he when I was in the dark\u2014when I was being hurt by Jason? Where was he when I was alone, where was he when Jason was binding me?\u201d Her voice strained. \u201cHe never did anything bad to us\u2014but he never did anything right by us, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I shook her icy, bony touch off my wrist. \u201cI have no feelings for Jason\u2014not after what he did to his own brother. So stop haunting me with his memories. I don\u2019t want to see them anymore.\u201d</p><p>She lashed out and grabbed my arm again as I turned away. \u201cHe never wanted anything in this world so bad as he wanted to hurt David, Ara. You saw what he suffered in his human life. Where is your compassion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have compassion for him. Not real compassion. He forged that when he came to me in my dream and had sex with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara. He didn\u2019t. He earned that compassion through his kindness, protection, and love for you.\u201d She stood with her arms by her sides, soaking from the sudden rain that came down in her world, but not mine. \u201cHe protected you. He hurt himself, hurt his own soul, then died for what he did to you in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe felt nothing for me then. It was all lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stepped forward. \u201cHe fell to the floor each time he left that chamber; he cried so hard for the way you begged him to stop. But if he had\u2014if he stopped, if he had not killed his brother, if he had not hurt you, they would have taken him away\u2014they would have handed you over to someone else, and he would never have been able to stop them from what they wanted to do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know?\u201d I screamed. \u201cYou\u2019re just a dream. You\u2019re me\u2014a part of me. You don\u2019t know what Jason felt. You can\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is true, then this is what you wish he felt. This is what you want to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. It\u2019s human nature to find a reason\u2014a connection.\u201d I turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s called Stockholm syndrome.\u201d</p><p>She only laughed loudly as I walked faster and faster, trying to detach myself from the drain her mere existence brought on my soul.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you walk away from me, Ara. You can\u2019t escape me. I\u2019ll keep bringing the memories until you see,\u201d she called after me. \u201cOne day\u2014you will see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is always the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the truth is\u2014\u201d her voice became smaller the greater distance I gained. \u201cThe real truth is, you\u2019re just afraid to love him because you don\u2019t want to grieve him, too.\u201d</p><p>I dared not turn back. She was wrong\u2014everything she said. This was just a nightmare\u2014words Arthur spoke, fear of what was to come and the deep hope I felt to be rescued while I was being tortured by Jason\u2014all rolling into one horrible dream. I had to wake up.</p><p>Wake up, Ara. Wake up!</p><p>\u201cTime to wake up, Princess Amara.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids popped open, the warm scent of toast and garlic filling my nostrils before daylight signed the registry of consciousness.</p><p>\u201cI trust you slept well,\u201d said a very unfamiliar voice; a tray appeared on my lap.</p><p>I looked down at a coffee cup and a plate of eggs and bacon, then sat up a little more. \u201cI...I was having a nightmare,\u201d I said before I could stop myself.</p><p>\u201cMay I enquire what it was about?\u201d The man showed his face then; kind eyes, aged, wrinkled skin and grey hair. Human.</p><p>\u201cOh, um. It was about being a queen, I think.\u201d I grabbed the fork and broke the yolk over my toast.</p><p>The old man smiled. \u201cThen, I do not feel so bad for waking you.\u201d He bowed. \u201cI am Edgar, your butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d He wandered over and opened my window, letting in the smell of wet grass and the hum of crashing waves, pleasantly accompanied by the resonance of a violin.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that coming from\u2014that music?\u201d</p><p>Edgar smiled. \u201cThat would be Arthur Knight, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and felt the notes in my heart. \u201cWhere is he? Is he in his room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. Shall I request he desist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, please don\u2019t. I like it\u2014\u201d I slipped my legs over the side of the bed, leaving the tray by my pillow. \u201cAsk him to wait for me, please? I\u2019d like to speak to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Edgar bowed slightly, then walked away, closing the door behind him.</p><p>I slipped into my light denim shorts and white tank top with the shoestring straps, then scuffed my toes into my flip-flops as I walked out the door, leaving my hair in the ponytail I\u2019d slept in. It would probably only get messier at training today anyway.</p><p>The lure of Arthur\u2019s music led me down the corridor by my ears, touching my soul like a warm hug, and the scent of garlic followed me out of my room, stealing the sweetness of summer rain outside. As I neared his open door, the music wrapped around me, daylight disappearing in the depths of his dark room; I could just make out the edge of his four-poster bed to the right and one column of pale light shining through a window beside a fireplace. Arthur stood on the other side, his body framed by the shadows behind the closed curtains of the second window. I stood in the doorway, wriggling my toes, unsure if I should enter, but so lost in the perfection of his every note that I likely couldn\u2019t walk anyway.</p><p>His whole body moved with the flow; his forearm swinging with each stroke of the bow across the strings; his head rolling, taking his body through the soul of the song. I could only just see the side of his face from the small pillar of light, showing the contour of his cheek and the corner of his eye, but it was enough to see the smile he wore there. I smiled too as he lowered the violin, the song ending before I wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Arthur.\u201d I crossed my arms and leaned on the doorframe, watching him place his violin in its case on the table.</p><p>\u201cI hope my playing did not disturb you.\u201d He snapped the case shut then turned around to face me.</p><p>\u201cNo. But that would be a sound I could wake to happily anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I shall play for you at every sunrise.\u201d</p><p>We smiled at each other across the room.</p><p>\u201cPlease, do come in, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Unlike the hesitation I always felt to enter Mike\u2019s room these days, I felt none walking into Arthur\u2019s. I wandered over and took his hand, smiling when he kissed it. The smell of rosemary and mint, and the dry parch of ash from a fireplace not lit for a long time filled my nostrils. My head turned instantly to the scatter of plants and herbs all over the box seat, sitting neatly in the cove of the window.</p><p>\u201cThe song I was playing, you know it, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s the same one in my music box\u2014the one David gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho composed it?\u201d</p><p>He leaned on the heavy wooden table and folded his arms. \u201cVampirie.\u201d</p><p>I felt privileged then, felt a kind of intimacy that comes from knowing a secret no one else knows. Just the notes of that song were so wondrous, so ancient\u2014written so long ago, in a time before pianos, in a time before great composers like Mozart, who would have given anything to hear such a masterpiece\u2014to hear notes arranged in a way no mortal had ever thought to try. And here I was, just a girl of the twenty first century, not a historian or a person of any great importance, and yet, I had been privileged enough to know such a tune\u2014a story that came from a place before time.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask\u2014\u201d Arthur turned to me, \u201c\u2014who taught you the words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You sung them once, I was told, when...the day David died.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, blinking. \u201cI...I don\u2019t remember doing that. Did I really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His gaze dropped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell, how would I know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA question, my lady, I had hoped you might answer.\u201d</p><p>I wandered over to his window and rested my head where the bricks cornered outward, forming a cosy nook around the box seat. Outside, a rainy sky darkened the greens, making the hedge labyrinth, the garden that looked like a chessboard and the forest border look richly coloured\u2014something toned by enhancing the hues artificially. \u201cDid Jason know the song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. Why do you ask?\u201d Arthur said, and light filled the room behind me, coming through the window as Arthur opened the curtains on the other side of the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he taught me the words.\u201d I smiled at his memory.</p><p>\u201cWhen would he have done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a dream. Many dreams.\u201d My arms tightened around myself, my distracted gaze, full of thought, on the day below.</p><p>\u201cDreams, you say.\u201d There was a fondness to Arthur\u2019s voice. \u201cHe called them mind-links.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I like to think of them as dreams.\u201d So they don\u2019t seem so real.</p><p>\u201cThen he came to you other times, aside from when he bound you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. I knew I probably shouldn\u2019t trust Arthur with this, especially since Mike and Morgaine didn\u2019t even know, but something in my heart told me he would keep this secret for me.</p><p>\u201cWas he kind to you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, letting my head fall softly against the bricks again after.</p><p>\u201cI never believed he did not love you.\u201d He stood beside me, smiling down at the rainy day; I looked up at him, tilting my head slightly since he was that bit taller, like David. \u201cHe had the council convinced his affections were a ploy, but I never believed it.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He needed you to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was how he felt,\u201d I said, but even as the words left my mouth, I didn\u2019t feel the meaning in them I usually did. Arthur knew that, too. It was in his smile. \u201cWas Jason sick as a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d I nodded, not really feeling like I was in the room\u2014still standing on the cusp of my last dream. \u201cHe showed me memories.\u201d</p><p>Arthur cleared his throat. \u201cYes, he was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...Jason was four when his father saw fit to punish him for speaking out of turn by leaving him on the doorstep for the night, like an ill-mannered pup.\u201d The anger from hundreds of years passed remained in his undertone. \u201cThe boy was near death by morning. He came down with the fever and was not predicted to last the winter. But he did, and when spring came, he showed promising signs, but was never quite the same again. His lungs were weak\u2014his body, even the poor boy\u2019s soul.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd where were you while he was being neglected and abused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning the Set,\u201d he said factually. \u201cI returned that morning to find Jason pale, burning with fever, shaking under a thin blanket a maid had placed over him in the early hours of dawn. I swept him up in my arms and, once he was stable, gave his father a beating parts of his body never recovered from.\u201d He walked away then, taking to the other window. I watched him for a moment, seeing the weight of what his nephew suffered bearing down on him, even so far into the future. \u201cThe laws I live by, Amara, prevented I should stay with them, and it haunted me each time I left, for I knew I would return to more stories of horror. But I had no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice.\u201d</p> <p>He only looked up from the window and smiled at me, a conceited smile. \u201cI will forgive that, Princess, because you do not know Drake\u2014the promise I made to him in my own blood\u2014nor do you understand fear of cruel punishment.\u201d</p><p>I turned away and looked back out the window. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Arthur. I don\u2019t mean to imply you didn\u2019t care for them. It just makes me angry to think of what they went through. And I never understood it before, but it makes so much sense now\u2014the way David is\u2014was.\u201d Oops.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so guarded, you know. He never really let me in.\u201d</p><p>I heard Arthur sigh. \u201cHis childhood was something he tried to push aside. It wasn\u2019t that he kept it from you, but that he wished to forget.\u201d</p> <p>And that just made my heart bleed for him\u2014for both boys, actually. \u201cWhy did Jason show me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dealt with grief by talking about it. He was always a very scientifically-minded young lad\u2014had to find reasoning for most things in life, including the actions others took against him.\u201d Arthur\u2019s presence warmed my side before I saw him slowly appear next to me. \u201cHe told me once that he learned more about himself and the reasons he felt the agony of his suffering, by hearing other people talk about their own trials.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he showed me\u2014because I\u2019d suffered so much. Maybe he was trying to help me deal with my suffering, do you think, by showing me what he\u2019d come through?\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s lips turned down with thought. \u201cPerhaps. Or perhaps he wanted you to understand his brother\u2014to know what you had gotten yourself into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by gotten myself into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose close to David knew a different side to him.\u201d Arthur looked down at his clasped hands. \u201cI feared for you when David told me he was in love with a sweet, human girl. I wondered on what twisted version of this planet God would allow such a match, but it seemed you brought out the best in him, not the worst.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what was the worst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant, my dear. Not now. I\u2019m just thankful you loved the side of David I knew was in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved all of him.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cI did see another side to him, from time to time,\u201d I added, thinking about the day he nearly exploded over Pepper. \u201cBut he loved me, Arthur, and he was never harsh or cruel to me. I can\u2019t believe there were two versions of him; this cruel boy who tormented his brother, and this sweet, loving boy who carried my books at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are two sides to anything in life, my dear. One does not have to understand to love, but must love to understand.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head a little, a sarcasm-littered smirk twisting my lips. \u201cDo you make those up on the spot?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me, growing taller. \u201cMake what up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose lines? You could write quotes for the Dalai Lama.\u201d I laughed lightly.</p><p>He gave a kind smile. \u201cI came up with a good one this morning. Would you like to hear it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, pulling a pretend pencil from behind my ear to hold over an imaginary notepad. \u201cLet me just jot it down.\u201d</p><p>Arthur cleared his throat. \u201cThe branch of hatred is always grown from the seeds of greed and jealousy.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my imaginary note-takers. \u201cMeh, not that good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, how \u2018bout, \u2018One cannot teach what must be learned\u2014in order to give advice, you must be telling a person something they, deep down, already know.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d My eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good. Very true.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that what you do all day? Just sit around and dream up quotable quotes.\u201d</p><p>His lip lifted on one corner with an easy grin. \u201cNo. I\u2019m an Herbalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee those plants there?\u201d He pointed to his window.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grow them, not to look pretty in the light of the sun, but to use for medicinal purposes, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they have other uses, but my main area of focus is vampire medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you a doctor?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head once. \u201cI was. A long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was human. I\u2019ve not practiced human medicine in my vampire existence, though\u2014only herbology for vampire treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So, does that work\u2014you know, the whole mystical, alternative medicine thing?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes. In vampires, it does. I cannot speak for humans, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I mean, why don\u2019t you treat humans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had the need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even with Jason\u2014when he was sick?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI would not have presumed to interfere with matters I knew nothing of. It had been many centuries since I was versed in the biology of the human body. To treat him may have been to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised David didn\u2019t ask you to treat him in that case, since he hated him so much.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, the daylight making shadows around his soft smile. \u201cI sometimes wondered if much of David\u2019s hatred for his brother was merely jealousy.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOh, definitely\u2014as adults, anyway. I mean, I don\u2019t know about when they were kids, but David even admitted he was jealous his brother could read vampire minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d Arthur bounced on his toes once then sunk back down, seeming lighter. \u201cThen he truly was a changed man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged, huh?\u201d I said to myself. \u201cWas David really that bad? You talk like he was some kind of monster.\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked down, cupping his hands behind his back. \u201cNot a monster. He was good and kind, but had a manner about him that people did not mess with\u2014not even those who loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the good, kind man would become...something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see that side of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. However, I was not once the target of his infuriation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a figure of authority\u2014almost like a father. David\u2019s interactions, his respect for me, differed to those who were peers or subordinates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, people were afraid of him?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded once.</p><p>\u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and there are many stories I could tell, my dear, to make you see, but I\u2019ll not speak ill of the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure if David could go back, he\u2019d do things differently\u2014especially with Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Arthur reached for my hand, holding it until I looked at him, his bright-blue eyes softening. \u201cHe did love his brother\u2014David. For all they fought, I know, deep in his heart, he never felt what his father did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did his father hate Jason so much?\u201d</p><p>Arthur straightened. \u201cHe lost his wife. She went into her room to give birth, and when the doctor opened the door, he handed Thomas two boys and a firm hand of apology. That was that. She was breathing one minute, gone the next. And there were few advances in medical science to confirm the cause of her death. He was left to believe myths, wives-tales, uneducated ideas that ruined the heart of this man, because he loved his wife so deeply he could not find reason why God would take her, except that it was the devil\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo, it\u2019s like David told me\u2014Thomas believed Jason was the devil\u2019s incision of David\u2019s soul\u2014all the bad things in one boy?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cAnd, sadly, Jason never pitied himself this. He believed he was responsible for killing Elizabeth\u2014never questioned it.\u201d</p><p>I thought of a little boy; green eyes, dark hair, so small, playing quietly by a fire. Perhaps he felt content, perhaps he felt no evil in his soul, and often wondered how he could have done such terrible things before he had even taken his first breath. But this was what they told him. This was what he was. \u201cIt\u2019s not true, is it\u2014he wasn\u2019t evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, there was no more evil in that child than there was love.\u201d Arthur\u2019s head rolled down a little, a tight breath leaving his nostrils. \u201cJason, somehow, was perceived the adversary at every turn, but the true monster was that which created his fury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me. \u201cIn the beginning, yes, but when David and Jason became men, I often wondered if Thomas\u2019 own soul had taken the heart from David\u2014lived on in him. And in the end...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason was the monster.\u201d</p><p>Arthur was taken aback, but softened quickly, nodding. \u201cThen they both were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not David. I know he regretted everything. I know he was sorry for how he treated Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I looked away from Arthur. \u201cNothing. David never talked with me about it, but I saw it in his eyes once, when I mentioned Jason\u2014I saw the pain of regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you forgive David for the way he treated Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to forgive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it not\u2014when everything you suffered began from the seed of David\u2019s hatred?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a hard lump in my throat. \u201cThen, yes, I guess I do forgive him. I guess I forgave him a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have no forgiveness in your heart for Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter? He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs is David, but you feel the need to justify what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd from that, you understand him.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe had a good heart, Arthur\u2014despite what he did to his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we all contain good. But good is beheld only until loneliness manifests itself for too long in the hurt and the broken. Jason started out good, and died doing what was right. You cannot rightly love one beast and deny the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne beast killed my husband\u2014the other didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, venom killed your husband. Jason was merely the subject who was ordered to oversee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have said no. He could\u2019ve let someone else do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would have had your cheeks sliced open for disobeying when you refused to bite David.\u201d</p><p>My mind flashed back to that room\u2014to David, on his knees, an inch away from death at my hands. I shuddered.</p><p>\u201cThe fact remains\u2014sometimes, good people must do bad things. Jason was good; David was good.\u201d Arthur looked away. \u201cAnd I will never fill the emptiness their absence has left in my heart.\u201d</p><p>I realised then, that the question of my love and forgiveness for these two men was not a question for me at all, but for himself. \u201cYou wonder if you should love them\u2014after what they\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have asked myself that question.\u201d He nodded. \u201cAnd the answer is always, that which does not deserve love, perhaps needed it the most.\u201d</p><p>The sparkle of tears in his eyes made me want to tell him, right then, that his nephew was still alive\u2014that he need not grieve him. But, for the sake of a stupid prophecy and the belief of my private council that he was a traitor, I had to let this man suffer. We talked about good versus bad, but I wondered if, by allowing him to grieve someone who was not dead, it made us the monsters.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t question yourself, Arthur, for loving them. One thing I\u2019ve learned, through all those I loved and lost, is you don\u2019t get to choose what your heart feels. It runs by a set of its own rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, it does.\u201d He reached out and took my hand. \u201cAnd you are too young to have this wisdom. It saddens my heart, the things you have suffered to be able to conclude such philosophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I squeezed his hand, thankful for the warmth of friendship I felt with him. \u201cWe find new people to love, and make our lives about them, right?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that. \u201cThis is also true. A piece of wisdom, I believe, my David taught you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled widely; it felt nice to know someone who knew him like I did\u2014who loved him, too. \u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a boy of many thoughts, himself. Shared very little with others, though. You were the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I took a deep breath and rubbed my temples then, as the day ahead entered my mind.</p><p>\u201cIs something else troubling you, young princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a headache. It\u2019s only mild, but I have them so often now I feel like a new person when I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He moved suddenly, but I felt him behind me; the length of his body close to mine, as he cupped one hand around my ponytail, gently sliding my hairtie down the silky lengths until it all came loose. \u201cBetter?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Heaps better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, and each strand tingled along the base of my neck, my forehead and behind my ears, his deft fingers separating then twisting them into a loose plait. \u201cYou need to tie it up for training, or you may end up getting your head pinned to the ground by some knight\u2019s knee. But this should be enough.\u201d</p><p>I turned when he finished, and ran my fingers down the plait, resting it over my shoulder. \u201cThanks, Arthur.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are welcome, my dear.\u201d He stood a little taller and his eyes narrowed as he looked into the gardens. \u201cYou best be going. Someone is looking for you.\u201d</p><p>He looked small from this high up, that knightly figure charging across the grounds, but his bulk frame and hair shining yellow in the morning light could not be mistaken for any other man. \u201cI\u2019m late for training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks irate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably is. He\u2019s probably gonna make me run laps until I fall over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Arthur said, offering the doorway, \u201cwe best be moving then. Can\u2019t have you being punished for my keeping you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the laps I\u2019m afraid of\u2014\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLecture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout...\u201d Being alone with you. \u201cAbout being late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can charm your way out of a lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know Mike very well, then,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019s resistant to my charms.\u201d</p><p>As I turned away, Arthur grabbed my wrist gently. \u201cTake care out there today, Princess. I will drop by to watch you train later, but, in the meantime, keep your wits about you\u2014watch closely for anyone who watches you too closely and do not spar with any knight you feel you can\u2019t trust.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you worried there\u2019s a mole?\u201d I almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat, I am.\u201d He released my wrist. \u201cOnce I arrive, you needn\u2019t worry too much, but I have a few things to take care of before I come down. Just be careful, please.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMike will be there. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Arthur seemed amused by that. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>I closed his door behind me and after four steps, enough to be directly in the middle of the corridor again and not so close to looking like I was alone with Arthur, Mike popped around the corner. \u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, where have you been? I sent my knights up to collect you over an hour ago. Edgar told them you were getting dressed, but now they report back that you\u2019re not even in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the shower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra, they looked in there.\u201d He smiled conceitedly. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went down to the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Arthur\u2019s door then back at me. \u201cKitchen, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I pushed past him. \u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well what my problem is.\u201d He grabbed my arm, stopping me as I reached the stairwell. \u201cI told you not to spend time alone with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me, Ara. I know you were in his room. I can smell him all over you.\u201d</p><p>I shrunk a little. \u201cWell, I can do what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can\u2014except be alone with him.\u201d</p><p>I yanked my arm from his grip. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me from having friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, grow up. I\u2019m not trying to stop you from having friends, but you know we can\u2019t trust him. He was Drake\u2019s right hand man for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a mole, Mike,\u201d I yelled, loud enough that Arthur probably heard. \u201cHe just wants to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike laughed sarcastically. \u201cHelp himself\u2014to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? Don\u2019t be such a jerk.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his arms to his sides, huffing loudly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that guy. He waltzes in here like he owns the place\u2014tells me how to do my job, how to look after you, then wanders off with you and keeps you to himself all afternoon. I\u2019m your best friend, and I waited so long to have you here, and now you are, I\u2019m practically barred from seeing you, but those rules don\u2019t apply to him.\u201d</p><p>I clicked my tongue, folding my bottom lip in an exaggerated pout. \u201cAw, poor baby\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>His mouth split into a grin, laughter coming out in one breath. \u201cQuiet, you, or I\u2019ll pair with you for sparring and give you a right smack on the bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Good luck. I\u2019m faster than you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and took my hand. \u201cCome on, how \u2018bout I show you this training hall I\u2019ve been talking about for the last two months.\u201d</p><p>Mike walked beside me, and the soft rain fell around us, making the countryside smell sweet, like cut grass and sugar. My mouth watered. It was a little colder on the coast for a summer, though, than it was inland. I wrapped my arms around myself to hide from the breeze as we stepped out of the trees and into a grassy clearing.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s training been going with Emily over the last few weeks?\u201d Mike asked from a step or two ahead. \u201cShe told me you\u2019ve become quite a little expert with a sword.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cA bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2018spose the ballet classes help there\u2014given that fencing\u2019s really a balance and grace thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Or just that I\u2019m super cool.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s see how you do with a gun then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gun? We have guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenom-filled bullets. Vampires are fast, but even they can\u2019t stop venom infecting them if they don\u2019t catch the bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. When do we get the guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn about a month or so. I\u2019m putting a team of marksmen together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. Do I get firearms training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ninety-eight percent accuracy on Halo does not give you the same skill out here in the real world. And besides, your dad would kill me if I put a gun in your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of my dad? We have a blood-hungry psychopath after us, and you\u2019re afraid of my dad?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cAra, you know what it\u2019s like to sit under the glare of his disappointment.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cAnd you think I have daddy issues.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBaby, you do have daddy issues.\u201d</p><p>Hmpf! I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, back to the issue at hand\u2014stop distracting me,\u201d he warned, with a smile. \u201cHow are you going with the speed thing? Emily said you\u2019d pretty much taken a step backward\u2014so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I get dizzy.\u201d I rubbed my head. \u201cI tried to flip out of Emily\u2019s reach the other day and ended up in the lake\u2014saturated.\u201d</p><p>Mike burst out laughing, covering his nose for a second. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</p><p>Heat washed over my head, rising from the chest up. \u201cI asked her not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the full story of your sparring with David, though. He talked you up a bit, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he just went easy on me.\u201d</p><p>He held back his amusement. \u201cI know. Well, so we need to work on your combat methods with vampires, but, today you can spar with humans, so it should be a piece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I need a self-esteem boost, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can all use a little encouragement sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy fighting those weaker than us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeaker than you,\u201d he said, and laughed. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be so sure you\u2019ll win, baby. These guys might be human, but they\u2019re Special Ops, most of them. They\u2019re damn good at what they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, joy,\u201d I said. It felt good to be walking outside with Mike again, in the open air of the cool, shady day. It reminded me of bush walking back home in Oz. And Mike had a bounce to his step when walking on uneven ground, like he laid his foot down heavily, not calculating the surface at all. It was so human, so unlike David, who was so used to walking with the grace of a vampire he couldn\u2019t even pretend to be as clumsy as a human anymore. Mike hadn\u2019t lost that yet, and I really appreciated that about him right now.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know when we drove in on the driveway that leads to the manor?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter or before the big, scary gates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a side road that takes you down to the training hall, and in the distance, about two minutes Lilithian-style run, is the barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you spend all your time?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he beamed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the weather today,\u201d I noted, looking at the murky sky. \u201cIt was so sunny yesterday\u2014what\u2019s with all this rain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmp,\u201d Mike laughed softly. \u201cProbably to do with your mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Haven\u2019t you ever noticed how, when you\u2019re sad or upset or angry, actually, even happy\u2014not that that happens often\u2014the weather seems to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what, like I\u2019m a mood-stone?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI know you\u2019re moo-dy. But, I don\u2019t know, I was thinking about it a few days ago\u2014it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve noticed since I first came to America to stay with you. It\u2019s not all the time, which is why I thought nothing of it \u2018til now. But it seems to be happening more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you to notice something so trivial,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>Mike laughed again, placing a supportive hand to my lower back as we splodged down a mildly slippery slope of grass. \u201cWhen it comes to you, my pretty little princess, it\u2019s my job to notice everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll pay that\u2014but the weather? That\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say it made sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019d be cool. If we want a sunny day, we\u2019ll just bring David out to the manor.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and right at that moment, the sun shone down on a building in the distance, lighting up its red roof and white bricks.</p><p>Mike stopped walking, his brow lifting over a smug grin. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cCoincidence.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly and we started walking again. \u201cSo, that building under the spotlight of your joy\u2014\u201d he paused; I rolled my eyes. \u201cIs the training hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look big enough to hold five hundred fighting soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for the entire Core. We train the Queen\u2019s Guard there. The rest train at the barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how many are in there right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire Guard. Fifty men of the highest skill and qualification. They stand watch around the manor to protect the queen and only the queen. The rest of the Core are having the morning off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who are the four knights you always talk about\u2014Blade and Falcon and that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your Private Guard. Personally appointed to be by your side at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I stopped walking. \u201cAt all times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, Mike. I don\u2019t need that kind of protection. I\u2019m not the goddamn president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, exactly. You\u2019re the queen\u2014of a nation of killers, Ara. You need to be protected at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t. I need to live, Mike. I\u2019m not having those guys follow me around everywhere I go. Especially not here at the manor. We\u2019re heavily guarded enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d He kept walking.</p><p>\u201cMike? I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike!\u201d I ran after him. \u201cDamn it! You better not have them follow me.\u201d But it was stupid to even say that. Of course he would, and once those men were turned into Lilithian knights, there\u2019d be no knowing if they were following me.</p><p>\u201cNervous,\u201d Mike said, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not in my bad books, Michael.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the warmth of his sexy grin making his whole face cuter. \u201cI really don\u2019t care, Amara-Rose. You will do as you\u2019re told. Like it or not. So you can chuck a tantrum, go ahead, it won\u2019t change things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t need to throw a tantrum.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cI\u2019ll find some other way to make your life hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathing pretty much covers that,\u201d he joked, and I scoffed. We walked past the tall windows of the rectangle building then, but couldn\u2019t see inside because the white glare of the sun reflected back the image of a short girl walking through a grassy field beside a bulky man.</p><p>He led me around to the front of the building, still smiling smugly, not saying anything. As we stood by the open entrance\u2014about four doors wide\u2014I took a breath to steady my heart.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shuffled my feet, my gaze on my shoes.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He took my hand; I looked up at his caramel eyes. \u201cYou know I was joking, right\u2014about the annoying me by breathing thing?\u201d</p><p>I let my shoulders relax a little, smiling. \u201cCourse I do, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong then? Why have you got that pouting lip?\u201d He ran the tip of his finger over it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just nervous, I think. You know what I\u2019m like in public.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on mine. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be here with you. And don\u2019t think of them as strangers\u2014think of them as family. We\u2019re all very close. In fact\u2014\u201d he looked into the room behind him, then grinned, \u201c\u2014we have a bonfire night coming up. Maybe you should come. It\u2019d be a good chance for you to get to know some of the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Am I allowed to go to things like that, you know, Core gatherings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, baby, of course you can. You\u2019re still my best friend. I\u2019d love to have you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Cool. I\u2019ll come then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He grinned and tugged me along to the openness of the doors, right where everyone would be able to see me. My heart told my lungs to take faster breaths, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. \u201cWait here a sec.\u201d He dropped my hand and walked forward; I waited in the shadows under the eaves. \u201cAtteeention!\u201d he said, standing straight and tall; a unified clap echoed off the bare walls as the men stomped one foot to the ground, dropping their arms to their sides.</p><p>My lips twitched with the urge to laugh at the seriousness on all of their faces.</p><p>\u201cMen?\u201d Mike called out. \u201cWe have trained hard. We have sweat blood\u2014\u201d he pointed to someone at the back of the room, \u201c\u2014and there have even been some tears. But what you have worked towards is finally here. I present to you, my friend and your future queen\u2014Princess Amara.\u201d</p> <p>I stepped into the room and it grew bigger as the space from hip height up emptied, each man dropping to one knee, slapping a fist over his heart. And I became smaller, not really sure what to do. \u201cUm, hi.\u201d I waved clumsily, instantly wanting to slap myself.</p><p>\u201cAt ease, men,\u201d Mike said loudly, then looked at me.</p><p>The room crowded again as they stood tall, eyes forward\u2014on me.</p><p>With each step Mike took, pacing the floors, addressing the men about the day\u2019s training activities, I tried to step behind him, staying out of sight. I caught the gaze of a few men, who gave a soft nod or a small smile of what I assumed was reassurance. I felt ridiculous, but watching them, the way they responded to Mike\u2019s orders, the way they stood, the very manner of the room, I realised that this was real to them. I\u2019d never really stopped to think about it, but the truth was, I was their future queen. To them it was something regal, something magnificent\u2014to me, it was like someone stole my life and was telling me how to live it. But these guys were here, offering their lives in service of what they believed to be real\u2014to protect something important to a lot of people. I suddenly didn\u2019t feel so ridiculous. I started imagining each one with Lilithian power, wondering what special gift they might have\u2014if any at all.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Mike clapped his hands together. \u201cBreak up into groups of six. I want three-on-three sparring.\u201d The room came alive then with the sudden movement of fifty men, and the noise rose up between the mirrors on the walls, bouncing off the hard wood floors, filling the room with more energy than my headache could handle. I rubbed my temples until Mike pulled my hand away. \u201cCome on. Time to meet your Private Guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I half walked, half looked over my shoulder at all the men, dispersed to every corner of the room, lining up sparring mats and grabbing swords from holders on the walls. They all just looked so cool. Like my very own video game, but with real blood. \u201cAre they allowed to cut each other like that?\u201d</p> <p>Mike looked behind him. \u201cYou only get cut if you\u2019re fooling around. These guys are trained to attack and block. They get cut, it\u2019s their own fault.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened in horror.</p><p>\u201cAra, relax. We don\u2019t usually have too many casualties. They spar fair and aim not to cut\u2014for now. That\u2019ll change soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these four, fine men here\u2014\u201d We stopped in a mirrored section at the end of the room, where four men waited in a line; their hands behind their backs, chins slightly lifted, feet set apart, \u201c\u2014are your Private Guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, giving a friendly wave, this time not so awkward.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you by name. Step forward as I address you. Ryder.\u201d</p><p>The first man marched up, stomping his foot down hard, then clapped his arms to his sides.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said; he nodded once, looking away quickly.</p><p>\u201cQuaid,\u201d Mike said, and the next man came to stand in line with the first; he was shorter than Ryder, but bulkier across the shoulders, with short, shaggy hair and black skin.</p><p>I nodded at Quaid when our eyes met for a second before he looked away.</p><p>\u201cThis guy is Falcon,\u201d Mike announced, and the man took a step toward us; he had a strong jaw, square, covered with a slight brush of sandy stubble, like a broader, more serious version of Mike. I didn\u2019t even bother trying to greet him, because he looked like he\u2019d sooner lecture me than say hello.</p><p>When the last man stepped forward and planted his hands behind his back, he smiled at me, winking as he did. He had a cheeky grin, the kind that always got me into trouble, while his shaved hair matched his black eyes perfectly.</p><p>\u201cThis is Blade.\u201d Mike clapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBlade?\u201d I said.</p><p>The four men turned their heads slightly to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014it\u2019s just a strange name,\u201d I stammered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nickname,\u201d Mike said, and all the men cast their eyes forward again.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I looked directly at the last knight. \u201cWhy Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to handle one pretty well,\u201d Blade said, his English accent knocking a breath of surprise from me.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re from England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce.\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do before you came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack Ops.\u201d He grinned, running a hand over his hair. \u201cI was kind of their secret weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I nodded then turned to Mike. \u201cWay to go, Chief\u2014good team.\u201d I looked back at Blade then. \u201cSo, they won\u2019t miss you, will they? At your old job?\u201d</p><p>Blade laughed. \u201cDoubt it, Princess. I went a little rogue\u2014had a contract out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath warrant,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>My eyes widened, but I smiled when Blade brushed it off with an ultra cool shrug.</p><p>\u201cSo, then, what do you mean by you went rogue?\u201d</p><p>Mike took me by the arm and led me away from the men. \u201cNot rogue in the way you think, baby. He\u2019s a good guy\u2014follows orders, but not when he deems them unethical.\u201d</p><p>I grinned widely. \u201cExactly the kind of guy we need, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I hoped you\u2019d say that.\u201d Mike looked back at the guys for a second, lowering his voice. \u201cIf I had to pick any one of these men to fight for you, it\u2019d be him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he that good?\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cGood isn\u2019t really the right word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then\u2014\u201d I spun slowly in a circle, taking in the now shirtless, sweaty surrounds of my knights, \u201c\u2014guess we better start training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard her, men.\u201d Mike clapped his hands together loudly and my four knights broke apart, lifting their shirts off or wrapping their wrists in black tape. \u201cTake your shoes off, baby, or you\u2019ll trip over.\u201d He motioned down to my flip-flops.</p><p>I kicked my feet out of them and felt shorter without the whole millimetre of height they added. \u201cSo, what exactly do you teach them here? Why are those guys all sitting down looking at that whiteboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being briefed on an external training op, but, aside from fighting skills and fitness, we actually teach the history of our people, so the Core have a clear idea where we\u2019ve come from and what we hope to achieve.\u201d He went to walk away but stopped. \u201cOh, and we also teach human skills, too\u2014like how a vampire can blend in with the humans, you know, how not to break a hand when shaking, how to make quick exits in awkward situations and the ins and outs of identity change. And there\u2019re a few guys who don't speak English, so we have language classes, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cSo where are their uniforms?\u201d I nodded toward one of the guys wearing black sweats and a black t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t train in uniform usually, but even if I wanted them to dress formally today to meet their princess, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I had the knights in uniform last month when she came to visit and she nearly died at the sight of them\u2014said there is no way her best friend\u2019s army is going to walk around in clothes they stripped off King Arthur\u2019s corpse.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud. \u201cOh, I love that girl. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike chuckled. \u201cSo, she actually designed the new get-up. It\u2019s been approved already and we\u2019re shipping them out as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShipping? From where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweden. The Ninth Order should be getting them today, but ours will take another week or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Not a big rush anyway, right. I mean, what do they need uniforms for? It\u2019s all a little silly, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Mike glared at me. \u201cThis is not some joke, Ara\u2014a bunch of guys getting together to play dress-up. This is an army, and when you unite a group of people together for one greater purpose, order, uniformity and respect must be an adamant part of that collection. Wearing an outfit that represents who you are and what you work for is a matter of pride\u2014not some ridiculous gesture by a guy who wants to play pretend.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open. \u201cMike? What happened to you\u2014you\u2019re all...grown up.\u201d</p><p>A warm, mischievous grin turned one corner of his mouth. \u201cYes, Ara. I have to be. I\u2019m the man responsible to defend the most valuable thing in all of our lives\u2014\u201d he winked at me, \u201c\u2014our freedom.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, patting his arm. \u201cAnd you are the best man for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded and wandered over to a table of weapons.</p><p>\u201cUm, so, I get that you\u2019re using venom-tipped swords, and all, and maybe this is a stupid question, but, wouldn\u2019t it just be easier to bite the vamps instead of doing all this weapons training and stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese guys will need those weapons, Ara.\u201d He presented the greater mass of the knights. \u201cWe\u2019re only turning the four knights in your personal guard into what I am. The rest, I\u2019m going to turn when it\u2019s time. So, we need weapons training because their bite won\u2019t kill vamps. The only way will be with venom-tipped swords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So, I don\u2019t have to bite all of them?\u201d I asked, pointing to the group of giant, well-toned men.</p><p>Mike smiled softly. \u201cNo. We don\u2019t need fifty men that can kill vampires. Me and the four Private Guard should do.\u201d</p><p>I bounced my head with approval. \u201cSmart thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was actually Morgaine\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are those swords tipped yet?\u201d I pointed to the table.</p><p>Mike slid a long, silver, very heavy-looking piece of metal out of the pile and smoothed his fingers down it. \u201cNo. We keep those ones in the armoury. This one\u2019s for training purposes only. We never, ever keep venom-tipped swords in the training hall, Ara, and if one even got in here by mistake, someone would be in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that Asian guy over there?\u201d He pointed to the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cI see about twelve Asian guys over there.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWell, anyway, one of our knights is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I have several more\u2014guys I trust, who are joining the Core this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, no venom-tipped swords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and no biting.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He gently tossed the sword to me. It spun through the air, handle driving a path, and my hand shot up to catch it, nearly taking me backward with the force I used\u2014way too much for such a light piece of metal. \u201cStill not used to all this strength, huh?\u201d Mike laughed, taking a sword of his own.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I smiled and looked down the blade, feeling its weight in my hands, light, like it was a strangely-shaped broomstick. \u201cSo, how do you make the venom stay on the tip? Wouldn\u2019t it wear off after two jabs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Have you actually looked at venom, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s thick\u2014like blood. When it dries, it doesn\u2019t lose its potency. If we coloured it blue and wiped it all over this blade, when it dried, you\u2019d still see blue, and like salt, it sticks around in tiny particles. You only need the smallest amount to touch their bloodstream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when the sword gets really bloody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just lubricates the dried venom and makes it act faster. I haven\u2019t tested, but we reckon you could get about a hundred kills from each sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cool. Well, there are only about a thousand vampires in existence, isn\u2019t there, so that should be fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it. Now\u2014\u201d He grabbed my fingers and tightened my grip on the sword. \u201cI wanna see how you handle yourself with this thing. Don\u2019t drop it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cI can probably handle this thing better than you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHa!\u201d He turned away and handed his sword to Falcon while he took off his shirt. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I hoped I could handle it. So far, I\u2019d only used wooden swords\u2014no one being brave enough to stick sharp metal in my hands and let me come at them. And this was heavier and shaped differently than the wooden ones\u2014the handle thicker, a little slippery in my fingers.</p><p>Mike folded his arms, standing beside the four knights, wearing a smug grin, and said, \u201cOkay, Ara, take combat position.\u201d</p> <p>I planted my heels to the ground and bent my knees, balancing the weight of the sword by angling my elbow on a slight tilt inward.</p><p>\u201cFeet further apart.\u201d Mike pointed to my legs; I shifted them.</p><p>\u201cChin up.\u201d Falcon walked over and stood behind me, lifting my face with his fingertip.</p><p>\u201cAnd be on your guard,\u201d Blade said in his smooth English accent as he stood beside Mike and pointed his sword at me.</p><p>Smiling, I scanned the scene; three men in front of me, one to the side, and one I could feel behind me. I dipped my weight into my knees a little more, curling my fingers to beckon their advance. \u201cBring it on.\u201d</p> <p>Mike grinned. \u201cYou heard her, boys.\u201d</p><p>A quick movement caught my eye to the left; I turned, feeling time slow down around me, heard the blood pump through the fingers of the hand gripping a sword, felt the cut of the blade through the muggy summer air and saw the glint of excitement in the eye of the man swinging it. But his face changed before the blade reached my flesh, when he realised it would hit white space, its target bending under it\u2014feeling the brush of wind from its crisp metal sweep over its back.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Falcon said, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s fast, I\u2019ll give her that.\u201d</p><p>Time sped up again; I sunk to my knees, rolling my spine straight to dodge the cut of a blade coming directly down my nose, missing it by a bee\u2019s leg. Two men moved in on my right; I swung my leg out, using a fist on the ground to balance me, then thrust my sword upward into Mike\u2019s, blocking a cut that would\u2019ve opened my shoulder. The men under the swing of my leg hit the floor as my blade came back down, and I heard only a few grunts as I got to my feet again and squared my sword to slice along the blade of another. As I spun to an assault from my right, metal connected with my cheek, parting the flesh in a clean slice, forcing a high-pitched squeal from the back of my throat. I cupped my face to hold the blood in, my gut turning until the wound tingled, knitting back together.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Quaid said.</p><p>The knights were taken aback for only a breath more, then ran in from all four sides; my forearm split open where it shot up to shield my face, while my sword clinked against Quaid\u2019s, and all of a sudden, my feet came out from under me, a fifth knight tearing me to the ground. They all piled in on top of me, pinning my arms and legs, deepening the gash as it tried to heal.</p> <p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d</p><p>Quaid stood at my brow, his sword to my throat. \u201cYield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d I bent my elbow and twisted my forearm, bringing my knee up into Mike\u2019s jaw at the same time, sending him and Ryder back with a pretty powerful blow\u2014for me. The knights on my left ankle and wrist stupidly let their guard drop, watching Mike stumble about, cursing; I took the break, risking the condition of my gashed arm, and rolled to one side, dragging my limbs from their grip.</p><p>Aside from the blood coating my wrist, standing felt like a new victory, but Falcon was on it; he rolled his shoulder into the ground, legs over head, and came up in front of me, his sword meeting mine with a nasty knock that made my elbow shake. I gripped the handle with both hands, angling it against each of his strikes, until Ryder thrust his in a straight jab, right between Falcon\u2019s and mine, and I lost my grip, dropping the sword to the ground.</p><p>They moved in then. Falcon kicked my sword out of reach; it skidded across the floor, stopping by the mirror, right beside any hope I had of winning this. But the defeat made something shift in me, like a decision made\u2014like everything had already been calculated and was just waiting for that last cog. It filled me with a feeling\u2014a rush, like excitement, which rose up my arms, replacing failure with a burning charge demanding release.</p><p>I flicked my wrist, sending a bullet of electricity into Falcon\u2019s chest as he ran in for the kill; he stopped dead, as if he\u2019d hit an invisible pane of glass\u2014his arms flailing out, his body shaking once before he shot backward, like a rope pulled him from behind, dragging him to the wall.</p><p>\u201cBack off.\u201d I pointed the violent lashing of blue at Blade, then turned at the shoulder to warn the knights behind me; they all stopped, metal clinking on the ground as they dropped their swords, held up their hands and yelled, \u201cYield.\u201d</p><p>My winning smile swallowed my entire face. \u201cLooks like you guys can go home.\u201d</p> <p>Mike rose from the floor, clapping his hands. \u201cMuch better, Ara. Much, much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, simply marvellous,\u201d a loud, humour-filled voice announced from the side of the room.</p><p>\u201cArthur.\u201d I turned around and smiled as he walked toward us.</p><p>\u201cBravo, Amara. I see the rumours of your power were true.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, waiting for the electricity to recede, but my body obviously still felt under threat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay, my dear.\u201d Arthur carefully touched my shoulder; the adrenaline pumping through me eased, taking the blue light with it.</p><p>\u201cUr, Chief?\u201d Blade tapped Mike\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Arthur said, his panicked eyes on the back wall.</p><p>Mike moved as I spun around to see Falcon, slumped heavily on the floor. \u201cMate, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcon!\u201d My gut dropped.</p><p>Mike and Arthur got to his side first. I fell in clumsily between them, my hand hovering over the knight\u2019s bloodied chest. \u201cDid I...did I kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis heart\u2019s stopped,\u201d Arthur said, rolling up his sleeves.</p><p>Mike grabbed the knight by the shoulders and laid him flat on the ground, then started compressions, pushing crossed hands down firmly between Falcon\u2019s breastbones, right below a mucky, sticky mess of burned flesh. And without a second thought, I sunk my teeth into his arm, and the instant his skin broke under them, blood spilled into my mouth, burning the sides of my throat like hot pins charging through each tiny tastebud, searing everything in their path. The watering response of my tongue made the blood mix into a thinner liquid, which slipped easily past my throat and into my stomach, twisting it in tight knots.</p><p>\u201cI got a pulse!\u201d Mike said.</p><p>I released my hold, spitting blood and venom to the ground as I fell back on my hand, wiping it from my nose and chin. I wanted to kick my legs and scream for them to get it off, but I was all too conscious of the fact that everyone in the room was staring.</p><p>Blade knelt beside me, wiping his sweaty shirt around my face and down my chest where the blood dribbled. \u201cYour majesty, what is it, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I looked up into eyes of concern, and realised only then that I was crying.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Mike hoisted me off the ground by my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get you some blood to wash out the taste.\u201d</p><p>An arm, with the sleeve rolled up to reveal clear veins, appeared in front of my lips. \u201cYour Majesty, drink,\u201d Arthur said kindly.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no.\u201d Mike pushed his arm away. \u201cThere is no way she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in agony,\u201d Arthur growled, standing face to face with Mike. \u201cI do not care for your fears of the lust she will feel while drinking, Michael, I care that that poor girl be eased of the burning she is suffering. Now let me pass.\u201d He eyed Mike, staring him down, and as soon as he pierced his vein with his nail and the smell of his blood hit my senses, I pushed past Mike and grabbed Arthur\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cAra, don\u2019t bite him,\u201d Mike said, with way too much panic, grabbing me.</p><p>Arthur looked up at him, confused. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you cared.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my lips around the cool, soothing milk spilling from Arthur\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But the last thing we need now is the death of a vampire at the hands of the future queen.\u201d</p><p>I was vaguely aware of Mike moving away, but had to narrow myself in and focus only on the blood\u2014only on the feel of it taking the burn away, like cream over salt. But the urge to bite Arthur seared worse. I could. I could bite him. He wasn\u2019t immune, but if I bit him, I could give him my blood right away and he might be all right.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Mike grabbed my shoulder and rolled me away; the sensation of lust, flooding me like a warm beat of blood through my heart, turned to a flush of heat in my cheeks as I felt the air between us.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Arthur.\u201d I wiped my mouth with my forearm. \u201cI still get a little carried away with blood.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head, rolling his sleeve down his already healed arm. \u201cDo not think on it, Princess. It is my pleasure to appease you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mike seemed to grow taller then, taking me by the arm. \u201cTraining\u2019s over for you, missy. Let\u2019s go.\u201d As he led me from the room, he looked back at the gawking knights. \u201cBack to work\u2014all of you. Blade, you\u2019re in charge.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Arthur, I mouthed, hurrying away at more than human speed. I didn\u2019t even get a chance to see if he heard me.</p><p>The cool breeze and soft kiss of rain on my cheeks outside shocked my warm body. My heart started faster and the taste of Arthur on my lips sunk in to realisation. I touched my fingertips to them, smiling a little, half laughing.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d Mike said, eyes forward, practically dragging me away.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Drink his blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! How could you let yourself\u2014?\u201d His face contorted with disgust, his fingers tightening on my arm. \u201cI\u2019m so mad at you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgh. Get over it.\u201d I whipped my arm from his grip. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire. I drink vampire blood. He\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy. You\u2019re a girl. Doesn\u2019t mean you can screw him.\u201d</p><p>Hu! I gasped loudly. \u201cHow dare you? I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid, Ara. We all saw the lust take hold.\u201d He pointed to the training hall.</p><p>I dropped my hands to my hips. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s a part of the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely why you are never to drink his blood again. Do I make myself clear?\u201d He towered over me a little.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot,\u201d I said breathily, insult rising like a flamed wind, \u201ctell me. Who to eat from.\u201d</p><p>He grew taller in front of me, his eyes widening to take all of me in. \u201cI can. And I will.\u201d</p><p>I stomped my foot, thrusting my fists to my sides, tilting my chin to seem taller. \u201cI can eat from whom ever I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you going to stop me?\u201d</p><p>Mike dropped back and leaned against the white bricks of the training hall, rubbing furiously at his brow. \u201cAra. Please. Come on. Stop being a stubborn little brat. You know you shouldn\u2019t drink from him and you know why.\u201d</p><p>As the heat of lust and the adrenaline simmered in my limbs a little, I felt a pang of acquiescence. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter, because I don\u2019t want his blood anyway,\u201d I huffed, folding my arms. \u201cAnd if I did, I\u2019d have it. You can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d Only, he was right. I did feel the lust. I did feel the desire to move my lips up Arthur\u2019s arm and find his mouth, and I knew it was artificial. So, I wouldn\u2019t drink his blood again\u2014if I could help it. But I wasn\u2019t about to be controlled by Mike, either.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to tell you what to do\u2014when it comes to your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his hurting you I\u2019m worried about,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. He stiffened quickly and dropped his arm back down to his side. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Ara. I know you just hate being ordered around, but, please\u2014\u201d He stepped into me, two hands holding my face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t drink his blood again.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He let go of me and turned away, walking ahead. \u201cBut if I catch you alone with him, I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, and I will forcibly remove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou so will not!\u201d</p><p>He stopped then and turned to face me. \u201cYes, I will. I promised David I\u2019d watch out for you when it comes to Arthur. I won\u2019t let you make the mistake I know you\u2019re capable of, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait? What mistake?\u201d I grabbed his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d He looked down at me, his caramel eyes narrowed. \u201cI listened to your heart, Ara, while you drank from him\u2014as did Arthur. You\u2019re lucky only one other person in that room is immortal, or they would all have heard it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the blood lust, Mike,\u201d I called as he walked away again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Ara, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHu!\u201d I huffed and followed him toward the manor. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you don\u2019t know how to control yourself when it comes to your heart.\u201d</p><p>I bolted\u2014Lilithian speed\u2014and stood in front of him, blocking his path. \u201cMy heart?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shifted before stopping on the ground by his feet. \u201cYou think you want something until you get it, Ara\u2014which, by the point you realise it\u2019s not what you wanted, you\u2019ve already destroyed it.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped. \u201cMike? Is this about Arthur\u2014or about you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at me for a second then looked away with a sigh, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I grabbed his forearm and tugged until he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cThis is about nothing, except the safety and freedom of our people, Amara. If you fall for Arthur through some twisted, artificial love the blood lust causes you to feel, you could be putting this whole operation in jeopardy.\u201d</p> <p>Swallowing hard, I nodded. \u201cOkay, Mike. I already told you\u2014I don\u2019t want his blood. It tasted old and dry.\u201d I pretended to wipe it away from my mouth as though that was true, when all I really wanted was to feel it against my tongue again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn, Ara.\u201d Mike pushed past me. \u201cYou could just say you won\u2019t drink it because you think I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true, though.\u201d A wide smile forced itself onto my lips. I hid it before I walked beside him again.</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter, anyway. I stand by what I said. If I catch you alone with him\u2014\u201d he pointed at me, \u201c\u2014you are in big trouble. Clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a bell.\u201d I nodded. But I think we both knew I wouldn\u2019t listen. I\u2019d stay away from Arthur\u2019s blood, but he was quickly becoming the only friend I could truly confide in. There was no way I\u2019d give that up to ease Mike\u2019s baseless fears.</p> <p>The ring tone had a kind of homely sound to it, and I hoped with all my heart that David would pick up, but when Emily\u2019s sweet voice came down the line, I wasn\u2019t really that surprised.</p><p>\u201cHi, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra! Hi. How\u2019s things at the manor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Hey, um, is David around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUumm.\u201d I could almost hear her clearing her throat. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. Put him on.\u201d I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She went quiet, aside from voices muffled by what I assumed was a palm over the mouthpiece of the phone. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, not to me. \u201cUm, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...he went to the store about twenty minutes ago. Sorry. I forgot. But I\u2019ll have him call you back when he get\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d My voice broke.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. He\u2019s not here, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Em. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed heavily. \u201cLook, thing is...he kind of doesn\u2019t want to talk right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...well, I actually don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he mad at me?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he hate me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...I don\u2019t really understand. Why won\u2019t he talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm? I really miss him. I just want to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll talk to him, okay\u2014maybe he\u2019ll call you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I frowned to myself. \u201cUm, can you at least tell him I love him and...and that I\u2019m sorry for the argument we had the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Um. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d I hung up the phone and ditched it onto my bed, throwing myself down on top of it.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The soulful tunes I set out to play had been left behind somewhere in my room. I sat in the pale light coming in through the giant window by the piano and played what was in my heart\u2014which, when translated into notes, sounded like a doleful memorial.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d a high-pitched voice said from the side of the room, \u201c\u2014don\u2019t you know any pleasant melodies, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, calming slightly as I looked up at the woman. \u201cI'm just too angry right now to play something sunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She nodded, reaching high to dust the top of the mirror beside the piano. \u201cTroubles of the heart?\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, I nodded, taking in her aged face and short, white-grey curls; she had a kind of \u2018nanny\u2019 look about her. \u201cI don't like arguing with people. It makes me feel uneasy, and then when I can\u2019t resolve it, I feel like I\u2019ve been tied up.\u201d I dropped my hands from the keys. \u201cI just can\u2019t think straight when I'm upset.\u201d</p><p>She sat down beside me, her plump form taking up most of the piano stool. \u201cKnow what I do when I can't clear my head?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI take a stroll out to the lighthouse, climb the stairs and watch the waves talking to the shore.\u201d She smiled at something distant. \u201cEver since they first erected that lighthouse in fourteen-oh-two, it\u2019s been my go-to place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here that long?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was human back then, but, yes, I\u2019ve been here some years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears? That\u2019s more than years.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, thoughtful. \u201cTime passes differently here. Feels like only yesterday young Lilith was running these halls.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, imagining Lilith as a child, but with everything else occupying my head, her face faded quickly, leaving only my troubles. \u201cHow do I get to the lighthouse? No one will show me the way.\u201d I closed the cover on the piano.</p><p>\u201cGo out here and through the garden to the left.\u201d She pointed to the big doors. \u201cThere\u2019s a dirt road leading through the forest. Follow that to a clearing and go down the hill. You\u2019ll see the lighthouse from quite far off. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said and stood up. \u201cAnd, um, I didn't get your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty, lovely. Kitty Jomane-lonique.\u201d</p><p>I extended my hand and she shook it softly. \u201cNice to meet you, Kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure is all mine, Princess.\u201d She bowed her head and took to another room, leaving me alone again in the shadows of a newly-forming day.</p><p>The dirt road appeared quite quickly once I started walking, and the fresh air made all my problems seem further away\u2014not so much like a blanket around my shoulders. The trunks of the forest trees parted for the dirt path, their wispy leaves closing the canopy in above, allowing passage for enough light to filter kaleidoscope patterns across the ground.</p><p>Aside from the graceful breeze and the summer song of birds, I could also hear my tactless, human guards following me. If I were human, I\u2019d never notice them there\u2014they were really quite clever\u2014but I could smell them and hear their hearts pumping as they tried to keep up with me. Poor things. Mike shouldn't have them following me until they can handle it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some company, my lady?\u201d</p><p>I turned to Arthur, approaching from behind. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I walk with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I was about to say no, but he looked so young and carefree in his jeans and white button-down shirt, with the sun making his messed hair gleam, that I didn't have the heart to tell him I was in a bitter mood and just needed everyone to leave me the hell alone. \u201cYeah, okay. I'm not really sure I\u2019ll be very good company, though, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThere always is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips together and rolled them to one side. \u201cNo. I mean, I would, but I think distracting myself might be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d he said, stuffing his hands in his pockets. \u201cI shall do my best to blindly steer your mind around these undefined troubles.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, bumping shoulders with him gently. \u201cThanks, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>We held a smile between us for a second past uncomfortable, until I looked away. He was so much like David\u2014the ancestral connection very clear between the two\u2014which made walking out here, in a forest, hard\u2014made me very glad David was actually alive, or I might\u2019ve fallen to the floor in a sobbing mess. \u201cYou look so human today, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d he said, half frowning, half smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean...I guess I just never pictured you in jeans.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his pants, shrugging. \u201cWell, I can be quite human at times. I trust, by the end of my stay, you will have a more unguarded opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnguarded?\u201d I asked, noticing the path narrowing at my feet, closing in with long, green grass. \u201cOh, you think I don't trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just guarded.\u201d He smiled, looking away quickly. \u201cLike you're afraid you might say something you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Hm. Clever. \u201cYou have been around for a while, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Arthur began, looking up as Petey came running down the trail toward us, \u201cyou pick up a little about human nature when you live for a few\u2014for as long as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Petey.\u201d I squatted down and scratched the top of his head, then peered up at Arthur. \u201cHow long have you lived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLived?\u201d He bounced a little as he started walking again. \u201cI lived for only thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d I followed him, patting my leg for Petey to come, too. \u201cAnd technically, you\u2019re still living. Since vampires aren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo...do you ever get tired\u2014of living?\u201d</p><p>He made a tight line of his lips, a smile in his eyes, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you alone now? Like, were David and Jason the last of your bloodline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He reached across Petey, who walked between us, and took my hand. \u201cWell, at least I still have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You do.\u201d I gently squeezed his fingers. \u201cWe immortals have to stick together, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And I must say, I look forward to your friendship over the years to come.\u201d</p><p>I almost thought about that for a second\u2014eternity\u2014but my dad\u2019s face popped into my mind, and the idea of seeing him die one day, knowing I\u2019ll never see him again, felt too heavy, so I pushed it all aside and dropped Arthur\u2019s hand, walking a little faster.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why the sudden dash for distance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't like to think about it\u2014eternity. It\u2019s just a bit...well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpty.\u201d He nodded and we both slowed, coming to the edge of the forest, the trees opening out to a wide field of wind-swept grass; its hues of pale green on a backdrop of blue ran as far as the eye could see. \u201cI shouldn't say this, as I do not wish to cause you grief, but I understand the pain of living without those we love. I know you think of David when you imagine eternity, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I closed my eyes, angling my head away from him. \u201cPlease don't talk about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady.\u201d</p><p>I started ahead, my footfalls sinking heavily on the uneven ground, while my fingers ran lazily through the blades of grass, making sweeping motions, like I did in the dreams where I walked a field much the same as this, with Jason.</p><p>\u201cDo you see that\u2014where the ground disappears up there?\u201d Arthur pointed ahead, past the lone, wide tree.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the cliffs and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lighthouse.\u201d I looked all the way up at it in the distance; white, tall, just like I imagined it would be, but also really far away\u2014enough that I could cover it with my thumb from where I stood. \u201cThis place is beautiful,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes. I have always loved it here,\u201d Arthur noted, then pointed to a steep incline of trees to our left that bordered the manor\u2014leaving the other side of this grassy plane open. \u201cHave you been told of the myth about that forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah\u2014something about if you go in there at dawn, you\u2019ll be trapped for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d He smiled, walking with his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cThis place has so many of those stories. I've heard several since I came here,\u201d I noted, watching Petey run ahead, chasing a murder of crows.</p><p>\u201cWell, live in any one place for long enough, and myths will form. Nevertheless, be mindful to choose carefully which ones you believe, Princess. All legends derive from some fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said, hiding a smile, but stopped walking suddenly when the tree came into full view. \u201cThat\u2019s my tree!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tree?\u201d Arthur stood beside me, looking at my face, then the tree sitting centre field, its branches reaching out like welcoming arms.</p><p>\u201cYes. My tree.\u201d I almost folded over and started crying, feeling so close to a part of my past\u2014a part with a boy I was made to love\u2014that, in that breath, I couldn\u2019t stand the fact of his death. \u201cJason showed me this place\u2014in my dreams. But he said I chose it, except, I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he lied.\u201d Arthur walked ahead.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I bolted forward, Lilithian-style, stopping only once the cool shade of the tree covered my skin from the sun, closing me in, showing me home once more. I touched its trunk, feeling him there\u2014feeling Jason within its spirit\u2014and let the urge to cry trickle away with each panting breath. \u201cWhy would he lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure.\u201d Arthur appeared beside me. \u201cPerhaps he didn't wish to explain why this place was special to him.\u201d</p><p>I slid down the bark of the tree, feeling each ridge, then each blade of grass under my knees, touching my skin. It felt just like the dream\u2014like reality, and when I looked up at the man beside me, I half expected to see Jason. \u201cThis is the field Jason and David played in as boys?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arthur nodded, looking upon the scene as if the children might be running there once more, then sat down carefully beside me. \u201cJason loved Loslilian. When he became a vampire and was forced to move to the castle, it nearly broke his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That was where our Set resided.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow come Drake lived there then? Didn't he have his own Set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Drake lived wherever he wanted. The castle was merely where he chose to be for the last decade or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I mean, was there a reason?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was not privy to such information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you never talked as friends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe did.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI just never asked him what reasons he had for coming or going. He was always a wanderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he made everyone else stay in one place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We moved on\u2014had opportunity to see the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy moving each winter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I thought about poor Emily\u2014how she lost Jason to that tradition. \u201cWhy did you move all the time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Arthur folded his hands in his lap, crossing his legs at the ankles. \u201cIt began as a tradition\u2014one we started in a time where food became scarce as the days grew colder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarce? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarmers would have no crops to tend, markets would close when it snowed and travellers would lodge until spring broke. And since it is our strong belief it\u2019s bad form to kill a man in his own bed, we travelled to warmer parts of the world, returning to our original homes when the snow melted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, not if you were a Set leader\u2014then you could stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf on your two years\u2019 leave, yes. But we were required to check in weekly, meet with other Set leaders on occasion to keep updated.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cEric told me once that he had to \u2018check-in\u2019 daily. What\u2019s with that?\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy so many questions, my dear?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cGuess I'm just trying to get an idea of how the Sets worked\u2014you know, since I\u2019ll be disbanding them soon.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at my teasing tone. \u201cThe check-ins were vital to keep tabs on all vampires. Each person had a different time, and would be hunted down by the Warriors if they failed to check-in on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And brought to trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo, the Warriors were like vampire cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur laughed lightly. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what Jason was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice became small.</p><p>I exhaled and looked around the field then; it felt strange to be sitting here, knowing I was awake. \u201cSo, why did Jason love this place so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always felt safe here, like he belonged.\u201d He slid down a little, leaning on his elbow, his face in line with my shoulder. \u201cAfter their aunt died, the boys lived here until they became vampires. This was home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Drake let you live away from the Set while you raised them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we simply moved the Set here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Mike told me you were Lord of Loslilian. So, that was when the boys were human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. And...you just up and moved the entire Set here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did everyone else feel about that\u2014about moving just so you could raise the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had some resistance.\u201d He looked up at me, his brilliant blue eyes shocking me for a second. \u201cDrake quickly put a stop to it.\u201d</p><p>I toyed with the hem of my dress. \u201cWhy was he so accommodating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an old friend of his.\u201d Arthur sat up a little more and dusted the grass off his palms. \u201cI had always given the best of myself to the throne\u2014not to mention, one of my conditions of becoming a vampire was that I always watch over my brother\u2019s bloodline. I couldn\u2019t let the boys end up in an orphanage, possibly never to know what became of them, so Drake and I came to an arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrangement? The way you say that makes it sound like there was crux.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSmart girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what was it\u2014the catch?\u201d</p><p>He reached across and picked a yellow daisy from beside my knee. \u201cDrake let us live here on the condition that, when the boys came of age, I would turn them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, David never told me that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never knew that.\u201d</p><p>I sat back against the tree, feeling superior for knowing more than David did\u2014for once. \u201cSo, if Drake was such a good friend, so good he changed laws and moved an entire Set just because he knew what the boys meant to you, why did he order David killed?\u201d</p><p>Arthur let out a long breath, his chest sinking. \u201cThere are laws, my dear, even I cannot protect someone from. That is why I told Jason to warn you\u2014and to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gave David up instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his tone deep. \u201cI know he thought it would give you time to escape. After all, it was you they were truly after. Without you, they could never have killed David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nodded, pressing my tongue to my fang. \u201cGuess that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fought for him, though.\u201d He touched my hand until I looked at him. \u201cI fought for David's life to be spared. But Drake overruled it\u2014said he had to make an example of David.\u201d</p><p>I sunk back a little. \u201cSorry, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be sorry.\u201d He patted my hand. \u201cNone of this was in your control.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at his fingers, then wound mine softly through his, as if he was the boy I missed so much. And it was just as easy as it was touching Jason, but this time, was merely a gesture of friendship. Something it had never been with Jason. \u201cI am sorry he\u2019s dead, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was always more human than David. He never even had to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always liked human, didn't you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was the first thing I noticed in his eyes, after I changed him,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe glimmer of compassion\u2014something vampires commonly lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he lost it later, didn't he? When David took Rochelle.\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked down. \u201cYes, but not completely.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Rochelle for a second. \u201cHe described it once, the way he felt to fall in love with a human. If he never lost his compassion, how come falling for a human changed so much in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove does that. It opens your world.\u201d Arthur laughed, letting go of my hand to unfold his in front of him, like wiping paint across the sky. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve felt love, you notice light in the day you never saw before.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah. I guess that\u2019s true. It was like that for me when I fell for David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for Jason?\u201d</p><p>I shuffled uncomfortably. \u201cThat can't be classed as real love, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he bound me. I was compelled to love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still cared for him\u2014love aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your heart tell you?\u201d</p><p>I asked it, in my mind, and the answer was always the same. \u201cI hate the way David treated him. I hate that David killed Rochelle. I just feel so empty for Jason, and I know that's wrong, I know I should hate him for what he did to me, but, honestly, Arthur, if he were here right now, I\u2019d thank him. And the next time I saw David, I\u2019d punch him in the arm for being such a butt-wipe brother.\u201d</p><p>Arthur laughed loudly. \u201cOh, my dear, if Jason could only have heard you speak those words, I know it would have washed away so much of the agony for what he was made to do to you.\u201d His smile simmered away to thought. \u201cI'm sure he is resting peacefully in his grave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou buried him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. What else would I have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCremated him\u2014like\u2014\u201d I didn't need to say it. Arthur knew who I was talking about.</p><p>\u201cI know that is the preferred method after a venom death, but Drake was not there to enforce that law, and I could not bring myself to betray Jason\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis wishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When he was a boy, on his deathbed, we asked him if he would rather cremation or burial.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cHe asked that he be buried beside his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s next to his brother\u2019s empty grave, and that of his aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his old grave?\u201d I nearly shot forward.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you? He should have had a proper burial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, imagine the paperwork I would have to file in order to commission a new grave for a member of society who was nineteen years of age and died suddenly of unknown causes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014that\u2019s what your Set does. You forge things, don't you, you have doctors on your side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But Jason was, by all legal rights, supposed to be cremated. Those who die of venom must be burned. That is the law. Who would I ask to help me write the orders up to bury him, when I was breaking the law by doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn't you have friends that would lie for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl, if they were my friends, I would not ask them to risk punishment by lying for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so wrong. He shouldn't be buried in his old grave\u2014marked as dying in nineteen-sixteen. People should know who he is and what his life meant to those who loved him!\u201d</p><p>Arthur softened. \u201cAnd his memory will live on in those people, for eternity. You're immortal now, Amara, and sometimes you have to act unfavourably in order to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry. It\u2019s the way things are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, sitting straight. \u201cAs soon as we have control of the vampires, I'm having him exhumed and buried properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis bothers you deeply, doesn't it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cDoes it not bother you that the ashes of your husband remain in the cindering base of the fireplace in the room where he died?\u201d</p><p>I looked away. \u201cI try not to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will do the same when it comes to Jason\u2019s final resting place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I bit my teeth together.</p><p>\u201cI must tell you\u2014\u201d Arthur said, breaking the calm song of nature that filled the silence, \u201c\u2014how it warms my heart to know Jason was loved once, before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved once?\u201d I felt the muscles in my brow fold in. \u201cRochelle loved him, too.\u201d</p><p>Arthur exhaled. \u201cNot when she learned what he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to him, told him she was pregnant. Concerned for hers and the child\u2019s well-being, Jason brought her to me, asked that I deliver news to this girl that her boyfriend and child were vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told him to burn in Hell, then tried to kill him with the crucifix she wore around her neck.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cHe never told me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never told a soul. I only knew because I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid David know?\u201d</p><p>Arthur scratched his cheek. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after he killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect...before.\u201d</p><p>So many questions simmered through me, like an alternately cold then hot pulse. I wondered if that was the real reason David killed her\u2014because she meant to kill Jason, because she thought of his child\u2014their child\u2014as an abomination. \u201cPoor Jason.\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked down; his long lashes hiding his blue eyes. \u201cThe world cannot hurt him any longer, my dear.\u201d</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t enough for me. My chest shook and my face crumpled; I barely had time to cover my mouth before it all came out in a torrent of tears. \u201cOh, Arthur. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, my dear. I know.\u201d He gently wrapped his arms around me, letting me sob, my whole body shaking in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI don't want to feel anything for him. But he was so real. He was real and he got hurt, and no one made it all okay for him. And I keep telling myself it\u2019s the spirit bind that makes me care, but it should be gone by now. I'm strong. I'm a vampire. The bind should be dissipating by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas\u2014\u201d He sat me up a little and looked into my face. \u201cHave your feelings toward Mike eased?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my tears stopping for wide eyes. \u201cLike, heaps. I feel normal around him now.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThen you must grieve Jason, Princess. Grieve him and the pain will ease.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head against his jaw, covering my whole face with my hands. \u201cIt doesn't help. I\u2019ve cried for him. I\u2019ve cried for everyone I\u2019ve lost, and it doesn't change how much I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it probably never will. But it will do you no good to deny your broken heart, either.\u201d</p><p>I hiccupped a few times, sniffling. \u201cArthur?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don't tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell anyone what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat I dreamed of him\u2014that...that I cared for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn't even consider it, Princess. Our conversations\u2014all our conversations\u2014remain private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said in a quiet whisper against his shoulder.</p><p>When the tears finally settled, exhausted from all the things in my head, I laid back on the grass, with Arthur beside me, and we watched the clouds move slowly across the blue sky. The simplicity of the moment brought a kind of ease to my soul I\u2019d not felt since I was human.</p><p>Petey eventually came back from his all-important crow-chasing activities and laid beside me\u2014my last connection to a man I wished I\u2019d admitted I cared for when he could have heard me say it.</p> <p>Yesterday afternoon\u2019s training left me exhausted. By the time I finally fell into bed, after a long dinner\u2014entertainment being the heated political debate between Arthur and the Lilithians\u2014I pretty much passed out. Didn't even have any dreams; no scary ghost version of me and, to my disappointment, no memories of Jason. I wondered if I\u2019d seen them all now\u2014if I\u2019d removed all the mind blocks he left in place. And that idea made my soul feel empty, disconnected.</p><p>I ran the brush through the lengths of my hair, watching each movement through the mirror of Arietta\u2019s dresser, then picked up the perfume bottle by my hand and sniffed it. Nope, no garlic. I had cornflakes for breakfast, and I was pretty sure they didn't contain any garlic, so it seemed odd to be able to smell it. Perhaps it was some potion Arthur was cooking up. I did see a few cloves of garlic on his windowsill the other day.</p><p>I sprayed a little perfume on my wrist, just to make sure the garlic smell wasn\u2019t me, then walked out of my room, closing my door behind me.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Mike came charging down the corridor at a half run. \u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen here the whole time. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm coming with you this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith me?\u201d I shrugged, simultaneously shaking my head and frowning.</p><p>\u201cDon't play dumb. I know you're going down to the cellblock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI have eyes and ears everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the wall beside me, to the focused gaze of the woman in the painting there. \u201cWhen I get back, I'm hanging you upside down.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cDon't take it out on her. Blame yourself for being foolish enough to think you\u2019d get away with it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my arms to my sides. \u201cI just want to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, baby, but you shouldn't have planned to go alone. You don't know what\u2019s down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a map.\u201d I pulled a small, repeatedly folded piece of paper from my pocket and held it up to Mike, who took it, opened it out, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cBaby, this is a map of de la Mort\u2019s cell block. Not Loslilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this, anyway?\u201d He tucked it away in his own back pocket.</p><p>\u201cI took it from Arthur\u2019s ro\u2014\u201d Oops.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d I started walking. \u201cI was just watering his plants. He asked me to do it while he was away on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But, does he know you have his map?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI was gonna put it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. I'm keeping it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said as we reached the base of the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s exactly what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head, his narrowed eyes searching my face, while sunlight shone through the doors of the Great Hall, making his hair gold. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the hundred questions today?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYou took something that's mine. I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not yours, so it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s Core talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, I can't know what my army is up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant to you.\u201d</p><p>Hmpf! I bit my teeth together. We wandered through the pale-coloured rooms along the first floor of the east wing, stopping by a large door at the very end.</p><p>\u201cThrone room slash Court,\u201d Mike said, pushing the door open. \u201cThe only people allowed to access it this way are your council, the House and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does everyone else get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe front doors\u2014on the outside of the manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>We walked in and I expected to see a grand room with high ceilings, but I met the blue back of a curtain, closing us off in a small space. Mike shut the door behind us and kicked a rug out of the way, revealing a hatch.</p><p>\u201cA secret door?\u201d I smirked.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He opened the hatch and pulled something out. \u201cSecret key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Cool.\u201d</p><p>In the wall panel behind him, hidden to the right of the door, was a small hole. He pressed the key in, turned it, and the panel came forward just enough for him to slip his fingers between it and the wall.</p><p>\u201cThis isn't the way I was told to come,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fastest way to the section you\u2019re going. Usually you\u2019d take the stairs through the Round room and follow a passage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, one of the maids said the door to the underground was in the Council Chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. The Round Room.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI thought the Council Chamber was that room we all sat in last night with the House.\u201d</p><p>Mike groaned. \u201cAra\u2014are you serious?\u201d</p><p>I moved my shoulders up to my ears in a really slow shrug.</p><p>\u201cBaby, the Round Room is important\u2014it has, not only great historical significance, but is the place you\u2019ll hold all your Private Council meetings\u2014for the rest of forever. That room we were in last night was the board room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I wondered why it wasn't round.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cOh, baby, sometimes your lack of focus can be very endearing.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the slightly open secret door. \u201cSo, where is the Round Room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough there.\u201d He pointed to the curtain. \u201cIt\u2019s underground, dark, secret, all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But it\u2019s not called the Round Room just because it\u2019s round. There\u2019s an old stone tablet in there\u2014which is round\u2014and is said to have been the meeting circle of the first knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting circle? What, like, a table or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, thanks for clearing that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Now, come on.\u201d He took my hand and the underground chill rose up from the depth of the dark beyond, creeping around everything that contained life out here and sucking it away.</p><p>I pulled back a little. \u201cAre there stairs there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You\u2019ll see.\u201d Mike drew his phone from his pocket and opened iTorch, shining the white light down the barrel of a cavernous hole; stone steps led away in a curve around a cylindrical column hiding who knew what.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I laid a shaky hand to the air before me. \u201cI don't like it down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, baby,\u201d he said, placing my hand onto the wall. \u201cJust follow the curves and you won't fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so steep?\u201d I couldn't see how far down this stairwell went, but it had a feel to it\u2014a tilt, like walking down a really big hill.</p><p>\u201cIt goes pretty deep under the manor, Ara. What did you expect?\u201d</p><p>I tried to shrug, but my shoulders were too stiff.</p><p>When the door closed behind us with a thud, sending an echo into the pits below, I squealed, hearing my own voice hit every step in this tunnel before bouncing back to embarrass me repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cHa! And you wanted to come down here alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't know it would be this scary.\u201d I moved closer to Mike and took his hand. \u201cIs the other tunnel like this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse,\u201d he scoffed, angling his torch to show the steps directly below our feet; they were all I could see\u2014all I would focus on. The walls rose up around us, becoming higher and higher as we descended beneath the manor, and when we finally came to the base of the stairs, the slimy brown stones spread out to a corridor\u2014longer than my eyes could make out, with a roof low enough that Mike had to hunch a little.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you make that torch any brighter?\u201d I nodded at the phone.</p><p>\u201cThis is as bright as it gets. You wanna hope I don't run out of battery.\u201d He laughed. I did not find that funny at all. \u201cYou could use your electric light thing\u2014in your hands.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my fingertips for a second. \u201cI don't think it works that way, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>Among the eerie weight of fear this darkness pressed on me, I found a solid little thought\u2014a happy one, and focused on it; David\u2014his smile, his arms, his love. But despite the static charge in my skin, the light stayed dormant. I stretched my fingers, making them stiff, as if that would help, but it didn't. \u201cI can't, Mike. It won't work when I'm scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works if you\u2019re gonna lose a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s because I hate losing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, and I noticed there was no echo to his voice, despite the empty, cavernous tunnel, \u201cmaybe you should imagine you\u2019ll lose a bet. Maybe I\u2019ll bet you can't make your light work down here.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNah. I don't really feel like having a headache today, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still getting those?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but he probably didn't see it through the darkness. \u201cIf I'm on my own, just shooting stuff, I don't always get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, we just need to exercise it. It\u2019s like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Well, I\u2019ll just have to take your word for it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I aimed a soft punch at his arm, but missed, feeling his shoulder blade under my knuckles instead. He laughed, and we walked along for a while in silence then, our footsteps and my laboured breathing the only other sounds. I\u2019d expected to hear screams of terror or moaning and groaning from our tortured prisoners, even expected to be grabbed at by reaching hands of despair, but as I ran my guiding touch along the wall, I noticed that, not only were there no horrible sounds, but no cell doors, either. It was just one long blank wall, leading to a black vortex a few meters in front where the light was too weak to reach.</p><p>I looked across at Mike; I could just see his jaw, his elbow and his wrist where he held the light, and I knew I was safe with him. Was also really glad he came with me.</p><p>\u201cGlad I came with you now?\u201d he asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cNo. I could handle this on my own.\u201d I stepped away from him, out of the safe glow of the light. \u201cI wasn't planning to set them free or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past you, my sweet friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I did, they\u2019re children, Mike.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cDo you get that? Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is exactly why I'm coming.\u201d He pointed at me. \u201cThe Lilithians don't trust them, Ara. There has to be a reason for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been down to see them yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, Ar. \u2018Cause I haven't.\u201d He rubbed his neck, rolling it a little.</p><p>As we walked, a rancid smell of decay seeped in and swathed us like humid raw meat. And the worst part was, I actually knew that smell only too well. I covered my nose. \u201cDavid told me once that the Immortal Damned are fed live humans. That\u2019s true, isn't it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I can smell\u2014the decomposed bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left of them, yeah.\u201d</p><p>It made me tense then, knowing I was breathing the scent of death\u2014of life stolen under panic and fear. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But the Damned won't eat them if they\u2019re already dead. It\u2019s the kill, the stalk, the terror they thrive on. Not just blood.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cThose cages are secure, right?\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cYes. We\u2019ve only ever had one escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Did it kill anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ripped the flesh off a maid\u2019s torso, but she was immortal, so she actually recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re immortal, then.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cImmortal. Not undying. You know that. If it\u2019d taken her head off, she\u2019d have been dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the heart, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason took my heart out, and I stayed dead until he put it back.\u201d I rubbed my chest, dropping my hand as soon as I realised I was doing it. \u201cIf they ripped the heart out, would a Created Lilithian stay dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we put it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProviding the Damned didn't actually eat the heart, they may regenerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw. So, you wanna hope you never lose a body part, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, not a vital one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the same for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath. Can you die, like I can?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed heavily. \u201cA bit easier, actually. From what I'm told, if you slice the back of my neck, you know, sever the spinal cord, I\u2019d be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you come back if we regenerated you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think so. Created Lilithians don't\u2014not from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you technically don't, either. Once your soul leaves your body, you reincarnate. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jason said I needed some serum to kill my kind\u2014to stay dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a load of bullshit, Ara. If he\u2019d not put your heart back in your body, or if your head had been chopped off, you\u2019d have stayed dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not real death. He said that my soul stays tethered to the realm of life\u2014that it\u2019s really hard to sever the connection.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin. \u201cDid he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...there may be some truth to that. I read somewhere that if a body is rendered useless, but the soul hasn't been untied, they wander the earth for eternity\u2014and that\u2019s how we get ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, because I'm a pure blood, my soul can't be untethered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure, baby. Guess we\u2019ll have to do a bit more reading.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could ask Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would he know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, let\u2019s just keep him out of it for now. Ask your husband, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would David know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you might think, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. He hadn't called me that in ages. \u201cSo, being that we\u2019re Lilithian\u2014quite close to human, will the Damned try to eat us if we go in the cage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, they try to eat vampires. And they won't just eat you\u2014they\u2019ll toy with you first, make you really scared so your blood warms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, they won't.\u201d I smirked to myself. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to scare me.\u201d</p><p>I heard him laugh, and when I looked up at him, I had to laugh, too.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a big uncle playing in his nephew\u2019s cubby house,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think we\u2019ll take the other passage next time.\u201d He reached up to touch the roof without any effort. \u201cThis was built in a time when humans weren\u2019t quite as tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too low for me.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAra, you can walk straight in a tube slide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I flicked my hand out at him.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d He rubbed his chest. \u201cYou gotta stop slapping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, doesn't baby like a little slap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I love a slap. I just like to be the one doing the slapping.\u201d He gave my butt a soft whack, to which I returned a little squeal.</p><p>\u201cI can't believe you just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh, it\u2019ll do you some good. And what\u2019re you gonna do about it?\u201d he said, shining the torch in my face; I covered my eyes from the almost blue flash. \u201cYou gonna tell the king on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, pushing his hand down, seeing the grin he wore behind the light\u2019s glare.</p><p>\u201cHa! He\u2019d probably shake my hand for disciplining you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably.\u201d I looked away, my smile dropping with the ghostly sound of dripping water. My shoulders tightened, and an unnerving cold moved in, layering my tongue with a strange metal tang. I moved saliva around in my mouth, trying to swallow the taste down.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mike angled the light to show a string of lanterns hanging from the arched ceiling. \u201cLook for matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, little sticks that bring flame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d I dropped to my knees and scrambled around for the feel of a box or something, but there was only dirt, really cold dirt.</p><p>\u201cHere. Got \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErk. Of course you do.\u201d I stood up and dusted my hands on my jeans. \u201cYou just wanted to see me get all dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I just thought you should get down on your knees and pray.\u201d He laughed, making himself sound like a preacher.</p><p>\u201cYeah, how \u2018bout I pray for Lilithians to have night vision as good as vampires do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea. While you\u2019re at it, get me the power to read minds, will you? That\u2019d be a handy tool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I said drily. \u201cWant a sense of humour, too\u2014among other miracles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I'm not funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho me? Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I might just have another smack on the butt sitting dormant in these hands.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd shut up, I can't concentrate on lighting this match with you talking at me.\u201d</p><p>A golden flame came to life then, warming the eeriness of the cellblock in the small circle where Mike and I stood, but outside that, the flickering wick of the lantern cast dancing shadows in a creepy theatre show on the walls.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the cells?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the end.\u201d He held his arm straight, the lantern hanging from his curled finger, swaying with the movement.</p><p>I grabbed the base and held it still. \u201cThat\u2019s freaky. Don't let it swing like that. I feel like the clich\u00e9 blond chick in a horror film\u2014you know, the one who gets killed first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, and started walking. \u201cYour boobs aren\u2019t big enough. You\u2019ll be the one who lives to tell the tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I folded my arms and followed him.</p><p>Twenty or so paces ahead, I could just make out hollows in the walls on both sides, and as we neared them, the dry, powdery scent of dirt made me want to take shallower breaths, not letting them slip past the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, babe?\u201d Mike walked closer to me, matching my footsteps exactly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they so silent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason to make noise, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He was right. There were no windows, no sunlight, no fresh air, not even a drafty breeze. Just...stillness, darkness. When we reached the end of the tunnel, I peered in through the bars on both sides; two cells, sitting directly across from each other, about three classrooms wide, but completely empty. \u201cWhere are all the other cells? I know we have more than two.\u201d</p><p>He tapped the brick wall. \u201cThrough here\u2014this leads back out to the other passage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no door, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all is what it seems.\u201d He winked, then walked to one end of the wall and slipped his hand through it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I ran over and traced the length of his arm, following it through the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s an illusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pulled his hand back; he hadn\u2019t put it through the wall at all\u2014there was no wall there. It ended short on that side, but it was so dark in here that, from the way the bricks were lined up, no one would know there was an opening. \u201cPretty cool, hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say de la Mort is pretty much made up of walls just like this.\u201d He tapped the bricks with a flat palm.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you want the map.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at me, lifting the lantern a little to see my face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But I'm telling Arthur you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then I\u2019ll tell David you drank Arthur\u2019s blood the other day.\u201d</p><p>I grumbled to myself. \u201cFine. I won't tell Arthur you have the map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come to your senses.\u201d He wandered over and shone the lantern into the cage; \u201cCan you see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Are they even in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey cluster in the back corner.\u201d A man popped up suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I touched a hand to my racing heart. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Majesty.\u201d His ghastly old face showed in the dim light; the folds in his skin made deep shadows along his jaw and under his eyes, while his crooked nose darkened the gaps in his teeth behind a curt smile. He walked with a hunched gait, as if he\u2019d trolled these low-roofed tunnels for too many centuries and now lacked the ability to stand tall.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCaretaker. Folks call me Mr. Keeper.\u201d He turned away and nodded into the cell. \u201cStrange, really, how they all bunch together like that.\u201d He held his own lantern up to the bars, and I saw them then\u2014little faces, about twenty of them\u2014all huddling against each other like puppies in a small box.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d I covered my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYerp. No feelings, no sense, yet they all seem to bunch up, like they\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are scared.\u201d I grabbed the set of keys from the caretaker\u2019s dirt-covered hands. \u201cThey\u2019re children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u201d the hideous old man warned. \u201cIt\u2019s feeding day\u2014you\u2019ll get ripped to shreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm willing to take the risk,\u201d I said, and as I jammed the key in the lock, Mike grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ara, you\u2019ve had your fun. It stops there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d He took the keys and hooked them over a nail on the magic wall. \u201cBaby, even if they were capable of humanity, which they\u2019re not, they\u2019re hungry. Look how unreasonable you get when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>My heart grew bigger and split open inside, filling my chest with a tight ache when I saw the gaze of the few who dared to look up; sad black eyes, like opals, set deeply into pale faces absent of innocence and animation. \u201cHow often do you feed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of humans a month,\u201d the caretaker said.</p><p>I spun around quickly to face him. \u201cWhat? That's not enough for that many children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d Mike stepped forward, reaching. \u201cMove away from the cage.\u201d</p><p>I sidestepped quickly, looking behind me, catching a glimpse of a grey hand stretching through the bars, just out of reach of my hair. The child hissed at me, his mouth gaping like a hollow cave; his eyes completely black and empty.</p><p>\u201cThat was close.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cToo close. Now, move a few more steps away,\u201d Mike said, but his eyes went wide, the world going cold all around his soul as my head jerked awkwardly to one side, my feet leaving the ground as my spine hit the bars, the wind bursting from my lungs in a short squeal. Solid little hands circled my face, ripping at my hair; I reached up to pry them away as Mike darted forward, driving his elbow between my neck and the bars. But there were too many\u2014grabbing my skin, scratching it, their dry, sour-tasting fingers slipping into the corner of my mouth, yanking my head against the metal.</p><p>They refused to give up, fighting so hard against Mike that I felt like a sack of beans on the backseat of a minivan driving off-road. I couldn't even scream, couldn\u2019t get a breath past the thumping in my throat.</p><p>\u201cSnap her neck!\u201d the caretaker yelled over the chaos. \u201cSnap her neck, and they\u2019ll back off.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot to Mike\u2019s; a split second passed as he played that thought out in his mind.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ar\u2014\u201d His hands moved in slow motion; one cupping my chin, the other firmly grasping the back of my head.</p><p>I screamed, jolting forward as tiny talons dragged my feet backward through the bars. Mike dropped me, reaching out quick, catching my hair as I went down. I heard it rip as my elbows hit the dirt\u2014felt it come lose from my scalp in a big clump that he threw to the floor by my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I got you.\u201d His feet parted, his hand coming down to grab my arm, just as my body spun, slipping forward at full speed toward the cage until I wore the bars like a metal pair of underwear, driving into my flesh, threatening to rip me apart from the middle, up. I screamed out as my shoes came away, then the legs of my jeans, leaving my shins and ankles bare, cold. I couldn't kick, couldn't drag myself away from the cage. And Mike pulled, lifting my arms above my head, fighting a battle of tug-of-war with starving immortals.</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d a thunderous voice sent a shockwave of fear over the tunnels.</p><p>Mike and I flew backward into the wall, landing in a tangled heap as my legs suddenly came free. High-pitched shrieks wailed through the air, circling around and disappearing like a banshee\u2019s echo, the children retreating to the rear of the cell.</p><p>I struggled to my feet, with a little help from Mike, clutching the base of my neck where my hair was missing, and hobbled over to the cage.</p><p>\u201cYou. Know! The. Rules!\u201d the caretaker jammed his metal stick into the floor on each word.</p><p>My eyes strained against the darkness, with the torch lamps dim, lying sideways on the ground. But as I peered through the bars, wrapping my fingers around them, saw something shift under the caretaker\u2019s stick\u2014something no bigger than a pillow.</p><p>\u201cYou rotten little maggot!\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d A boy howled, tucking himself into a ball as his ribs wore the brunt of the caretaker\u2019s fury. He sounded like any other child, not some demonic immortal; his small voice quivered, laden with panic, calling through his hands for his mother\u2014an instinct so human it broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I screeched, dropping to my knees, reaching in through the bars. \u201cStop hurting him.\u201d</p><p>Mike landed in the dirt beside me, grabbing my shoulders. \u201cBaby, stay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I tried to get up\u2014to go to them. \u201cLet me help them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBaby, you can't.

I felt Mike shift, felt him go to stand but stop. Then, he took a larger breath and yelled in his thunderous cop voice, \u201cI said that\u2019s enough. Leave the boy alone!\u201d</p><p>The caretaker stopped mid-thrust and groaned. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>From the border of the shadows, a hand came out and grabbed the limp boy\u2019s wrist, dragging him into the darkest corner of the cell, leaving a trail of blood behind in the last dregs of light from the lantern.</p><p>Mike hauled me away from the bars, and I heard the great, groaning creak of the door slamming shut.</p> <p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d I wiped my face, looking up at the haggard old man, sobbing so hard I had hiccups.</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d he said. \u201cMy lady, if I had not, you would have no scalp.\u201d</p><p>I jumped to my feet. \u201cThere are other ways to deal with children! This is not acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shoved Mike off me. \u201cI won\u2019t stand for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy will heal, Ara. He\u2019s immortal, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you say that, Mike?\u201d I clenched my teeth tight enough to taste blood. \u201cHow can you think this is okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't. Not even a little bit. But there\u2019s nothing you can do for them, baby. They can't be taught. They live by instinct\u2014like animals.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him again when he tried to hug me. \u201cEven animals deserve better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you propose we do?\u201d asked the caretaker.</p><p>\u201cTry. I don't know. But we have to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Mike took my shoulders and turned me to face him. \u201cYou're shaking.\u201d</p><p>Of course I was, but I couldn\u2019t feel it. I felt only numb\u2014the beating of that boy repeating itself in my mind\u2014blending with the horrible thought that it probably wasn\u2019t the first time. And for what? Probably to satiate the caretaker\u2019s own wicked needs to feel like a master.</p><p>Hatred for him burned through me, coming out in a piercing gaze. \u201cHow often are you in charge of these children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly during feeding times,\u201d the caretaker said. \u201cThen, they\u2019re on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been their keeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout\u2014\u201d the man paused, taking a breath, \u201c\u2014two hundred years, give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I walked away from Mike, rubbing the ache of torn hair at the back of my neck. \u201cAs of now, you're fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d both Mike and the man said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d I said. \u201cMike? See Mr. Keeper to a new position in the manor, would you? Perhaps toilet cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAr, come back, baby,\u201d he called after me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I walked away, barely aware that Mike hadn\u2019t followed, unable to see but in no state to care. I felt my way along the wall in the darkness, tripping when I found the stairs suddenly, then clambered up, using my hands to feel the curves of each one. I have no idea how long I climbed those stairs for, but it felt like forever, moving inch by inch, one at a time, on my hands and knees until my head hit a wooden panel\u2014the door.</p><p>I looked back into the darkness behind me; Mike\u2019s torch was nowhere to be seen. He probably went the other way.</p><p>When I pushed the door open and landed in an exhausted heap in the calming but dim light, I\u2019d never been so happy to breathe warm air in all of my life. I laid on the slightly turned-up rug, my arms out wide, letting my heart beat its erratic tale until it eventually calmed and my breathing finally slowed\u2014allowing me to feel the pain of my broken flesh from the scratches the children left.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go check on her.\u201d Mike\u2019s scuffing steps came up the stairs; I jumped to my feet and darted behind the curtain. \u201cOkay, mate. See ya later.\u201d He slipped his phone in his pocket as he surfaced, then stood for a second and looked around; I stayed hidden, peering out through a small gap. \u201cAr?\u201d</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>\u201cAr, you here, baby?\u201d He shrugged, then walked away, closing the throne room door behind him, but left the secret passage open.</p><p>Two decisions weighed on me; I looked at the light coming in through a crack under the Throne Room doors, then back at the drafty depths of the cellblock. And despite everything that hurt, I pushed the curtains aside and ran into the darkness again, closing the door behind me.</p><p>I needed to make sure the children were all right.</p><p>Navigating downward through the dark was trickier than it had been upward. I sat down and felt for the ledge of each step with my toes, then slid my bottom onto it, using my hands to acknowledge the step behind me.</p><p>When I finally reached the base again, I let out the breath I\u2019d been holding; the gentle vocalisation of that relief sat in the cool air like a helium balloon\u2014no echo, not even a light acoustic reverberation\u2014just a dense, flat sound, lingering right in front of me. And I know it should have scared me\u2014all of it; the dark, the chill, the feel of...something down here\u2014something that was lurking like a creep walking behind me on a dark, empty street, matching my footsteps exactly. I felt like, at any minute, I\u2019d turn around and see his face. And screaming wouldn\u2019t be enough. Running wouldn\u2019t save me. I\u2019d reach the end of the tunnel, feel for the gap in that brick wall, and it would be gone. I would have to face him, alone\u2014not knowing what he wanted or what terrors he had lived through that made him compassionless\u2014able to do...unspeakable things to young girls. But none of those fears were enough to stop me planting my hand to the wall and following it along\u2014toward those children. They needed me more than I needed to feel to safe. I just kept imagining them in that cell, hugging themselves for comfort after being beaten for trying to eat. It wasn\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t fair. I just wanted to wrap them all up in my arms and tell them it would be all right. Then make it all right. Words weren't enough. Promises, no good. It was time to take action.</p><p>Each step deeper into the nothing felt like a bad idea, and my pulse was so strong, my heart gunning in my throat so hard it was almost difficult to breathe. The wall under my fingertips felt slimy yet gritty; I lifted my hand every few seconds to wipe some of the smut away, but it stuck to my skin like a bad memory.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cry for us?\u201d a little voice asked; I froze\u2014my arms out in front, hands angled to the ground. The voice sounded so close, like the child who owned it was right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhere...where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your left,\u201d it said very quietly.</p><p>I turned my head, brushing my hands out blindly in that same direction, stopping on metal, realising then that I came further than I thought. I\u2019d half expected to feel the matchbox at my toes or at least hear the dripping of the leaky faucet I heard before, but there was nothing\u2014not even the murky, rotten smell.</p><p>Using the bars, I felt my way down to the floor\u2014hoping the children didn't grab my hand. \u201cAre you\u2014are you out of the cell?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d I said, combing around the dirt. \u201cI\u2019ll light a match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat big man put them with the lantern,\u201d the child said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the lantern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d On my knees, I shuffled slowly to the back wall and ran my hands over each bump in the bricks until my fingers met with something cold and hard. And sure enough, the matches were in the lantern. I had to use all my other senses to get the damn box open, pull out a match and strike it, and when my fingertips, wrist and the base of the lantern showed under the flame\u2019s gentle glow, I held my breath instead of exhaling relief, in case I blew it out. The cinder of smoke and warm flame ran past my nostrils, though, despite holding my breath, and circled the calm spot of familiarity inside me.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from the lantern to the cell, and saw it then\u2014a child, with its back to me, its pale grey skin hugging each pebble-like bone in its spine.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure that little boy was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now. He\u2019s not breathing.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth with shaky fingers. \u201cWill he be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, placing the lantern beside my knees as I sat down in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the child said, making no effort to look at me. I wondered what I\u2019d see in that face; if he hid it because he knew the truths that burrowed deep within his dark little soul, or if he was hiding because he was shy.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why they lock you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re bad\u2014you\u2019re not bad.\u201d I slid closer to the cage. \u201cYou\u2019re just a vampire. The ones who lock you away are afraid you won\u2019t control the killing\u2014that you might hurt too many humans.\u201d</p><p>He didn't say anything, just kept moving his arm back and forth.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPlaying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoughts and crosses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that game. Can I play, too?\u201d</p><p>He turned around and his black eyes looked so chilling, yet full of so much innocence my heart burned. \u201cDo you have a stick?\u201d the boy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I looked around, not seeing one, so I stood up and grabbed the keys off the wall. \u201cI can use these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cYou be crosses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I took a quick glance into the back of the cell, my mouth dropping when I saw the other children; each one sat in small groups, whispering to each other, watching us or playing games of their own. My hand shook as I made a game board in the dirt\u2014on my side of the bars. \u201cCan you reach this?\u201d</p><p>The boy rose onto his knees and slowly placed his stick through the bars. His hand was so tiny\u2014covered in dried and fresh blood, cacked with dirt. His nails were long, really long, with black ridges making lines all the way down them. I felt the sting of the healed scratches those nails had given me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make my cross in the centre,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s always the best place to start.\u201d</p><p>He considered the board for a moment, then drew a circle on the far corner.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d I said, looking away from his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggot?\u201d I frowned, then laughed. \u201cOh, is that what the keeper calls you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's what he calls everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I stopped for a second, listening, sure I heard a distant echo in the direction I came from. \u201cThat\u2019s not your name. What did your mum and dad call you before you came here? Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes narrowed, strained concentration making his face appear aged beyond his probably only six human years. \u201cMaxwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThen, that\u2019s your name\u2014not Maggot.\u201d I stood up and dusted myself off. \u201cI'm coming back for you\u2014all of you, and I'm going to give you a home. You\u2019re not monsters, okay? But you will have to learn to behave. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let us play outside\u2014see the grass?\u201d A little girl appeared, her fingers around the bars, her smiling face pressed between them.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I placed my hand over my heart to steady it. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's what the last one said,\u201d Max muttered.</p><p>\u201cLast one? What last one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe angel,\u201d another piped up from the back of the cell.</p><p>\u201cHair of gold,\u201d said another.</p><p>\u201cArietta.\u201d A tall, almost teenage boy stood up and walked over to me. \u201cShe promised to set us free\u2014but she never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe had a baby,\u201d said another. \u201cPeople don't care about other kids when they have their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, no.\u201d I grabbed the bars and pressed my face between them. \u201cYou don't understand. She died. She never got to have her baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, are you going to die too?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Max.\u201d I touched his dirty, blonde hair. \u201cI'm the new queen. I\u2014\u201d I looked at the keys on the floor beside the lantern. \u201cI'm going to let you out. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike grabbed my hand and yanked me back from the bars; the children fled from sight. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not monsters, Mike,\u201d I beamed.</p><p>He swept the keys off the floor and stood up again, groaning. \u201cWhen are you going to learn? You never listen. Never! One day you're going to get yourself killed, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, they talked to me. They\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, nice trick, isn't it? They're predators, Ara.\u201d He stepped into me. \u201cWhat did you think they were doing? They want to eat you\u2014not befriend you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mike yelled, taking both my arms, the keys pressing into my flesh. \u201cListen carefully. I stayed while they were being fed. I sat there\u2014\u201d he pointed across from the cell, \u201c\u2014I watched the keeper drag a woman in\u2014tied up, unconscious. He threw her into the cell, slammed the door, and the Damned did nothing. Nothing. Until the woman stirred.\u201d He walked a step away, running a hand through his hair. \u201cShe started breathing heavily, panicking. Next thing I know, I hear this rip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of rip?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Damned untied her, baby. They unbound her hands and her feet, and they let her run. They let her cower by the bars, screaming for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, don't. You're lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not lying,\u201d he yelled. \u201cThis is what they do. This is not a joke. David, Eric, even Emily\u2014what they are is not a joke. They kill people. Those Damned moved in on that woman\u2014they ripped her clothes off, held her arms apart and fed on her, kept her alive, her blood warm and pumping until she was goddamn well dry as the Mojave Desert.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, covering my ears. \u201cI don't believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't? Fine.\u201d He grabbed his phone from his pocket, thumbed it until iTorch came on, then angled it to the back of the cage. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>I turned my head slowly, squinting at first, then covered my face, squealing as the last dregs of an image shivered through my spine. \u201cThat\u2019s not real.\u201d I looked up again at the naked woman, her body spread like a white, fleshy butterfly, glued to the back wall\u2014her bones missing from her skin. \u201cThat\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is real.\u201d</p><p>My gut heaved as I folded over, gripping my knees.</p><p>\u201cDo you see now? Do you take me seriously now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I walked slowly over to the cage and peered inside. I could hear them in there, playing, laughing, like that dead woman was just a bear-skin rug on the wall in their father\u2019s study. \u201cBut, they play, Mike, and I talked with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a lure.\u201d He dragged me away from the cage by the arm. \u201cYou open that door, they will take you apart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don't agree.\u201d I pulled my arm free. \u201cThat boy held a civil conversation with me. If they were treated properly\u2014fed and loved and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cReally? You're too old for this. I can't keep chasing you around\u2014trying to protect you from stupid things like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don't,\u201d I said and grabbed the keys from his hand. \u201cThey won't hurt me, Mike. I'm not a kill. I'm not their next meal. They trust me. They want to be free, and I know they can behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen open that door.\u201d He presented it, conceit refining his grin.</p><p>I thrust my shoulders back, held my head high and jammed the key in the lock, but stopped before turning it. What if he was right? What if they really were monsters?</p><p>But David never believed that. He believed we could help them; he wanted me to help them\u2014told me I wasn\u2019t worth a damn if I didn't have the heart to help them.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike said gently. \u201cWhy don't we just sit down and talk about this?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at him. \u201cIf I do, will you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit, Ara, move!\u201d A breath of shock started my heart when he jumped toward me, my fingers scrunching together around the key as a small hand forced it in a turn. Mike grabbed my wrist, his fingers slipping along it as I jolted forward, landing on my hands and knees, the door hitting the wall with a loud metal echo. \u201cAra, run!\u201d</p><p>I looked up from my dirt-covered fingers, wide eyes taking in the open cage for only a heartbeat before I sunk to the ground, covering my head as the force of twenty screaming children came down on top of me like racing horses. I heard Mike cry out somewhere under the terror of their shrieks, and then, like a storm passing in a whirlwind of racket and chaos, the noise retreated suddenly, leaving me alone on the floor, untouched, with only an eerie still surrounding me. I curled up as small as I could get, trying in vein to quiet my panicked breath.</p><p>Several seconds passed, counted out by the thump in my chest.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I slowly pushed up on my hands and turned my head to the dark space he\u2019d been standing before. He was gone. \u201cNo.\u201d A small cry of panic quivered in the back of my throat. I reached forward, my hands trembling so viciously my elbows shook, and felt for a wall or the bars\u2014anything. But all I found was cold dirt.</p><p>The panic rose again; I shuffled back further into the cell, tucking my knees to my chest, seeing that dead woman in my thoughts as my eyes scanned the darkness.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whispered, my gut expanding then shrinking quickly back in when I saw a silhouette in the corridor; it stood there, three feet high, still as death\u2014looking right at me.</p><p>A bubble of dread burst open in the middle of my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked in a small voice.</p><p>The thing stepped forward, its slow steps clipped, forced, a raspy, grating sound coming from its throat.</p><p>I jumped to my feet, squealing like a small child, and cupped the edge of the iron door, swinging it closed. The twang of metal echoed down the tunnel and its small hand shot in through the bars, the horrid creature spitting and growling at me like it was some kind of rabid beast. It pressed its cheeks against the cage, the skin on its face pulling its eyes into tiny slits, showing bared, bloodied teeth and a long tongue, licking the iron.</p><p>The ground stayed under my feet as I took a few slow steps backward, finding the wall with flat palms. But as I stopped, the child pulled back, turning its head slowly to look across from me, then disappeared.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I rolled my chin upward, pressing the base of my head into the stone wall, and let myself cry for a moment. Mike was gone. Who knew if he made it out to get help or if they bludgeoned him before he reached the end of the tunnel? Who knew if some of the Damned had escaped and were ravishing the manor as I stood here, crying tears of self-pity?</p><p>I wished I\u2019d just waited. I wasn't going to open that damn door. I was just trying to make a point, and the worst part was, I couldn\u2019t even remember what point I was trying to make in the first place. I wasn't even sure it mattered. Well, I guess it didn't matter now. I looked around the thick darkness, hardly able to see the red chipped paint on the bars, and certainly blind to the corners and deeper depths of this cell.</p><p>I wiped my face and ran forward, grabbing the bars, and shook them. But the door was stuck fast, trapping me in this cage with partially decomposed bodies, the scent enough to make me want to stick my fingers down my throat just be sure I hadn't swallowed any vestiges of rotten flesh. And somewhere under my fear of what was real, what was right outside this door, dangerous enough to rip me apart, I also wondered if the troubled ghosts of those who\u2019d been killed so violently here haunted these cells.</p><p>But another thought occurred to me then; even if I did get this door open, how was I to know if the damned weren't just waiting for me\u2014hoping I\u2019d be smart enough to escape, so they could chase me, warm my blood with fear, then tear off my clothes too, and drink my blood. And maybe I wouldn't die from that; maybe I could be regenerated, but I wasn't too excited about being ripped apart.</p><p>Weighing options up in my thoughts, I paid no mind to the sound of a soft breeze, until it started to take shape, form into what I thought were words. I stopped thinking, my whole body going still as I listened. But the noise stopped, too.</p><p>Maybe it was just the wind. I had no way of knowing which sounds were normal down here, and which weren't. It made me think more about the Damned\u2014how frightening it must be for new children to come here, be thrown away, out of sight, out of mind, never to be seen or heard of again.</p><p>I stopped thinking, my ears pricked; the sound of the whisper spreading through the darkness. I tried to focus on it, make out words, but it stopped. After a few seconds of silence, I walked slowly forward, seeing what I thought was an outline of a rock on the floor, and sunk to my knees in front of the bars. There hadn't been any rocks out there in corridor before. I wondered what that was, and as I looked closer, the object sharpened into a boot. A big, heavy, black boot. Mike\u2019s boot.</p><p>The sound of my shock echoed around me in a breathy gasp; I covered my mouth, trying not to squeal, but the air came back into my throat in a quivering, high-pitched whimper. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>I reached through the bars, my pale white arm stretching as far as it would go, yet not far enough.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I said again, yanking my hand back, checking the space outside the bars for a small hand or set of teeth that might grab me.</p><p>All was still. Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. But I could feel things around me\u2014feel eyes on me, prickling the hairs on the back of my neck. It didn't matter, though. Even if the Damned grabbed my hand and ripped my arm off as soon as I reached for Mike again, I still had to try\u2014to see if I could wake him. Right now, with them out there and me in here, Mike was kind of my only hope.</p><p>After another few breaths, each one building confidence, I reached out slowly through the bars again, my shoulder pressing past the limits, my chin going with it, making my fingers longer. I held my breath, biting my teeth together, and finally touched the tip of his boot, celebrating a quiet moment of victory before getting up on my knees a little more. I sent my hand back out into enemy territory, the top of my arm sore, burning from the force of the metal, and this time, my nails caught the sole of his boot. I tugged a little, but my fingers slipped, falling to the ground as the shoe disappeared, leaving a trail behind in the dirt where something dragged Mike\u2019s body deeper into the darkness.</p><p>I jerked my hand back, tucking it into my ribs as I landed against the wall, squeaking to myself. They were out there; the damned were out in the world, and they had Mike. I couldn't see him, or hear him breathing\u2014tried to listen for the sound of vampires feeding, but it was like they\u2019d just disappeared, locked me in and thrown away the key.</p><p>I rubbed a flat palm across my hairline, then looked up, eyes bright with new hope. That\u2019s it. The key. Maybe it was still in the lock.</p><p>I got to my knees and sifted around in the dirt before heading to the door. It had to be there.</p><p>But my swift movement stirred something, woke something that had clearly been sleeping\u2014something still in the cage, with me. It groaned, becoming a solid figure as it creeped out of the shadows, moving by its hands, like a dog with no legs, dragging them loosely behind it.</p><p>I sat very still, covering my mouth to block the scent of fresh vampire blood and urine coming off its body like heat.</p><p>Whatever it was hadn't seen me yet, but it would smell me soon enough.</p><p>My thoughts left my mouth in a whispering curse, and the thing turned its head, looking right this way; its dark eyes fixing on mine, growing wider inside its head as it hissed, shifting direction quickly, snaking toward me.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I jumped to my feet, leaped for the bars and climbed, hooking my foot in a hold on the second rung. But it slipped, sending my body into a spin, my toes nearly touching the ground again. I quickly glanced back at the child, but it was gone, leaving only a trail where it\u2019d dragged its limp little body through the dirt, toward me\u2014its next meal. My eyes darted across the floor, the world freezing around me when I spotted it, less than an arms-length away.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I squealed, pulling myself up higher, clutching the bars in a bone-white grip. \u201cMike! Get up. Please, Mike!\u201d I grabbed the top of the cage, angling my head away from the stone roof, my shoulders hunched against it. When I looked back down, a small hand shot up at me, just missing my foot as I jerked away. The child growled in the back of its throat, the sound coming out through caged teeth, like it was smiling.</p><p>\u201cMike! Please!\u201d I screamed over at him, aiming my voice down, as if mere volume could wake the dead. But my breath stopped short of my lips when several heads lifted from the aura of his body, smearing blood across their mouths. And under the dead silence, as each eye turned to find me, every fear I ever had\u2014every creature under the bed, every man in my closet, became apparent in that one breath.</p><p>If I stayed here, my fingers wrapped around the bars, toes edged out into their world, they\u2019d grab me. But if I dropped down\u2014back into the cage, the demon at my feet would own me\u2014rip me apart.</p><p>My limbs went tight with tension. I\u2019d never been good at decision-making. But they were closing in\u2014slowly walking toward the cage, while the demon under me fastened its fingers around the bars, pulling itself closer, its legs dangling behind it like dead meat.</p><p>\u201cGet off!\u201d I thrust my foot into its head, feeling its hair under my toes.</p><p>It went down, its tiny hand shooting up, catching my ankle.</p><p>\u201cPlease. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in your cage!\u201d A thunderous voice broke through the darkness, and like a dragon scorching the night sky, hunting for its young, the children shrieked, their entourage breaking apart, forcing the cage door open beside me.</p><p>I fell to the floor with a thud so hard my teeth knocked together inside my mouth, and the child\u2019s hand locked around my foot. There was nothing to grab\u2014no time to roll over and crawl away; it pulled me closer as the chaos of bodies moved past us, and opened its mouth, its tongue rolling out over my toes.</p><p>But my foot came loose suddenly, sending me, with all my fight, tumbling back on my hands\u2014the keeper\u2019s stick coming down, spearing the demon\u2019s shoulder. It screeched, cupping its neck, scrambling around to find ground with its hands.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t watch. I didn't want to see this again; I curled up on the floor, hands over my head, knees tucked to my chest, and cried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou foolish little girl.\u201d The keeper grabbed my wrist and dragged me across the dirt\u2014hooking his toes around the cage door to close it as he shoved me into the bloody heap that was my best friend.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I whimpered, rising up on my hands to touch his face. \u201cMike. Please be okay.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn't okay. His chest, his neck, his whole shirt was drenched in the sticky, thick paste of redness they\u2019d drained from his veins. I shook his shoulders, slapping his cheek, listening for breath.</p> <p>\u201cDo something!\u201d I yelled at the keeper.</p><p>\u201cNuttin\u2019 to be done now, missy. You got what you came \u2018ere for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d I spun around to look at him, spite littering my upturned lip.</p><p>\u201cA lesson.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>I was about to find the nearest rock and ditch it at his head, but Mike grumbled, his hand moving to grasp his neck.</p> <p>\u201cMike?\u201d I sat back on my heels, giving him space.</p><p>\u201cArgh. You\u2014\u201d he groaned, rolling up. \u201cNever. Listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm so sorry, Mike. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d he said, thumbing a massive gash on his elbow. \u201cI\u2019ve just attended a three-course meal, Ara, and I was the bloody main.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I was about to say I should\u2019ve listened to you, but Mike cut in with \u201cNo, you\u2019re not\u201d and stumbled to his feet, leaving me on the ground to look up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re bloody lucky those Damned were just fed, or I\u2019d be in the regeneration chamber right now.\u201d He winced, wiping his jaw. \u201cThat really freakin hurts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d The keeper looked down at me, leaning on his metal stick. \u201cLearned any valuable lessons today, Your Royal Pain in the Arse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I scoffed. \u201cYou can't call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll allow it this time,\u201d Mike said, shaking his obviously very irritating sore arm. \u201cAfter all, he was right about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right\u2014that you\u2019d come back down here and let those Damned out,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I left the keys on the hook?\u201d The caretaker pointed to the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou set me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I'm sorry, but you always have to learn the hard way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean...?\u201d I clambered to my feet, using the wall to steady myself. \u201cYou knew they\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Ara. Did you think I was stupid?\u201d Mike shook his head and clapped the keeper on the shoulder, like they were best buds. \u201cWe had you figured before you even came down here today. The doors were barricaded at the other end so the Damned wouldn\u2019t get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, what, you were just gonna let them rip me apart?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, half laughing, half folding over in agony, propping his hands to his knees. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHu!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019d heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they ate my heart or took my head off!\u201d</p><p>He stood up, wiping a hand across his nose. \u201cI was watching for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you mean you were conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Ate onion this morning and everything, just to make my blood less appealing.\u201d He rubbed the gaping wound on his neck. \u201cHad extra blood, too, so I\u2019d heal faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll thank me one day,\u201d he said smugly and picked up a lantern. \u201cYou needed to see that people generally do things for a reason, Ara. Just because you don't agree, doesn't make it wrong.\u201d</p><p>Mute with bewilderment and disappointment, I looked back at the children. \u201cI really thought they were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you thought.\u201d Mike wrapped a heavy arm over my neck; he smelled of blood mixed with dirt and sweat, and, now I thought about it\u2014onion. \u201cExactly what the last person who talked to them thought, too\u2014and now she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were making that up\u2014to scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that, Ara? Honestly.\u201d He shook his head again\u2014his new favourite move when it came to me. \u201cShe was all too real, baby. Human. Not lucky enough to be like us. She didn\u2019t even get a chance to heal.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the bloodied mess of Mike\u2019s face, and felt absolutely no pity for him. \u201cWell, you deserve every scratch you got.\u201d I folded my arms and stormed past him. \u201cJerk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d he called after me.</p><p>I stopped. \u201cWhy? So you and your pal there had another chance to beat those children.\u201d</p><p>Mike grabbed my arm, appearing beside me at vamp speed. \u201cNo, Ara\u2014it was the only way to teach you a lesson. Maybe now you might start to realise that, sometimes, what your heart tells you, and what\u2019s right, are two different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart tells me they wouldn\u2019t have hurt me if you weren\u2019t here.\u201d I poked his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s you and that...that thing they\u2019re afraid of.\u201d I pointed at the keeper. I meant the stick, but calling him a thing served my point, too.</p><p>Mike huffed loudly and dropped his arms to his sides. \u201cThere\u2019s just no getting through to you, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it comes to what I believe is right and wrong, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019re a little girl, for God\u2019s sake. You wouldn\u2019t know the complexities of right and wrong if they came up and ripped your hair out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no complexities, Michael! Black and white. That\u2019s it. And the black of it is, those Damned are children.\u201d I pointed a straight arm at their cage. \u201cAnd the white of it is, I'm going to help them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you gonna do?\u201d He leaned forward, towering over me. \u201cLet them loose? Give them a bedroom and a dolly to play with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. But one way or another, I will find a way to make their lives better. I know what they\u2019re capable of now, but that changes nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, they\u2019re like the Children of the Corn, baby. They haven\u2019t been changed by compassion for humans. They see killing in black and white, whether you wanna believe that or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be so, but desperation and loneliness will turn even the sweetest kitten into a savage beast.\u201d I started walking again but stopped and looked down at the little boy, now sitting by the bars again. \u201cWe have no right to create monsters and then punish them for monstrous behaviour, Mike. We start making plans for a new home for them\u2014today!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Petey sat by my feet, well, on my foot, while I leaned my elbows on the balcony railing, trying to spot the lighthouse through the orange glow of sunset. Now that I\u2019d been down to the field and knew where the lighthouse was, I could just make out what I thought was the top, but I wasn\u2019t sure. Below my balcony, the summer smell of the forest mixed with the briny salt of sea spray on the breeze, making me thirsty. Really thirsty.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think he is, Petey?\u201d I asked, scratching him on the head. \u201cIf he doesn't call soon, I think I'm just gonna jump over this balcony and go see him. He promised. He said \u2018every day. I will call you every day. Six, no, nine times a day\u2019. What happened to that?\u201d</p><p>Petey whined, licking his chops.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike\u2019s voice kind of made me cringe. I knew why he was here. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at dinner?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at Petey. \u201cTold ya we\u2019d get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blaming the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his idea,\u201d I said, and Petey groaned, moving to sit by Mike\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cRight. Looks that way,\u201d Mike said, a little smug.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine. I just...I'm too depressed to go down there and pretend I want to listen to everyone argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cA part of our tradition is to dine in community each night. And you\u2019re the princess\u2014you don't get to hide in your room and throw a tantrum because the world isn't going your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike? I just got attacked by a gang of bloodthirsty kindergarteners and I haven\u2019t heard from the man who\u2019s supposed to love me for nearly a week, because he doesn't want to speak to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t want to, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d He scratched just beside his eye. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him for you, okay? But I know he\u2019s just feelin\u2019 it pretty deep\u2014this whole being apart thing. His way of dealing with that is to distance himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAr, you know how it is\u2014like when you talk to a friend on the phone that you haven\u2019t seen in ages. It always hurts more right after you hang up.\u201d He tugged softly on a strand of my hair. \u201cHe still loves ya, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, until he tells me that, in his own words, I think I have a right to feel a bit sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, but you don't get to sit here and wallow in it. You have a responsibly to your people, and a part of that is maintaining rituals, even if you don't feel like it. Now, suck it up and get down stairs.\u201d</p><p>I watched my door swing closed behind him, letting my lip quiver. \u201cI just can't go down there, Petey. I\u2019ll cry. I know it. If I have to sit through another stupid argument between vampires and Lilithians, I think I\u2019ll just burst into tears.\u201d I covered my face. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. I'm not going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if I ask you?\u201d Eric pushed the curtains back and stepped into the pink light of the setting sun.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d I looked back out over the ocean.</p><p>\u201cAra, please. You're the only person worth talking to down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I want to be there?\u201d He leaned against the railing beside me, arms folded, back to the view. \u201cI'm a vampire. I have no real need to eat, but I go\u2014for you.\u201d</p><p>I bit my teeth together, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d He grinned, and that dimple-indent thing leaped off his cheek and hit me in the hard exterior.</p><p>\u201cUhg! Fine.\u201d I threw my hands up. \u201cBut only because I'm hungry\u2014not because you used that cheeky grin on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He cocked his head, winking. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone you can\u2019t resist me\u2014it\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d I punched him softly in the arm.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He grabbed my wrist. \u201cWhen did you last have blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust after the attack\u2014a few hours ago. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee this?\u201d He ran his index finger over my vein. \u201cSee how it\u2019s raised and the smaller veins around it are purple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re blood-thirsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have used a lot to heal.\u201d</p><p>I ran a finger over my wrist. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call up a Sacrificial.\u201d He went to walk away.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don't. I\u2019ll just starve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really hate those guys. They\u2019re so impersonal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's the idea, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...I don't know. Maybe I'm more like you guys than my kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? You want to kill?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNo. Not kill. But...I like the bite\u2014the intimacy. Drinking from some man in a suit, who looks away while I suck his arm, is like washing chocolate down with a glass water, real quick, so you can eat a plate of broccoli.\u201d</p><p>Eric laughed loudly, rolling his head back; his pointy fangs made me miss my vampire so, so much. \u201cHere. You\u2019ll just have to drink from me then, until David can come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you immune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Mike\u2019s been tipping his blood into a cup for me.\u201d He made a face like he was grossed-out.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes you immune to my venom, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo all venom, including Created.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand in a delicate grasp. \u201cI really hope you\u2019re right about that, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not, guess we\u2019ll find out the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d I looked at his wrist, then his caramel eyes, all smiling and knowing. \u201cWhat about the lust?\u201d</p><p>His brow arched high. \u201cAmara, I think we\u2019re a little past all that now. Just drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the prophecy child is no longer an option!\u201d one person said sternly; I rolled my eyes, walking into the Great Hall.</p><p>\u201cI disagree. There is nothing to say it must be conceived with a firstborn son of Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and if it was, Arthur is a firstborn anyway, so he could impregnate her.\u201d</p><p>I looked right at Arthur when I heard that, my lip turned up; he closed his eyes, shaking his head as if to say \u2018sorry\u2019.</p><p>\u201cLook, right now, we need to focus on catching Drake,\u201d Mike cut in. \u201cWe can debate the prophecy after that.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stood suddenly, conversations ceasing as I pulled my chair out. I held the urge to swallow in the silence until, as I sat down, everyone else followed, making quiet chatter again.</p><p>\u201cWe should be focusing on the coronation,\u201d Portly woman said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Steps. We must look at this in steps. The coronation needs to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said, unfolding my napkin.</p><p>A few people shook their heads, a couple of eyes rolling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sacrificial right,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt completes the process of your transformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInto a Lilithian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a person being baptised,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBaptised? But I don't believe in God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is irrelevant,\u201d Arthur\u2019s tone was a little harsher than usual.</p><p>\u201cYes, see, Your Majesty, that Stone has power,\u201d Moustache Man said with a bit of a stutter. \u201cIt is said to be the scale that measures balance between all living things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd when you make a promise to assist it, you become a part of Nature\u2019s army,\u201d a woman in a pink blouse said, \u201clike a bee or a seed, helping keep things in greater order\u2014all life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like, I can make a plant grow by touching it?\u201d I half laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt is not just the plants you will command,\u201d Moustache Man said, \u201cbut the animals\u2014all creatures that walk this earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll living creatures,\u201d someone corrected.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Moustache Man amended.</p><p>\u201cWell, what un-living creatures are there, if vampires aren\u2019t undead?\u201d</p> <p>The room grew silent. Everyone seemed to have an answer but no one wanted to say it.</p><p>\u201cGhosts?\u201d I asked, smiling under high arched brows of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cThe issue at hand here is not what you will rule, but what you must do before you can,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cAnd, so, I\u2019ll be a complete Lilithian vampire when I make my oath on the Stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the full ceremony is complete, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't really understand how a simple coronation can change things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, like making your Confirmation in God\u2019s church, you will be bound, the slit of which your purity and your power enters and leaves your soul will, essentially, be sewn shut\u2014set in stone. You will be one with Mother Nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. So, if Drake\u2019s destructive and cruel, not really balancing things, how come the Stone lets him rule? Can't it just do some mumbo jumbo magic and get rid of him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Stone is not there to maintain balance. It is a gateway\u2014an energy point that connects the earth and all living creatures to the human world. It has no power to change things itself,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cIt needs...assistants. Bodies connected to this realm, of which can do its bidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, so Drake was, what, fired?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Drake never made an oath on the Stone. He commissioned the monarchy and the laws, and is deemed ruler by law, by vote, but it is the one who Nature deems worthy that counts. He can remain on the throne of the vampires, but once you make your oath and prove your worth, Mother Nature will deem you the only ruler\u2014like Lilith before you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and with Her backing,\u201d Portly Woman said, \u201cHeaven help any who try to get in your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do we really need to catch Drake and let this prophecy child kill him? Can't we just coexist, you know, he can rule the vampires and I rule all else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake has become a power hungry man,\u201d another said. \u201cHe serves a purpose outside maintaining balance now, and that is why Fate has placed you here, it is why there is a child prophesised to kill him, it is why we must not allow him to continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s so bad about him? What\u2019s he doing that deems him worthy of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack magic. He incurred a curse on this land many centuries ago, and the runes of the old language once said the curse would come again, with a great darkness commissioned by Drake\u2014around the time of a new queen\u2019s rising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d an old man said. \u201cAside from prophecies on parchment, written in languages most can no longer read, by a vampire no one has seen in centuries, we Lilithians have been predicting futures by use of stones marked with Symbols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you predicted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But not this prophecy child.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, suddenly more interested, while the rest of the table shushed the old man.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, I want to hear this. So...you think there\u2019s no child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, there is a child, but she is of little significance\u2014in this chapter of Drake\u2019s story, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...will she be the one to free the Damned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not had any...\u201d The old man shook his head a few times, looking at the man who pretty much looked like his double. \u201cI don't believe we\u2019ve prophesised such a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Vampirie did, right?\u201d I said, then looked at Arthur, who stared at Morgaine, his eyes narrowed with thought.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, suddenly sitting taller. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve deciphered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I looked back at the old man. \u201cVampirie says one thing; what did you predict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo paths,\u201d the old man said. When he stood, I noticed the grey cloak he wore, very out of place among the modern suits and sequined dresses. \u201cA great queen would rise and give birth to a new Order, where two kinds would live in peace. She will defeat the evil for love of a child, but the story will not end there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what happens next?\u201d I realised I was sitting really far forward.</p><p>\u201cWe...we don't know,\u201d he said in a shaky voice and sat back down.</p><p>\u201cDarkness,\u201d his double said. \u201cAs if the path does not exist, or perhaps has no determination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like a plan-your-own-future story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, or perhaps a decision must be made before the door opens.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to myself. \u201cSo, you said there were two paths? What was the other one?\u201d</p><p>Another old man stood, tucking his long beard to his chest as he bowed to me. \u201cA curse, Majesty. If you choose the wrong path, a Darkness will rebirth the curse on these lands. We have seen it\u2014seen death, destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how can we stop that from happening? Did you get any clues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>I waited.</p><p>\u201cLove must offer life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Nhym, in the old language,\u201d said the man in the grey cloak.</p><p>\u201cWell, how do we do that? Is it, like, I offer my life in service, or sacrifice myself on the Stone? What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door to any path reveals itself as you walk, Princess.\u201d The man standing sat back down. \u201cWhen the time comes, you will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2014in the meantime, I get some freaky power from Mother Nature by making an oath on some stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not just some stone,\u201d Grey Sideburns said. \u201cIt is connected deeply to your roots\u2014to Vampirie\u2019s mother, Lilith\u2014your ancestor. Do not have such little respect.\u201d</p><p>The idea that facts surrounded her story made me feel connected\u2014made me feel a part of myth and legend, as if I knew Lilith once. \u201cSo she was real? Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has proved she either existed or that she didn't. So, until they do, we have only stories and faith,\u201d Arthur said, raising his glass.</p><p>\u201cLike God.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll give it a go. Bring on this coronation and let\u2019s see if I really do have Mother Nature\u2019s backing, then I\u2019ll go catch Drake myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what with him?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>I looked around at all the faces; they wanted me to say kill, but I wasn't going to do that unless I really had to.</p><p>\u201cKill him,\u201d Morgaine said, jamming her heel into my ankle.</p><p>\u201cOuch\u2014ur, yeah.\u201d I sat back. \u201cFigure out how to kill him, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a fight on your hands. You must make sure you\u2019re strong before you do this.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. That much, I knew. But it was like going to a party that hadn\u2019t listed a dress code on the invitation; I had no idea what to expect. For all I knew, he could be like the Head Boss in a video game\u2014a riddle I had to figure out on the spot, and I was sure there wouldn\u2019t be any \u2018power up\u2019 cartridges or \u2018health packs\u2019 lying around when I reached a hundred points.</p><p>\u201cI disagree. From a tactical standpoint, sending an inexperienced fighter\u2014a young girl\u2014to catch an ancient warrior is a bad idea. I mean, this is Ara we\u2019re talking about\u2014\u201d Mike presented me, looking at Eric then Morgaine. \u201cShe\u2019s not capable of something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you just need a little faith, yourself, Michael,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cI don't believe you know what that girl is capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI train with her. I taught her everything she knows. She can't even fight off a mob of human attackers yet. How\u2019s she gonna measure up against Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce she has made her oath, her powers will enrich,\u201d the old cloak man said. \u201cGive her a chance before you place limitations on her.\u201d</p><p>Mike sat back. I knew he wouldn\u2019t believe I could just become more powerful by spilling blood on some rock and making a promise; it wasn't factual enough for him. He needed something tangible, a weapon\u2014a heavy object he could throw, not a mythical story passed down from old man to old man, translated from several different languages since its inception. And maybe he was right not to place too much faith in oracles. But, at the same time, the idea of the runes really sparked my interest. They held more worth, in my mind, than some half-ripped, hard to read prophecy Morgaine, who wasn\u2019t even an expert, had deciphered. I wanted Arthur\u2019s opinion on what the prophecy said. But he hadn\u2019t mentioned it to me at all\u2014like he was avoiding it.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, right now, it\u2019s not Amara\u2019s battle with Drake you need to prepare her for, Mike,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Walk of Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat's the Walk of faith?\u201d I asked, and everyone groaned.</p><p>Mike swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou didn't tell her?\u201d Morgaine looked right at him.</p><p>\u201cI...I was going to.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to seal your oath, you must prove your worth,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cThis is the right of passage Arthur mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA walk is a right of passage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, see, to prove you have the courage and strength to rule, you will take the path of treachery, walk darkness in isolation, to find hope and bring it back to your people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you find hope? It\u2019s not a thing; a stick, a pebble, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cBasically, by doing the walk you\u2019re finding the hope\u2014or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, so I have to walk. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou start it after you swear your oath\u2014a part of the ceremony that will weaken you, both physically and spiritually,\u201d Moustache Man said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you must leave the border of the forest before dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy before dawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you don't, a; you will be trapped in there for eternity.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd b; you will have failed your people. You will not be crowned as queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down at my plate. \u201cSo, I just wander around the forest for the night, that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won't be that simple, my lady,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt will be pitch black, you will be exhausted, burning from your markings and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are...things in the forest,\u201d Portly Woman interrupted. \u201cOnly myths and stories have been told of the dangers you must face and the fears you must overcome to prove your worth, but even those are enough to see brave men run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, or it\u2019s just a forest and she draws pictures in the dirt with a stick for the night and walks up the hill as the sun starts to show,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Morgaine folded her napkin. \u201cWe\u2019ve no way of knowing. Not one who entered that forest after making an oath ever came out\u2014except Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they were not proved to be Lilithians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no way of proving it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said, sure it was becoming my new favourite word. \u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to prove\u2014just give them a vampire for lunch and see if he dies from the bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where do you propose we\u2019d have gotten one of those?\u201d someone else asked. \u201cDo you think Drake would just hand one over\u2014let us kill it? If he knew those of us who weren't imprisoned in the cells were searching for a pure blood all these centuries, he\u2019d have had us all beheaded.\u201d</p><p>I touched my hand to my collarbones; to the place I could only pretend I had my locket. \u201cOkay, so, this Walk of Faith is quite possibly fatal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Morgaine said, issuing a stern glare down the table. \u201cBut not likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't have to do this, baby.\u201d Mike reached across and rubbed my shoulder blade.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don't. This is your life, Ara, if you don't want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Mike, disagreeable obligations don\u2019t relieve a princess of her duties\u2014you of all people would be the first to tell me that.\u201d I looked around the table. \u201cThis changes nothing.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at their dinner, except Arthur, who bowed his head to me and smiled. Mike sat back, but his face burned pink with rage and his eyes fixed to one spot on his plate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI say we set a date for the coronation at the House meeting tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It will be discussed between the Private Council first,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cIt should be an event determined and agreed on by all, not just those who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d I stopped it before it started. \u201cI am officially ruling that no one talks politics or battle tactics at the table for the rest of the night. I am so sick of these arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here.\u201d Arthur rapped his knuckles on the table and dug a fork into his dinner.</p><p>Slowly, everyone went about their meals, and quiet conversations around the table made for a very pleasant evening. Until Eric mentioned le Ch\u00e2teau de la Mort.</p><p>\u201cElysium!\u201d Arthur slammed his napkin on the table; I glanced up, shocked.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Councilman. I meant no disrespect.\u201d Eric looked into his plate.</p> <p>\u201cLet it be known\u2014\u201d Arthur pointed at each person along the table, \u201c\u2014this is the last time anyone will call my home such a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hang on.\u201d I frowned across at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took his napkin up again and flipped it into his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nickname,\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what David always called it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d Arthur\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p> <p>\u201cUrm...uh, maybe it wasn't him who called it that.\u201d I didn't want to get him in trouble when he \u2018came back to life.\u2019 \u201cSo, what\u2019s it really called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLe Ch\u00e2teau Elysium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElysium? Is that like the gardens in the rivers of the Underworld\u2014in Greek Mythology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur gave Eric a sideways glance. \u201cWhen the castle was built by my ancestor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ancestor?\u201d I screeched, then gulped it all back in. \u201cI mean...sorry. Continue...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur said, letting out a breath through his nostrils. \u201cThe castle was commissioned by a man named John Philippe Knight\u2014built as a home, a sanctuary\u2014a place to end all journeys. And so, he named it after the place he believed to be the afterlife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why do they call it the Castle of Death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the Dead,\u201d Eric corrected, becoming smaller beside Arthur.</p> <p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Arthur turned his head slowly to look away from Eric. \u201cBeing that, in Greek Mythology, Elysium is a place the dead go and, over the centuries many deaths occurred at the castle, vampires have quite amused themselves with this heinous nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but, Elysium is were the blessed dead go, right? Like Heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. It is a place of rest, a sanctuary. Not a tomb,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd this bothers you?\u201d I asked. \u201cThis nickname.\u201d</p><p>He eyed each of the faces staring back at him. \u201cI grew up there, as a boy. It was always only a home to me. I\u2019ll not have her name tarnished by ignorance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cFine. Like Arthur said, no one calls it de la Mort again. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Everyone on both sides of the table nodded, mumbling to themselves.</p><p>Arthur bowed his head, smiling softly. \u201cThank you for your support, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Petey and I laid on my bed, listening to music, while my foot tapped out the beat of all my emotions. The night outside was incredibly still, slipping past my open balcony door and resting on my brow in a mist of perspiration. It made Petey\u2019s fur, where I lay my head on his ribs, stick to the back of my neck. \u201cThis song reminds me of her, you know\u2014of my mum.\u201d</p><p>As always, Petey didn\u2019t respond, but I told him all about her anyway\u2014all about her terrible cooking, the boyfriend who left when she fell pregnant with Harry, and the way she\u2019d dance around the living room with me, singing into hairbrushes. It almost felt like Petey shared my loss, like he knew her too, or at least knew what it felt like to miss somebody that much.</p><p>When my playlist ended, I talked a while longer, letting midnight creep closer and closer, while the distant song of a cricket gave me a feeling of safety, knowing there were no evil vampires down in the garden, thankfully. Not even my knights. But they were right out in the corridor\u2014guarding me from evil housekeepers and deadly dust motes.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a kid being punished and made to stay in her room,\u201d I said to Petey. \u201cI mean, I know I can leave, but I feel like Falcon\u2019s my dad\u2014waiting to bark at me if I come out.\u201d</p><p>The dog\u2019s chest shook a little, his musty kibble breath making me cringe.</p><p>I rolled over and looked into his pale blue eyes. \u201cDid you just laugh, Petey?\u201d</p><p>He held eye contact, his tongue hanging out, but beyond that gaze was the kind of awareness I\u2019d always seen there\u2014like he was an old soul. \u201cI wonder how you became his dog, Petey\u2014Jason\u2019s,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I wish I could read your mind\u2014wish you could talk to me about him.\u201d</p><p>Petey edged forward and licked my nose; I giggled, pushing him away by his collar.</p><p>\u201cI'm okay, boy. It\u2019s just...well, I don't see him so much in my dreams now. It\u2019s almost like I was left with a certain amount of memories, and now I've used them all up.\u201d I thought about his sparkling green eyes, how I loved them in a different way to what I love David's\u2014like they looked the same, but detained different truths. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, you know\u2014this...well, David just isn't who I thought he was, and I...\u201d I couldn\u2019t say it to Petey, because I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d figured it out in my own head yet. \u201cLove means loving someone no matter what, right?\u201d</p><p>A low whine sounded in the back of Petey\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cThere are just so many things in David\u2019s past that I still don't know, and I'm starting to wonder if I would love him if I knew them all. And him not speaking to me just leaves me alone with all this in my head, and I can't sort it out myself, Petey. I can't. I am the worst advice giver ever, and yet I'm the only one that can give myself advice about this.\u201d</p><p>The dog cocked his head; I looked down at his big, heavy paws, making impressions in my white quilt, then flopped onto my back and wound my hair around my fingertip.</p><p>\u201cIf this was Emily I was speaking to, and she said, \u2018hey, Ara, my husband was really cruel as a child and everyone who knew him as an adult cringes when they think of him,\u2019 I\u2019d tell her she should run, you know. That it\u2019d only be a matter of time before that cruelty came out on her. But I love him.\u201d I sighed, half waiting for Petey to tell me what to do. \u201cI don't know. Maybe I just need to see him. Maybe when I look into his eyes and see the humanity I know is there, I\u2019ll forget everything I've made him out to be in my mind while I\u2019ve been here.\u201d I sat up and jumped off the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Petey. I'm going to see him!\u201d</p><p>My iPod fell off the bed with the sudden movement; I grabbed it and pressed play on the David playlist, then opened Arietta\u2019s dresser drawer, pulled out my hairbrush, lip-gloss and a few other travel essentials, stopping when a low growl sounded from behind me.</p><p>I spun round to Petey\u2019s bared teeth. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He didn't answer, so I turned back to continue gathering stuff, but the dog appeared beside me, snatching my hairbrush up in his teeth.</p><p>\u201cHey! Give that back.\u201d</p><p>He leaped over my bed and ran across the room.</p><p>\u201cGet back here!\u201d I climbed over the pillowy obstacle and darted after him. \u201cI'm going, Petey. You can't stop me.\u201d</p><p>The white ball of fur dropped the brush between his paws and showed his teeth again, growling, probably attempting to look scary.</p><p>\u201cArgh. I'm not afraid of some overgrown marshmallow with a throat condition.\u201d I stomped over and grabbed my hairbrush, all slimy and gooey, from the floor. \u201cAnd what's it to you, anyway? You're a dog!\u201d</p><p>He sneezed at me, wiping his paw across the brow of his nose a few times.</p><p>\u201cPetey, I have no idea what that means.\u201d I opened my bedroom door for him. \u201cNow, get your fluffy tail out of my room and let me pack. And don\u2019t think I won\u2019t lock you outside if you show me those teeth one more time, Petey.\u201d</p><p>He trotted off, and I looked at Falcon, who leaned back, propping his foot on the wall as he folded his arms. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, and slammed the door. I can't believe I have to defend my plans to a canine. And what\u2019s worse, Falcon definitely heard me say \u2018pack.\u2019 My shoulders dropped, my chest sinking with a sigh as I looked at the balcony; I\u2019d have to jump if I was going to escape. And I\u2019d have to move fast. Falcon was not born yesterday. I probably had about three minutes to get out of here.</p><p>I took off on my right foot, the vamp speed knocking a small side table into the corner of an armchair as I passed, and appeared in my wardrobe, still in one piece, then scanned the shelves, top to bottom, for a suitcase or even a plastic shopping bag to stuff my clothes in. A handkerchief folded around a stick would even do. But, there was no need to go all Huckleberry Finn style, since my suitcase was on the top shelf.</p><p>I took a leap toward it, with a little too much speed, and hit my head on the roof before falling back down on my butt in a pathetic heap. \u201cSome vampire you are, Ara,\u201d I said to myself. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you can land better when you jump off the third storey.\u201d</p><p>I clambered to my feet, dusting myself off, and looked up at the top shelf again.</p><p>\u201cI will get you,\u201d I said to the troublesome suitcase; it scowled back down at me. \u201cAnd when I do, I'm going to stuff you so full you won't be able to zip yourself up for a week without lubri\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d Mike asked, leaning on the doorframe; his brow arched, arms folded.</p><p>Petey sat by his feet, his tongue hanging out over his smug dog-grin.</p><p>\u201cDibber-dobber,\u201d I snickered at the over-protective fluff-ball\u2014the dog, not Mike.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Ara?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cAside from holding one-sided conversations with inanimate objects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm going to see David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I slouched forward, skulking out of my wardrobe behind him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat's the point of us trying to protect our last hope if she's going to run off all by herself? What if Drake had a mole out there, just waiting for you to do something stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't care. I'm still going to see David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Come on.\u201d He grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see Morgaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she can talk some sense into you, since you seem to listen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say let her go.\u201d Morgaine shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mike and I both said at the same time\u2014undertones of a different sentiment, though.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Mike, you heard what Arthur said yesterday. Drake\u2019s not after her right now. He\u2019s got other things going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Arthur about Drake?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Morgaine said, as if this was old news.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, he thinks we\u2019re not in any danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now\u2014apparently he\u2019s not even in this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I folded my arms, grinning haughtily at Mike.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mike pushed my arms down from their fold. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't care what you say.\u201d I folded them again. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll go if I want to, and you can't stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Ara.\u201d He slammed his fist on the table, knocking Morgaine\u2019s card tower over.</p><p>\u201cOh. Mike?\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Morg.\u201d He looked back at me. \u201cAra, please, please just listen to me for once in your life, girl. Just once. I'm head of security for a reason. I don't believe it\u2019s safe out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come with me. It\u2019s just for a few days, Mike. I just need to see him\u2014tell him I love him.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine looked up at me then, her brow pulling at the centre.</p><p>I glared at her, confusion moving the muscles in my face. \u201cWhat, Morg? Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um\u2014\u201d She slid her fingers across the table, collecting her cards in a bunch. \u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>I sunk back on my heels a little. The stress radiating off Mike\u2019s body made even me feel tense. And I felt a little sorry for him, standing there, pinching the bridge of his nose, lacking comprehension for my convictions. If I could just put him inside my head, he\u2019d see why this was so important. But I couldn't. And I couldn\u2019t make him want to understand either.</p><p>I sighed, looking past him to the night sky, darkening the front of the manor. This was the first time I\u2019d been in the Common Room, and I barely even noticed the cushy couches and the big open fireplace under the cloud of all my inner turmoil. The d\u00e9cor didn't match the Victorian style of the rest of the manor; this looked more like the lounge room at Vicki's house, but with a dining table in the middle of the room. \u201cMike, I'm sorry you disagree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don't see the point, Ara.\u201d He shook his head, dropping both hands onto the table. \u201cIf I can\u2019t make you listen to me, what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do listen to you, Mike.\u201d I touched his shoulder; he shrugged me off. \u201cBut I have to go see him. I can't rule a nation if my heart is broken.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran his hands through his hair, standing tall again.</p><p>\u201cMike, please? I'm going. Please just support me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If you go, Ara, I\u2014\u201d He stopped, scrunching his fists in the air, then took a deep breath and disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Morgaine chimed, setting her pile of cards aside. \u201cThat went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad.\u201d I spun on my heel and headed back to the corridor. \u201cHe can\u2019t control me all the time. I'm not a little girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and you're not being truthful, either.\u201d</p><p>I looked away from her as she came up beside me. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Amara. Admit it. You want to see David again because you\u2019re confused about how you feel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow I feel?\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times, frowning as if concentrating. \u201cI think you\u2019re not sure if you love him anymore. What happened?\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking, dropping my arms by my sides. \u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d I see his face. When I think of him, I see his face\u2014the boy in my dreams; he\u2019s so angry, so bitter, and full of so much hate. I just\u2014I can't...I can't find anything in my heart for him when I see him like that. And I... \u201cI know I love him. I know I do.\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got bad news for you, Princess. You can't go see him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was stirring Mike.\u201d She smirked. \u201cHe rises to the occasion every time.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, smiling. \u201cMy God, you are a torturer, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why can't I go see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he's not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where is he?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together and leaned closer. \u201cRight now, I don't know. But earlier today, he was here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere? At the manor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d I folded over slightly and looked around, as if I might spot him. \u201cIs he crazy? Why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just checking in on you\u2014he does that from time to time. I cover his scent for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover it? With what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarlic.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know much about vampires, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg,\u201d I huffed, rolling my head to the side. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a mask\u2014it blocks the scent, leaving a rancid perfume. People will know someone\u2019s been spraying it around, but won\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how have I not noticed he\u2019s been here? I\u2019d have smelled him a mile off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely why he only comes when you\u2019re asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsleep?\u201d My jaw jutted forward. \u201cHe watches me while I sleep?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cTrust me, he doesn't like being the creepy stalker, but he said he\u2019d go mad if he didn't get to see you. So, if sleep-time is all he gets, he said that\u2019s better than a padded cell.\u201d</p><p>All the disgust blew out of me in a short huff. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s kind of sweet. But I'm still mad. Why didn't he wake me\u2014tell me he was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure things out too, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how he feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more that he\u2019s not sure how you feel about him. I think he can sense it, you know\u2014your confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not really confused,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course you\u2019re not. You never are.\u201d She leaned on the wall. \u201cBut, I think he\u2019s wondering if maybe you\u2019ve moved on\u2014in your heart. Like maybe he\u2019s not enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he think that? I never said or felt anything like that.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine cleared her throat and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYou know those dreams you\u2019ve been having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about them? I never told you about them, did I?\u201d I went through my conversations with her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut David saw a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine flicked her cherry red hair and smiled. \u201cWhen you sleep, you're not as good at that mind-block thing as when you're awake.\u201d</p><p>I sunk back and leaned on the wall across from her. \u201cWhat...what did he see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014his childhood?\u201d I tried.</p><p>She shrugged, her shoulders staying up for a second. \u201cI don't really know. All I know is that he\u2019s pretty convinced you don't love him so much now, and that if he doesn't do something soon, he\u2019s going to lose you forever.\u201d</p><p>I breathed out, touching my collarbone. \u201cBut, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I\u2019ve just got a lot of issues to work through. But I still love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? He won't speak to me. He...he comes here and doesn't tell me. How am I supposed to even apologise for the argument we had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this not speaking to you thing is for a reason. And it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...he dug up some info on your family, and it\u2019s bad news. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d She raised her hands before I could jump in with an inquisition. \u201cHe\u2019s worried that, with you catching his thoughts sometimes, especially when you get...\u201d she cleared her throat, \u201c\u2014hot, that you might see something he's not ready to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t I know? If he knows something about me, he should tell me\u2014I have a right to know, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not until he's sure. He doesn\u2019t want you to be upset for no reason if it turns out to be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what does? What does he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know, Amara. He wouldn\u2019t tell me. Look\u2014\u201d she touched my shoulder, \u201c\u2014have faith in him, for once. Just once, don't go looking for trouble. He will come to you when he's ready\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he won't, Morgaine. You know he won't tell me if it\u2019s something that\u2019ll upset me. Please?\u201d My voice quivered with desperation. \u201cMorg? Please?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, at herself, I think, and exhaled. \u201cOkay, look, all I can tell you is that...he took a DNA sample from you while you were sleeping and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She touched her thumb to her cheek. \u201cJust a swab. But...he had it matched against your great grandmother\u2014you remember that really old woman I discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my mum\u2019s grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn't a match. So, he fed her blood while she was sleeping\u2014did that a few times and...nothing. She\u2019s not Lilithian. And she\u2019s not related to you\u2014in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...my mum wasn't really my mum?\u201d I said quietly, already knowing that deep down inside.</p><p>Morgaine shook her head. \u201cI'm sorry, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I muttered, more to myself than her. \u201cSo...what about my dad, then? Is he actually my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. David wouldn't tell me that much. He\u2019s very guarded about all this, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded, a little breathless. \u201cSo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, for now\u2014\u201d she patted my shoulder, \u201c\u2014just know that he's checking in on you from time to time, and maybe you can leave him a note or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Checking in on me is not good enough. He should have come to me. He should have told me all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will in his own time.\u201d She turned me so I faced her, and held both my shoulders firmly. \u201cDon't you bring this up with him, Amara. I told you that stuff in confidence. If you want him to trust me, he can't know I told you anything, or he will keep things from me, too. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cFine. But I'm still allowed to be mad at him for sleep-stalking me and not telling me he\u2019s been coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you have every right.\u201d She smiled and shook her head. \u201cBut he has to stop coming here anyway. The vamp-rebellion arrives tomorrow and then it\u2019ll be impossible for him to get past the guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have some very skilled trackers. One of the guys was our top vampire Scout; he will smell David, and he will know he's alive. Had the Scout been Lilithian, we could\u2019ve risked him knowing about David. But, if he's a mole, then we could lose this battle before it\u2019s begun. So, David promised not to come after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I need to get upstairs and write a note for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go tell Mike you thought about what he said and decided to listen to him,\u201d she said as I walked away.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t believe you,\u201d I called without turning back.</p><p>Dear spineless. No, scratch that. Dear annoying, no, not that either. Dear David. That\u2019s better. Wake me when you come to spy on me. I need to speak to you. If you don't, I will file for divorce! No, scratch that. If you don't, I will cry myself to sleep for the next ten years. Love, Ara.</p><p>There. I left the note on my nightstand, folded in half so it stood up like a name card on a wedding table, and retraced the letters on the front so it said, in bold, READ ME, then changed into a soft cotton nightdress and crawled into bed.</p><p>Outside, the horizon turned darker over the ocean closer to the west, with a pale hint of the day to come seeping in from the east.</p><p>Though my body had dragged the exhaustion of the day to bed with it, I couldn't just slip off to sleep\u2014not with the possibility that he\u2019d come and wouldn\u2019t wake me. If I didn't see him soon, I was sure I\u2019d spontaneously combust, or at least do something incredibly stupid just to look into his eyes again.</p><p>I rolled over and puffed the pillows, then laid still for a moment, and since that didn't work, puffed the pillows again and rolled back the other way. My heart raced, my breath uneven. I listened carefully for the sound of silence, hoping the crickets would hush and give sign that he was out there somewhere. But they were even nosier than usual, almost like a chirpy slap in the face; the little buggers were probably dancing around a bonfire singing, \u201cHe doesn't love you. He's not coming. Ha-ha, ha-ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I screamed at them, slamming a pillow over my face. But the pillow disappeared with a cool rush of air.</p><p>\u201cI didn't say anything yet.\u201d</p><p>I jumped involuntarily, scuffling to the back of my bed when a body became apparent beside me, but as soon as the amazing green gaze of my husband registered in my sight, I rocketed forward and flung my arms around his neck. \u201cYou came!\u201d</p><p>He wore two weeks worth of tears, loneliness, sorrow, regret, happiness and missing him, all over his face in a collection of probably very sloppy kisses.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Ara.\u201d He laughed, unfastening my wrists from around his neck, then laid me back on the pillow beside him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? I haven\u2019t seen you in weeks, and you expect anything less than a smothering of kisses?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI kind of expected a slap first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan,\u201d I huffed, folding my arms. \u201cDamn you and your cute dimples.\u201d</p><p>His half smile curved deeply into his cheek, showing just a little of his fang. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I'm hungry?\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand over my heart. \u201cBecause this just picked up about ten beats and your temperature increased about three degrees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not hunger,\u201d I said, rocking my knees.</p><p>He jumped up, leaving the space beside me empty. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what\u2014to make love to your wife?\u201d I rolled my legs over the side of the bed and sat up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, folding his arms, his solemn gaze on the dawn outside my window. \u201cI came to give you a kiss, tell you I love you, then get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork? What are you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm hunting down Drake at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about my family history?\u201d</p><p>The ball of his throat shifted. \u201cAnother time, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But...have you had any good leads on Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you checked out Mu\u2014er, Elysium?\u201d</p><p>David smirked, angling his head to look down at me. \u201cElysium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUr, yeah, we kind of got in a little trouble for calling it The Castle of the Dead.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his head back, laughing. \u201cWho was it? Who slipped up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric.\u201d</p><p>He laughed harder. \u201cOh, I wish I\u2019d been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don't. I told Arthur you always called it that, and he was not impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, my resurrection from the dead will save me any trouble. And I only called it that around you to stop you Googling it to find out where I lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I half laughed. \u201cBecause...I would never have actually thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn't have surprised me if you had. I could just imagine waking up to tap on the shoulder from the castle butler saying there was a nice human girl at the door for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow I wish I had thought of looking it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t have done you any good, anyway.

And they were not because I don't love you, or because I don't care about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you cared about me, you wouldn\u2019t have left me so long without any contact.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, tucking me into his chest. \u201cThere are reasons for everything I do, Ara. One day, you will understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just tell me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I shouldn\u2019t even be here. My mere presence is risking everything that's already been....\u201d He bit his teeth together. \u201cLook, just be okay without me for a little longer. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, sighing, then glanced up to his stern face. \u201cSo...you're not worried about Mike and the spirit bind, anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Morgaine told me it\u2019s faded. Is that true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMostly.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI still love him, but I think I can distinguish the two kinds of love now.\u201d</p><p>His lips broke apart with a breath of laughter. \u201cI'm very happy to hear that. And, has he stopped calling you \u2018baby\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Did you ask him to?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cAsk\u2014demand. Same things, really.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. \u201cWell, he still calls me baby, but he doesn't mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d I said harshly. \u201cHe\u2019s had your back, you know? He always stands up for you\u2014the baby thing isn't intentionally disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded, running a hand through his dark, wavy hair. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been keeping me sane when it comes to you. Ha! I almost ruined it all the other day, when you fell over at training and hurt your ankle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d My cheeks flushed with humiliation. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMike spotted me outside\u2014managed to make me leave right before Blade carried you out.\u201d</p><p>My gut sunk; he was right there. Right outside, and I didn't see him. \u201cI can't keep this up much longer, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor can I, sweetheart.\u201d He held me into his chest and kissed the top of my head; I could feel the warmth of his breath and smell the way his orange-chocolate scent mixed with the heat, making me feel as if I was wrapped up tightly in naked-him. \u201cI better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I grabbed his sleeve as he pulled away. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, Blade\u2019s on guard tonight, and he may not be immortal yet, but if he hears me in here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Just lay with me for a bit? Help me get to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the bed, then the rising day outside, and sighed. \u201cOkay. Just for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d I clapped, and I didn\u2019t even feel silly for my immature display of excitement. But the sudden jumping made that dull ache I\u2019d come to know so well sear up on the side of my head; I cupped my hand over it, wincing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d David pulled my hand down, looking at the spot I covered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the headache. Every time Mike makes me use my electricity, I get them really bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. He seems to think it\u2019ll pass when I'm fully transformed.\u201d</p><p>David nodded as he pulled me into his chest again. \u201cI'm sorry, Ara. I never wanted this life for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never your choice to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, once\u2014before I gave you my blood.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I shook my head. \u201cEven if I was given a crystal ball back then, and saw our future\u2014all the bad we\u2019ve been through, I\u2019d still take it, David, for all the good.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in slowly, holding the tops of both my arms, and kissed my forehead. \u201cAnd that is one of the reasons I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d I smiled, both inside and out, because I meant it. Despite everything I\u2019d learned about him, I still meant it. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back a little, a guarded smile on his lips. \u201cWhy don't I like the sound of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I walked away and hugged myself across the room. \u201cMorgaine said you saw a dream I had\u2014about when you and Jason were young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014that wasn\u2019t the only one I had.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI thought as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at m\u2014\u201d I stopped when I spun around, expecting him to be across the room, angry and scowling, not right behind me, smiling. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, okay.\u201d He stroked one finger down my cheek. \u201cYou worry too much. I knew you were having dreams. I knew he showed you our childhood, because you\u2019ve slipped up, said things so many times that you couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you tell me you knew?\u201d</p><p>He smiled as if the answer were obvious. \u201cI wanted you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I became smaller, looking at his shiny black shoes.</p><p>\u201cBut you did tell me.\u201d He moved in and kissed my hair. \u201cSo, it\u2019s okay. And I can't be mad at you for things he showed you while you slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you mad that I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. But I got over it. Missing you has a way of putting things into perspective for me.\u201d He rubbed the tops of my arms. \u201cJust...don't ever keep secrets from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I shuffled my feet closer to his and turned my head as I rested my ear against his shirt.</p><p>\u201cBut...that was all, right?\u201d David asked. \u201cHe only showed you our past? He didn't...you didn't...do anything else, did you?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, eyes of fear mixing with eyes of concern. \u201cNo.\u201d With that lie, the glass of my broken promise shattered on the ground around my feet, and I heard it, felt it, but didn't regret it. They were dreams. They were in the past. They had to stay in the past\u2014not destroy our future.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He exhaled relief. \u201cI guess I kind of knew that. It\u2019s not like I thought anything happened, but I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just worried.\u201d I wrapped my arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI just had this feeling, you know, that something was going on. And, I know that\u2019s not the case, but I just...I don't know. Perhaps it\u2019s because I know how much he wanted to hurt me, and the one way to do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the past,\u201d I cut him off. \u201cHe\u2019s gone now, and he can never hurt us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that makes me feel better?\u201d He turned away, breaking our embrace.</p><p>\u201cOh, David. I'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate myself, Ara.\u201d He glanced back at me for a second before returning his gaze to the waning night below the window. \u201cI never understood before, exactly what I\u2019d done to him. I blamed him for so many things, and I let my anger turn to hatred.\u201d He took a breath through his nose, his shoulders lifting slowly. \u201cThe worst part is, I knew the truth. I knew it was never his fault\u2014the things I blamed him for, but somehow, placing it all on him made it easier to bear the grief. And I never got to make amends for that.\u201d He stared out past the glass, talking as if I wasn\u2019t in the room. \u201cHe deserved that much. What he did to you\u2014to us\u2014was horrible, but it truly was all my fault.\u201d</p><p>I walked very slowly over to him and let my fingertips hover above his shoulder blade before touching him. \u201cI'm sorry, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be sorry, Ara.\u201d He shook his head a few times, biting his lip. \u201cJust...you don't have to be sorry for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve stopped him\u2014from killing himself.\u201d I stared out at the place David stared for so long, hoping to find the resolution he was looking for too. But there was none there. \u201cI could\u2019ve taken the vial and snapped it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn't know then.\u201d David reached down and took my hand, keeping them between us. \u201cYou hated him\u2014thought he wanted to kill you. Don't feel regret for that, Ara. He wanted to die. It was his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because of what he did to me.\u201d</p><p>David opened his mouth to speak, his thoughts seeming to change direction instead. \u201cI'm not sure his death was for that reason. He was a smart kid, Ara, and he would\u2019ve known, only too well, that you\u2019d forgive him when you found out the truth about why he tortured you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s why he left you those memories\u2014with the blocks in place\u2014so they\u2019d come out one by one, when he wanted you to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could empathise with him?\u201d</p><p>David shrugged one shoulder. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my eyes tracing the white oak divide of each French pane. \u201cHe showed me Arietta. I saw her face, heard her voice.\u201d</p><p>My fingers pulsed where David's tightened around mine.</p><p>\u201cShe was very beautiful,\u201d I said.</p><p>A distant smile rested on his lips. \u201cAnd she loved Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes...it felt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she was just making up for the love Jason never got from you\u2014or from your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did love us, you know. He wasn\u2019t all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d He nodded, his lips pursed. \u201cAnd that's why it was so confusing. When we were babies, he fathered us the way he should. But, as the pain of losing my mother wore his soul down, he drank more, and his love became subjective to his sobriety.\u201d The very depth of his tone sent a message into the air, that he felt it\u2014that he still carried so much of that confusion, even as a man.</p><p>\u201cThat must have been hard; to be loved one minute, mistreated the next.\u201d</p><p>He turned and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d I looked up at him, \u201c\u2014it\u2019s not. You still feel the pain. And I don't know much about the way he treated you, only that he punished quite harshly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw some of those punishments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. None. But Arthur told me how Jason got pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, relaxing. \u201cFather loved us, Ara, for what it\u2019s worth. He just couldn\u2019t cope in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for him, David. He mistreated you, and you spent your life hating Jason for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hatred for my brother was not because of the mistreatment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was because Father blamed me when Jason would step out of turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat you when Jason would step out of turn.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, focusing on nothing. \u201cWhy would Arthur tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t. You just did.\u201d</p><p>The stare broke away to a smile. \u201cYou and your assumptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy correct assumptions,\u201d I said, to which he added nothing. \u201cYou started your life alone, David.\u201d I wrapped my arms around him again and felt each indent in his stomach, his ribs and the little place between his breastbones where I liked to rest my cheek. \u201cBut you're not alone anymore\u2014I'm here. I love you, and I\u2019ll never let anyone hurt you like that, ever again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, absentmindedly stroking my hair. \u201cPlease don't hate me for the things you learn while you're here, Ara. I have changed since I met you.\u201d He tilted my chin upward; regimented David back in place. \u201cEverything you know of me now is who I really am. Don't let my past destroy our future.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, because he used the same words I had thought only minutes ago. \u201cIt would take something pretty awful to get me to hate you.\u201d</p><p>He looked down then and placed a soft hand to my belly. \u201cNo luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. No baby. I had my period last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe one day.\u201d He leaned down and kissed my cheek. \u201cI have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I grabbed his arm with both hands and held on tight. \u201cYou said you\u2019d stay until I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was before we spent the last ten minutes talking, Ara.\u201d He looked at his watch then sighed. \u201cFine. Another half hour, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s very hard to sneak out of this place in the daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure you\u2019ll manage.\u201d I smirked.</p><p>He reached out and placed his hand on the back of my neck, directing me to the bed like a naughty child at a nineteen-hundreds boarding school. \u201cMaybe I should manage you better, then I wouldn't find myself in so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can think of one way you could manage me.\u201d I landed on the bed with a soft bounce and smiled up at him suggestively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy manage,\u201d he said, landing on his knees between my legs, taking both my hands and pinning them gently beside my face, \u201cI assume you mean make love.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closing my eyes with the smell of his sweet breath touching my nose as he lowered himself, warm and solid, on top of me.</p><p>\u201cIf I make love to you now, it\u2019ll be noon before I leave this place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHa! Yeah, right. It\u2019s been two weeks since we had sex, David, it\u2019ll probably only take three minutes.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of his laughter made my whole body tingle, and the way his fangs showed when he rolled his head back like that made me want to be under them\u2014my blood spilling past his lips. His laughter ceased, trickling away to a soft smile as he wrapped my arms around his neck and gently ran a hand up my thigh, lifting my nightdress. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve got something to prove. I hope you don't plan on walking for the rest of today.\u201d</p><p>I giggled, nuzzling my nose into the skin below his neck. \u201cI don't plan on walking for the rest of the year. So you can do whatever you want to me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a little and looked down at me. \u201cYou shouldn't say things like that, my love. You sound sadistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I'm only being playful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don't like that kind of playful, Ara. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Sorry.\u201d I tucked my cheek into my shoulder, smiling sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cKnow what I do like, though?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He slid his fingertips under my head and lifted it slightly, bringing my lips up to meet his, but stopped there and whispered, \u201cI'm the luckiest guy in the world, that I get to kiss you, hold you and love you, whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, you don't,\u201d I said, touching my lips to his once. \u201cWe can't be free to love each other until we rid the world of all its evil. Until then, we have to take small moments of bliss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmall moments that last three minutes, huh?\u201d He laughed, sliding his hand into the front of my undies.</p><p>The sheet felt like a satin kiss across my almost naked skin, drawing a smooth, tingling sensation down the length of my body as it came away, leaving me uncovered in the cool air. My eyes flicked open to an emerald green gaze, foreground to another night sky. Somehow I\u2019d slept through all my responsibilities, all the things I wanted to run from, and been left in the arms of this man I loved so much. \u201cYou stayed with me?\u201d I said.</p><p>But he shook his head. \u201cNo, sweet girl. I returned to you.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes become smaller, focusing more carefully on his face; the shape of his eyes, the boyish gentility in his smile\u2014the fact that he said \u2018sweet girl\u2019.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d His form disappeared from beside me, standing suddenly by the bed, his hand extended; I searched the tips of his fingers, the creases in his palm, the chains of destiny around his wrist, and the clear veins in his arm\u2014all the way to his soft emerald eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you real?\u201d</p><p>He nodded to his hand. \u201cTouch.\u201d</p> <p>My fingertips shook, travelling across space and time to fold into his, and it felt so real, so warm and so solid, like he was really there, right beside me. He helped me to stand, and a tight, tingling pull permeated through my limbs, like I\u2019d left something behind, something that fell from my soul.</p><p>\u201cCare to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I'm not dressed for a dance,\u201d I said.</p><p>He only smiled and looked at my underwear and bra, then smoothed his hand gently down my face; my eyes closed under his touch, and my lips parted as his fingers tickled across them, cool against my warm breath. I felt dizzy, breathless from the craving.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Ara.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I looked down to a swirl of blue light, rising up in soft, smoky plumes, encircling my legs, hips, then waist. \u201cIs this a dream?\u201d I whispered, feeling the tingle over my bare skin.</p><p>Jason nodded toward my bed. I turned slightly and looked at the girl\u2014curled up under the white silk sheet, breathing deep, peaceful breaths\u2014sound asleep, alone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He held his finger across his lip, smiling behind it. \u201cDon't wake her.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at him. The blue light faded then, dissipating slowly, leaving behind a silky feel of fabric around my waist and over the tips of my toes, the colour yellow shining up at me in the shape of a ball gown. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I ran my fingers over the waist and onto the full skirt. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s my favourite colour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jason reached up and placed something cool and sweetly-scented beside my ear, tucking my hair back with it. \u201cAnd this is my favourite blossom.\u201d</p><p>I drew a sharp intake of breath when I touched my fingers to the flower, feeling the solid, silky petals of a rose\u2014so real, even its scent, as if we were actually standing right here, face to face, hip to hip, breath to breath. But we weren\u2019t, and I knew that\u2014as sure as I could see myself sleeping right behind me, I knew this was just a dream, and it made my stomach sink as much as it made me excited. Alone here, in this dream, nothing mattered; not the way I felt for David; not the way I felt for Jason.</p><p>I took his hand when he offered it, and noticed only then, as he led me into the now empty room across from my bed, that he was dressed formal, too, in a tuxedo. He looked so human and so sweetly handsome I nearly laughed. I caught sight of our reflection in the mirror above the mantle of the fireplace\u2014the only objects left in the room\u2014and smiled, thinking we\u2019d fit perfectly in a turn-of-the-century romance novel.</p><p>We took step to a rhythm I couldn\u2019t hear; Jason glided across the floor with the grace of a vampire, leading me with a kind of gentility that felt like floating. I was never much of a ballroom dancer, but in his arms, I was flying. The feel of his hand, flat against the small of my back, consumed everything in my mind, and the song I couldn't hear, the song he sung to me with his steps, rose up from the back of my mind, giving life to the room. Colours swirled around us\u2014masked strangers appearing, smiling, laughing, dancing just like Jason and I, but turning in the opposite direction, making the movement of our steps feel like a cog in a clock\u2014ticking, spinning, purposeful, but different.</p><p>My bare feet felt each rise of the wooden floorboards, each grain of sand or brush of his shoes past my foot, and he kept me close, the grace and charm of his tall, straight shoulders, and the perfection of his eyes, locking to mine, made me want to stay here forever. And it wasn\u2019t a trick. Not this time. This time, I felt this way because I cared for him\u2014because I wanted him to be here, to dance with me.</p><p>In his eyes, I could see so many thoughts, so many things he wanted to say. But he lost the chance. He took his own life, and my mind, as much as I knew his face, could never put words in his mouth that had never been said. And that was the saddest thing about this dream; that in the morning, the daylight would steal all that was perfect in the night.</p><p>The music became louder, and I looked over at my sleeping body; she did not wake. She did not know what her heart was doing while she dreamed peacefully of her husband, whom she made love with only moments ago.</p><p>\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t just a dream,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes.</p><p>Jason held me closer, his fingers curling slightly against my hand. \u201cWhat would you say to me\u2014if I was not a dream?\u201d</p><p>My eyelids fluttered as I rolled my face up to look at him. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>His brow pulled tight and the song slowed again\u2014a violin the only instrument. We stopped dancing and the others in the room faded away like quivering shadows, leaving Jason and I alone. He slowly rolled me back in his arm, tipping me toward the ground; my hair swept the rug where it hung down, the blossom falling from its place, landing alone on the floor by our feet. I looked back up into the green magnificence of his eyes\u2014all the love, the soul, the pain, the truth\u2014everything he was and suffered and cared for shining out through that gaze, pulling me into his world, begging me to save him from it. And I wanted to. If I could go back. If I could go back and be his\u2014I would.</p><p>My jaw shook, my mouth open, crying out inside for his to touch mine. But he closed his eyes and scrolled his lips along my jaw, letting his warm breath fall heavily against my neck.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d I said, tilting my chin, opening the longing of my skin to his teeth. \u201cBite me, and then make love to me.\u201d</p><p>His hand rose to my collarbones, and he clenched his fist above my flesh, hesitation stalling his desires.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jase?\u201d</p><p>Without looking away, he opened his hand and smoothed it down my throat, between my breasts and over my stomach. I felt him\u2014felt the touch against my bare skin, as if there was no dress there. \u201cI have no right to you,\u201d he whispered, his nose to mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have no right to want you,\u201d I breathed, closing my eyes.</p><p>When I opened them again, light filled the room and a shock of ice washed through me, leaving me half naked, covered only by silk and the scent of my husband. I sat bolt upright, clutching the sheet to my breasts, covered in blood, confused\u2014so confused, and so, so alone. A cool breeze brought a faint hint of a rainy day, making me feel stony and out of place. I looked over at the rose on my nightstand, my heart pounding in my throat, easing when I touched the thornless stem.</p><p>I laid down again, sinking into the feathers of my pillows as they rose up around my cheeks, and my dark hair tickled my nose. Images of my dream flashed in my mind, forcing my eyes shut for each brush of his lips across my skin, hold my breath for each time I felt the desire to be in his arms. And then David's face came to mind; the way he looked down at me as he slipped inside me; the way he smiled when he gave my body another chance to create life from his; the way he kissed my lips so softly, lingering for just a little longer than usual, before he left me.</p><p>And the scent of the rose became the memory jerker to my confusion. I rolled over and tucked my knees to my chest, folding the petals of the rose down, one by one.</p><p>By the time the smell of pancakes came wafting in with the morning heat, there were no petals left on the flower. I wiped a stream of tears from my cheek and climbed out of bed. I needed to talk to someone. I needed to sort this out in my head, but I couldn\u2019t do that alone. I just needed someone who understood that I loved David, but dreamed of his brother.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>I had to stop and ask several people directions to the entrance to Lilith\u2019s garden. Everyone seemed to know exactly where it was, but not really how to get in. I\u2019d seen the wall that bordered it from my balcony, but could never see inside\u2014the gardens hidden under the pinks of cherry blooms and the greens of leafy trees. I knew there was definitely a garden behind this wall, but just couldn't find the damn door.</p><p>\u201cYou need the key.\u201d Arthur materialised beside me.</p><p>I pulled my hand down from the small stones of the wall and looked up at him; we were shaded from the sun here, the shadows making the day cool, but Arthur looked a little hot; his collar moist, his hair sticky around his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He wiped a hand across his face. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I\u2019ll let that one slip. \u201cSo, I need a key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He took my hand and led me along the wall to a section hidden just inside the Forest of Enchantment.</p><p>\u201cShould we be in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear, it is the only entrance to Lilith\u2019s Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So, how do you know? Have you been there before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since it was finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d He nodded, using his hand to brush aside a thick mass of vines, growing over the wall from the garden. \u201cI helped Drake plant many of the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, then let go of my hand to bend down, standing again with an iron key in hand. \u201cYour key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was it in there?\u201d I looked down as he covered the wall with the vine again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nook beneath these vines. The key has been there, in plain sight, for some hundreds of years.\u201d</p><p>I held the key up to the small column of light shining in through the tops of the trees. \u201cWhere\u2019s the door?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, stepped back a little, then cast a straight arm further down the wall\u2014deeper into the forest.</p><p>I gulped. \u201cWill you walk me to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Morgaine said, popping up out of nowhere, linking arms with me. \u201cAfter all, I have a private invitation.\u201d</p><p>Arthur bowed his head, then turned and started in the direction we came.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to see your garden, Majesty?\u201d Morgaine practically hugged my arm.</p><p>\u201cYes. Very ready.\u201d I didn't even need to tell my feet to move. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up with Arthur today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She looked over her shoulder to where he\u2019d walked away.</p><p>\u201cHe was...less than presentable. That\u2019s not like him.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just not coping with being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? At the manor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Arietta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. He did mention that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay. He\u2019s just grieving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cVampires feel things eternally, Ara. He\u2019ll never move on from her. Well, maybe if he finds another to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's really sad.\u201d I glanced over my shoulder, wishing I could go give him a hug, but we came upon a big set of arched doors then, with iron hinges and a slot just the right size for my new key. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCare to do the honours?\u201d Morgaine said, letting go of my arm to present the door.</p><p>I slipped the key in the lock and, using two hands, turned it stiffly to the right, then the left and to the right again. But nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cYou need to push,\u201d Morg said.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I gave the door a giant shove with my hand, then the entire right side of my body. It gave way, creaking with protest as it slowly opened. \u201cHow long has it been since anyone\u2019s been in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gardener comes in a few times a day, but no one except you is allowed in here, and those you personally invite.\u201d She bristled with pride. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you here when they built it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt was built when Lilith was a child. I wasn't \u2018created\u2019 until about thirty years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So, how does the gardener get in here if that door never gets used?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSecret passage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I breathed out through my nose, smirking. \u201cShould\u2019ve guessed.\u201d</p><p>As we stepped through the thin branches of wilting willows and into the garden, the sweet essence of summer filled the air. I closed my eyes around the beauty of stone steps, shining gates atop, opening out to a cobblestone path.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Morgaine transformed into the epitome of a little girl, taking my hand and leading me to the garden steps. We pushed through the gates, and I stopped, letting my arms fall to my sides. The cobblestone path led away between plants and trees, and at the centre sat a large square pond with marble edging\u2014a place you could sit to read a book. White swans and plain ducks bathed and dived in the water, and blossoming lilies floated on the top, home to frogs I could hear singing but couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cThat path leads right around the gardens,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cI was told Lilith had it laid when she was a woman, so she could pass each of her favourite scents as she walked\u2014a way of clearing her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we should walk it.\u201d I took Morgaine\u2019s hand again and started the path, smiling as daisies, roses and tulips greeted each step\u2014a kaleidoscope canvas of colours. I tried to make out the edge of the walls around the garden, but vines and trees and all manor of plant life completely hid it\u2014as if we were in some alternate universe\u2014no walls. I could imagine the garden went on forever, and this magical feeling, this sense of something present here that couldn't be touched, made me think I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it did, in fact, go on forever.</p> <p>\u201cMorgaine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked back from the tops of the trees.</p><p>\u201cEverything we say in here is in confidence, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I placed one hand then the other behind my back and watched my blue ballet flats blend in with the tiny multi-coloured stones of the path. Everything felt so bright and richly-hued, like this whole garden was a painting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I blinked back tears.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p> <p>After a long sigh, I smiled and told Morgaine all about the dreams I\u2019d been having. We walked the entire path, coming to rest by the rectangle pond again, in a circled section that housed a small white seat and a sundial, surrounded by wispy little stems with snowflake flowers.</p><p>\u201cSo, you think you\u2019re in love with Jason?\u201d she said as we sat on the edge of the pond.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like it. And I get the sense that you are.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, watching a dragonfly whiz past, then drop down and kiss the white and pink blossoms that fell into the water, coming in diagonally on the whisper of the breeze. \u201cI don't know what to think. That\u2019s why I'm talking to you. I'm confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, what are you confused about\u2014your feelings or what your feelings mean?\u201d</p><p>I had an answer on my tongue, but hesitated. \u201cDoes dreaming about Jason mean I don't love David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love David?\u201d she asked simply.</p><p>I laughed, looking inside my heart to the place I always felt him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, no, it doesn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, am I cheating on him\u2014by having a dream, or...memories?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, I held Jason\u2019s hand\u2014kissed him. Is that cheating, when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara.\u201d She placed her hand on my shoulder. \u201cCalm down. Seriously. Jason\u2019s dead. Okay? So, you haven't done anything wrong. You can't control your dreams. Sometimes, Princess, they don't make any sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I dipped my fingertips into the cool water. \u201cBut, I wanted him, Morg. I wanted Jason like I want David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the spirit bind, Ara. You would never have done that stuff with Jason if he hadn\u2019t made you believe you loved him. And you wouldn\u2019t do it now, would you\u2014if Jason was still alive?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, feeling a little unsure in my heart.</p><p>\u201cGood, then don't worry about it. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should tell David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said in short, her mouth making a circle. \u201cNo. I would leave that alone until this thing resolves itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hu. You don't know their history like I do. Jason\u2019s not here for David to go and strangle anymore, so he\u2019d have to find some other way to vent his anger, and it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Trust me, Amara. He is far better off in Mushroom Land than Truth City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMushroom Land, you know? Kept in the dark and fed bull\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d I held my hand up, then laughed. \u201cOk. I get it. But I don\u2019t like it. I feel like I'm lying to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then tell him\u2014and what you see on his face will make you wish you hadn't.\u201d She took my hand. \u201cPrincess, it was a dream. Nothing happened. Nothing has changed. You don\u2019t need to hurt him for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I've done nothing wrong then he\u2019d have no reason to be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept to know that his brother, even in death, is still causing trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it in the past, Amara. David's suffered enough. That much I do know. And I know he won\u2019t delight in you admitting you wanted Jason, even in a dream\u2014especially since you don't actually feel that way,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t real, Your Majesty, it doesn\u2019t make sense to hurt him for something that you don't truly feel.\u201d She looked at me then, and frowned. \u201cOr do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm confused, Morg.\u201d I dropped my head into my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don't tell him until you do,\u201d she concluded.</p><p>Mike walked ahead while I followed, taking in the scenery\u2014the soaring, airy trees, some of them yellow, others green, and the dry, leaf-covered forest floor. It actually wasn't that scary in here\u2014for an enchanted forest. I expected a little more...enchantment.</p><p>We strolled in silence for a while, leaving the summer behind on the border, where the shorter trees, with full leafy branches, stood as fairy-tale sentries. The deeper we walked, the darker and cooler it got, and the trees seemed to soar up to the heavens, spaced further apart, though the canopy seemed to close in, miles up into the sky.</p><p>Mike stopped in front of a large, grey rock and turned to face me. \u201cThis is the Stone of Truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I unfolded my arms and walked over to the big lump of slate in the middle of the clearing. \u201cIt looks like a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a rock.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know\u2014maybe an elaborate altar or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing great is ever made of gold, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it looks like a rock, people will only see it as a rock.\u201d He ran a flat hand over it. \u201cIt\u2019s safe that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it get magic? Like, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>Feeling sheepish, I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He patted the spot beside him as he leaned on the unpretentious altar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaning on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Don't worry, baby, it\u2019s not disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than picking an apple from a tree. It\u2019s a rock\u2014a part of nature.\u201d</p><p>When I let my hips and butt fall against the Stone, I felt a vibrant warmth coming off it; it seemed so small here, surrounded by so many tall trees, spread so far apart, making a clearing around it, like it had some kind of disease the rest of nature didn't want to catch. \u201cIt feels lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can a rock feel lonely?\u201d He looked behind him to the grey stone.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don't know. I just get the sense that it\u2019s lonely.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. \u201cYou are one weird girl.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI know. So, anyway...how did it get magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, legend has it\u2014according to the Lilithian\u2019s version\u2014that the original Lilith stole a seed from the Fruit of Wisdom and carried it away. One day, she decided to plant it\u2014to profit from its fruit and its knowledge. When she covered the seed with soil from impure lands, it grew out of the ground, tall and magnificent, then, shrivelled away and turned to stone.\u201d He jerked his thumb behind him. \u201cThey say a great forest grew around it over many centuries\u2014said to be enchanted\u2014to protect the Stone from any who seek to misuse its power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was a tree, and it died, but kept its power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe it never died. Maybe the tree is alive in there somewhere.\u201d He rapped his knuckles on the Stone. \u201cAnd this is just an outer shell.\u201d</p><p>I stared at in wonder.</p><p>\u201cBut anyway, like I said\u2014it\u2019s a legend.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI don't care for the rest of it, and neither should you. Just being a vampire is enough weird for me. I can't even think of the fact that my best friend has to cut herself open and bleed on this rock to satisfy the sick, twisted traditions of a nation that lives on second-hand stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou'll be swearing an oath on this rock soon, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and then I\u2019ll be your slave for life.\u201d He bowed low, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhich will be different to now, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cSo, back to the guided tour; the first part of the ceremony is held here. After you cut yourself and bleed, you make some freaky magic promise that\u2019ll stain the skin all over your body with painful tattoos\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey fade when the ritual is finished, Mike. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they burn, don't they? That\u2019s what everyone says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I've been told.\u201d I looked at my smooth white skin, trying to imagine being covered in black runes. \u201cBut, I'm not the only one getting them, Mike. So don't worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s different for me, Ara. I\u2019ll only get one here.\u201d He pointed to his upper arm. \u201cYou\u2019ll have them everywhere, and we\u2019re not allowed to show pain during the ceremony. No emotion at all, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Mike. I'm strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you shaking?\u201d We both looked down at my hands. \u201cCome here.\u201d He sighed and wrapped me up safely in his strong, warm embrace, until the shaking died down to tiny trembles.</p><p>\u201cI'm not that scared\u2014not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re obviously scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the ritual that scares me, though.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, releasing his hold gently. \u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...I'm actually more afraid I\u2019ll stuff something up\u2014say the wrong words or trip over.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm glad to hear that, then. It means my best friend is still in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, his caramel eyes bright with his smile, and wrapped his arm across my neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up a lot in the last few weeks. I don't feel like slapping you quite so often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrk! I can feel the love,\u201d I said sarcastically, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAw, you know we love ya, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So, the walk\u2014where do I go after I bleed on the Stone?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to a path between two tree trunks that looked like Ents with big noses. \u201cRight through Boris and Bert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoris and Bert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we call those trees, because they look like funny old men with weird names.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled lightly. \u201cThat sounds like something I\u2019d name them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said.\u201d He rocked back, laughing once. \u201cFunny thing is, it was actually Lilith who named them\u2014when she was a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you go past Boris and Bert, and once through, the ceremonial crowd will disperse and wait for you to arrive just before dawn on the rim of the forest outside the Throne Room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have to walk at human pace, don't I? I can't just do it all in one run then sit on the ground for the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d He half laughed. \u201cDon't do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?

Who\u2019s to say Drake isn't gonna wait for you to be out here, all alone\u2014\u201d he looked up at the loneliness of the empty space, \u201c\u2014and then just swoop in and grab you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I hadn\u2019t thought of that, but now that you mention it, I'm sure I\u2019ll be looking over my shoulder and jumping at every snapping branch I pass.\u201d It made the idea of being out here, alone, in the dark, very, very scary.</p><p>Mike looked up as a crow landed on a branch behind us, cawing loudly in the silence. \u201cMaybe you should just run the whole track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s just a forest.\u201d I patted his upper arm. \u201cThe scariest thing out here will probably be my own imagination. Then again, I am a vampire, so the scariest thing out here would actually be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I love the way you look at things, Ara.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust doing my bit to be positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in the end, that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna get you through this.\u201d He looked at the crow again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the damn crow?\u201d I said mockingly. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s a spy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese days, baby, I\u2019d believe almost anything. Come on\u2014\u201d With his arm over my shoulder, he turned us and started walking. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take you to your first, official, Private Council meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goodie.\u201d I clapped once, sarcasm festering in the air around me.</p><p>Under a trap door that slid into a concealed pocket when Mike stepped on a tile marked with a Symbol, was a set of stone stairs, leading below the manor in a circle. If I\u2019d walked over that door, being hidden in the twist of the Throne Room\u2019s patterned marble, I\u2019d never have known it was there. And with the door gone, it almost looked like the circle continued, breaking into stairs as it went beneath. We followed them down, tracing the stone column they wrapped, until a dark room opened out before us; flame torches burned low in sconces on the rock walls, which reached high up to the floor of the Throne Room, with hollows displaying small statues, swords or tablets.</p> <p>\u201cOriginal.\u201d I dropped back on my heels, looking at the stone table. \u201cKnight\u2019s of the Round Table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think the legend came from?\u201d Blade, my sneaky personal guard, came up from behind.</p><p>\u201cReally? That was made up by Lilithians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they tell me.\u201d He shrugged and sat down, arms crossed behind his head, leaning right back in his chair. \u201cPretty funny, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn't made up,\u201d said Morgaine as she skipped into the room. \u201cThe knight\u2019s were once great and many. The head of each Core sat at this table, with the queen\u2014\u201d she pointed at me and then to a chair up the back of the room, \u201c\u2014while they wrote the laws that helped form our society. It\u2019s not a myth or a joke, Blade!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He rolled his eyes and sat forward, dropping his elbows onto his knees.</p><p>\u201cEase off the guy, Morg,\u201d Falcon said from the opposite side of the room, arms folded, foot against the wall behind him, as if he\u2019d been standing in here the whole time.</p><p>\u201cFalcon? How\u2019s vampirism treating you?\u201d Morgaine asked. \u201cHaven't seen you since you were bitten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStrangely, not so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, once you\u2019re full strength, you\u2019ll love it,\u201d she said and placed a phone at the centre of the table. \u201cFor Emily to join in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Emily?\u201d I asked, hinting that David should be, too.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mike said, pulling one of the ordinary kitchen chairs out from the ancient stone table. \u201cThat makes the Council complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, nodding. So, he hadn\u2019t told the knights David was still alive. I wondered if he would. Well, he\u2019d have to soon. I mean, even if I hadn\u2019t decided to have them on my Private Council, they\u2019d still be present for meetings and pretty much anything else I said or did.</p><p>\u201cAh, Eric, there you are.\u201d Blade flipped his chin; I looked behind me as Eric and Quaid jumped off the last step, laughing.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny, boys?\u201d Cop-Mike possessed the easy-going posture of my BFF.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Chief. We got lost.\u201d Quaid punched Eric softly in the arm.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was my fault. We were hanging out with the maids in the staff quarters, but there are so many doors down there\u2014I swore the exit was the one on the right.\u201d Eric stopped laughing for a second and looked at Quaid, but it burst out of them again like a car horn.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014\u201d Mike rested his elbows on his knees, \u201c\u2014so, what did you find when you turned right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat Margret and Edgar\u2014kissing in the broom closet.\u201d They roared with laughter again.</p><p>\u201cOld Margie\u2014that nosey hag from dinner?\u201d Blade asked.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Eric composed himself. \u201cYou should have seen the look on her face\u2014being caught with a lowly servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a candlestick, did they?\u201d Mike asked, and I laughed, though everyone else just stared at him. \u201cMargret, in the broom closet\u2014you know, the game\u2014clue-something?\u201d he said leadingly.</p><p>The only response was cleared throats and chirping crickets, though I was probably imagining the crickets. \u201cDon't worry, Mike. I got it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, shaking his head, then stood up and offered me his chair. \u201cI'm gonna call her Mrs. Peacock from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, that makes no sense,\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you never played board games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I sat down. \u201cMike and I used to play that game with my mum all the time, right, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled warmly at the past.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Peacock was a game?\u201d Morg asked.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014a character from a game,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cO...kay. Whatever.\u201d Morgaine sat down.</p><p>\u201cFor an old bird, Morg, you don't know much about nineties pop-culture,\u201d Blade said.</p><p>\u201cShut up, douchebag!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, cool it, you two,\u201d Mike cut in. \u201cNow, first on the agenda today\u2014\u201d He paused and looked at the phone. \u201cMorg, did you actually call Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Crap.\u201d She grabbed the phone, her cheeks blushing, and dialled Em\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHa! She is like Ara,\u201d Quaid piped up, and the other guys shushed him.</p><p>Morg gave him a vehement glare then turned back to the phone when Emily answered. \u201cHi, Em. Meeting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Present,\u201d Emily said in her sweet voice.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous. So, meeting begins now; just speak up if you wanna add something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019kay.\u201d</p><p>I looked from the phone, to Mike. It was once weird to see him so affectionately look at another girl\u2014er, phone\u2014but it kind of felt nice now, to know he was happy\u2014that he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>He paced the floor, first addressing the subject of the defectors our Order had just inherited, how they seemed to be trustworthy so far, then went on to discuss the coronation, deciding it would be held this week\u2014provided the Upper House approved. \u201cWhich brings us to our next topic.\u201d</p><p>All eyes in the room moved to me; I shrunk in my seat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging of the knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy.\u201d I tipped my brow to my hand.</p><p>\u201cI know, Ara, but the rest of the army have completed the change\u2014they\u2019re training and ready to go. The only thing left to do, which I know you\u2019re dreading, is to change these guys.\u201d Mike clapped Blade on the shoulder.</p><p>I swallowed, trying to push the feeling, the memory of when Jason flooded my lips with human blood, out of my mind. I could still feel it blazing, and could still taste the acidic tang of Falcon\u2019s blood when I changed him the other day.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Blade shrugged, palms up. \u201cI don't get it\u2014she just has to bite us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman blood burns her, Blade,\u201d Morg said with a very thick smothering of abhorrence. \u201cLilithian\u2019s just weren\u2019t designed to bite humans\u2014it goes against everything we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Princess.\u201d Blade sunk back a bit. \u201cI didn't mean to be offensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Blade,\u201d I said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d paid attention the day you bit Falcon, he would know how it affects you,\u201d Morgaine barked.</p><p>Blade looked like a kid cussing at his own mistake. \u201cU\u2019m sorry. I just...I thought she was upset \u2018cause she killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, now you know, don't you.\u201d Morgaine took my hand. \u201cBut, despite the burn, Amara, you have to do this. The sooner, the better. You may need the knights when you go to kill Drake in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrap him,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>She looked up at Mike, who gave a small headshake\u2014his non-verbal \u2018leave it for now.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWell, at least I only have to bite three, right. So, when do you want me to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d Mike said. \u201cAfter the bonfire shindig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I rubbed my tongue over the roof of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cCan you think of a better time?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll let these guys enjoy their last evening as mortals, then we\u2019ll introduce them to the flip-side of the pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cThe flip-side...\u201d his voice trailed off. \u201cIt means the cool side of life, you know, \u2018cause your pillow is cold on the other\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tonight?\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>An air of exhilaration and anticipation washed over the last remaining humans in the room.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Tonight, then.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d Blade and Ryder smacked hands together, then turned and did the same with Quaid. Falcon remained cool, watching on from his position against the wall, as if he was above it all\u2014way too mature to high-five.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWell, the next meeting will be called in two days\u2014the morning prior to the coronation. Ara?\u201d He looked at me. \u201cEileen, formerly Lady in Waiting to Queen Lilith, wants to talk with you about the coronation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Mike leaned on the wall, his legs casually slanted in front of him. \u201cShe says there\u2019re some things\u2014history and reasons for some of the ceremonial stuff, that you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I groaned. \u201cLook forward to it.\u201d Really, though, I actually just felt like catching a taxi to Elysium, running inside, killing myself a bad guy, then taking the first breeze back home\u2014to dad\u2019s house\u2014to normal life again.</p><p>Morgaine turned her head swiftly and looked into my eyes, while the rest of the council chatted and laughed loudly between themselves. \u201cYou okay, Princess?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cRight then.\u201d Mike stood up off the wall. \u201cLet\u2019s call this meeting adjourned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. Dibs on lighting the bonfire,\u201d Blade said, rubbing his hands together as he stood.</p><p>\u201cYep, and Falcon can get all the firewood,\u201d Quaid slapped Mr. Serious on the shoulder as he passed.</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d Morgaine asked.</p><p>\u201cHe can pull trees down with his bare hands,\u201d Quaid said.</p><p>\u201cRoooar!\u201d Ryder laughed, following the boys up the stairs.</p><p>Falcon and Mike shook their heads, looking like twins, standing side by side. They even wore the same black fitted shirts and jeans. I wondered if Mike was missing his little bromance with David, enough that he was seeking himself a twin of his very own.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike\u2019s hand came down on my shoulder; I hadn\u2019t even noticed him beside me. \u201cEileen\u2019s waiting in your room. You can meet us down at the bonfire once you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it take that long?\u201d I looked at my watch. \u201cI was planning on\u2014\u201d I stopped before the words going to the lighthouse slipped out.</p><p>\u201cYou were what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I'm just tired. I wanted a rest first.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine took my hand and whispered quietly, \u201cWould you like me to come to the boring meeting with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Please!\u201d I hopped up off the chair. \u201cWe can throw paper canons at her head when she\u2019s not looking.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOkay, but only if we get to blame you for it. You can't get in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys?\u201d Emily\u2019s voice came up all crackly through the phone, like the connection was dropping.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alone yet?\u201d</p><p>Mike looked over at Falcon. \u201cWe\u2019re among friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I can talk about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mike said, cutting her off. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d Blade popped his head around the corner.</p><p>\u201cEm, hold on.\u201d Mike looked at Blade. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He stepped off the stairs and gave me a wink, then looked back over at Mike. \u201cKegs for the shindig just arrived. Jack wants you to sign for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll be there in a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Blade had a really boyish, playful charm about him today. He knocked me gently with his elbow as he passed; his lips parting over his teeth, giving a cheeky grin that seemed to apologise for nothing. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya tonight, pretty princess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mike opened his mouth and Falcon stood straight, but Blade disappeared up the stairs again before they could object to his...friendliness.</p><p>\u201cOkay, on that note.\u201d Morgaine pulled my hand a little. \u201cLet\u2019s go see Eileen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d I heard Mike say as Morg and I started up the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cStill here,\u201d she trilled in a chirpy voice.</p><p>I wanted to stay and hear what she was going to say about David. Assuming she was going to say anything about him. Whatever it was, though, Falcon was in the \u2018circle of trust\u2019, but not Blade. I wondered why. Maybe certain members of the Private Guard were to be permanently kept in Mushroom Land. In fact, that dark, imaginary place seemed to own too many of us right now\u2014and I would have to put David in there, too, to keep him safe from the truth about my feelings for his dead brother.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Morgaine startled me from my thoughts. \u201cCan you experience any one emotion for long enough to decide how you\u2019re feeling? You're exhausting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Morg. Too much going on in here.\u201d I tapped my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said again.</p><p>\u201cSo? What was that thing in there\u2014what were you thinking when Mike said you had to meet Eileen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cUm. Nothing, really. I just kind of thought to myself how easy it\u2019d be if I just shot a bolt of electricity at Drake\u2019s head and ended this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cMoody today. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I'm tired. Like, spiritually tired. I actually just want to go hom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Don't say it.\u201d She grabbed my arm, her fingers making small impressions in my flesh. \u201cI know, okay, but you shouldn\u2019t say that here. These people need you, Princess, more than you need to live a normal life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, Morg.\u201d I nodded. \u201cWhy do you think I'm still here?\u201d</p><p>The short puff of each breath I took made my lungs tight. I\u2019d been running so long I couldn't remember how to find my way out. My tiny feet pattered, one over the other, in the short-clipped grass, while my fingertips trailed along the sharp, rain-dotted edges of the brush. It smelled like pine and fresh water, even though the maze was planted of shrub, and though the sun was bright outside these walls, the shadows behind them were thick, making it dark down here.</p><p>I looked behind me again, feeling him there, feeling his presence, hearing his breath through the gaps in the leaves. He was close; he\u2019d find me soon, and despite this being a web of changing walls, I knew there was nowhere to hide. There never was. Running was my only option.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d his voice jeered in a creeping, ringing tone. \u201cI'm coming to find you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>I squatted down and tucked my knees to my chest, hugging them tight, wishing I could make my breaths quiet, like his.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he called again; I turned my head a little, seeing a bulk figure stop beyond the wall right beside me\u2014filling out the green gaps in the brush with his darkness.</p><p>My whole body became stiff, hoping he wouldn\u2019t reach through the hedge and grab me.</p><p>\u201cLili?\u201d He moved on again, and I relaxed. \u201cLili?\u201d</p> <p>Above me, a crow cawed loudly, its silky black wings reflecting the glare of the sun, and under its evil call, the voice of the man trailed away; I was safe. For now.</p><p>I dared to peek, my lips falling softly apart when I saw his cloak floating around a distant corner; his feet were gone, his ghostly figure looming, purposeful. He knew where he was going, and this was all a game\u2014just a game, where he let me think I\u2019d escaped.</p><p>\u201cLili.\u201d His tone peaked on the end. \u201cMy little Lili, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Little Lili? I looked down at my small hands; the nails were squared, the skin pink, almost transparent with youth. Lili? Who was Lili?</p><p>\u201cAh-hu!\u201d Deep blue eyes set on my face, the ghostly fiend jumping out at me; I squealed, taking off in a run, but he grabbed my arm. \u201cI got you, Little Lili. You can never hide from me. I always hear you.\u201d He released me and I scrambled back on my heels, stopping in the arms of the shrub wall. \u201cNow, time to run again\u2014and this time,\u201d he said, \u201cdon't make it so easy to find you\u2014\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open to Morgaine\u2019s face; she pulled her hand back from my shoulder, her mouth moving with words I couldn\u2019t hear. Inside my chest, a thumping pulse owned my breath, and the feel of that man\u2019s hand on my arm remained.</p><p>As my soul floated gently back down to earth, my tired gaze drifted from Eileen, still pacing, going on with her lecture, to the dome roof above my bed. And the shocking blue eyes of the man in my dream smiled back at me. Drake. The man in the glass, having a tea party with Lilith\u2014Little Lili\u2014was Drake.</p><p>I took a few deep breaths and composed myself.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Morg whispered.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d I nodded to myself on the chair. \u201cJust then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, you were awake this whole time. You were talking to me.\u201d</p><p>I stared forward. \u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>She nodded at Eileen when she turned and gave us a glare, her eyes questioning our attention. \u201cYeah. Don't tell me you've mastered not paying attention\u2014to the point where you can sleep and hold conversations.\u201d</p><p>I slinked down in my chair, taking the pressure off my numb butt, and cast a quick glance to the windows, seeing the daylight slip behind the horizon. The smell of bonfire smoke rose up from the forest below and even the sound of the knights\u2019 laughter managed to find its way into my room to remind me of all the fun I was missing out on.</p><p>\u201cSo, what was your dream about?\u201d Morg asked, leaning closer.</p><p>I took a heart-steadying breath and closed my eyes, looking back into the maze and all its darkness. \u201cDrake\u2014coming to get me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't worry, Princess.\u201d She took my hand and flipped it over, showing the long crease in my palm, around my thumb. \u201cYou have a long life-line. He\u2019s not going to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not death or capture I\u2019m afraid of, Morg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window again, frowning. \u201cThe hunt.\u201d</p><p>Loud music and laughter filled the warm, summer air\u2014distant but homely in the leafy rims of the enchanted forest. I traipsed down the dark trail toward it, with my fluffy friend-slash-guard-dog beside me, feeling safer once I spotted the orange glow of firelight.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you reckon, Petey\u2014is that the right spot?\u201d</p><p>Petey took off, leaving me behind, charging forward to break apart a group of knights with a spritely bound; they jumped back, laughing and petting his head eagerly.</p><p>Falcon frowned at the dog, then looked up\u2014looked around, his wide eyes relaxing as soon as he saw me.</p><p>I waved; he nodded casually and went back to his conversation.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Eric stumbled, drunk and loud, toward me. \u201cKiddo? What took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman!\u201d I charged into the glow of the bonfire and stopped right in front of Mike. \u201cShe practically gave me a full exposition. I only just broke free. See?\u201d I unravelled the blanket I brought from my bedroom and showed the same skirt and white top I was wearing earlier. \u201cI didn't even have time to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Mike handed me a plastic cup. \u201cYou must have been desperate to get out of there.\u201d</p><p>My gaze narrowed, watching him sip his drink, his eyes shifting edgily. \u201cWhy do I get the sudden feeling you had me kept under deliberate imprisonment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me.\u201d He shrugged, sniffing once before turning and walking toward the group Petey was in.</p><p>I looked down at the cup of cola in my hand\u2014at the bubbles popping, then let out a long breath. The bonfire crackled in front of me, its rising embers floating on the heat to the tops of the trees, like orange fairies, while the gentle glow spread warmth out over the clearing, giving a kind of border to the intimate little gathering.</p><p>After a few more breaths, the burning timber, with its homely smell of winter smoke, simmered my irritation down another notch. I settled myself against the trunk of a tree a few meters away from the fire and watched the knights sit in companionship around the blaze, talking and joking with a kind energy you\u2019d see on people celebrating.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d A man fell heavily beside me, spilling his drink near my shoe.</p><p>I looked up from the sloppy mess on the bark-covered floor and into a pair of black, smiling eyes. \u201cHey, Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. That woman was a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s over now.\u201d He reached across and, with the tips of his fingers, untangled a small piece of bonfire ash from my hair.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled then blew it away.</p><p>\u201cSo, My Queen? Who will you be sinking your teeth into first tonight?\u201d</p><p>The key to nightmares I\u2019d locked up turned inside me, opening the door; I looked away.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d He gently turned my face back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...whenever I think of human blood, it reminds me of...of...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf when you were tortured?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pressing my lips in. \u201cYou know about that, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt was one of our first lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I feel trapped, you know. When I taste it, it makes me feel like I'm laying flat on my back again, with someone doing things to me I don't want them to do. And I can't make it stop.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arm over my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you don't want to do it tonight, I\u2019ll talk to Mike for you. Hey?\u201d He laughed then. \u201cMaybe I can get you drunk, and you can pretend to pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Blade.\u201d The bile in my throat flooded away with a small laugh, but came back as I watched Mike for a moment. \u201cI don't think I\u2019ll be doing any drinking, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm under age, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd two?\u201d Blade pressed.</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d Two is that the last time I drank alcohol, I lost my mother and baby brother. \u201cTwo is I don\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart girl.\u201d He nodded and sipped his. \u201cSo, where did you get your name\u2014it\u2019s really...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to say pretty, but since you said it first.\u201d He nodded. \u201cYeah, odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I shuffled, wriggling the dirt and bark off my upper thigh, sticking where my skirt rose up a little. \u201cAmara was my grandmother\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the \u2018Rose\u2019 part?\u201d he asked, and his English accent sounded smoother than usual; I smiled to myself.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was supposedly because my skin was like the softness of a rose petal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He lifted his hand, his touch hovering above my arm. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>I let the blanket fall away and closed my eyes as Blade stroked his fingertip down my skin. \u201cYeah. Beautiful. Wow. Who\u2019d have thought?\u201d</p><p>I leaned my elbows over my knees and sat forward; the distant warmth of the firelight glowed against my bare arms. \u201cSo what\u2019s your real name then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the point of a nickname, Ara\u2014so you don't have to use your real name.\u201d He ran his hands over his hair, sitting back against the tree trunk, a wide grin lighting up his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to know. I'm curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all the other knights\u2019 names.\u201d</p><p>Blade looked around, checking the darkness of the dry, leafy forest, then looked at the fire again. \u201cIt\u2019s like a scar, my name. It\u2019s a part of my past I don't really want to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrunk a little. \u201cI\u2019ve done some bad things. Before I jumped onto the right side of the fence, I...well, let\u2019s just say I had a rough start. I don't really wish to wear my father\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s your surname you don't like?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s your first name?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas,\u201d I said to myself. \u201cNice. So, can I call you Tom?\u201d</p><p>He breathed out through his smile and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI was serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t answer you.\u201d He picked up a stick and started snapping it into pieces. \u201cLook, Ara, I like you\u2014but we\u2019re not even supposed to be talking like this.\u201d Blade looked over at Mike. \u201cIf he thinks for one second that I'm crossing the line between guard and . . .\u201d He shrugged, one corner of his lip lifting into his cheek. \u201cHe\u2019ll kick me outta the Core.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay. Blade, it is.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, leaning back slightly. \u201cNo, call me Tom\u2014but only in private. Okay?\u201d</p><p>A smile forced itself across my face. \u201cOkay, Tom-but-only-in-private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re a laugh, aren't ya?\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happenin\u2019 guys?\u201d Falcon fell beside me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking,\u201d I said casually.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He looked at Tom. \u201cLookin\u2019 pretty cosy over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, man. We\u2019re just talking,\u201d Blade said, then sighed and stood up, heading for the fire.</p><p>\u201cTalking? That\u2019s all, huh?\u201d Falcon asked me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFalcon, I know you think you\u2019re cool with your newfound ability to hear and all, but it doesn't give you telepathy. So chill. Blade and I are just getting to know each other.\u201d I stood up, too.</p><p>\u201cThat's the problem, Your Majesty.\u201d He appeared in front of me, blocking my path. \u201cIt\u2019s his job to protect you\u2014not know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I looked over at Blade, then folded my arms across my chest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the same as you\u2014except you seem to think it\u2019s all right to make assumptions about my intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said smugly, \u201cI don't assume. I know. And it is more than appropriate for me to make those assumptions, Majesty, because it is my job to protect you, and that includes from yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr!\u201d I scoffed, turning away. \u201cYou're starting to sound like Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Falcon stopped behind me. \u201cI\u2019d be proud to be only half the man he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, he may be a good man, but when it comes to what\u2019s best for me, he\u2019s getting his clues from the wrong side of the line.\u201d</p><p>Falcon appeared beside me, gently grabbing my arm. \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re just too immature and too na\u00efve to know any better. Maybe it takes a man who is willing to step outside that line to tell you what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcon.\u201d I pushed his hand off. \u201cNow you are being inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had to watch Mike fight with you, day after day, worry over the simplest things, because you refuse to listen.\u201d He leaned forward and spoke quieter, \u201cDo you have any idea what you put that guy through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and folded his arms. \u201cYeah, well, I got news for ya, Princess, it is my business. Everything you do, think, feel or say is my business\u2014and I am not going to let anything bad happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad? By talking to Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy crossing boundaries with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, now I can't have friends?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if they\u2019re in your Guard. It\u2019s against the rules\u2014a dischargeable offence. Blade knows that.\u201d Falcon pointed toward the fire. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be talking to you that way.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Blade, who looked down at his feet. \u201cWould Mike really kick him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been warned.\u201d</p><p>Without looking back at Falcon, I nodded. \u201cOkay. Fine. I won\u2019t talk to him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to him, just...keep it light. No first names.\u201d He smiled at me as he trudged past.</p><p>\u201cYou heard all that?\u201d My arms dropped, and I followed him, hearing only a soft laugh from ahead.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The early morning sun shone down on the colours in the dome above my bed, making the eyes of what I\u2019d recently concluded was Drake, and the greens of the gardens around Little Lili rich and bright. I twisted my wedding ring around on my finger, imagining David beside me, talking about the strokes and textures that made up the roses and grasses in the stained glass. We had many pretend conversations like this. Somehow, talking to him in my mind helped ease the troubles in my soul. It was like I could predict his answers, then get advice from him about stuff I could never tell him, all while he wasn't even in the same room.</p> <p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d Mike said as he opened my door. \u201cHey, baby. Brought you coffee and toast.\u201d</p><p>I pushed my hands into the mattress to sit up. \u201cNo garlic today?</p><p>\u201cGarlic?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d I shook my head; he clearly didn't know about David's visits.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, setting a tray down beside my leg.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your throat?\u201d</p><p>I touched my fingertips to my neck, lifting my chin slightly. \u201cIt stopped burning a few hours ago. How are the knights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. They\u2019re starting to notice changes\u2014small things, like their hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the bite marks healed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s has.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a coffee cup off the tray and sipped the brown liquid casually. \u201cI think I had my teeth in his flesh longer than the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d He sat beside me and grabbed a cup, too. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don't know.\u201d I looked down at my fingertips, wrapped around the warmth of my mug, while my mind flipped to the darkness of last night. The fire had burned down to embers, and the only remaining knights were the ones who were still human\u2014the ones I had to change, aside from Mike and Falcon, who stayed to watch over us, since they were the only sober men at Loslilian. There was so much anticipation in the air, a kind I understood, because once, I had been human, and once, I had wanted David to change me.</p><p>As it got later, Blade took my hand and led me through the trees until we could no longer hear Mike and the boys talking. I remembered my heart skipping in my chest as he turned to face me, taking both my hands in his and gently helping me to the forest floor. I knelt in front of him, breath responding to my panic, and he so sweetly brushed my hair over my shoulder and planted a very soft kiss to my cheek. I felt each sharp rise of bark under my bare knees, down the length of my shins and my ankles, but the fear of what I had to do consumed more of me.</p><p>\u201cYou're so scared,\u201d he whispered, cupping my face.</p><p>I closed my eyes and rolled my cheek into his warm, human hand. Each time his heart beat, his blood pulsed, making his flesh rise like ribs with a breath. I listened to the sound, heard his blood, thick and rushing, move through his veins. With a deep breath, I pinpointed where it pulsed closer to the surface\u2014the place I needed to bite. I knew what I had to do, but wasn't really sure how. When I had bitten Mike, just a small nick in his skin was enough to change him, but it took him weeks to transform. When I bit Falcon after electrocuting him, I left my teeth in him until his heart started again, and he was fully transformed within a few days. I weighed up the two options in my mind.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to take your mind off it?\u201d Blade said, pushing the shoestring strap of my top down my shoulder. \u201cI can make you think of other things.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, and he slid my strap back in place, taking his long, warm fingers up my neck, around the base of my jaw and over my chest, right between my breasts. I felt myself go hot\u2014hotter than I should for another man\u2019s touch\u2014and quickly dismissed it as fear.</p><p>\u201cYou are so lovely and warm.\u201d He pressed his hand more firmly to my chest. \u201cI can feel your heart beating. It feels too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d I swallowed, looking at his neck\u2014at the pulsing vein.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of the pain\u2014the burning?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen hurt me.\u201d He grabbed my hand and positioned it around his throat. \u201cHurt me while I hurt you\u2014make me feel your pain.\u201d</p><p>With a deep, shaky breath, I closed my eyes and wet my lips. One bite, that's all, just one and it will be over.</p><p>\u201cWait?\u201d Blade pulled back. \u201cNot there. If you bite me on the neck, you have to do that with the others\u2014it\u2019s too intimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're right. I didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bite me here.\u201d Blade studied my lips carefully, his breath coming through his own with the hope of touching mine, I could feel it, and he slowly pressed his wrist to my mouth...</p><p>\u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cOh. I, uh\u2014\u201d I blinked a few times and set my coffee cup down.</p><p>\u201cAra? Were you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mike. I kind of got a little lost.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and groaned. \u201cNot much has changed, really, has it?\u201d</p><p>I shrank into myself, smiling sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cIn a strange way, though, baby, that\u2019s kind of comforting to know.\u201d He winked and handed me a plate of toast. \u201cWhat I was saying is, I thought I might film the coronation for David\u2014that way he won\u2019t miss out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That's a great idea, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cSo? You nervous yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He grinned and sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cChief!\u201d</p><p>I jumped out of my skin when Ryder burst through my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cRyder, what\u2019s up?\u201d Mike dumped his cup on my nightstand as he stood.</p><p>\u201cOrion detected a vampire\u2014\u201c Blade said, charging straight to the window. \u201cSomewhere on the border of the manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcon was on it though, Chief.\u201d Ryder came back in from my bathroom and started checking behind my curtains, then dropped to his knees to look under my bed. \u201cHe ran before the alarm even sounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, he knew?\u201d Mike turned to face Ryder, who stood, satisfied there were no Bogey Men under my bed.</p><p>\u201cDunno, Chief. He just started running. Didn't have time to ask.\u201d</p><p>Mike pulled the curtain across with his fingertip and peered outside. \u201cRight. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Ryder and Mike fled my chambers, leaving me, half frozen with shock, alone with Blade.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Your Majesty. They\u2019ll catch him.\u201d Blade stood by my bed and looked down at me, a lustful grin shifting the concern from his eyes.</p><p>My mouth dropped open a little, a silent huff carrying my insult; I covered my slinky summer nightdress with my sheet and scowled at him. Somewhere outside, an alarm was ringing, pulsing and howling for all to exercise caution; I could hear the chaos and confusion of the House and guests all over the manor. But in my room it was calm; just Blade and I, and my barely-covered body. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s an attack?\u201d</p><p>Blade shook his head and sat down on the bed next to me. \u201cDoubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what will they do to the vampire if they catch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends what he's doing here. If he\u2019s here to kill you, they\u2019ll rip him apart\u2014if not, they\u2019ll just smash him up good and bring him to you for questioning.\u201d He laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s no one we know, or they\u2019ll get a bit of a bloody greeting.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth, suddenly realising the vampire sneaking onto the property could be David.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying.\u201d Blade patted my leg. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here\u2014protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sitting there, you won't.\u201d Mike waltzed in and closed the door.</p><p>Blade stood tall, his arms by his sides.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I threw my covers back, happy Blade had distanced himself, and ran over to Mike. \u201cDid they catch him\u2014the vampire?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYeah. They got him. No time wasted with my knights, Ara. Got him good, too. Heard he\u2019s lookin\u2019 pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d My eyes met his. I needed him to read my mind right now. If that vampire was David, we had a conspiracy to cover up. \u201cIt wasn't...?\u201d But I couldn\u2019t say it. Not with Blade in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mike looked at me, totally confused.</p><p>Erg! So much for higher intelligence. He could practically read my mind any other time, why not now? \u201cIt wasn't my old weapons instructor, was it?\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment, but then his eyes widened and he shrunk back. \u201cOh, shit. I dunno. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Blade placed a hand between Mike and I, forcing us apart. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Ara\u2014he knows,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Blade said, grinning. \u201cMike told us all yesterday, while you were being tortured by mystical-woman-with-long-stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were telling them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Mike grabbed my wrist. \u201cNo time for this now. We need to get down to the Throne Room. If that's David, we gotta conceal it quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I screeched. \u201cBlade said the knights will rough him up pretty bad. He could be really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, that is the least of our problems,\u201d Mike said, dragging me\u2014nightdress and all\u2014to the corridor.</p><p>We burst through the Throne Room doors and Mike threw the curtain aside, dragging me past the back of the big gold chair to the edge of the landing it was perched on.</p><p>Blade leaped onto the balcony at the back of the room, and Quaid flung open the double doors leading out to the forest.</p><p>\u201cSee anything yet, Blade?\u201d Mike called.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. Just trees\u2019n\u2019shit.\u201d</p><p>Mike turned back to me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and sat down on the steps.</p><p>Satisfied, Mike wandered over and stomped on the panel that opened the Round Room. \u201cIf it\u2019s him, we\u2019ll get him straight into hiding. It\u2019ll be okay, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said breathily. But it wasn't our little \u2018David's dead\u2019 conspiracy I was worried about.</p><p>\u201cHey, wanna know a useless piece of information?\u201d He placed a hand to the step and fell into it, spinning to sit on his butt beside me. \u201cMight help distract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose marble columns that hold the roof up.\u201d He pointed to the six cream pillars along the length of the room, sitting in the gaps between each giant window.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fake. They\u2019re not structural at all. Lilith had them placed in here after she saw a Roman palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s my room up there\u2014\u201d He pointed to the roof. \u201cIts foundations are set in the external bricks\u2014same as yours. But no one knows these are fake, so don't tell anyone, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, how do you know that?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI know everything.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, backhanding him softly. Sometimes, his own self-loving could be charming, and it always made me feel better somehow.</p> <p>The gentle scent of clay and pine came through the doors at the back of the room, and the absolute silence felt almost peaceful. It was the calm before the storm. I looked up at the fake marble columns and the pale colours, everything tinted with touches of gold, kind of like Lilith was making extra effort to disguise her throne and her Court as the real deal. I wondered if anyone took her seriously\u2014believed in her. For some reason, judging by the fake grandness of this room, I felt like they didn't\u2014like maybe she was just like me.</p><p>\u201cChief?\u201d Blade called down from the balcony outside. \u201cI can see them coming up this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. How\u2019s the prisoner look?\u201d</p><p>He walked back inside and leaned over the railing, into the Throne Room. \u201cLooks bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it you know who?\u201d</p> <p>Blade appeared beside us then. \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell. Looks too big\u2014too built to be him. And his hair was all shaved, like mine.\u201d</p><p>I breathed a soft sigh of relief. There\u2019s no way David would ever shave his head.</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s just some dumb kid looking for a place to crash,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cHope not. We\u2019ve only got two or three guest rooms left,\u201d Blade said, hands on his hips, watching the double doors.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll throw him in the Core then\u2014plenty of rooms at the barracks,\u201d Mike said, standing up, and they both just stood there, watching the back doors.</p><p>It felt like time just ticked by, like the knights were taking forever to get here. Mike reached back, pulled me up to stand, then dropped a quick kiss on my head. \u201cIt won't be David, baby. He\u2019d never shave his head.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. \u201cI know.\u201d It was nice that Mike knew that, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you so worried about then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I frowned, going back through my last few thoughts. \u201cI...I think I was actually thinking about your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room?\u201d he said, looking up for a second. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about Lilith, you know, and if we were anything alike, and then I was thinking about the stained glass dome above your bed.\u201d</p><p>Mike stiffened. \u201cI tacked a sheet up over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d I half laughed.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look at that anymore. It\u2019s sick.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled to myself. He didn't know it, but Morgaine actually told me what the picture was; a depiction of Lilith\u2019s death\u2014a woman, her legs forced apart by the hips of a man as she cried, reaching out to the nothing, while another slit her throat. Mike had gone to great lengths to keep that from me\u2014even barred me from his room.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, why were you thinking about it, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I just feel a kind of connection to Lilith. I...I felt sad for her. For the fact that she set this room up to look all grand, and then she had it all taken away.\u201d</p><p>Mike opened his mouth to speak just as the knights burst through the doors.</p><p>\u201cGot him, Chief,\u201d Ryder called.</p><p>As soon as I saw the thick, rounded skull and the wide, broad shoulders of the man they dragged between them, I relaxed. This guy looked like he was of European descent\u2014maybe Italian or something, certainly not the unmistakably Caucasian appearance my David had.</p><p>Ryder and Falcon dropped the bloodied vampire to the floor; he landed on his hands, then gave up and flopped down, his face bleeding all over the velvet rug below the steps.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Mike asked, squatting beside him.</p><p>He groaned, trying to lift his head. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak louder.\u201d Ryder shoved the man with his foot.</p><p>\u201cHey, ease off!\u201d I walked over and stood with Mike.</p><p>\u201cDrake. Has.\u201d The man coughed and rolled over, clutching his stomach.</p><p>\u201cDrake has what?\u201d Ryder leaned over him. \u201cWhat has he done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a break!\u201d I yelled, pushing Ryder aside, then knelt down beside the man, who, up close, was no older than me. He was bloodied badly, his lip split, dirt and small pebbles lodged into his temples and cheekbones, and the whole left side of his body was practically limp. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate,\u201d he wheezed, struggling to speak.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened? Why did you come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Drake?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wincing, his eyes becoming small with pain. \u201cHe\u2019s...something about blood oaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>He coughed, and the gash across his chest pulsed blood as he rolled back.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, you\u2019re bleeding bad.\u201d I held my wrist out. \u201cHere. Drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Mike grabbed my arm and looked up at Quaid. \u201cGet him a human. Lilithian blood won't be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human?\u201d I practically barked as Quaid ran off.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Ara. I won't allow any biting or killing.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and placed my hands on the guy\u2019s chest, forcing pressure down on his wound. It felt like forever before Quaid finally came back, escorting a young girl. She looked so small and so nervous next to him. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, and gave her a soft push in our direction.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smiled sympathetically at her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, bowing her head as she knelt beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Danni, have you ever had someone drink from you before?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWe won't let him bite you, okay?\u201d I said, pushing down harder on the vampire\u2019s chest, feeling the flood of his blood pulse up with each breath he took. \u201cAnd if you don't want to do this, you don't have to.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Quaid; he winked at her, and she gushed, blushing. \u201cI don't mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I slowly pulled my hands back from the bloodied mess and held them out from my body, resisting the urge to lick my fingers, gross as that sounds.</p><p>Mike squatted right beside Danni and guided her hand to the vampire\u2019s lips, squeezing her wrist as he made a cut; she looked away, scrunching her eyes tight.</p><p>The warm, dead animal smell of her blood wafted up to my nostrils, making the sweet, desirable scent of vampire on my hands seem suddenly so unappealing, like eating a doughnut in a room where someone farted. Quaid held the head of the newcomer so he couldn\u2019t lift it, and Danni\u2019s blood spilled, drop by drop, against his lips.</p><p>The bruising along his jaw receded and his eyes changed from black to a bright hazel colour as he sat up and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded and looked right into Danni\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d he said, touching her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She blushed again, and Blade helped her to stand, leading her away; she turned back to wave at Quaid, but he was too focused on the man to notice.</p><p>\u201cNow. What's going on?\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cDrake turned volatile, started slashing people apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard it was something to do with oaths. Apparently he wiped out every member of the Blood Army\u2014went to each Set, killed everyone who\u2019d ever sworn an oath, then came back here and finished them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed the army?\u201d I felt weak, dizzy. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Mike said, standing up. \u201cWhen you take your oath tomorrow night, any man whose allegiance is sworn to the throne will switch to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYep, and that would have included Drake\u2019s army.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the young vampire. \u201cSo, you haven\u2019t sworn an oath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sat up properly, his chest completely healed; he looked down at it, parting his shirt to give the skin a little poke. \u201cI don't really care for politics. I just heard screaming, looked out my bedroom door and saw Drake slice a man\u2019s throat open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he...did the guy die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I kid you not, yo. Guy just dropped dead, right there on the floor in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! How is he killing vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't you know?\u201d the kid said, his eyes wide. \u201cThere\u2019s some new drug called Venom. Wipes \u2018em out in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrug?\u201d I said, looking at Mike.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by drug?\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cDunno. I just heard some High Council dude say something a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething about vials\u2014said we had four but Drake took it to his lab in Sussex and had it expanded into...I don't know.\u201d He swallowed, as if his mouth had made too much saliva to keep talking. \u201cI can't remember, but he made enough of it to walk \u2018round the castle with a sword and just start cuttin\u2019 guys up. Their eyes were open, ma\u2019am\u2014he just left \u2018em there. Just...dead!\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cSo, then you left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I was lucky. I followed some guys out this tunnel and came out to a road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many escaped?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cAre you the only one that came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were twenty who ran. But they all went in different directions. I only came here \u2018cause of Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric de la Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2014a few months ago he said he was fleeing the Set\u2014asked me to come. I didn't wanna risk capture, and he wouldn\u2019t tell me why he was leaving, so I told him I\u2019d stay. He just handed me a map and said if I changed my mind to come here.\u201d He looked up at Falcon. \u201cI'm sorry, man, I didn't know this was some royal ch\u00e2teau or nothin\u2019. I just thought Eric had really rich parents or something.\u201d</p><p>Falcon laughed and helped the vampire to his feet. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say your name was, kid?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cNate.\u201d He folded over a little, obviously still in pain.</p><p>\u201cWell, Nate, welcome to Loslilian. This here\u2014\u201d Mike presented me, \u201c\u2014is our princess, soon to be the new ruler of the Three Worlds.\u201d</p><p>Nate looked at me then, flipping his chin. \u201c\u2019Sup.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room laughed.</p><p>\u201cBlade, go get Morgaine. Tell her to prepare a guest room for our new friend.\u201d</p><p>Blade saluted with two fingers and turned on his heel, disappearing. He\u2019d learned to use that speedy vamp run really well for a vampire who was only a few hours old. Smart bugger.</p><p>\u201cSo, you guys are all Lilithians?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Mike bristled with pride.</p><p>\u201cI heard of your kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou drink vampire blood. Some say Drake\u2019s building a new army to come get some kid you guys stole or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew army?\u201d</p><p>Nate nodded. \u201cHe ships humans in\u2014thirty a day. At first I thought he was just really hungry, but then a mate of mine in decomp said he was only burning about half that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecomp?\u201d I looked at Mike.</p><p>Mike winced and without looking at me said, \u201cDecomposition. It\u2019s the guys who get rid of bodies.\u201d</p><p>I felt queasy. \u201cSo, he\u2019s creating a new army?\u201d</p><p>Mike sunk back a little, exhaling through his nose as realisation seared through him at the same time it did Falcon and Quaid.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the allegiance shift?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYep. But he can't make them swear an oath because, not only does he not have access to the Stone, but the oath would be invalid as soon as you swear yours. He\u2019ll have to brainwash them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike\u2014\u201d I grabbed his sleeve, my eyes tearing. \u201cWe have to save those people.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped me up in his arms, grimacing at the blood on my hands, dirtying his shirt. \u201cBaby, there\u2019s nothing we can do to help them. We\u2019re not ready to go after Drake, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is good news,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cNot that humans are dying, but that his army won't be ready for some time. He needs to change them, train them and make sure they\u2019re reliable enough to carry out whatever task he asks of them.\u201d</p><p>Quaid looked at Nate then at Falcon. \u201cRight. This at least means Ara\u2019ll be safe while she does the Walk of Faith. I doubt he\u2019s gonna come onto Lilithian grounds without some protection.\u201d</p><p>Falcon nodded and clapped Nate affectionately on the shoulder. \u201cNate, my man, welcome to Loslilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA toast.\u201d Mike, chirpier than usual, stood and tapped his glass. \u201cTo the knights, for their exceptionally quick reaction time, the successful capture of an alleged bad guy, and also to our new comrade, Nate.\u201d</p><p>We raised our glasses, one by one, all thirty-something people down the table. More chairs had been added since our little family grew; first, my Private Guard being invited to dine with us each night, then a half dozen new vampires, and now Nate. But the head of the table still remained empty\u2014another reminder we had no king and, for me, another reminder that David would miss my coronation ceremony tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm glad to be on this side of the fence.\u201d Nate held his glass up to Falcon. \u201cYour knights pack a pretty wicked punch.\u201d</p><p>Falcon sipped his wine, smiling into his glass; it was the same kind of smile he gave when he knew he was right about something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must say,\u201d Margret, now nick-named Mrs. Peacock, spoke over everyone. \u201cMichael, I underestimated you. It seems you\u2019ve trained your knights well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Moustache Man piped up. \u201cI watched from my window this morning as they caught our new friend.\u201d</p><p>Nate shuffled in his seat.</p> <p>\u201cYoung Falcon here is quite a force,\u201d Mrs. Peacock said.</p><p>\u201cJust doing my job.\u201d Falcon nodded once.</p><p>My ears adjusted to a quieter conversation near me, and as the rest of the table went about their private dinner chatter, I looked at Eric and Nate.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it mean?\u201d Nate asked Eric.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s permanent, man. You\u2019d have no life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is that different to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara\u2019s disbanding the Sets when she\u2019s sworn in\u2014we\u2019ll be free to go where we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious?\u201d He glanced at me then back at Eric. \u201cCan I go home\u2014to my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, man, but you can get on with your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you swearing an oath?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will if you want to be on the Private Council,\u201d Arthur said, coming into the conversation uninvited.</p><p>Eric\u2019s jaw came forward\u2014the serious side of him. He looked down at his plate.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Arthur?\u201d I asked across the table; several people hushed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the law. Those in your Private Council must be sworn to the throne or to the people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the oath do?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cIt makes those who bear the mark bound to obey any command given in strong order by their ruler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept those sworn to the people,\u201d a man said. \u201cThen they may disobey, should they see the order detrimental to the greater good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Arthur nodded.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what if they swear to the other one\u2014the...throne, was it?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, the throne,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIn that case, they must obey, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you swear an oath, Arthur?\u201d I cut in.</p><p>He nodded, sipping his wine. \u201cI was on the World Council. It was a requirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not as Set leader\u2014like David was?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSo, Arthur, if Drake was to call you up now and tell you to come back, would you have to?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were sworn to the throne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jason? What was he sworn to?\u201d I asked, ignoring the quiet gasps when I mentioned his name.</p><p>\u201cThe throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when I take over, his allegiance would automatically have transferred?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd I swear my allegiance to the people?\u201d I touched my chest.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I don't have to do what they say if they order me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As long as you never do anything that directly affects the people in a grossly negative way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if some of them would die by a decision I make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you knew in your heart it was for the greater benefit, it would be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...if, say, Nate was to swear to the throne, he\u2019d have to do whatever I tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The compulsion act only applies to orders of a certain nature,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can give an order for Mike to, say, punch Falcon,\u201d Morgaine started into the conversation. \u201cAnd he can refuse. But if you compel him to obey, he would have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of energy you use, so I'm told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will come to understand it once you\u2019ve made your oath,\u201d a man with a long grey beard said, bowing his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cSo, I can only use that after I'm sworn in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it would work now, for those who have made an oath to the people\u2014if they believe you to be the true ruler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I do it\u2014how do I compel someone?\u201d</p><p>Arthur leaned forward, his arms on the table. \u201cRequest something of them as though you hold all authority. Ask as though you would bring all hell down on their soul if they did not do as you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgaine?\u201d I turned to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Majesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I try it on you?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed the top of her arm, the place I knew she had the same marking as Jason. \u201cOf course, Princess Amara.\u201d</p><p>I took a breath and worked up the same tone my mum used on me when she was sending me to my room, and I would look in her eyes and know damn well if I didn't move it, she was going to start spitting green stuff, her head turning around on her shoulders. \u201cAnswer this honestly; do you believe any of the people at this table may be traitors?\u201d</p><p>Everyone gasped, the energy in the room going tense.</p><p>Morgaine looked into her plate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can keep your whispers to yourself, Margret,\u201d Arthur said suddenly in his stern voice. \u201cI would just as soon give my life at her feet. I am no traitor.\u201d</p><p>I offered him a warm smile. \u201cI know that, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I cannot be the traitor,\u201d said Moustache Man. \u201cI'm Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I,\u201d said Grey Sideburns, then a few others. No one seemed to look particularly guilty, except Morgaine. I wondered if she knew who the traitor was or if she only suspected someone. Either way, we were going to have a sit down chat\u2014a long one.</p><p>\u201cSo, those who swore to the throne of Lilith, what happened to their oaths when she died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey remained faithful. Since Drake never made an oath, he could not have control of us,\u201d Margret-slash-Mrs. Peacock said, bowing her head. \u201cOur allegiance remains faithful to the Lilithian rule, even if you never make an oath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if I wanna stay here,\u201d Nate said, \u201cdo I have to make an oath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you plan to serve on the Private Guard or the Private Council,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d He nodded. \u201cWell, if it\u2019s all the same, I\u2019ll just stick to being one of the guests for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Nate,\u201d I said, tearing my eyes away from his with the sense of another\u2019s on me, and when they brushed across Arthur\u2019s face, he looked away.</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d I kicked her foot under the table; she looked up at me. \u201cIs your \u2018getting people\u2019 thing turned on right now?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, half smiling. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you read...I mean...\u201d I nodded in Arthur\u2019s direction when he turned away to answer a question. \u201cHe looked at me weird.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine stared at him, then shook her head and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, leaning closer. \u201cWhy was he looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked right at me then, and I sat up, pretending not to be talking about him, but I felt my cheeks flush, the heat rising up from my chest. I could only imagine what scent he was catching from me then, because he scratched his brow with one finger, laughing a little. Even Morgaine laughed.</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d I whispered, not so quietly. \u201cWhat are you two laughing at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't have anything to worry about.\u201d She smiled at Arthur, who didn\u2019t even bother to look away this time. \u201cFrom what I gather, he thinks you look pretty tonight.\u201d</p><p>With another flush in my cheeks, I looked up at Arthur\u2019s vibrant blue eyes and smiled.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d Mike kicked my foot.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d I whined. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirting.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cI can feel the heat coming off your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not.\u201d I scowled at him and went back to eating my dinner.</p><p>From my peripheral, I saw Mike point at Morgaine. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t encourage her.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine just giggled and looked up at me from under her lashes, but her gaze slipped quickly past me to look over at Nate, talking with another vampire about David.</p><p>\u201cWhat about David?\u201d I shot my voice across the table; all hushed.</p><p>Nate shifted in his chair.</p><p>\u201cHe just found out he\u2019s dead,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>I twisted my wedding band around with my thumb. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I keep to myself. I\u2019ve pretty much just hidden in my room at the castle since I was changed. I didn't even know there was a war going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate\u2019s new,\u201d Arthur explained. \u201cHe was recently brought in by a Scout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScout?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cLike Orion,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cSame guys who would\u2019ve eventually come for Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked over at our newcomer. \u201cSo, you knew David, Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I went to school with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust last year.\u201d</p><p>My core imploded. \u201cNate\u2014is that...is that short for Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow! You\u2019re Nathan Rossi? I went to your funeral!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Oh, my God. You\u2019re not dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUr\u2014\u201d He looked down at his own body. \u201cNot as far as I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I said a few times. \u201cDoes Emily know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d Nathan looked at Eric. \u201cWho\u2019s Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily\u2019s a vampire, Nathan.\u201d I tried to contain my excitement, but heard my own voice travel across the table louder than it should be. \u201cEmily from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily...\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cEmily Peirce? David's Emily?\u201d</p><p>Everyone went quiet.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s Emily?\u201d I gulped. \u201cWhat exactly do you mean by David's Emily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe...she was...I mean, she was the only girl he ever hung out with.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey were close.\u201d</p><p>My heart dropped in my stomach. \u201cClose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. None of us guys were allowed to touch her. So...what happened to him\u2014David? Why\u2019d he die?\u201d</p><p>Eric clapped Nathan on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll fill you in after dinner, man.\u201d</p><p>I scratched my head, sitting back.</p><p>\u201cSo, is she here? Em?\u201d Nate asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I looked at Mike; he was as stiff as I was. \u201cShe will be tomorrow, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Nathan grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool. I always liked Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s engaged now.\u201d I jerked my head in Mike\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYeah? No kidding. That's awesome.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded and looked down at his lap, a blue light making his face glow from under the table. I felt the double vibration of his message tone come through the base of my seat.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you know David, Princess Amara?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>Eric leaned in to Nathan and whispered, \u201cShe was his wife.\u201d</p><p>Nathan sat taller, his eyes wide. \u201cOh. But\u2014I thought he...I mean, last I spoke to him, he was hooked on some other girl. Ara, or something weird like that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed through my nose. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s me. I get called Ara, Ara-Rose, all different names.\u201d</p><p>His lip quirked on one side as he took a closer look at my face than he had before. \u201cSo, you married him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to stop from smiling at his obvious joy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm really glad to hear that, Ara.\u201d The table huffed at such an informal address, but Nathan didn't even notice. \u201cI know he was pretty in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah. He was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry he\u2019s dead. He was a good friend of mine.\u201d He looked down at his plate.</p><p>\u201cSo, who turned you?\u201d Morgaine asked, looking around Falcon, down the long line of vampires on her side of the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I added. \u201cDavid told me once it wasn't him.\u201d</p><p>Nathan looked at Arthur, then at Eric. \u201cI uh...I don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down. \u201cSo, you didn't see the guy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cCould\u2019ve been a girl, for all I know.\u201d</p><p>A few others shot questions at Nathan, while I looked at Mike. Him, with all his rules, was the last person I ever expected to see texting under the table. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWho are you...?\u201d I nodded to the phone.</p><p>\u201cEm,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh. Did you tell her about Nathan?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and held up his phone.</p><p>All I saw was exclamation marks, then laughed. \u201cGuess she\u2019s happy then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, just a tad.\u201d He leaned forward and stuffed his phone in his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked, patting his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You?\u201d he breathed, forcing a smile.</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cDavid's Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I kind of knew it was like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you did, too. Doesn't mean anything, baby.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. It was just a shock to hear it put that way.\u201d</p><p>He patted my hand with his other one. \u201cI know. I just feel sorry for...you know who. I bet they\u201d\u2014by they, he meant David\u2014 \u201care gonna cop an earful when you see them next.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cProbably not. I can never stay mad at hi\u2014er, her when we\u2019re in the same room.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved that about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The training hall seemed cold without the heat of fifty bodies filling it. Mike fitted a metal cuff to his forearm and winked at me as he grabbed a sword.</p><p>\u201cWhy do we need protection?\u201d I rubbed the cuff on my arm. \u201cWe\u2019re vampires. We won\u2019t die from a cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but do you have any idea how much energy it uses to heal a slash every ten seconds? That energy\u2014that blood\u2014is better spent cutting up bad guys on the battlefield, Ar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I shoved a finger under it to scratch my skin. \u201cMakes sense. But, I was kind of wondering, and...I know this is probably a really stupid question, so don't get mad, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, baby, what is it?\u201d He jammed a sword into his scabbard.</p><p>\u201cIf...if we\u2019re strong enough to cut vampires open with a butterknife, why do we need Lilithian steel blades? I thought that was just so humans could cut them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, handing me a sword from the table. \u201cTo cut them with plain iron would, again, take more effort, and the chances of cutting deep enough to bleed them out and let the venom tip do its trick are one in five. Lilithian steel guarantees the best possible result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs their skin really that tough?\u201d</p> <p>Mike smirked, sighing heavily. \u201cYou just have no idea about anything, do you, girl?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed with a little gulp. He was right. I hadn't really thought about any of this. I guess I just took it for granted that I was a vampire and so were they\u2014that we\u2019d all just do some biting and waving of swords until someone wore out and went home.</p><p>\u201cCome on then.\u201d Mike lowered into his stance, his eager grin drawing me into battle. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>I twisted my sword over, holding it in a dagger grip, then extended my arm, my fist aimed at Mike, the blade of my sword following the length of my forearm.</p><p>\u201cAra, you\u2019re holding that wrong. Point your blade upward, like this.\u201d He showed me how one is supposed to hold a sword.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI have my own style. It\u2019s non-conventional, Mike, but this works for me.\u201d</p> <p>He scoffed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIt does. Just watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, and his deep, godly tone made me not so sure of myself. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I angled my wrist and dipped my arm, waving my blade through the air in a figure eight, then dropped my shoulder, flipping onto my back as Mike stepped in. The ground caught me with a jolt, but it wasn\u2019t enough to wind me. I grabbed his ankle while he was still looking for me in his line of direct sight, and slashed his shin\u2014bringing him down to the ground beside me. He hit hard, dropping his blade with a loud clunk, and I was on him, legs either side of his chest, my sword to his throat. \u201cYield?\u201d</p><p>He coughed, laughing, his face red with obvious pain, and held my hips with both hands. \u201cGirl one. Guy nothing.\u201d</p><p>I laid my sword on the floor beside us. \u201cStill think I need to hold my sword \u2018properly\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He knocked my hands down from their sarcastic pose of \u2018quotation marks\u2019 and dragged me into his chest for a bear-tight hug. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, baby. You hold that sword however you want\u2014long as you fight like that.\u201d</p><p>I smiled into his sweaty neck, feeling the short, gristly stubble along his hairline behind his ear. It felt good to be this close to him again\u2014like we\u2019d not hugged in so long. He let me free, and I sat up, looking down at the caramel gaze of my bestest friend in the whole world. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Mike.\u201d</p> <p>He took a very long breath, wrapping his big hands around my hips again. \u201cI missed you too, Ar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Mike?\u201d I grinned mischievously.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes small with the relaxation his body stupidly felt while under me.</p><p>\u201cNever let your guard down,\u201d I said.</p><p>He had time only to widen his eyes as I rose up on my knees, making enough room for his body to twist under mine, then grabbed his shoulder and flipped him over, pressing my blade to the ball of his throat, holding his head in place by the scruff of his hair.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Falcon said as he came in. \u201cMike, you going easy on that girl again?\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s arms came up, twisting at the elbows to knock my wrists away; my blade tore across his throat with the force, while the roll of his hips sent me to my back, on the floor, my legs open around him. \u201cMaybe just a little.\u201d</p><p>I pushed my cuff to his chin, holding him off me. \u201cYou were not,\u201d I said, struggling. \u201cYou\u2019re just embarrassed to be pinned by a girl.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and eased off me, leaving me breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re just too quick for me, Ara.\u201d</p><p>When he offered his hand to help me up, I ignored it and rolled over, clambering clumsily to my feet. \u201cI had you. You were pinned.\u201d</p><p>Mike smirked, wiping blood off his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You did. But you let your guard down, baby, and the battle flipped in my favour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I dusted myself off and looked at Falcon, who was covering his grin, then back at Mike. \u201cIt won't happen again.\u201d</p><p>The boys laughed behind me as I stormed from the training hall, into the cool sprinkle of summer rain outside.</p><p>The greyish glow of the single torch in the corner under the stone steps gave little light to the room; I sat on a chair in the border of its warmth, tapping my fingers on the round table, checking my watch every few seconds. Mike had a good excuse for being late to the council meeting, because Emily apparently arrived about ten minutes ago, but where were the rest of them?</p><p>Somewhere up in the Throne Room, a door slammed, its sudden echo making me jump a little, while a quick gust of air rushed down the tunnel of stairs, sweeping the roundness of the room, and blew out my torchlight, thrusting me into the pitch black of the underground.</p><p>\u201cLooks like even the flames gave up waiting,\u201d I said to the torch, standing up. In the darkness, it almost felt like I could hit my head on something, though I knew the roof was much too high for that. I felt my way around the cold stone curve of the table and wandered, hands out, to the wall under the stairs, finding the matchbox right where we usually left it. The birth of the flame brought an instant bubble of safety with its warm glow. I rested it to the wick of the torch; it sizzled and flourished into a bold, bright light again, touching the shadows in the corner under the stairs. I quickly looked around to make sure there were no Bogey Men, then sighed, my shoulders dropping.</p><p>\u201cWho? Amara?\u201d Morgaine said in a high-pitched voice, coming down the stairs. \u201cBlade\u2014what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I'm saying, Morg.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the unstruck match to my side and pressed my back against the wall, masking myself in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I do, and I can't say I'm terribly impressed.\u201d</p><p>As they walked in and sat down with their backs to me, I drew my toes into the shadows, hoping the rapid beating of Blade\u2019s heart would hide my own. But they seemed too distracted by their conversation to even notice my partially heavy breathing.</p><p>Blade rested his head in his hands. \u201cI just don't get it. Why am I so hooked on her?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s the curse of her blood\u2014Lilith\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the original Lilith. History reports that she was cursed with beauty beyond imagination and the burden of desire. This was believed to have been a punishment for deceiving Eve\u2014convincing her to eat the Fruit of Wisdom.\u201d Morgaine touched Blade\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCain, Lilith\u2019s husband, had been cursed for the murder of his bother with a thirst for blood. All who take the poison of the cursed inherit the burden. For the Created, we simply became vampires, but any who descend from the bloodline of Lilith will take the hearts of men. It\u2019s why Lilith was known in history as the Goddess of Seduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't get it? What does that have to do with this?\u201d He pressed his hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cBecause any man that piques her interest will be cursed to love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014this isn\u2019t real? It\u2019s just that she, what, Amara fancies me? That's why I feel like I\u2019ll die if I don't hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don't have any feelings for him, Morg!\u201d I shot forward, aiming a finger in Blade\u2019s direction; they both spun around, shock paling their faces. \u201cI don't. How can he be cursed if I don't feel anything for him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slightly, sitting back a little. \u201cDid you ever feel a flutter in your heart for him\u2014maybe for a certain action\u2014perhaps he was kind, perhaps a certain smile or something?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, my eyes tearing, mouth open like I could say something to defend myself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all it takes, Princess,\u201d Morgaine added.</p><p>\u201cBut, I mean...we just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you planning to tell me this?\u201d I yelled, digging my finger into my chest.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to.\u201d She held up defensive or maybe calming hands.</p><p>\u201cWho said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>I took a few deep, laboured breaths, my shoulders rising and falling until it all came down on top of me. I sunk into the chair beside Blade, my head in my hands. \u201cOh, God. Blade. I'm so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be, Amara.\u201d He touched my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBlade!\u201d Morgaine gasped. \u201cI understand you have feelings for our queen, but there are boundaries. You have no right to touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He dropped his hand, then slipped off his chair and squatted beside me. \u201cI'm sorry. It\u2019s just\u2014can't you see, Morg? She blames herself.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine sat in Blade\u2019s chair and took my hand. \u201cThis is not in your control, Amara. It\u2019s a curse\u2014one you inherited with your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m cursed to make men fall for me\u2014for a simple thing as liking their smile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Morgaine looked down.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I don\u2019t love Blade. I mean, I like him as a friend, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn't matter. You care about him. That\u2019s all it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I buried my face in my hands. \u201cI'm so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mike\u2019s stupid.\u201d Morgaine reached across, between Blade and I, and placed her hand on my shoulder, bringing us all into a huddle. \u201cHe should\u2019ve let David tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, David knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I pushed her hand off me, sitting straight, eyes wide. \u201cThe curse\u2014does that mean David's love for me isn\u2019t real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s real.\u201d Morg laughed. \u201cDavid fell for you before you were changed\u2014as did Mike. But you, my friend\u2014\u201d she turned to Blade, \u201c\u2014you are just a part of an eternal curse Amara has to suffer for the sins of her ancestors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg, are you sure, I mean, about the curse taking hold after David and I fell in love?\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cYes, I'm certain. David loves you, okay. And it is real love. I can sense it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure mine isn't?\u201d Blade said.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYep. Sorry, Blade, you just have to get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I quit?\u201d He looked at Morg, not me. \u201cMaybe I should work in the general Core? I might be too close to Amara to ever break free of the spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d I asked. \u201cWork in General?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Blade said, rubbing his brow. \u201cI really don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t seem to stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Blade. If I\u2019d known about this curse, I\u2019d never have even talked to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cThe curse only works on men whose hearts don't belong to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I looked up then.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Morgaine reached down and took both of Blade\u2019s hands, drawing them up to her lap. \u201cWhen you fall in love, the curse will break.\u201d</p><p>Blade exhaled, his shoulders dropping. \u201cSo, like, what\u2014true love breaks its spell?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine laughed. \u201cYes. So, all you have to do is find a nice girl and get her to fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hairline with the heel of his palm. \u201cStory of my life.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine\u2019s eyes glistened and she flicked her cherry hair from her face. \u201cStory of all our lives, Blade.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a cough in the back of my throat that tried to escape as laughter. For once, I totally \u2018got\u2019 Morgaine, and it was hilarious.</p><p>Blade stood up and walked across the room, still rubbing his head. \u201cNo offence, Your Majesty, but I'm glad I'm not really in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I said, then frowned. \u201cHey, why are you glad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s wrong. I'm supposed to protect you\u2014not fall in love with you. It goes against everything I've been trained to do\u2014against everything I believe in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I guess we need to find you a girl as soon as possible. Got a preference?\u201d</p><p>He turned around, his grin lighting the room, the shadows on his face making the contours around his nose and mouth look like a moustache. \u201cBlondes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlondes?\u201d Morgaine scoffed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do.\u201d Blade shrugged. \u201cI'm a bit shallow. That was the dead giveaway that something was wrong when I started thinking about Amara in all the wrong ways.\u201d He extended his arm, an upturned palm pointing to me. \u201cNo offence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d I raised both hands then looked to Morgaine, but she was gone. \u201cHey, where\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>Blade looked to the stairs. \u201cWeird. Don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she went to see where the rest of the Council are.\u201d I turned back and made patterns over the cracks on the tabletop.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay.\u201d Blade sat down carefully beside me. I felt his hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I'm okay. I guess it explains why guys would possibly ever fall for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, hey, don't be like that.\u201d He carefully tilted my chin upward. \u201cOne of the first things I noticed about ya was how pretty you are. That\u2019s why guys fall for a girl. From there on in, it\u2019s to do with personality. But, put a pretty face like this in front of a guy and he\u2019s bound to want your affections, curse or not.\u201d</p><p>His English accent made me smile; somehow, everything sounded better coming out of his mouth. And I realised then\u2014that was how it happened. I felt an attraction to his accent, his cute smile, his cheeky mannerism. I dropped my head into my hand again. \u201cI pity any guy who ever walks in a room with me if he has an accent and a cheeky grin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucker for it, huh?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded into my hands. \u201cUh-hu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess a cheeky grin is my curse.\u201d He sat back then, resting his knuckles by the corner of his lip, his elbow on the table. \u201cYou haven't felt anything for Falcon, have you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cGod, no. He\u2019s Mike reincarnated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! That's what we say over at the barracks.\u201d He rolled back with laughter. \u201cWe all reckon Falcon and Morgaine should get together\u2014since Morg is so much like you, red hair aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Falcon and Morg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be the Mike and Ara that never happened.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cWell, Mike has Emily. That\u2019s the way it was always meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d Blade scoffed. \u201cYou mean that fianc\u00e9 we never hear about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe talks more about Morgaine than he does Emily. I was starting to think she was just a trophy.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNo, he just...he keeps his heart closed off. Besides\u2014\u201d I grinned, looking back up the stairs to make sure no one was coming. \u201cI have sneaking suspicion Morgaine might actually like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d He jostled, rolling his neck so he almost had a double chin. \u201cNo way. She throws her shoes at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He rubbed his elbow. \u201cShe got me real good, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got news for ya, Blade. Girls pick on guys when they like them. Didn\u2019t you ever go to kindergarten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh. Um\u2014well, she\u2019s being mean to you because she\u2019s insulted you haven't taken her very subtle signals that she has feelings for you and done something about it. You're expected to read her mind.\u201d</p><p>Blade nodded, his lips turning down with thought.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, not really. It\u2019s hard to like someone when they\u2019re calling you names.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cAsk her out on a date; if she stops calling you names, it means she likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she doesn't like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen start collecting the shoes she throws at you until she has none left.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I couldn\u2019t help but join in. I knew I shouldn\u2019t, but it felt so good to laugh. There was this moment, when finding something funny, where you could actually completely forget all your problems.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He stood up, giving the table a soft whack with both palms. \u201cA date then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going on a date?\u201d Mike asked, stepping into the room. \u201cNot you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mike.\u201d I sighed and stood up. \u201cBlade and Morgaine.\u201d</p><p>Mike smiled at Blade. \u201cI thought she hated you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurns out girls hate you because they\u2019re angry at you for not noticing that they like you.\u201d Blade shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Mike raised a brow in my direction. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Chief.\u201d Quaid came bounding into the room and sat down on one of the chairs. \u201cWhat's on the agenda today?\u201d</p><p>Mike stood taller and folded his arms, looking at me. \u201cDiscussing the knighting ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Quaid\u2019s face lit up. \u201cDid you ask her?\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head. \u201cI'm just about to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk who what?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAsk you.\u201d Quaid tipped a chair back and forth with his foot.</p><p>\u201cWe want to move the knighting ceremony to tomorrow,\u201d Blade said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sense in waiting. Saves getting the people out here again for another festival,\u201d Mike added. \u201cWe need to take action and get ready for this attack on La Chat\u2014I mean Elysium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...if you do that, I can't be there for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Mike looked down at his folded arms and nodded. \u201cBut it\u2019s only the Ritual of Rights you\u2019ll miss\u2014you kinda have to be there for the ceremony, since you\u2019re the one who knights us.\u201d</p><p>I swiped a hand slowly across my forehead, wiping away the sweat of the summer day, sneaking in through the open hatch up top.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Mike said, taking a deep breath. \u201cIf we can get your approval, we want to move in on Drake Monday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked at Falcon as he came in. \u201cWe\u2019d do it Sunday, after the crowning, but we all have to attend that stupid ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that leaves Monday,\u201d Blade said.</p><p>\u201cBut...I'm not ready yet, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won't be coming.\u201d Mike leaned on the wall, tucking his foot up under his thigh.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I won't!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, look, we\u2019ve been dicking around\u2014wasting time. Drake knows you're alive. If he comes here, we can keep you safe, but casualties would be insurmountable. I don't want to sit on this any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but if you plan to strike Monday, I'm coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always say that?\u201d I stomped my foot. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I'm Lilithian. I'm powerful, Mike. You've seen it. Why won\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you, Ara. But there\u2019s no need for you to be there. My bite, Blade\u2019s bite, they all do the same thing\u2014and we\u2019re stronger than you are. Ryder pinned you in training yesterday.\u201d He held his palm out as Ryder came in. \u201cIf he can pin you, especially being a newb, it\u2019s a damn sure bet Drake can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, Ara.\u201d Blade moved into me; I shrugged away from his touch. \u201cYou don't need to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not on topic right now,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI need to move the ceremony to Sunday morning\u2014right after your first official session of Court. We\u2019ll perform our rituals in the forest while you\u2019re doing your Walk of Faith, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what this is about?\u201d My narrowed gaze fell over Mike and his conspiring. \u201cYou don't want me out in the forest alone! That's what this really is, isn't it?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>He shrank, all eyes in the room on him. \u201cBaby, this is because we need to move in on Drake. We all gain power from swearing an oath, too. Okay. So this is not just about you!\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to shrink. His voice had that effect.</p><p>Mike sighed and slumped down in a chair, making a steeple of his fingers in front of his lips. \u201cLook, Ara...I'm worried about you.\u201d He looked right at me. \u201cI think we need to bring David back into the picture, and I can't do that until Drake\u2019s locked up or dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we need David back?\u201d I looked around at all my knights. \u201cWhat's the big deal?\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s tongue moved around the corner of his lip for a second; he looked at Falcon, who stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cWe think you've been away from David for too long,\u201d Falcon said.</p><p>Mike stood up, scuffing his chair across the floor until it hit the wall softly. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for you two to be apart. Morg says you\u2019re not right\u2014she says there are things she can\u2019t tell me because they\u2019re personal\u2014\u201d He ran both hands through his hair, \u201c\u2014things about you, and the only thing she can tell me is that we need to hurry and get David back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey're two pieces of one puzzle,\u201d Quaid said from his seat at the table; we all looked over at him. \u201cKeep them apart too long and the equilibrium starts to shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike nodded slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s it, isn't it? It\u2019s like the world isn't right, somehow. It makes me uneasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I've never seen David like this either.\u201d Emily gently placed her fingers against mine.</p><p>\u201cEm!\u201d I spun around quickly and wrapped my arms around her neck. \u201cOh my God. It\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, Ara\u2014you and all your crazy.\u201d She laughed and stood back. \u201cAre you okay? How are you feeling about tonight?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder, looking at my feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She squeezed my fingertips.</p><p>I wanted to tell her everything about the whole magic pheromones curse\u2014tell her she was right; there was no true reason for all these guys to keep falling for me, but a part of me wondered if she already knew. David always told her things he couldn\u2019t tell me; she was starting to feel like an extension\u2014the part of me David could confide in; the sensible, reasonable, mature part of me. Best of both worlds. I suddenly felt the weight of all the bullshit they used to fertilise the Mushroom Land I\u2019d been living in.</p><p>At some point, while I was lost in thought, everyone had decided, despite my disagreement, that the ceremonial procedures for the knighting would begin tonight, after I started my Walk of Faith\u2014ending tomorrow when I would officially knight them into the Core.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It makes us official.\u201d Blade grinned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, all the hours of practice and study\u2014it\u2019s time to get a title for it,\u201d Quaid said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I always wanted to be a knight when I grew up.\u201d Ryder leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cThen you better hurry and grow up,\u201d Blade said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you grow up.\u201d Ryder dived off his chair, pummelling Blade, and they fell to the ground, scuffling about, laughing harder than they were punching.</p><p>Emily and I stepped back, covering our smiles as the other knights jumped up and piled onto the stack.</p><p>\u201cTypical boys,\u201d Morgaine scoffed, coming back into the room. \u201cDo they ever grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a rhetorical question?\u201d I asked, watching the \u2018men\u2019 flounder around on the floor like children.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see the Lilithian family back together again.\u201d Morg wiped an imaginary tear from her cheek. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think, Morg?\u201d I asked, branching us away from the chaos. \u201cMike wants to move the knighting ceremony to tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already spoke to me about it. I agree. We might as well be a complete unit by weeks\u2019 end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s unanimous?\u201d I turned and faced the guys as they stood up, patting themselves off, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cAside from one vote.\u201d Mike placed his phone at the centre of the table. \u201cI officially call this meeting to order.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cDavid? You there?\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d David's voice came through the phone like a long-forgotten melody, and I nearly melted to the floor. Emily pushed a chair under me as I sunk down, ignoring the roaring amusement of my council. \u201cWhat are you all laughing at?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d Mike said. \u201cShe practically fainted at the sound of your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David sounded weary, detached. \u201cMy love, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm fine. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm fine,\u201d he said, but he sounded puffed-out.</p><p>\u201cAre you around humans?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. How can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never breathe heavily unless you're walking fast\u2014in public. And I can hear your footsteps, too,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Uh, well, I'm at the store. Had a hankering for pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Lucky. I wish my life was that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys?\u201d Mike spoke louder. \u201cYou do realise the rest of us are here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Mike,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo what's on the agenda for today?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve all agreed we want to move the knighting ceremony forward\u2014to tomorrow, rituals being done tonight, and...\u201d Mike hesitated.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWe wanna move in on Drake,\u201d Mike finished.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday,\u201d four of us spoke at the same time.</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d David paused, probably rubbing between his brows. \u201cRight. Well, I agree to the ceremony being moved. But, why Monday for Drake? It seems a little soon. And who\u2019s going? Ara? You're not planning on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I'm that stupid, David,\u201d Mike interrupted.</p><p>David just groaned. \u201cI know you\u2019re not, bro. But I know Ara. And you and I both know if she wants to go...there\u2019ll be no stopping her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike looked at me. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm going.\u201d My hands fell on my hips. \u201cI don't care if you try to stop me. I\u2019ll be coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at me.</p> <p>\u201cGuys?\u201d Morgaine piped up. \u201cAra won\u2019t be strong enough after the coronation. The whole process will weaken her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't care. I'm coming.\u201d I held firm when Mike looked at me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we leave it for a week or so\u2014the attack?\u201d Falcon asked Morgaine. \u201cWill she be strong enough then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would bet my life on it.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded, exhaling heavily through his nose. \u201cFine. Okay. You can come\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I jumped in my seat a little, clapping.</p><p>\u201cBut, we can\u2019t leave it too much longer,\u201d he continued. \u201cDrake\u2019s rebuilding his forces\u2014killing humans every day to do it. We need to act soon.\u201d</p><p>I hugged my arms to my chest. Maybe he was right. Maybe we should attack now. I couldn't stand the thought of all those people dying every day for a thing as simple as not having the gene to become a vampire. \u201cWill he make them immune?\u201d I asked, breaking through their conversations. Everyone looked at me. \u201cIf he plans to attack our vampires, they\u2019ll need to be immune. How will he do that without our blood?\u201d</p><p>A cool calm washed over the room. \u201cNo one but us knows about immunity, Ara. Hopefully he hasn\u2019t figured that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he survived an attack with a tipped blade. He must know about it.\u201d</p><p>Mike looked at Falcon, who looked at me. \u201cWe\u2019ve already thought of that, Princess,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry. Let us do that part for you, okay. You need to focus on your coronation.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. I wanted to argue, but I knew Falcon was right.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Mike said, then looked at the four guards. \u201cAnd, guys? I want to brief you again over the knighting ritual before afternoon training today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Ryder smiled.</p><p>\u201cSecond that,\u201d added Blade.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Mike looked around the room, cupping his hands together. \u201cThen, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine touched my shoulder and squeezed gently, looking at Mike. \u201cOkay, can you call this meeting, Mike. I need to brief Amara, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight then.\u201d Mike picked up the phone. \u201cMeeting adjourned. David? I\u2019ll call you later,\u201d he said and hung up without letting me say goodbye first.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d Emily practically snarled.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra might\u2019ve wanted to talk to David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looked at me then the phone in his hand. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the knights fled up the stairs in a crowd of excited hurry, laughing and bumping each other until their noise disappeared. Eric touched my shoulder, smiled sympathetically at me, then followed them up, taking two steps at a time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you up there.\u201d Mike kissed Emily on the cheek, then disappeared too.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d Emily sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cA little. How\u2019s David?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She looked over my shoulder at Morgaine, then smiled back at me. \u201cActually, he\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s like a mopey teenager. He\u2019s fine when he\u2019s focusing on work, but he hasn't got a lead on your family history or word on what's happening in La Ch\u00e2teau de la\u2014lysium,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHe\u2019s miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the pizza.\u201d I smiled to myself. \u201cIf he starts eating ice-cream, we know things are serious,\u201d I joked, but Emily bit her lip. \u201cOh, Em\u2014don't tell me he\u2019s that miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just misses you. He hates being away, and he hates that he can't be here tonight\u2014to see you take your oath.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI hate it, too. But I\u2019ll bet you're happy you\u2019ll be here for the knighting ceremony?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah. It was hard choosing between my mum\u2019s fiftieth or seeing my fianc\u00e9 become a knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s why he was so insistent we move the ceremony?\u201d</p><p>Emily shrugged. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure it was,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cThen again, he is pretty anxious to get in there and kick some evil Blood King butt.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYeah, maybe I should be letting them go without me. I mean, it\u2019s better for the people, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you\u2019re right, Ara?\u201d Emily said. \u201cWhat if they do need you there to kill Drake?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I didn't pipe up and say something.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine took my other hand and pulled me to stand. \u201cWell, none of that matters, right now. We need to go dress you for your big night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and, Em?\u201d Morg looked back at her as we reached the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome by and give Amara some blood in about an hour, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I thought she wasn\u2019t allowed to eat today.\u201d</p><p>Morg smiled. \u201cNo one said she couldn't have a little blood to get her through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRule breaker,\u201d I said; she just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNow, remember, there are strict rules to adhere to\u2014formalities that you must not corrupt,\u201d Morgaine said sternly. \u201cNo smiling, waving, say nothing except your oath, show no emotion, no pain, no joy, no fear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I moaned. \u201cYou\u2019ve only told me fifty times, Morg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And remember, when you reach the edge of the forest, after the Walk of Faith, you must smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d I saluted, smiling at her through the reflection of my dresser mirror.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Amara. I don't mean to be hard on you\u2014it\u2019s just...we have these rules for a reason. Royalty is something highly valued among our people.\u201d She sat down on my bed. \u201cIn the world you grew up in, Princess, no one cares about formalities anymore. But we still do. You must adhere to our traditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Morg.\u201d I rubbed my temples, leaning on my elbows. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said in a soft, high tone, then stood up. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go over this one more time; you carry the dagger to the Stone and use it to make the first cut along your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I ran my tongue over my bottom lip. \u201cRight. The blood of the lips to bind my words to truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d She prompted.</p><p>I spread my fingers and showed an open palm. \u201cBlood of the hand to hold the promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd blood of the heart,\u201d she said. \u201cA pledge to rule with that which guides the soul.\u201d</p><p>I touched a hand to my chest. \u201cHow am I going to stay alive if I have to jab a dagger into my heart?\u201d</p><p>She scratched her nose. \u201cJust don't dig too deep. It only has to be from the place surrounding the heart, Amara\u2014you don't actually have to stab your own heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you fall to the floor and we do the coronation on the next full moon.\u201d Morg looked at my face in the reflection then turned around and grabbed her purple velvet cloak from the bed. \u201cHere\u2014\u201d She ripped off one of the wooden toggles. \u201cJust bite down hard on this\u2014it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>I studied it. \u201cRight. A pop-stick\u2019s going to ease the agony of cutting myself open and splashing my blood on a piece of rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it would help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, help me not bite my tongue off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere now, that's looking on the bright side.\u201d She patted my arm.</p><p>I glared up at her, unamused.</p><p>\u201cCould be worse.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou could have to make the oath naked, like Lilith did.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, then smiled down at the small scar on my wrist; the one Jason left when he attacked me. It was minuscule now, barely a sliver of a memory, but still there, still visible in the light. \u201cThe tatt\u2014er, markings, they fade, right? Like, you're not lying about that part, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When the crown is set atop your head, the ritual is over, and they will fade. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d My wide eyes forced my brows up. \u201cLook, I never liked tattoos. I really don't want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara. You\u2019ll be fine. Stop worrying.\u201d She massaged my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the best day of your life. And we\u2019ll all be there waiting for you at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Morg. I'm just...I mean, what if I forget the words for the incantation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say them in your head as you walk to the Stone, and you\u2019ll be fine. Now\u2014\u201d She unclipped my hair and let it fall loosely down my back, then took my hand, standing me up. \u201cYou remember what Eileen said? How, instead of nakedness, they\u2019re letting you take your oath in a fabric made of nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Patesco Silk.\u201d I closed my eyes for a second, rolling my head as if it\u2019d help bring the information to the surface. \u201cSpun from spiders\u2019 webs, dyed silver as an offering to the Goddess of the Moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...why the Goddess of the Moon?\u201d she asked in a tone one would use with a child in primary school.</p><p>\u201cUh, I know this\u2014\u201d I held my finger up, racking my brain. \u201cIt\u2019s the spirit which strengthens Lilithian power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what else is She?\u201d Morg asked leadingly.</p><p>\u201cUm, and...\u201d I stopped, closing my eyes: \u201cShe also represents purity and serenity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were listening the other day?\u201d Morgaine laughed, helping me out of my bathrobe. \u201cI thought you might have gone to sleep at one point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had.\u201d I chuckled, covering my bare breasts. \u201cI mean, the first three hours were okay, but after that I lost interest.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine grabbed the silver cloth from the bed behind her and wrapped it across my front, tying it around my ribs and over my hips, leaving it hanging loosely from my thighs downward, with a split on each side that revealed my legs. If I moved the wrong way, everyone would see my nakedness beneath.</p><p>\u201cMan, could this be any more revealing?\u201d I ran my fingers over my stomach and turned slightly to see myself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be, so your people can read the runes of your promise as you head toward the Walk of Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I feel so naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing.\u201d She stood behind me and swept my hair back. \u201cWhen we get outside, I need to get a picture, okay. David wants to see how it looks.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cHe was relieved when I told him I wasn\u2019t doing the coronation as close to nature as Lilith did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nakedness wasn\u2019t taken sexually back then. It was a thing of beauty, of perfection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s what the Council tried to tell me when they argued with me about it.\u201d I touched my hand to my collarbone, wishing I could grab my silver locket. \u201cI just wish David was here to actually see me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d She reached around and placed her hand over mine. \u201cIn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven that\u2019s still too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She nodded. \u201cWhen I was dating him, even I found it hard to be away from him. He\u2019s...for all his darkest depths, he\u2019s something pretty special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not just special to me, Morg. He\u2019s my soul.\u201d I dropped my hand to my side, feeling the emptiness of his not being there to catch it.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean soul-mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean\u2014he\u2019s my soul. He\u2019s just the part that broke away.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine studied my eyes for a second, her chocolate gaze stealing my emotions to decipher them. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThen, let\u2019s hope we catch Drake soon, so you and David can be together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, at this point, I\u2019d happily kill Drake just to have David back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich scares me,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't lose who you are, Princess, for the sake of heartbreak. You never know what the future might hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I said, spinning around.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, looking back at me from her distraction, then cupped her hands on my arms and made me sit on the dresser stool, facing her. \u201cOne more thing. Remember how we chose that dress for the crowning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the black one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, well, you need to be wearing that when you come out of the forest. I know it\u2019s tacky, but you have to change in the bushes before you emerge.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not tacky. It\u2019s just like a ballet concert. We had to change on the side of the stage sometimes. It\u2019s what the crowd sees that counts, right?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine smiled widely. \u201cI love how agreeable you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreeable?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the only person who would ever say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Your people love you, Amara\u2014all of them.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my nose a few times to get the itch of Morgaine\u2019s musky perfume from it. \u201cSo, the dress, does it just slip over this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019ll hide it perfectly. Then you just have to walk to the throne, smiling, and sit in the chair all day for your first Court session. Once that\u2019s over, you can knight the Guard and you\u2019ll be free for a few hours until the ball.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded, picturing the events ahead. \u201cSo, how did it look\u2014the crowning dress? Is it like the picture we drew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better.\u201d Morgaine\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I think I'm most excited about that part.\u201d</p> <p>She stood up and leaned over the dresser to dash on some of my lip-gloss. \u201cAnd what are you most scared about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I think the whole enchanted forest thing, you know. People say there\u2019s evil out there, and that if I don't get out before dawn, I\u2019ll be stuck in there for eternity.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine\u2019s shoulders dropped. \u201cUm. Look. I know you want reassurance, but...well...just finish the walk before then, and we won\u2019t have to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cI feel better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but there\u2019s not much I can say. I don't know if those rumours are true, and I'm not willing to test them on you, Majesty. Just don't fail us.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling a deep rumble in the pit of my stomach, I inhaled the wafting, savoury scent of chickens being roasted in the kitchen. Morgaine looked up from straightening her dress and focused on the tight clutch of my hands over my stomach.</p><p>\u201cAra, the sun has barely touched the Earth. You still have a whole twenty or so hours to get through before you can eat. Are you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t designed to go without food. Especially knowing my faithful subjects will be feasting in my absence. Those chickens smell great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBut the feast at the ball tomorrow night will be even better. Trust me\u2014it\u2019s worth the starvation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't see why they\u2019re sticking to the fasting rule.\u201d I rubbed my tummy. \u201cI feel weak enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, we love our rules and rituals around here.\u201d</p> <p>The golden sun, setting around the world outside, sent its pink light into my room, warming the walls with the soft kiss of twilight. I shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Morgaine took a step back and grabbed her cape off the bed. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, jagged breath, then smiled. \u201cI like your hair that colour. Is it naturally brown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But the purple streak is dye.\u201d She grinned, touching it. \u201cIt matches my dress for tomorrow night\u2019s ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the cape, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm going for a whole purple theme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like.\u201d</p><p>She fastened her cloak over her long, fitted black dress and smiled at me as my deep breath turned into a yawn. \u201cYou tired already?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I yawned again. \u201cWill I get any sleep for the next two days? I mean, I\u2019ll be up all night tonight, walking, then all day tomorrow on the throne, doing queenly duties, then the ball\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Welcome to being queen. They expect you to be super-human. Oh, wait\u2014\u201d she touched her fingertip to her chin, \u201c\u2014you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't feel super-human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look super hot.\u201d She elbowed me gently. \u201cAnd I actually think that dress is more perfectly close to nature than being naked.\u201d</p><p>I touched my fingers to the stiff, almost gristly feel of the fabric. \u201cHey, Morg, I have another question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, in the oath, I have to say a word that translates to One Entity. Arthur said it means God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't really know if I believe in God. How can I make an oath to Him if I don't believe in Him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don't you believe in Him?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI just think if He was all so powerful and great, there wouldn\u2019t be such things as war and famine and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Ara, I could so easily get into a debate with you about how ludicrous that statement is, but we don't have time. The One Entity can be any god you want. It just means a higher power than yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...all the old people here believe in God. Aren\u2019t I supposed to believe what my people believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of your people don't know what to believe, Amara. Only the Ancients believe in God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Lilith believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't make yourself believe in anything, Princess. And, like I said, as long as you believe in something bigger than yourself, you can choose whichever religion you want. Drake, for example, was a Pagan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that because he\u2019s a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Study the intricacies of the Pagan religion, Amara. Witchcraft and Paganism are very different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don't have to be a witch to be a Pagan, and you don't have to be a Pagan to be a witch. Why not do some reading, find out for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u2014as long as you believe in something.\u201d</p><p>I looked into my heart for a second as I followed Morgaine from my room. I knew there were things in my soul I would never understand, but I also knew I felt something deeper than myself\u2014something I couldn\u2019t explain. There had to be some entity up there, somewhere, which ruled over all. That much I was sure of. Whether it was God or not, I just couldn\u2019t say. But there was something.</p><p>Morgaine turned back and grabbed my hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go write some history\u2014you can think about the mysteries of God tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>A rushing sound, like an express train in a subway, forced my eyes open. Small needles of dry pine blurred my vision for a second; I blinked them from my lashes, my eyes focusing on the waning daylight, while a woodsy, earthy smell dried my nostrils with each breath. I lifted my face from the crook of my elbow and sat up, circling on my knees a few times in the barky bed I was laying.</p><p>Above me, trees soared high into the summer sky, opening to a ribbon of pink. I jumped to my feet and scuffed back, stopping, palms flat over the bark of a tree trunk.</p><p>\u201cMike!\u201d I called. \u201cMike? Are you out there?\u201d</p><p>No one answered. I couldn't hear anyone or anything. There were no birds, no scuffling of little animals hiding under the brush, not even a breeze\u2014just my own shallow breath and the thumping of my heart. I scrunched my eyes shut, folding over from the tight, searing pulse along my veins; getting hotter the closer it got to my core. And several questions fell through me like water over a window; how the hell did I get out here, and where was everyone else?</p><p>There were no trees that looked like funny old men with weird names, no rock and no Mike. Nothing but me and my confusion.</p><p>I sat down with my legs crossed and ran a fingertip from my ankle to my upper thigh, tracing each tiny little word in black ink. They looked like whirly notepad art or the veins on the back of a leaf. I could feel the burn of the Mark around my eyes and nose, like a mask, but without a puddle or a lake to see my refection, I\u2019d never know what they looked like. Strangely, though, when I leaned closer to my shin and looked carefully at the words, they peered back up at me like text from a children\u2019s book. I knew the swerves and curls of each rune were letters of the old language, just like Jason\u2019s tattoo, but I could read them\u2014every word, as if they were in plain English. I looked away quickly.</p><p>Above me, the sky darkened, with thick purple clouds closing it in, lowering shadows onto the forest with an eerie chill. One thing was clear; somehow, I\u2019d made my oath and ended up in the depths of the forest. But I had no memory of it. No idea where I was or how I got here.</p><p>After a deep breath, I got to my feet and checked myself; my lip wasn't cut, neither was my hand, and...I felt my chest...I clearly hadn\u2019t jabbed myself in the heart. Or maybe I did, and now I was dead\u2014well, as dead as I could be\u2014or unconscious.</p><p>I closed my eyes and focused on my toes, feeling the earth and tiny bits of bark between them, felt the cool of the twilight air, settling around the tops of my ears and the edges of my shoulders. It was real. All too real to be a dream or death. Which meant that, once that sun went down, I would have a hard time figuring out which way led back to civilisation. In fact, I wasn't even sure this was the same forest surrounding the manor. It felt bigger, deeper, scarier than the one I walked in with Mike that day. The trees, though I knew they were filled out with leaves at the very tops, all felt bare and lifeless, slanting inward, looking down on me. I was alone out here, but I didn't feel alone. Not one little bit.</p><p>Rubbing the pulse in my wrist with my thumb, I started walking, cautious eyes checking every branch before passing under it. But the ghostly chill of dusk, gathering at the nape of my neck and seeping down my spine, made me walk a little faster, worrying less about what might be in the trees and more about what might be following me.</p><p>Out here, gravity owned my steps; it seemed I\u2019d been stripped of immortality and all the powers that went with it. The ground felt weird, kind of hard\u2014like I\u2019d been in bed for three days and only just got up. It received my steps, but didn't return them, and I didn't like it. Didn\u2019t like the hunger, the cold, the...feeling human. But if I could overcome it and make it home by dawn, I would finally prove to everyone that I'm not just a dumb little girl.</p><p>With that, I stood a little taller, dropping my arms to my sides.</p><p>Pain or none, I could do this. I was born for this.</p><p>Despite this forest being so uninhabited that the branches had never been trimmed and a trail had never been cleared, it felt kind of like the trees made an aisle for me, turning their heads as I passed, wondering what my business here was. But other than that small feeling of being watched, everything was normal; no marshy bogs or tar pits, no shape-shifting crows that swooped in to kidnap me. It was actually even quite pretty\u2014the raw, untamed part of the forest. Even the weeds, tipped with furry flowers that broke into motes of dust when I passed them, looked pretty in the wild, because they were meant to be here. They weren\u2019t doing any harm\u2014not spoiling prized roses or messing up garden beds. This was their home, and, out here, I was the intruder\u2014the weed.</p><p>Up ahead, a solid figure caught my eye; I stopped dead, looking through the foggy air, past the straight columns of tree trunks. \u201cMike?\u201d I called cautiously.</p><p>Whatever it was stopped moving. I focused on it, squinting.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I called again, cupping my hands around my mouth; my voice echoed all around me. \u201cMike? Is that you...ou...ou?\u201d</p><p>The soles of my feet ached where twigs entered the delicate flesh between my toes and under the bridge of my foot, but I didn't care. I walked carelessly, fast and anxious, stopping when I neared the tree where I\u2019d seen the person\u2014or thought I saw a person.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said, then spun in a couple of circles, looked up the hill and down, but found nothing. No one.</p><p>This time, my tone held a little caution. \u201cMike, are you out there?\u201d</p><p>I waited longer to hear a voice, but only the crass caw of a crow answered. Behind me, the bird sat on a wiry branch, his weight making it bend a little, his call still sounding in my ears. We stared each other down for a few breaths, my heart pounding in my chest, each steady thump like a deliberate bang on a drum. Then, he cawed again and flew off, his silky wings beating the foggy air, until he ducked past a branch and was gone.</p><p>I made the prompt decision then that yelling out, screaming through the forest that I was alone, might perhaps be a bad idea. There was no knowing what was out here. No knowing if the stories were true\u2014if maybe I\u2019d find hundreds of vampires who\u2019d been trapped in here at dawn and were starving\u2014hunting their next meal. And if that eerie-looking crow was anything to go by, it was na\u00efve of me to think I was alone.</p><p>Maybe the person I saw was Mike, but I was so not going to call out to him again.</p><p>A heavy stillness crawled down around me then, bringing night closer and closer, and I felt the tight fist of panic unfurl in my gut. The silent hope I\u2019d had of finding Mike out here\u2014possibly performing his Sacrificial Rights\u2014just became locked behind an iron door. This was all up to me, alone, and all I could do was walk\u2014one way or another, I had to move, and just hope I was headed in the right direction\u2014hope it would lead me to the border by sunrise\u2014any border, even if it wasn't the one lining the Throne Room.</p><p>I lifted my leg a little and rolled my foot to look at the damage; twigs and pebbles stuck out from my skin, finding pockets of softness to hide in. I swiped my hand down them, wincing as a few dragged themselves from the bloodied clasp of my flesh, then dropped my foot back down on its side, so I wasn\u2019t standing on the cuts, and started walking again.</p><p>The further I walked, the deeper I must have headed into the forest. Sunset followed me, sitting in the sky like a timeless wrap. Night should have closed in, should have taken hold of this walk by now, but it seemed as though I\u2019d been dropped off in an empty world that knew no time. I had no watch, but my body-clock was still active, and I knew enough time had passed to bring morning\u2014but hadn't presented a way out of this vast landscape. Suddenly, the idea that this was an enchanted forest seemed a little less ridiculous.</p><p>The branches around my feet had shrivelled away from thick and bold to skinny and scrawny, the shrubs and grasses making way for cages of dead twigs. Each tree I passed screeched at me, creaking as if my presence made their roots ache.</p><p>I sunk my neck into tight shoulders and tucked my elbows closer to my ribs. It felt darker. Every step took me deeper and deeper into the forest, down a hill that never looked like a hill until I glanced behind me. When I looked up from my feet, night seemed to own the path ahead, but I never seemed to reach it, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One thing was for sure, though; at any minute, that sun could disappear and this would all get a lot worse. The sheer vastness of the trees and the waning warmth of day made me feel very small and very out in the open.</p><p>All around me, the cold turned from a brush against my cheeks and ears to a lake of chill, lapping the tops of my thighs and knees. I ran my tongue over my bottom lip, licking away a few strings of dried skin, then pressed them together to keep the moisture there. But only two breaths later, the dryness returned, travelling down my throat, stopping in my belly where I was sure my stomach had eaten itself. But that was the least of my worries. In fact, there were too many terrible things to think about or be afraid of.</p><p>In my mind, I went off on a little wander, taking myself through the past, through hopes for the future, and came upon a memory of Mike and I as children\u2014playing hide and seek in the bushes back home. It was almost as if it came alive then\u2014as if my hands showed youth, my feet, even the baby soft hair falling over my shoulder. I let myself imagine it\u2014let myself see this as a place where children played.</p> <p>\u201cReady or not,\u201d I said, so quiet my bare feet made more sound over the dry leaves. \u201cHere I come.\u201d</p><p>The imaginary version of Mike laughed, running behind a tree. I saw him\u2014saw which one he hid behind. He was so silly. He always made it too easy.</p><p>\u201cI saw you, Mike,\u201d I said, smiling for real as I came upon the tree. \u201cI always see yo\u2014\u201d But he was gone. I looked over my shoulder and saw the little boy, hair of gold, run behind another tree, laughing.</p><p>My sneaking feet balanced over the bark and twigs carefully; I had to be quiet if I was going to surprise him. But a twig snapped, its crack echoing all around me like an artificial sound.</p><p>I stopped dead and looked down at my feet; there was no twig there\u2014not under my foot, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cFound you!\u201d the little boy said, stopping just in front of me. He was small, wearing black shorts and a stripy shirt, his face dirty, his cheeks plump, but it wasn\u2019t Mike.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked behind him, then took off in a run, giggling.</p><p>I ran after him, pushing wiry branches aside as they struck my cheeks, my brow, my forearms, and as I flew into the clearing where the little boy went, stopped dead. It was empty. No one was there. I could see all the way up the slope, all the way to the darkest part of the forest on all sides, but there was no child.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d I called.</p><p>He didn't answer.</p> <p>The fog closed in around me, fingering my legs, my arms and shoulders until it blotted out the trees and even the ground just below my feet. That furl of panic returned. I exhaled into the air, feeling my breath brush back on my own lips. \u201cHello?\u201d I said, pushing my arms out to my sides slowly to make sure I hadn't fallen into a small hole or woken up buried in a coffin. As I reached into the empty space, a small hand appeared around my wrist.</p><p>I gasped, yanking back, falling to the ground with my arm raised to protect my face.</p><p>But nothing happened.</p><p>Very slowly, I slid my hand down from my eyes and peeked out past my wrist, dropping it completely when the empty, clear lines of the forest stared back.</p><p>The fog was gone. The hand, gone.</p><p>The gravity of loneliness opened the world around me then, as if I could pan out to a view above everything and see myself, so small, so alone, out here in the forest with no one but myself to protect me. That was just a recipe for disaster.</p><p>I looked up to the weaving branches, blending in with the black of night as the last clouds ate the sun. Darkness fell, descending like a velvet cloak, ingesting the treetops, the branches and, finally, the trunks, until all I could see was my own hands if I held them right up to my nose.</p><p>I was alone. Burning. Starving. Weak. Hopeless.</p> <p>Inevitability surrounded me on all four sides; the shadowed density of night that circled the trees would be the path I\u2019d walk until dawn. The timer had started. My mission had begun. I had only hours now to get out of here.</p><p>But I didn't want to walk. I didn't want to go deeper into a landscape I couldn\u2019t see. How was I to know if I\u2019d fall off a cliff or hit a tree? How could I possibly walk through what I couldn\u2019t actually see?</p><p>And despite that, I felt myself get up, protest screaming within me, and start walking. If I sat there all night, I might not get hit by branches or feel the itch of hairs raising on the back of my neck from things I couldn't see, but one thing was guaranteed; if I didn't get up, get walking and find my way, all hope would be lost, and I would not only fail my people, but never make it home again.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I felt around for a tree trunk, pressing my forehead into the dry, scratchy bark when I found it. My body swayed, too worn to stand straight. Rushes of cold then hot kept making me want to flop down and rest. Just rest\u2014just five minutes and I might have the strength to go on.</p><p>I slid my hands down the tree and felt for the ground. There was no grass, like I hoped, only dry dirt. But it was cool\u2014soothing against the hot Markings. I laid on my back, pressure rising in my nose, cheekbones and brow, making my headache throb, and brushed my limbs through the dirt, forming mounds under my elbows and shins.</p><p>The night felt longer than it should be. I\u2019d been convinced at least twice that the sun should be showing on the distant horizon, but it never came. I\u2019d walk and stumble and feel pointy branches scrape and pinch my skin, not focusing too much on time, until I walked so long I had to stop and catch my breath, realising only then that day hadn't come any closer. That time vortex had hold of me again, and I wasn't so sure this darkness had an end. But if I could sleep, maybe just fall asleep for a little while, the sun might be there when I opened my eyes.</p><p>The skin around my elbow pulled, the dried wounds cracking when I folded my arms in and rested my hands on my belly. Just five minutes. Just close my eyes for a little while, I said to myself. Just a little while....</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open and I sat up, darkness all around me, the ring of that whisper warm in my ear. I think I even dreamed a face to go with it\u2014saw the grey skin, the red lips, the dark hair.</p><p>I shook my head, dislodging it, and scuffled back on my hands until I felt the trunk of the tree on my spine. Clearly, I hadn't slept long enough to bring day or to make myself feel any better.</p><p>The burn in my skin retreated for the chills again. I hugged my arms across my chest and tucked my knees up, making myself small, but there was nowhere to hide, no way to escape the cold. The trees were all thin and bare, and the only warmth I found all night was the five minute intervals where my skin burned before it grew cold again, making me shake. Every muscle in my body ached like the flu; my lower back, legs, the ones around my neck and shoulder blades, even my bones ached.</p><p>I pressed the back of my wrist to my forehead; it felt muggy, sweaty, but underneath that, really hot\u2014hot enough to warm my throat just by breathing near it. Even my tongue felt hot.</p><p>\u201cHow can they expect me to do this?\u201d I murmured to myself, or maybe to that One Entity. \u201cI'm sick. I just need to go home to bed.\u201d</p><p>But it didn't matter. No one had installed the red button of panic out here. I couldn\u2019t just call Mike and beg him to come pick me up. I had to finish this. I had no choice but to either find a way out of here or be lost in the black purgatory for a time longer than I could comprehend.</p><p>Around the changing temperature of my body, the night air suddenly became cooler, settling over my toes, the very tips of my fingers and nose in an icy layer. I held my hand out to the emptiness, half expecting to feel snow, when I heard something\u2014a scuffle, a purposeful brush of a form against a tree branch. Singular. Lone. No other sound to follow it or around it. It wasn\u2019t wind, because there was no wind. It wasn\u2019t the crow, because he was rude and noisy. It had to be something else.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d A whisper slipped along my neckline.</p><p>I spun around to the tree\u2014just a tree, nothing else.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d The voice came at me again, creeping down my spine in a tepid breath.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I whirled around, the thump of my heart using more energy than I had spare. I felt weaker, so weak I knew I couldn\u2019t run if there really was a person there. \u201cWho...who are you?\u201d I said carefully, not really wanting an answer.</p><p>But the sound that came next left me with nothing but confusion; it started as a winding sound, like a cog or a crank, and grew into a soft, chilling lullaby.</p><p>I rolled onto my knees, digging my hands into the earth to steady myself.</p><p>Music. It was music. Like the box David gave me before our wedding.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called again, sitting very still, waiting to hear a sound.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d It whispered right by my face\u2014I felt it, felt its dry skin by my wrist; I snatched my hand into my chest and sprung back from the voice, white shock blackening my mind as my heart caught hold of itself.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d It said, talking faster than I had.</p><p>I wiped a hand across the ground, grabbing the first stick I felt, then aimed it into the darkness, waving it around blindly. \u201cI...I have a stick,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cAnd I will use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill use it,\u201d the voice said.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cShe sells seashells by the sea shore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the sea shore,\u201d It whispered back, a breathy, speedy echo of myself. I think.</p><p>Panting heavily in gusty breaths of cold, I pressed my hand to my forehead again; the fever was burning, clearly making me hallucinate.</p><p>I got up, ready to move on from this spot, and snapped the tip of the twig with my thumb. But a cold wash of fresh fear straightened my spine when an identical snap echoed from behind me. My shoulders lifted into stiffness as I turned slowly, deathly afraid of the form I might find. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d A hot breath moistened my ear.</p><p>I dropped the stick and ran, fast as I could but slow as a human\u2014wishing my legs would work properly. Each step hit the ground under me with a crunch of dry leaves, and the stranger mimicked. I pushed harder, faster, closing my fist, tilting my head for fear of hitting a tree and gouging my eyes out on its razor claws. \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d I screeched, panicked sobs choking my breath.</p><p>The sound of the stranger\u2019s footfalls thumped faster, doubling mine as we sped through the black, until my heel slipped, skidding out on a rock that sent me onto my side, dragging my leg, my ribs and my head along the sloped ground after it. I stopped on my tangled shins at the base of a tree and covered my face. \u201cPlease, don't hurt me.\u201d</p><p>But nothing grabbed me.</p><p>Nothing touched me or poked me or whispered in my ear.</p><p>Several beats of my heart passed, and the exhaustion forced a wave of calm through my limbs. Slowly, I slid my hands down from my face and blinked against a glare. Daylight!</p><p>A hysterical giggle jolted the pit of my empty stomach, though it refused to break through my lips. I looked up at the changing sky, looked at my hands, my dirty feet, my stained dress and all the gashes along my arms, legs and hands. It was a dream. The thing. Just a dream.</p><p>Feeling a little silly, I pushed up to stand, holding the trunk of a tree to keep my balance. The soles of my feet burned like walking on hot asphalt in the summer\u2014they even felt sticky as if it had melted there, too. I curled my toes to keep them from touching the hard ground.</p><p>All around me crickets sounded the song of dawn, and the trees, with their tall, reaching branches, stretched out to the heavens, warming their leaves in the golden glow of the sun, while a fresh, moist breeze brought a dewy, sugared taste to each breath I took.</p><p>But the colour of dawn drained the blood from my face. I slid down the bark of the tree and covered my mouth, tears blurring the yellow beginning of day.</p><p>I failed them. I failed the Walk of Faith.</p><p>Morning had broken, and I hadn\u2019t found the black dress, the border of the forest or hope.</p><p>My eyes traced the skin all the way along my wrists and down the backs of my hands; the tattoos were gone\u2014faded away to a silvery memory under my skin. They were supposed to disappear as the crown touched my head, clearly not because it was a mystical crown, but because it took a night for my soul to absorb the promise\u2014a promise I no longer had any right to wear.</p><p>I traced the absent Markings with a fingertip, scratching the skin as if I could make it come back. But I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>They were right. All of them. I am just a baby. The all-powerful pure blood, and yet, I couldn\u2019t even finish the Walk of Faith.</p><p>In my mind, I could see them all by the edge of the forest, waiting for me. They\u2019d all be standing there right now, their eyes hopeful, their smiles starting to slip as each second of sunrise passed. Mike would lower his head, Emily would cover her mouth, and everyone would turn away slowly and go home. And that would be that. It was over before it even begun.</p><p>But I would be here. I would be lost in this forest for the rest of eternity, and still, that wasn\u2019t what scared me. What scared me most was what would happen to those people without me. My bite turned Mike, my existence made others change their allegiance, and now, Drake would come back and kill them all for it. And it was, without any doubt in my heart, my fault.</p><p>I stood up and turned on my heel, indifferent to the beauty of the day, wandering aimlessly forward, with nowhere really left to be. A weary princess wearing a broken promise.</p><p>Throughout the hours that passed me, I thought about my dad a lot. I wondered if Mike would tell him the truth about why I disappeared for eternity. And a part of me smiled because, somewhere inside, I felt like Dad would come out here to find me. If anyone would, it\u2019d be my dad. Of all the people I needed in my life, he was always the one who was there\u2014through everything. He came to me when I lost my mum; he wrapped his arms around me and told me it would be all right. And he made it all right. He gave me a home and a bed and he hugged me every day. And maybe I was hurting inside, and it was a hurt he couldn't heal, but I knew he wanted to. I knew he would give up everything and anything to make me safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I never felt safe. Not really. And the worst part was, until now, I didn't understand some of that feeling. It was never in the sense that I was afraid I\u2019d be kidnapped or tortured, this was before all that; this was when I felt afraid of having nothing. I wondered how I would live if I didn't have a bed or food or my mum and dad, and now I've come to understand a new truth altogether; you don't need any of it. You don't need a bed or food or love, because, at the end of the day, even without all that, you're still alive. While you're missing the smell of roast chicken or crying because you can\u2019t hold those you love, you are surely and definitely still alive. It\u2019s the cruelty of the world, I suppose\u2014to take everything we need, everything we thought we needed to survive, and show us our hearts will keep on beating; we will keep on breathing without it.</p><p>And that\u2019s when you have to hope. That\u2019s what hope is.</p><p>Nothing is final until you're dead.</p> <p>I looked up at the clouds and closed my eyes as the warmth of the day made my skin feel yellow and bright all over.</p><p>Where there is life, there is hope. And I wasn\u2019t a little girl anymore; I couldn\u2019t lay in my bed, safe and warm with my dad down the hall\u2014the one who always knew what to do; the one who always told me it would be okay. It was my job to be that now. And maybe I didn't feel like it would all be okay; maybe I was scared all the time, but I at least had to be the one who said it would be okay. I had to be the leader.</p><p>But I learned that too late.</p><p>I opened my eyes again and let out a long breath, then poked at the seeping gash on my arm; it was swollen and red, probably infected, since, out here, I no longer seemed to be Lilithian. I was more human than I\u2019d ever been before. And it hurt and it sucked and I hated every breath of it. But this was it for me now. This would be my new life, and all I could do was find some food or some water and wander every tiny inch of this forest until, maybe one day, I might find the border again. Who knows? It wasn\u2019t much, but it was...a hope.</p><p>And at least if I eventually did make it out, I could say that I\u2019d done it on my own\u2014that I may have failed my people, but I did not fail myself.</p> <p>As the day wore on, I trudged up an endless hill; I could see the top, but as the sun moved to the west, that distance hadn\u2019t changed, and when I looked back behind me into the mouth of the valley, it looked as though I\u2019d only taken forty steps.</p><p>The sun glared down on my faded tattoos and sweat beaded across my brow, seeping into the swollen, yawning cuts all over my body. The muscles in my upper thigh were tight and burning from the constant uphill, and I was sure my mind had been turning the small shrubberies into sandwiches as I passed them\u2014just to tease me.</p><p>By now, everyone would know I failed. David would be worried; he would\u2019ve pinched his brow, probably even shook his head. Deep down inside, he knew I wasn\u2019t capable of this\u2014Mike knew, everyone knew. I was the only one who didn't. I was the only one who actually believed I might stand a chance.</p><p>I smiled then, thinking of another. Arthur. He believed in me, too. He always did. And I couldn\u2019t understand why. I never gave him any real reason to believe. Everything clever I learned about ruling, I learned from him. But maybe that was the point. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that I was dumb and young, but that I was capable of learning. Of all the people who would shake their heads in disappointment at this useless princess, Arthur would be the one man who would take me up in his arms, probably kiss my forehead and say he was glad to have me back. If I ever made it out of here.</p><p>As I distracted myself with his memory, I felt the unusual sensation of flat ground under me. I fell to my knees and locked my hands into the dirt, a snap decision away from kissing it, but I knew, with my luck, I\u2019d end up with an ant biting my lip or dirt in my mouth which would just dry it out even more and send me into a coughing fit.</p><p>Not bothering too much to cover myself from Nature\u2019s eye, I spun around disgracefully and sat on the ground, my gaze on the cavernous valley below. The grot around my fingernails stung, like the blood was tightening as it dried, peeling the delicate skin around my cuticles back. I didn't even have enough saliva to spit on them and wash some of it off. I blew on them instead, trying to rub the skin back the right way.</p> <p>In the forest beside me, a beam of light broke the dimness, and fluttering along, ignorant to the agony I\u2019d suffered, was a beautiful blue and black butterfly. It let the soft breeze carry it, landing right on the corner of my elbow.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, trying not to breathe on it. \u201cWhat are you doing out here all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>Without answering, it rose up into the air and fluttered to the border of the trees, where it sat on the ground for a second, shaking its wings. And something glinted under the soil, the sunlight beaming for a second. I struggled to my feet, gravity weighing me down, and wandered over, flopping onto my knees in the dirt.</p><p>The butterfly took flight, leaving me alone with this mysterious silver thing hiding in the earth. Each grain of dirt stuck to the dried blood, wriggling under the lifted skin around my nails as I burrowed my fingertips under the metal and dragged out a solid little key.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get all the way out here?\u201d I said, wiping my thumb over the symbol on the top; it looked like a headless snake, winding and tangling around itself; no beginning; no end. A thin silver chain hung down from it, delicate and shimmering, like a spider\u2019s web in the sunlight. The key was old, that much I was sure of, but it wasn\u2019t rusted to decaying. It looked as though it belonged to something\u2014to someone, once.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, fastening the chain around my neck. \u201cIt belongs to me, now.\u201d It rested neatly just below my collarbones, the chain slightly longer than the one my locket used to hang from\u2014my own little treasure, the key to all my secrets.</p><p>I stood up again, dusting my knees off, brushing aside the silly idea that they key might be a metaphor\u2014the key to hope. No way. That\u2019s way too corny.</p><p>As I took a step, heading to who knows where, my ears pricked to attention. Somewhere in the distance, I was sure I heard voices. The newfound idea of hoping awakened my positive internal thinker and so, I farewelled the endless valley with one loathsome glimpse, and walked toward the \u2018possible\u2019 chatter.</p> <p>But I only took two steps before my heart stopped and my feet froze, my eyes widening around the most magnificent sight I\u2019d ever seen. People! My insides went on a frenzy. They\u2019d found me.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I called, my dry throat amplifying the angst in my voice but drowning out the volume.</p><p>I looked inside myself for some strength. I hadn\u2019t used my voice for so long now I could hardly remember how to say my own name. Swallowing, I moistened my throat with the last stratum of saliva and took a breath. \u201cMike!\u201d</p><p>The sun was almost gone again, but darkness shouldn't affect his hearing. I trudged over the dry ground and stood right beside him, laughing.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>But he didn't hear me. He plain didn't hear me; he stared forward, focusing on something, as did every person in this small clearing with him. I looked at each face, studying each concerned gaze, and realised they were all watching one thing; my head turned slowly to the centre of the clearing and my heart washed away with a breath of pure shock.</p><p>The blood oath.</p><p>There, by the Stone of Truth, kneeling, eyes closed, bloodied wrist outstretched, was\u2014me! I hadn\u2019t left yet? I was still there.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I ran toward me. \u201cWhat are you doing? We\u2019ve done this! We\u2019ve done this!\u201d I yelled at her, but she didn't hear. \u201cPlease? I walked all night. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>None of them saw, though; they all watched her as she cut herself open and bled on the Stone, her lips moving with the words of her promise.</p><p>I felt hollowed out, numb, walking backward until I found the welcome embrace of wiry branches, holding me up. \u201cPlease stop,\u201d I whispered to myself. \u201cPlease don't say the oath.\u201d</p><p>Her words trickled through me like a bad memory\u2014one you wish you could forget, and without looking up, without taking a breath, she lifted the dagger and held it to her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I reached out, buckling over with wide eyes bulging when a jagged, burning sear scorched the bones inside my chest. And with a tight-fisted grunt, drew back, hitting my head against the tree as the tip of her blade popped the surrounding pocket of fluid inside my heart, pausing its ragged beat momentarily.</p><p>Her breath stopped; my breath stopped, and time flattened out around me. She slowly scraped the dagger out; every inch like a slather of wood grating over teeth.</p><p>Sound came rushing back, the volume too loud, and I gasped a wild, shrieking breath, clutching my breast. My heart started back up again, pumping gushes of blood out over my fingers, staining the silver silk\u2014soaking through and dribbling in a warm tickle down my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat's happening?\u201d I said, my breath barely a whisper; my eyes open, unblinking. \u201cI don't understand.\u201d</p><p>Mike and Emily watched as I bled my oath\u2014the real me\u2014or the imposter, I didn\u2019t know, but I watched on too. She rose to her feet, and with her eyes closed, her lip stiff\u2014trying in vain to hide her pain under the mask of deception\u2014she walked toward Mike\u2014toward the edge of the forest.</p><p>As she passed each subject, they read aloud the words that burned her skin\u2014my skin\u2014each sentence like spiky, acid spears of hot lava. Wasps, bees, bashing my knee on a step was nothing in comparison to this.</p><p>But she walked\u2014her face perfect, her lips red with blood, her skin pale under the dark inks of her Markings. She was flawless and so beautiful, while I fought to breathe\u2014a sticky, sweaty mess of my own tears and blood.</p><p>Mike reached for her as she passed him, and though it was a small movement, I saw her shake her head, keeping her eyes closed, as if she knew, as if she needn't see him reach out but knew he would. I wanted so badly for her to fall into his arms, have him make everything okay\u2014just know that somewhere out there, one of us was safe. But she wouldn't. She had a path to walk\u2014and she walked it blindly, not knowing the hell I\u2019d been through\u2014the hell we would go through all over again as soon as she set foot over that border.</p><p>Morgaine edged forward several times, hesitating before launching after Ara and wrapping a dark-purple cloak over her shoulders without disturbing even one step. I saw it wrap her, but felt the warmth on my own skin, and when I looked down, the silky velvet rested softly over my shoulders, hiding the silver dress. I touched my bloodied fingers to it, matting the velvet slightly.</p><p>\u201cShe looks so beautiful,\u201d Morgaine said, covering her mouth.</p><p>Mike blinked a few times, practically biting his own fist. \u201cI don't like this, Morg.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers floated slowly up through the air and came to rest on Mike\u2019s arm; he looked at her. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not so sure anymore, I... We gotta stop her.\u201d He darted forward and everything disappeared in a cloud of whitewash as Ara placed her foot to the doorstep of this ever-holding prison.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed at her, grasping the air where Mike\u2019s hand had been. \u201cWhat have you done!\u201d</p><p>Each step she took forward, deeper and deeper into the Walk of Faith, saw the burn of our promise mark my skin once more. I held my arm out and watched it snake its way along\u2014the words becoming clear to me once more; you will never escape. Leave the forest by dawn or be trapped in there for eternity.</p><p>I closed my eyes and listened to the ghostly whispers of the warning.</p><p>\u201cNever step foot in the Forest of Enchantment\u2014never step foot in there at dawn.\u201d</p><p>Dawn.</p><p>The word echoed all around me in the haunting silence of eternally consequential mistakes. My failure would repeat itself over and over again for me to watch, to relive.</p><p>I rested the back of my head against the bark of the tree, but stumbled back, falling through nothing, seeing the world go white around me...</p><p>...My eyes flashed open. I looked down, standing where Ara had been only a second ago.</p><p>We merged. I became her, but with the memory of a treacherous night too fresh in my mind to stop the tears. I just wanted to go home\u2014be normal, be with David. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>I sunk to the ground\u2014a pitiless soul in an empty world\u2014and hugged my knees to my chest, weeping into my arms. I was alone. Forgotten. A memory they would mourn, for sure, but evermore only that.</p><p>Trudging endlessly down an entirely different path, I shivered at the thought of the darkness to come.</p><p>My legs hurt, aching as if hands of reverberating sharpness were rubbing up and down my thighs, and my stomach felt like I swallowed a big, empty bowl of space. Even the grumbling hurt.</p><p>I rubbed the tops of my legs, letting my skirt rise higher than I would if there were others around. All over my skin, the Markings made me look like a favourite old Barbie doll someone\u2019s little brother had gotten hold of and scribbled on with a permanent pen.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks!\u201d I flopped down on my back, blowing my tantrum out with a hard pant. Overhead, my only friend shone down on me, lighting the sky pink as it had done on the last dusk, and beside that, my enemy crept in like purple shadows, disguising itself as clouds.</p><p>Hope was lost. It was my job to find it out here, but I failed. Now, I couldn\u2019t even seem to find the beauty of the forest, either. It wasn\u2019t pleasant like a national park or the forest by the lake. This was wild and untamed and open and no one knew where to find me. I wished the trees weren\u2019t so high, so that maybe I could feel sheltered. I just felt so out in the open\u2014like anyone, anything could be watching. But nothing ever showed. That rude crow hadn't even returned.</p><p>Though this world maintained it was dusk, I felt time passing again. I lay on the dirt, semi-conscious, singing to the sky, twirling the key around and around. Every now and then, I held it up to the light and moved it along so the pink sun made the silver sparkle. I wondered whose key it was\u2014what it locked away, whether it was a good secret or maybe a bad one. And wondered if perhaps it was a secret of the heart, like the ones I held. Maybe whoever owned this key felt love for another man, even though she was married, or maybe, in truth, it opened the lock to her lies\u2014perhaps lies she told herself because she didn\u2019t want to know the secrets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The longer I laid on the cold dirt, the clearer the sounds around me became; the lonely song of twilight hummed my heart to ease\u2014the crickets, the buzzing of mosquitoes, the distant, sleepy ballad of a bird. I closed my eyes and let myself imagine home. Home. Mike. His smile, his smell, all powdery-smooth, and the warm, scratchy stubble on his chin that\u2019d prickle my forehead when he\u2019d kiss my brow.</p><p>Home is David. His eyes. Green. Greener after we\u2019d make love and the electric blue surge of my uncontrolled passion had run free of them.</p><p>I shut my eyes tighter around the memory and held it all inside. Eventually these memories would fade, just like all the faces of my past. But right now, while I\u2019d only been lost for a few days, they were as clear as a summer sky.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes again, with the memory of summer so strong in my heart, midday actually filled out the forest around me. A sweet chocolaty scent ran through me with a deeper breath as I rolled onto my side, seeing a shape through the glare, like a beautiful man laying right in front of me, face to face. His green eyes stared into mine, but even though the day was so bright that sadness seemed misplaced here, his soul looked lost, broken. I reached up, slowly tracing my thumb over each grain of hair along his jaw, feeling every bump, every rise in his skin, stopping on a small scar at the base of his chin\u2014one he got when his six-year-old brother kicked him for losing a paper boat he\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>His smile was so filled with kindness that my heart burned with the almost forgotten feeling of being loved.</p><p>\u201cJase, are you really here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he said in that smooth, low voice. \u201cYou have to get up\u2014you have to keep moving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My eyes rolled back, closing. \u201cI can\u2019t. I failed, Jase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You only fail if you don\u2019t get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t find it\u2014hope. I thought I did, but...it was only a thought\u2014an idea, and I keep losing it. I just keep losing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope was never to be found, Ara. Hope is something you always had in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I'm not what my people needed me to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you are more than they hoped you would be\u2014capable of more than they allowed you to believe.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head against the dirt. \u201cI couldn't finish the walk. I'm no good to anyone, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still as valued as you were when you left. You never needed to prove anything to them about your worth, sweet girl\u2014you only need to prove it to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all gone. Everything I was supposed to be\u2014supposed to do\u2014all gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know what the future holds for you when you return, Ara, and I don't know what your people will say, but I know that no matter what you\u2019re worth to them, you will always be everything to one person in this world.\u201d His shaggy hair fell loosely in the dirt above his brow, and his sparkling grin, as he ran his fingertips along my face, made me feel as if he was really here. \u201cFind your way home, Ara\u2014find your way back to that one person, and you will never doubt yourself or your worth, ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who are you talking about? What one person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour true love.\u201d He shuffled a little closer; I felt his knees against mine. \u201cHe will hold you, kiss you and adore you\u2014come what may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d He stroked the tip of his thumb down my nose. \u201cOr perhaps not. Perhaps he is much closer than you think\u2014waiting for you to return to your dreams again, so he can hold you there, in his lonely reality\u2014for eternity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, Ara.\u201d He took both my hands. \u201cCome back to me...\u201d</p><p>Dark splotches distorted the image of Jason\u2019s face; I blinked a few times, trying to make it clearer.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me...\u201d His voice echoed away.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d His touch dissolved. I sat bolt upright in the dark of night. \u201cJase?\u201d Stay.</p><p>But he was gone again, leaving me battling with the deepest part of myself that loved him once\u2014loved him, but never got to say goodbye. I wish I could\u2019ve told him how I really felt\u2014wish I could\u2019ve told him in a room where it would have mattered.</p><p>But each time that battle began in me, screaming at the heavens, telling me to love him, I fought it down\u2014sent it away. The girl I saw in my dreams was right; I loved him once, and I didn't want to grieve him. I could grieve my mum, I could possibly even grieve Mike, but...just not Jason.</p><p>I covered my face, trying to sneak back into the world he and I shared. But it was always only a dream\u2014one that equalled reality in all five senses. I wanted to go back there\u2014to him. And that scared me. Because I knew, of all things I had to face here, facing that truth was the worst.</p><p>I got up, got to my feet and started walking again.</p><p>He asked me to come back to him. He was here\u2014if that was a dream or not, I didn't care. I felt home\u2014felt him, and I just wanted that back again. Death, dream or reality. It didn't matter anymore.</p><p>The trees thickened around me as I scuffed gracelessly over the dirt. Each entangled finger of branches seemed to deliberately slow me down\u2014touching me, grabbing me, snagging on my dress and arms.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I shoved a dry, twiggy talon off my flesh. \u201cStop. Touching. Me!\u201d</p><p>But none of them listened. They had me. They owned this part of the forest, and I wasn't allowed to go there.</p><p>I swiped my tears away and stood still in the crowded cage of dense shrubbery.</p><p>Maybe the trees were right. Maybe I was headed in the wrong direction. In my mind, I was walking to him\u2014to Jason, but I was supposed to be walking home\u2014to David. My husband. The one who has stayed with me, married me, put up with all my temper tantrums and stupid ideals. The one who always would.</p><p>Maybe I was supposed to walk back to him. Maybe I could never go to Jason because the road to the underworld was guarded by things unseen.</p><p>I had to turn around. I had to get back home\u2014to life, to my people\u2014to David.</p><p>Somewhere up in the night sky, the moon had risen, offering a pale glow to the darkness, illuminating the base of the trees in a soft, dull-blue\u2014giving everything a dreary, grainy appearance. I looked along the length of my forearm and twisted it to see my elbow; the tattoos glowed, as if the moon was calling to them, and they were answering. Perhaps they had a clue, a message of some kind that would tell me how to get out of this forest.</p><p>Everyone seemed to have had their own theories before I left; \u2018Follow the North star,\u2019 Walter said. \u2018Walk the path before your feet and don't look up,\u2019 someone else had said, and Emily quite simply said, \u2018Let your heart guide you.\u2019</p><p>I looked behind me then to the path I\u2019d been heading\u2014to Jason\u2014noticing that the trees had closed in, blocking that trail, making it impossible to get through.</p><p>Was that it? Follow my heart? Was I walking toward my heart?</p><p>I thought of David\u2014saw his secret smile in my mind, felt the warmth of his love and let it fill me up from inside my chest, branching out like climbing vines.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I spun around then, in a completely different direction, but I knew it was the way. Walk toward what your heart desires.</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d I said to myself, and as I took a step, something cracked under my foot\u2014the sound making my eyes wide before my hair and arms went vertical and my feet carried my body on a direct path downward.</p><p>I squealed, grasping at every branch to stop myself falling, coming to rest with a thunderous impact on my knees, my hands, then my head....</p><p>A rushing sound, like an express train in a subway, forced my eyes open. Small needles of dry pine blurred my vision for a second; I blinked them from my lashes, my eyes focusing on the waning daylight, while a woodsy, earthy smell dried my nostrils with each breath.</p><p>I lifted my face from the crook of my elbow and sat up, circling on my knees a few times in the barky bed I was laying.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I frowned and looked down at my hands, my arms and my stained dress. \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d</p><p>My heart faltered. Everything stopped.</p><p>I sunk down into my elbow and rolled onto the ground, flat on my back. \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>With my hands clasped over my belly, the ability to cry deflated from my tired soul, I decided to let myself stay put and expire.</p><p>As midday drank the cool in the air and infected it with a gooey heat, I laid, watching memories like films in my head, while the bare branches above me joined hands again across the grey-white sky, applauding the movies as they ended. Everything seemed to move slightly around me, as if it couldn't sit still.</p><p>Worse had come to worst. All the hope I thought I found was never really hope at all; it was positive thinking\u2014just the thoughts of a stupid young girl who really believed that everything would be all right in the end. But it isn\u2019t. It couldn\u2019t be. Why would it be?</p><p>It was all Emily\u2019s fault. Listen to my heart. What kind of stupid advice is that? All it\u2019s done is get me into more trouble. I should have listened to myself and just given up a few sunrises ago. Then I wouldn\u2019t be even more tired, even more beat up and bruised.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. You got me!\u201d I yelled at the forest. \u201cI'm not afraid of you anymore. You want me, I'm right here.\u201d</p><p>I flopped back down.</p><p>Forget them. All of them. None of it matters now. The monarchy will die. The people will go about their lives. And if Drake doesn't kill everyone, Mike will probably go home, marry Emily. David will probably marry her too\u2014some foul three-way. Morg will be with Blade, Sam will grow up and never think of me. And Jason\u2014his face stole my thoughts, making me smile\u2014Jason will be lost in his illusory dreams until I lose consciousness one day and meet him there. We\u2019ll hold hands and lay in the grass all day, every day, for forever.</p><p>I rubbed that thought away from my hot brow with an icy hand. How could you think like that? I asked myself. How could you place your happy ending in some imaginary world with your husband\u2019s brother?</p><p>\u201cI love David. David.\u201d I hit my temples. \u201cDavid! David! David! David!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssure you do,\u201d a slow, whispering hiss said.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did following your heart bring you back here?\u201d It said very slowly.</p><p>\u201cMy heart didn't bring me here. I fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell through the web of your own lies.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, staying flat on my back, my lip lifting. \u201cThe other path was blocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlocked?\u201d It said. \u201cOr maybe you needed to fight harder to make it through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don't see what business it is of yours, evil-voice-that-doesn't-exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to see you find your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't fire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I won't tell you what I came to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said to the nothing. \u201cThen you\u2019re unfired. Now, what did you want to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>I scratched my nose. \u201cDid that. So, unless you can give me some good advice, buzz off and let me die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not advice. Perhaps I can tell you something you don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what\u2019s in your heart\u2014what's really in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know that. It\u2019s David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you feel him, too!\u201d It hummed.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brother.\u201d</p><p>My chest lifted with a super huge sigh. \u201cNo. I keep thinking that, but it\u2019s not true. It can't be. And, so what if it was true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d It hissed, \u201cwill be the one hope you can offer yourself\u2014only then can you give it to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you know about it, you're just a figment of my\u2014\u201d I pushed up on my elbows, \u201c\u2014Gah!\u201d</p><p>A shiny black snake hissed back at me, its wide mouth gaping, showing pointy fangs. I jumped up, stumbling backward over a rock and fell on my hands.</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d It crept forward, almost smiling with its soulless eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet away.\u201c I screamed, brushing my legs with my hands. \u201cYou ugly, horrible little thing. Get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve come with a message,\u201d it hissed without moving its lips. \u201cOne that will mark you on your way to being a great ruler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d I stopped wriggling, shrinking into myself with the snake\u2019s advance. \u201cWhat message?\u201d</p><p>It stopped by my foot. \u201cGet up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope is the light you follow; faith is believing there is actually a light\u2014they are the refusal to give up when you have no reason to go on. Get up!\u201d it hissed again. \u201cWalk, Run, but do not lay there to die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I walked!\u201d I yelled at the slithering guru. \u201cI walked, and I never got anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you keep walking until you do!\u201d</p><p>I looked away, allowing defeat to swallow the fight in my voice. \u201cNo. I can't take the pain of believing in myself and failing, over and over again. Losing hope is worse than the actual failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen walk, because there is no reason to believe you will ever get out, no reason to live, no reason to go on except that you must. You are stronger than you know. Now, get up!\u201d It slithered closer; I tucked my ankle under my thigh. \u201cGet up, and go on, or die.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d I cried out. \u201cHow much longer do I have to endure this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you have fought with your last breath, walked every path which leads to nowhere and cried every worthless, faithless tear at the bottomless pits of Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I wiped my eyes. \u201cWhy do you have to be so cruel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cruelty, it\u2019s a lesson.

I know it\u2019s in me, but what is it?</p> <p>\u201cClose,\u201d the snake whispered.</p><p>\u201cHope is a part of faith,\u201d I started, going over the words in my head. \u201cI came out here to find hope and bring it home to them. I came here to find...\u201d I looked up, realisation flooding me like a wash of cold water. \u201cMyself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I found her\u2014she was making the oath.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not you. She is a repeat manifestation of the lies that make you whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth. Truth must be uncovered before you can find what you are looking for\u2014before you can find yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she hissed, \u201cis exactly the right question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr!\u201d I screeched and backed away as the snake launched forward. \u201cGet away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d It slithered toward my foot, shifting in weaving patterns across the dirt. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know any truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessss, you doo.\u201d It lifted its head off the ground and rocked from side to side, as if it had shoulders to sway from.</p><p>\u201cI don't know what the lie is...so I can't tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are lying to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know myself. I know my inner truths. I always follow my...\u201d I paused. My heart. \u201cMy heart is the lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps what\u2019s in your heart.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the snake and felt the tight pull of my brow at the centre. \u201cI already told you; David's in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs he there alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me truthfully, girl. Is. He. There. Alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I looked down at my dirt-covered legs. \u201cI don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Ask your heart, and do not deny the first answer it gives you.\u201d</p><p>I touched a hand to my chest and searched deeper inside myself, already knowing the true answer. \u201cI'm not capable of loving just one...am I?\u201d I looked back at the snake.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI know I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't lie to yourself, Amara. You cannot find hope if you cannot see the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That is the truth!\u201d I shuffled away from the snake. \u201cI love David. Do you hear? Never anyone else. I get confused. But I love him! Only him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies. Black heart\u2014black as the night. You, demon child\u2014\u201d It slithered, slowly edging closer, \u201c\u2014You are nothing more than what I am; a sinister nonentity, a parasitical fiend, and you will perish in this Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I pointed to the snake. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to trick me into admitting I'm something I'm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrickster. Faker. Liar. Me? No.\u201d It shook its head. \u201cYou are the worst kind of fraud, little girl, because you lie to yourself.\u201d It glided toward me again. \u201cYou don't have to like the truth, but in order to be free, you must admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I covered my ears, scuffling away. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't need to, child. You admitted this already. Admit it now. Admit it once and for all, and you will be free!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn girl,\u201d It said, forcing me to shift farther away with each inch it came closer. \u201cIt was all you had to do.\u201d</p><p>My hand slipped on a sharp, rocky overhang, and the flaking sound of raining dirt and stones echoed off the gluttonous canyon behind me, narrowing my options; it was either into the path of the snake, or a fall, possibly to my death.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d my voice quivered as the snake advanced, slinking toward my right foot.</p><p>\u201cTaking you back to Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d I smashed my foot into its tail, but the grappling, tubular body wriggled up my leg, and my scream trailed off as my hands met the absence of the rocky edge, reaching up, grabbing the cold neck of the snake as I went over, free-falling toward nothing.</p><p>And it was too late to say it\u2014too late to admit what I truly felt in my heart. But I saw him as I looked out over the endless valley\u2014saw Jason, saw his smile, felt my heart fill with blood for the longing to be beside him.</p><p>And that was the truth. I loved him, but I also loved David.</p><p>The quiet emptiness of falling into nothing stole a scream from my lips, but returned it as a silent breath, and my fingers unfolded, releasing the snake into freedom as the ground rushed up faster than I could control.</p><p>Hope, by definition, means, wish, desire\u2014a chance of success. Nowhere does it say faith.</p><p>They had hope, but they never believed in me\u2014never had faith. They wanted someone to walk them from the darkest nights of their everlasting pain and bring them to the dawn, but they needed a warrior, not a little girl who was so broken from the past she couldn't even love just one man.</p><p>The dawn came and went many times while I stumbled through this treacherous forest, and as I opened my tired eyes, my entire body burning and aching, I met the dawn again.</p><p>The last dregs of hope faded.</p><p>I had believed in myself; I had believed I\u2019d make it out\u2014that I\u2019d be the queen they needed. But they just couldn\u2019t see that. No one ever had any faith in me, and this was my only chance to prove I was strong\u2014to prove I could do anything I wanted to\u2014if I wanted to do it. And I did want to. I never wanted to be queen before, but I cared about those people\u2014all of them, and I wanted them to be free, to live in peace. If I was the only one that could make it happen, then I would have done my best.</p><p>But the belief I had in myself was merely the na\u00efve ideals of a child who read too many fairy-tales when she was young. I couldn\u2019t do it. I didn't make it. And they knew I wouldn't.</p><p>I reached my arm out, keeping my eyes shut, and closed my fist softly around the dewy grass, while the distant lashing of a wild ocean forced a painful smile onto my lips. I\u2019d not heard the ocean for days. I never went to see that lighthouse\u2014never got to sit on the roof and watch the day wear on. Never even had the chance to tell Arthur that David was alive. I would. If I could go back, I\u2019d tell him, so that maybe his heart could be free. And Mike, I\u2019d tell him how sorry I was for breaking his heart, and even admit that he was always right\u2014that I needed to listen to him more often.</p><p>As I rubbed one foot over the other to scratch off an irritating bug, I frowned at the feel of fabric, like rustling silk mixed with cotton, but weighty\u2014stacked on top of me.</p><p>I rolled up on my elbows and looked down. A black dress, fitted to the waist, sprawled out around me like a pool of black blood, and all along my arms, the Markings gleamed against my perfect white skin.</p><p>As golden sunlight shifted across the long grass, following some imaginary path of duty, I saw a tree\u2014at the centre of a field. Jason\u2019s field.</p><p>I must have died\u2014or knocked myself unconscious.</p><p>Leaning on one elbow, I reached across my body and pinched my own arm\u2014and it hurt.</p><p>I looked up at the tree again. This world was too real to be Jason\u2019s\u2014the undertone of fogginess it came with wasn't looming. This was bright. Fresh. Flavoured like a summer morning.</p><p>I shot to my feet and watched the dawn sun travel over my toes and ankles, up the fabric of my dress, making it orange, and finally, over my hands\u2014brightening the ancient symbols\u2014my promise in ink. But it slipped past me quickly, heading for the border of the forest.</p><p>Dawn.</p><p>I had to run. I had to make it through to the other side\u2014to the manor, the Throne Room\u2014to my people. It wasn\u2019t too late. But if the light touched that tree line, I\u2019d never make it out of that forest.</p><p>I hitched my dress up and ran, racing the rise of the sun. And as I came upon the forest, stepped a little more cautiously, holding my hands up as if to ward off something evil. \u201cI command you not to trap me in here for eternity,\u201d I said to it, and my fingertips became warm. I walked carefully through the trees; they huddled together like frightened children, and as I lifted my dress above my feet, noticed that my toes, my nails, my ankles, everything was clean\u2014polished, as if I\u2019d never left.</p><p>And maybe that was right. Maybe I never left. Maybe I never really went anywhere at all, because everything I needed to find was already in me.</p><p>A breath of composure filled my lungs and cooled my soul as I slowed to a walk, making my heart settle its erratic beat. I closed my eyes, wearing a soft smile, breaking free of the forest just as the orange sun touched the canopy.</p><p>Each step I took over the grass felt like walking on clouds; my powers were back, I could feel them. I could feel myself almost floating, as if gravity had forgotten me.</p><p>I watched, waiting for someone in the faceless crowd to notice I was here, and as the sun came past the trees, sinking down the canopy and out through the trunks, everyone turned their heads, one by one\u2014shock drinking their eyes, moving to their lips in a smile.</p><p>I finally reached the top of the small hill, and each subject, barely able to contain the applause, laid a path of white roses at my feet. I walked right over them, feeling them break beneath me, but the thorns did not cut; my feet had grown stronger\u2014torn down to be built back up. Nothing would ever break me again. I had proven my worth. I made it.</p><p>Arthur\u2019s face showed among the blur, and he bowed to me, receiving the warmest smile I owned. In his heart, I could almost hear him say I never doubted you. And I appreciated that. Because I knew he was the only one who never did.</p><p>As I walked through the doors of the Throne Room, Lilith\u2019s marble columns seemed to greet me, and, for some reason, I didn't mind that they were fake\u2014not structural, because it was what people saw that really counted. They saw a Throne Room, they saw a princess walk the red carpet, and in that, they saw a future. It didn't matter what foundations the lie had been built on, as long as it stayed solid. As long as it was real to them.</p><p>The white roses stopped below the first step to my throne, but as I made it to the top, saw one red rose on the seat; I reached out and grabbed it, looking up quickly when I felt its thornless stem. And as I turned back to face my people, searched the crowd for David, knowing he was out there\u2014somewhere.</p><p>A man in a long burgundy cloak stepped up beside me, and as he placed a small, uninteresting gold circle atop my head, an intensely warm surge of blood heated my skin under the inscription of my promise\u2014igniting the dense black to a brilliant, glowing blue, as if a tiny light shone from behind each word. My blood pulsed and shifted under the burn, but I smiled, clenching my fists, focusing on the cold rose in my hand.</p><p>My David. He\u2019s here\u2014watching. He\u2019s actually here.</p><p>The fire receded and a unified gasp filled the court as the Markings discoloured\u2014fading into my skin.</p><p>The oath was complete. My promise, eternal.</p><p>I started this journey as a young girl, and now, stood before my people as something so much more.</p><p>This is the path.</p><p>This is the question.</p><p>I am the answer.</p><p>I am faith.</p><p>I am hope.</p><p>I am Queen.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>As instructed by the old cronies who really run the show around here, for the entire three hours of my very first Court session, I nodded, smiled, glanced at Walter Moustache Man for an answer and ruled everything according to his and the Councils\u2019 wishes. In future, I\u2019d probably look to Mike or Falcon, but since they and my other three knights were off completing their sacrificial rights, you know, kneeling in prayer and all that, I only had Emily, Eric, Morg and the House. And Arthur, but he\u2019d nodded only once in opinion and it was on something very minor. I knew he felt it wasn\u2019t his place to say, and that was true, he had no real business giving me advice unless he was on my council, but I trusted his opinion.</p><p>I sat back in my chair, listening to the last dregs of this Lilithian\u2019s complaint, trying not to look utterly exhausted. But the Walk of Faith was still thick in my bones and my emotions, and, a few times, I\u2019d even had to resist the urge to break down and cry. I felt dirty\u2014like I was still covered in blood and muck from the forest floor, but each time I looked down at my hands, was surprised to see perfectly trimmed, perfectly clean nails. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But things were winding down. From what I could tell, we had about two or three cases left to deal with\u2014then I could rest for a few hours before the ball.</p><p>When the Lilithian stepped back into the crowd, Walter stood up from his House table to my left and wandered forward, flipping pages in his notepad. \u201cYour Majesty, Queen Amara, I present Derek Hill, of the Lower House.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Derek, who bowed, smiling back as he stood; he had an eager kind of grin\u2014small eyes, bright with intelligence and what I read as a lust for life\u2014proverbially\u2014not the kind he usually lusted after, being that he was a vampire. My stomach growled.</p> <p>\u201cYour Majesty, first of all, congratulations on this special day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Derek.\u201d I gave a soft nod. \u201cAnd, what can I do for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here to address the new laws of Vampire Sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are thrilled with the recent decision that those under your rule are free from their Set, but were unclear on a few of the restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, what did you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral of my people wish to partake in career paths which may lead to one being widely noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike famous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Morgaine. She did warn me that simply allowing vampires to be under my rule without issuing guidelines would be a bad idea. But I never thought of anything like fame. I guess I just assumed free meant free.</p><p>\u201cDeclined,\u201d Walter said, without even looking up.</p> <p>\u201cNow, hang on a sec.\u201d I stood up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen Amara, you know the reasons we have the laws we do. Even when Lilith ruled, this restriction applied to Lilithians also, not just vampires. We must not be a spectacle in the public eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because we don't age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and people may study us too closely, come to conclusions about what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalter, were you not in the Queen\u2019s Navy\u2014when Lilith ruled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were well-known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it differs greatly to one seeking world fame in modern society.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Okay, so...\u201d I looked back at Derek. \u201cWhat kinds of careers are we talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two bands and an aspiring actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenied,\u201d Walter said, without giving the man any further chance to speak.</p><p>\u201cStop saying that.\u201d I stomped my foot.</p><p>\u201cMy queen, not only is it unsafe, as it may expose us to the human world, but we have skills and experience far beyond that of a human,\u201d Walter reasoned. \u201cWhat right do we have to take rolls they could otherwise occupy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy giving music to the world?\u201d My brow arched. \u201cWalter, what right do we have to keep music from anybody, just because we may be better than someone else? Music\u2014any area of creativity and self-expression should belong to everyone\u2014vampires, humans, Lilithians\u2014whoever. It\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about in twenty years when this famous person has not aged?\u201d Margret said.</p><p>\u201cWith the advances in medical science now, no one would really notice,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that's not the point, Your Majesty. We stick to tradition.\u201d Walter sat down.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't like it.\u201d I sat down, too. \u201cWhat does everyone else here think?\u201d</p><p>The crowd looked among themselves, shrugging, their eyes a little wide.</p><p>\u201cSomeone speak up,\u201d I said. \u201cShould vampires and Lilithians be allowed to follow careers of passion, which would lead to fame?\u201d</p><p>A hand shot up in the back of the room. \u201cI think so, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d another said, and it seemed to be unified. Mainly only really ancient vampires or Lilithians disapproved.</p><p>I looked at Arthur, who didn't seem to have an opinion either way. I wished he did, because I\u2019d have ruled based on what he thought. I even gave a little nod, with wider eyes, prompting his guidance, but he just smiled apologetically.</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds of music?\u201d I finally looked back at Derek.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at a group of young guys, who nodded eagerly at him. \u201cAlternative and rock.\u201d</p><p>And I was sold.</p><p>To my right, Eric sat beside Emily, grinning widely at the vampires behind Derek. I wondered if they were in his band or if maybe he just knew them.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to write original songs?\u201d I looked directly at the bands.</p><p>When ushered forward, one guy stepped up and bowed quickly. \u201cWe already have, Majesty\u2014we\u2019ve been writing for about twenty years. But we\u2019ve just been working the cover scene, you know, since we aren\u2019t allowed to get noticed.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. I wanted to say yes, I really did, but Walter and the rest of the House would surely skin me if I did. Except, it wasn\u2019t fair; none of the Ancients played music\u2014not one from the House could even play piano. They just didn't have the passion, didn't understand the burn it caused inside you\u2014what it took to write a song and want to share that with the world. And if someone told me I could never live that dream, just because I was bitten and turned into a vampire, I think I\u2019d shut myself in a coffin for the rest of eternity\u2014because that's what it would feel like anyway.</p><p>Eric gave me a reassuring smile, and the excitement in his eyes set the words to my mouth before I saw them shape in my brain. \u201cGranted,\u201d I said.</p><p>Walter stood, a few people gasped, but it was buried under the loud rejoicing of the major population.</p><p>Derek bowed lowly and said, \u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're welcome.\u201d I turned my head to catch Eric\u2019s eye for a second. \u201cBut you all know how to keep yourselves in check. Don't make what you are obvious and don't do anything stupid, or I will revoke your rights. Got it?\u201d</p><p>The boys in the bands all nodded, bowing then nodding again.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Next on the list, Walter?\u201d</p><p>He was pissed, I could tell. But it was kind of okay, and this queen duties thing was actually pretty fun\u2014well, most of it.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I present case number\u2014\u201d he looked at his notepad, \u201c\u2014sixty five; Mr. Hamilton and Miss Crane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d I nodded to them; they both bowed nervously.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d The man knelt before me, his hand on his heart. \u201cI am in love with this girl, and I wish to marry her. But her sister, a twin, was recently granted rights to become a vampire, by the former king. Only...\u201d He looked back at the girl. \u201cShe didn't have the gene.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, remembering the day I discovered that same fact about myself; the girl held back tears, standing tall and strong.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you like to do about that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, Majesty, we seek the right to live together\u2014to...to be together while she remain human.\u201d</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou understand there are reasons this has not been allowed in the past\u2014unless under very special circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Your Majesty.\u201d He bowed lower, tension resting on his shoulders like a heavy load. \u201cBut I...I love her, and I can't risk losing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought of, perhaps, changing her into a Lilithian?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me. \u201cNo, Your Majesty, I hadn\u2019t. I didn't know that was a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed around here,\u201d I said and stood up, taking a few steps to stand before the man. \u201cTo your feet.\u201d</p><p>He slowly got up, arching his back to keep his head lower than mine. How terribly old fashioned. But I understood, thanks to all my lectures from the Officials, that this was how it had to be, silly or not.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, as her bite can put you in a coma\u2014\u201d I smiled over my shoulder at my Private Council, wishing we could spread word about immunity. \u201cBut, knowing this, would you want that life for her? She will be forced to feed through a slit in a willing vampire\u2019s vein\u2014she can never bite,\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked up at me, his eyes bright with a smile. \u201cYes, my queen, that would be fine\u2014for the sake of eternity together, I would do anything\u2014even feed her myself.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, the girl\u2019s eyes glittered with hope. I didn't even need to ask if she wanted this or not.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I approve.\u201d I looked over at Morgaine, half noticing the man step back and take his girlfriend\u2019s hand. \u201cMorg, can you see this happens for them, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d She bowed her head. \u201cI\u2019ll turn her myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d I said. \u201cThen it is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Queen Amara.\u201d His voice almost broke. \u201cI am your eternal servant.\u201d</p><p>I kind of laughed. \u201cNo need for that. But, if ever you feel the need to extend your family, please do consider adopting one of the Immortal Damned. We\u2019re hoping to have them ready for society within a few months, and we\u2019re looking, pre-emptively, for families to care for them.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s grey eyes became wider and he shook his head, bowing at the same time. \u201cOf course, Your Majesty. We...we\u2019d be only too happy to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I smiled out across the crowded room, finally happy to be queen.</p><p>Given that the knighting ceremony was supposed to be next week, I\u2019d brushed off the \u2018Rising of the Knights\u2019 speech, figuring I\u2019d learn it after the coronation. I stood behind the curtain of my throne, Court finished for the day, knees shaking, knowing I would make a fool of myself when I walked out there in front of five hundred people, words lost in the back of my throat, and let out only a small squeak. They say preparation is confidence, but I was so not prepared.</p><p>When Walter announced me, I thrust my shoulders back, tilted my chin to the sky and stepped out from the curtain. Every breath, with every step I took, sounded like it was exhaled right into a microphone. I could hear everything around me; the heartbeats of my people, the silent worry of my council, the throat clearing of the old vampires, and the foot tapping of eager subjects in the back row.</p><p>I stopped with my toes just on the edge of the top step, and my eyes washed across the crowd\u2014tightly packed into the court, lining the walls, leaving one clear isle of red carpet where the knights would walk in a few moments. And a proverbial furry cat climbed into my throat and ate my tongue.</p><p>After a tense pause, I inhaled a deep, shaky breath of nerves and held it, closing my eyes. The words of my speech rolled across my eyelids, and my mind flashed to the memory of the day Mike delivered this same speech to the knights\u2014when they were still human. He stood so tall in front of the hundreds, as if they were a small group of friends\u2014confident, comfortable in his own skin. \u201cFor generations,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cthe Lilithian knights have survived in secrecy; trained by night, kept underground, unknown to exist. We have been few and ineffective. Now, with the rising of a new queen, we too have clambered from the ashes of insignificance. We will become strong, impenetrable\u2014a force to be reckoned with.\u201d</p><p>And listening in my head to his words, my own part of the speech came to mind. \u201cThe legend of the knights began with the first Created Lilithian,\u201d I started, my voice clear, unwavering. \u201cQueen Lilith, whose source of nourishment saw the deaths of many vampires, discovered that her brother sought to imprison her and take the throne. Knowing the creation of vampires to be possible from a bite, she attempted the same on a human man named Lancelot.</p><p>\u201cThe transformation turned this meagre mortal into a powerful being, giving him the ability, like Lilith, to end the life of a vampire. An army was created, and after pledging their creed upon the Stone of Truth, the Guardians of the Pure became known to all as,\u201d \u2014pause for effect\u2014 \u201cLilithian Knights.\u201d</p><p>The crowd cheered; the energy in the room had a different feel now\u2014almost like the last day of school before summer break.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d I continued over the noise. \u201cRising from the ashes of a long forgotten tradition, is a new era of guardians. Five men will be sworn in; five men have taken their oath. On their honour, on their blood, they will serve with their lives\u2014protect queen and country\u2014Lilithians, Vampires and Humans\u2014united.\u201d</p><p>The roar of elation spread further this time; those at the back of the room wildly applauding; their thunderous calls infecting the hundreds outside who came today\u2014all of them to see the new Lilithian revolution begin.</p><p>I moved away from the lip of the step and sat in my throne, quite satisfied that, even with an exhausted brain and shaking knees, I still managed to remember the whole speech.</p><p>A gentle, quiet calm blew in like a breeze, and the Court came to a standstill. In one, sweeping movement, all heads turned to the back of the room\u2014watching, waiting.</p><p>Walter banged a giant brass stick three times, and the glass doors parted. My eyes adjusted to the warm yellow glow of the afternoon that entered, making silhouettes of five figures. As they marched forward, the anticipation beating in my heart made my blood run warm, and the silhouettes sharpened into men before my eyes. My knights. They looked like nineteenth-century officers of the Queen\u2019s Navy, in uniforms of white\u2014with long, double breasted jackets and ropes hanging across their chests, which I knew were special kinds of rope\u2014earned by doing some act.</p><p>\u201cLove the new get up, Em,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I could hear the smile in her voice. \u201cWait \u2018til you see Mike.\u201d</p><p>The five men turned to one as they filed into a line and marched down the centre of the aisle. Blade came first; his head held high, his face straight\u2014for once\u2014one arm by his side and the other resting over the hilt of his sword. I just wanted to leap out of my seat and jump around, telling them all how great they looked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Blade moved to one side, Quaid, Ryder and Falcon came up the step, forming a straight line in front of the throne. Then, Mike came into view. My heart skipped audibly in my chest and melted all over the floor. Time slowed down, making everything spin as he took the last step toward me. He looked so...debonair, so strong, so\u2014knightly. His sandy hair was brushed back, revealing most of his face\u2014the scruffy, half-shaven look he usually sports was gone, giving way to the smooth, square shape of his jaw. He looked right at me, a bright smile lighting up the spirit behind those caramel eyes, but absent on his lips.</p><p>As I walked toward them, each knight dropped to one knee, his head lowered.</p><p>I\u2019d been given a few options on the knighting ceremony, told that, traditionally, the knights were slapped hard with a glove or a hand to make them remember their oath. But I didn't like the idea of that, or the whole tapping the shoulder with a sword thing. We opted for a different method. Although, if Blade continued to look up and grin, I might consider slapping him.</p> <p>\u201cYou have sworn your promise in blood.\u201d I spoke loud so the whole Court would hear. \u201cYou are bound to the throne for eternity, to serve with your honour.\u201d I touched Mike. \u201cYour strength.\u201d I touched Falcon. \u201cYour blood, your soul.\u201d I touched Ryder and Quaid. \u201cAnd with your heart.\u201d I touched Blade, and he smiled up at me. That slap tingled in my fingertips. He looked down instantly when I scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cFor eternity, you will serve your queen and your people with these gifts you possess. Today, you kneel before me as men.\u201d I touched Mike on the shoulder again. \u201cBut arise as knights. Sir Michael Christopher White.\u201d Mike stood as I moved on to Falcon, kinda nervous about coming into physical contact with him. My hand shook a little as I rested it to his shoulder again. \u201cSir Brett Wesley Falcon.\u201d He stood too, and I touched Ryder\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSir Zeidyn Gable Ryder. Sir Shamus Arian Quaid, and\u2014\u201d My hand warmed as it fell on Blade and the sudden jump to his heart made me smile. \u201cSir Thomas James Blade.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, eyes wide, lips parted into a half smile.</p><p>\u201cNew life, new surname,\u201d I whispered, but most of the court, being vampires, would have heard it anyway.</p><p>Blade rose to his feet as the others had done, and they all turned on their heels to face the crowd; their hands behind their backs, chins high. I straightened my spine to feel taller beside them.</p> <p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the Court, I present to you\u2014\u201d I held my hand out. \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Guard.\u201d</p><p>As the joyous applause unified the court with warmth again, they took off on their right foot and marched down the red carpet. I sat back down in my chair\u2014throne\u2014whatever they want to call it\u2014it was a giant, overgrown cushion as far as I was concerned\u2014and slumped lazily on the arm. But the knights broke apart suddenly and a few gasps came from the back of the room as the doors burst open again.</p><p>\u201cYour majesty,\u201d Orion called, appearing from within the crowd, hauling a man by the arm. \u201cWe have a messenger.\u201d</p><p>He thrust the man forward, who fell to his knees, then stood up, straightening his clothes. \u201cHow dare you treat me in such a manner.\u201d</p><p>I walked over and stood on the edge of the step above him. \u201cYou say you have a message.\u201d</p><p>He dusted himself off again, melodramatically, and glared at Orion. \u201cI do. It is from his majesty, King Drake.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cThere is no Blood King,\u201d Walter said. \u201cOnly a queen.\u201d</p><p>The uniformed man scoffed. \u201cI know of no queen. Now, read the message. I must be on my way.\u201d</p><p>Walter took an envelope from the man. \u201cWould you like to read it, Majesty, or shall I do the honours?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed my knights stayed in the room until Mike stepped up from behind me and held his hand out. \u201cI\u2019ll read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Walter passed him the letter.</p><p>He cleared his throat, holding it up. \u201cDearest Niece, it saddens me that we have come to war after centuries of peace. If you turn yourself over and hand back the manor and the throne, I will be merciful.\u201d His voice slowed a little; he looked at the crowd then continued reading; \u201cYour death will be quick, as will that of your people. You have until sunset, a month from today, to turn yourself over, or I will attack and forcefully take back what is rightfully mine. Sincerely, Uncle Drake.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed, even me.</p> <p>Mike refolded the letter and looked down at the messenger. \u201cTell your king he will have word in a fortnight.\u201d</p><p>The messenger nodded and spun on his heel, then walked down the aisle, with Orion behind him. I looked around for Arthur then, to see what he thought, but he was gone.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d Walter said. \u201cI announce this session of Court closed.\u201d He banged his stick three times and the crowd turned away, quiet chatters of both joy and fear among them.</p><p>I spun around to look at my knights. \u201cIs he serious? Drake?\u201d</p><p>Walter came up and took the note from Mike then laid it out on the House table so the others could paw over it. We watched for a second.</p><p>\u201cSounded pretty serious,\u201d Eric said, popping up beside me.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded like an unreasonable demand,\u201d Mike said, wrapping his arm over Emily as she came up and hugged him. \u201cI think it\u2019s a distraction from the truth. He wants something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThink about it.\u201d Mike moved away from Em so he could pace. Walter and the others looked up with interest. \u201cHe knows his opponent. He knows you won\u2019t accept those terms. You might sacrifice yourself, but never your people.\u201d</p><p>I smiled; it was nice that Mike, for all his opinions on me, actually knew that one truth.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cHe\u2019s up to something. He wants us focusing on an attack\u2014it\u2019s a trick of the hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI concur,\u201d Walter said, turning back to us, with the letter in hand. \u201cQuestion is, what doesn't he want us focusing on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Blade said, rubbing his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWell, clearly he knows you\u2019ve been crowned now, and clearly knows you're alive,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cMaybe he knows we plan to attack him. Maybe he\u2019s, by giving us a month, buying himself more time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s too simple.\u201d Mike waved his index finger like a drumstick. \u201cHe wouldn't send a demand to buy time. He\u2019d ask for a truce\u2014knowing Ara would accept\u2014then he\u2019d just attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s waiting for a reply in a fortnight, right?\u201d Quaid said. \u201cI say we continue with our plan to attack next week\u2014take him by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We have to cancel the attack,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s probably aware of our plans,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cHe would know about the crowning process, the powers it will give you. I bet he\u2019s expecting us to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cSo...we don't attack?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Everyone looked at everyone else.</p><p>\u201cWe could wait,\u201d Morgaine suggested. \u201cWe could send out spies to investigate Elysium and see what he\u2019s got going out there\u2014see what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can let him attack us here, and we\u2019ll just wipe him out,\u201d Blade suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fighting fire with a garden hose, Blade,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThere will be no attack here; we have families living on this land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and the queen,\u201d Falcon added.</p><p>Mike looked at him. \u201cThat goes without saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, we\u2019ll send knights in to investigate?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat would also be a bad idea,\u201d Arthur said from the base of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThis is not your concern, vampire.\u201d Mike spun around to face him. \u201cIt is House and Private Council business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen speak in private quarters,\u201d Arthur said and stepped away.</p><p>\u201cWait, Arthur?\u201d I ran down the steps and grabbed his sleeve. \u201cWhy? Why would it be a bad idea?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Mike, then back at me again. \"Because, my queen, he may be all too aware of immunity, for examp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Morgaine gasped. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmunity?\u201d Walter walked closer. \u201cWhat immunity?\u201d</p><p>Arthur took my hands, ignoring the rest, who went on with a conversation behind us. \u201cMy dear, he may be looking to get his hands on a Pure Created. A mere Created Lilithian would not protect his army against your swords. He is a master of strategy. Everything he does has been planned out to make you think you have looked past the first two options and are clever enough to guess his real motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cSo, we won't send Pure Created knights in there.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at the bunch of old and new immortals arguing and waving their hands around as the House learned about immunity for the first time. \u201cI am sorry I had to bring that up, but it is no longer a card you hold.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou let something slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes darkened. \u201cI only wish you had known of this before my sons died.\u201d</p><p>I touched his shoulder, feeling Mike\u2019s vehement glare on the side of my face. \u201cI'm sorry, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He bowed and turned away. I watched his back until he disappeared into the crowds outside in the afternoon sun.</p><p>\u201cYou told him about immunity?\u201d Mike grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cI...he said I let something slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, this is exactly what I was afraid of.\u201d He shoved me away softly and rubbed his brow. \u201cNow Drake probably knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But I don't think Arthur would have told him, or he wouldn't have just admitted that he knew about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr would he? To make us think he wouldn\u2019t have told Drake, since he'd be the first we'd suspect anyway.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, exasperated. \u201cLook, Mike, I'm tired. I just wanna go have a shower and get some rest before the ball tonight. Can we please discuss all this in the meeting tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He backed down, smiling softly at me\u2014the old, loving Mike. \u201cI haven\u2019t even had a chance to tell you how proud I am of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mike,\u201d I said in a squeezed breath as he hugged me tight. \u201cAnd, by the way, you look sooo hot in that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, leaning back a little to look down at me. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the tattoo hurt?\u201d I touched his upper arm.</p><p>\u201cNope. Yours?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, and as soon as I felt the air between us from the distance of his body, Emily came flying in, practically squealing with excitement. \u201cAra. You look so pretty, and I was crying so hard when you finally came out of that forest. I literally paced the floors all night, worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>I patted her back, breathing deep the smell of her apple shampoo. \u201cI'm okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is it haunted?\u201d she asked, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cThe forest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I looked back into the memory for a second. \u201cI think it probably is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d She cupped her hands under her chin. \u201cYou poor thing. Were you scared?\u201d</p><p>Mike took this opportunity of girl talk to slink back to the manly political discussion going on at the top of the stairs. I looked back at Emily. \u201cI was okay. Um, Em, I\u2019ll talk later, okay. I really need some sleep before tonight.\u201d And probably a good cry.</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll talk at the ball then.\u201d She touched my arm softly then walked away.</p><p>Flowing hot water soothed my skin only minutes ago, but the silence of my own thoughts\u2014where I spent most of last night\u2014was all too much for me to bear as I laid on my bed in the coloured light streaming through the dome. Though I was clean and fed, and the dry, pulsing sting of blood-thirst had eased, I felt empty and cold.</p><p>After the Walk of Terror, I should be grateful for simple comforts, but I couldn't stop thinking about the things I faced in that forest long enough to even enjoy the absence of gravity again. So, I got up and went down to the beach.</p><p>My heels sunk deep into the white sand, making it squeak each time I turned to pace back the other way. I didn't want to cry; I wanted to be strong\u2014to move on from all the horrors of last night and just be a resilient, powerful queen. But seeing Jason in that forest made him feel so real, and the place I used to go inside my head to hate him was gone. That walk had changed things in me, that was for sure, but I wasn't sure if what had changed was for the better. All the grief I never wanted to feel for losing Jason came to the surface, down here, by the giant cliffs, safe from judging eyes. And it scared me, because I\u2019d never grieved so deeply for anything. Never.</p><p>I leaned my back against the ancient rock wall and covered my face, finally letting myself cry\u2014let the tears fall down, uninvited, unwanted, worthless, because they were shed for a pain that would never heal. And I just couldn't make it stop. Too much was hurting inside. I\u2019d been dragged through too much and it was all finally coming down on top of me.</p><p>You should be ashamed, the other version of me said, appearing beside me.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d I hid my face in my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not real. Go away.\u201d</p><p>She just laughed. You pathetic waste of life. How dare you? How dare you cry for him? How could you let yourself fall in love with a ghost\u2014one who mutilated and tortured you\u2014burned his own brother alive? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d I yelled into my hands. \u201cStop it. I can't let myself believe I loved him!\u201d</p><p>Oh, you loved him. You did, and you know it.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I stopped the thought abruptly, but it crept back in to betray me with its truth.</p> <p>What is it that hurts, Ara? She asked from deep inside my nightmare. Is it that he\u2019s gone, or that you\u2019re psychotic and perverted for loving him?</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I said, finally defeated enough to admit it in this real world\u2014away from the pressure of snakes or falling from cliffs.</p><p>This will kill him, you know, this will kill David when he finds out.</p><p>\u201cNo! Stop it, please. I've done nothing wrong!\u201d I shouted. \u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>Nothing?</p> <p>A wild summer wind swept over the sand and brushed it stiffly across my legs; I composed myself with a few jagged breaths, wiping my soaking face. I was exhausted. That\u2019s what this was really about. Even my soul was tired. I just needed rest. If I could just go to sleep, I\u2019d wake up and see that everything really was okay\u2014that maybe it was true, maybe I did love Jason, but maybe it didn't matter, because he was gone, and I still had David.</p><p>The shadow of the lighthouse, sitting high atop the cliff, stole the white from the sand as it stretched across the beach in a grey shadow. Behind it, the sun blinded me when I tried to make out the distance from here to the top. I wanted to jump up there but, exhausted as I felt, I\u2019d probably slip and fall off. So, I wandered away from the windbreak of the cliff and let the ocean breeze wrap around me, bringing the soft scent of frangipani fabric softener and salty sea spray. And with that smell, a tiny little positive crept up to make me smile; at least I never have to do dishes or laundry, ever again. That\u2019s pretty cool.</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d The confused tone of a pleasantly deep voice made my shoulders sink as a hand came upon me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Arthur.\u201d I glanced back and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMy lady?\u201d He stopped beside me. \u201cWhat are you doing out here by yourself? You should be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded and folded my arms across my chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like being alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Arthur looked around. \u201cYou are alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like I am when I'm inside.\u201d I turned to the thrashing waves and flicked my head so my hair blew away from my neck. \u201cOut here, I have the wind and the open air to distract me\u2014it kind of makes my heart beat for me, you know, but when I'm alone, in the still, it\u2019s like I'm too warm, wrapped up in a blanket I can't get out of.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s brows pinched in the middle, and my eyes, as I looked at him, watered from the blinding light of the high afternoon sun. \u201cYou're not all right, are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>He let out a breath and wrapped one arm, then the other, over my shoulders, and tugged me until I fell into his chest, my cheek against the indent between his breastbones. \u201cJust cry. My darling girl. Let it all out.\u201d He stroked my hair. \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019ll make it all better.\u201d</p><p>My chest heaved, each breath a jagged shriek that coughed back out. Arthur\u2019s embrace was so firm that I no longer felt the wind, so tight that my lungs struggled to draw air, and so loving I almost felt like his girl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long few years, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said in a low, soothing voice. \u201cYou've been through so much for such a young girl, and I imagine you've probably not spoken of how deeply you're hurting?\u201d</p><p>My chest shuddered, the sobs turning to short, quick breaths as I settled myself. When I pulled slightly away from Arthur and saw the wet outline of a face all over his white silk shirt, my cheeks burned. \u201cOh, my God, Arthur, I'm sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down too, wiping his hand over my mess. \u201cI wear the tears of the queen with honour.\u201d</p><p>I laughed once. \u201cIt sounds funny when you say queen.\u201d</p><p>His teeth showed on one side as he breathed a smile. \u201cYes, but you are queen. And we are all so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I failed, you know.\u201d I stepped away from his arms and let the wind dry my cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how scared I was that I\u2019d let everyone down.\u201d</p><p>He only nodded, as if waiting for me to speak. Then, like falling asleep with a heavy book on your chest and suddenly waking to lift it off, I sat in the sand with Arthur, by the lashing whitewash, and, leaving out the part about David being alive, told him everything. Everything. Told him all I saw on the Walk of Faith, everything I came to face\u2014all the failures, all the truths\u2014especially the truth about Jason. And he listened, with his hands linked together, his arms falling loosely over bended knees, smiling, nodding every now and then.</p><p>As the blanket of shame, fear and sadness blew away in the wind, I took a deep, shaky breath and turned my head to look at him for the first time since we sat down. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d I grabbed his arm and looked at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have nowhere near been talking long enough.\u201d He touched his hand over mine.</p><p>I sniffled. \u201cYou're a good friend, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, his chest lifting with a deep breath that he let out slowly. \u201cI'm glad you told me all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it all means\u2014all that snake business?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI'm not sure. But, like you said, this snake, this entity who came to you, it wanted you to realise the truth of yourself, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, more than a little eager to hear his take on it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, that is the truth. Perhaps you loved them both\u2014Jason and David, and maybe when you come to terms with this, your life can take a journey on a new path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have come to terms with it, Arthur. So where\u2019s this new path?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, you have not. You have admitted it\u2014barely, but you have not come to terms with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren't they the same things?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how do I come to terms with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my dear child, you will have to learn on your own. One day, you will wake up and everything will suddenly make sense to you\u2014the path you must take, the road you\u2019ve been down, all the questions you ask yourself about why\u2014it will all make sense, and then, and only then, does it mean you have come to terms with what is in your heart, and essentially, what you, deep down inside, are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I am? What do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>He looked out at the ocean. \u201cI mean that...you perceive yourself as this confused little girl, who thinks she knows what's right but doesn\u2019t trust herself. You also believe every impure thought you have\u2014perhaps thoughts for another man\u2014make you a bad person, somehow. But you\u2019re not. You are, for all intents and purposes, human. And you make human mistakes and feel human emotions. You berate yourself far too harshly for what you feel, Amara, and that will, in the end, be your undoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy undoing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmotionally. You cannot rule if you are not strong, in here.\u201d He tapped his chest. \u201cAnd you cannot be strong if you do not love yourself\u2014or at the very least, understand yourself.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I can't understand how I could feel anything for Jason at all. I can't understand how I can love anyone else but David. He...\u201d I looked ahead, closing my eyes for a second. \u201cEven though he\u2019s gone, he should still be the only one I ever love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, don't be so harsh on yourself. You cannot expect to be alone for the rest of your days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But what about when he was alive?\u201d I said. \u201cI loved Jason then, Arthur, and I can't forgive myself for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid David ever know how you felt about his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me a few times\u2014but we always got interrupted and just never continued the conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he would say now\u2014if he were to find out?\u201d</p><p>I went a little stiff. \u201cI'm not sure. I think he\u2019d hate me.\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re nodding. So, you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, my dear, I can't honestly answer that. You see, David spoke to me shortly after he first saw you. And we had many conversations preceding that, where I learned two things. One; David had lost faith in the world. He believed there was no good left in anyone\u2014not vampires and not humans. The other thing I learned was that, through reading the minds of humans for a hundred years, David had a bitter hatred for their kind. Until you came along. He saw in you a pure soul; he said all your thoughts were battles between right and wrong and he had never met a girl so innocent, so undamaged by the world, that he instantly fell for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndamaged?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cArthur, I have to be just about the most damaged girl in the world.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, but he meant that you were not tainted by the world\u2019s ways. You weren\u2019t mean, harsh\u2014you thought of others before yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d I rubbed my hairline. \u201cBoy, did he have me figured all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, he did not. He was right. Sometimes you look past other people, too busy worrying about how not to hurt them, that you do just that. I know what you are, and David fell in love with what you are. He told me he learned more about compassion and kindness in a week with you than he did in an entire century from the human race.\u201d The sun made his nose look longer as he looked at the ocean again. \u201cHe loved you fiercely, my dear, and it was because you are a good, pure soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why he\u2019d hate me so much if he realised that I'm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy loving another?\u201d Arthur frowned. \u201cYou think you\u2019re impure because your heart wanted his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have his brother? Did you cheat on David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, I don't really know. I held hands with Jason and I know I kissed him, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this was in your dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind-links.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they were merely dreams, Amara. You don't actually know, do you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, if Jason were here right now, alive, would you be with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. Not if David were alive as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love David. I'd never want to hurt him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you saying? What's your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is...David would hate you for doing the wrong thing, Ara. He would likely be immensely angered to learn you had feelings for Jason, but unless you acted on those, I doubt he could ever bring himself to hate you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cEven then, it doesn't make having feelings for Jason right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you are not declaring that you didn't love David by facing the truth that you love Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess not.\u201d I laughed, moving my toes to make patterns in the sand under them. \u201cBut...I still lose sleep over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if ever you find yourself unable to sleep, come to my chamber,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cI have some herbal remedies that assist with relaxing the mind of a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have one that makes the heart stop feeling anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And you do not need such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara\u2014\u201d He turned my face to look at him. \u201cYou're a young girl, nineteen, to be exact. You are still learning the inner workings of your heart. Most girls your age have had many boys in their life at this point to learn from, but you, my dear, have had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, two,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cAh, of course.\u201d He drew a breath through his teeth. \u201cMike. But, Amara, falling for, having feelings for, and even acting on those feelings for boys, does not mean you are bad or promiscuous\u2014it simply means you are young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you saying I shouldn\u2019t have gotten married\u2014that I can never be monogamous in my heart because I'm young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cSimply that if your heart wants, don't hate yourself for it. A wise young girl once told me that the heart lives by its own set of rules.\u201d</p><p>He smiled; I smiled back.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe world has created its own rules about how love should be, too. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s natural. Queen Lilith, for example, had four husbands\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought she was promised to marry Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. He would have been her fifth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do we see him in the dome, and not the other husbands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was the catalyst that saw her demise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave Drake information on how to kill her, since it was he who discovered that if a pure-blood is beheaded, they will remain in a state, like death, until reassembled. We didn\u2019t know that. We figured she was indestructible like her father and brother\u2014aside from the fact that her venom was deathly to vampires.\u201d Arthur smiled, tapping his tooth. \u201cAnd that fact was the only thing that rendered Drake compliant when Vampirie stripped him of his title as king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did Vampirie do that?\u201d</p><p>Arthur cleared his throat, sniffing once. \u201cDrake\u2019s love for his new wife Anandene turned to obsession; he became reckless, nonchalant in his duties as king. Vampires were out of control again and wreaking havoc on the world. It was more than the Set leaders and the World Council, combined, could control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what, Vampirie just came in and kicked Drake out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Then rounded up a number of vampires\u2014any who had committed offences in the past\u2014and handed them over to Lilith. She kept these vampires as food for the next few years\u2014ridding the world, once again, of around three quarters of the population of vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, and...where did Drake go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe and Anandene disappeared for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? How did he come to kill Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome years later, Drake returned to Loslilian and reunited with his sister. The family feud had healed and all was well, for a while. But Anandene was a well-known, very powerful witch, and when she learned of the Stone\u2019s powers, sought to use it to cast a great spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. I only know that Lilith warned her this spell would bring a curse down on the lands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was black magic\u2014used for personal gain, not for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Stone doesn\u2019t condone that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt doesn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened then?\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked at his watch. \u201cAnandene went behind Lilith\u2019s back. She used the Stone and, sure enough, a plague hit. Many people died. In a desperate attempt to right the wrong, Lilith went to her father. He told her the life that cast the curse must be given back to the Stone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnandene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilith had to kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the Stone. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>Arthur hesitated. \u201cThis story, my dear, is not the one you will read in books\u2014nor is it the one you will be told, should you ask Morgaine. And I do hope this will stay between us.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBut, why doesn't anyone know this story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know what Drake wanted them to know. All this I have learned over the centuries by doing some digging\u2014drawing conclusions. I may have some of the story wrong. But it has been kept a secret, for reasons unknown to me, and I intend to do the same\u2014until I piece everything together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I won't tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure you don't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...did she do it? Did Lilith kill Drake\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo begin with, Drake actually offered his life in place of Anandene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lilith agreed?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cBut when he went to the forest to die, Lilith had him captured\u2014locked away under hold of Created Lilithian venom. When he woke from a nightmare, hearing his beloved scream, he was released to a healed world\u2014the curse lifted, Anandene cold in the ground.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cSo, he wanted Lilith dead because she killed Anandene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I let out the breath I\u2019d kept inside for too long. \u201cWow, well, that\u2019s a different spin on the story to what Morg gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Try not to listen too closely to what she says. She...Drake gives titbits of information he wants you to have for some greater purpose of his own. She believes he let slip the story about the coming of a Pure Blood and a prophecy, but I don't believe he is that careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think he wanted her to set up a knighthood\u2014set up hope for the Lilithians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot even begin to understand his strategy, and I have exhausted myself trying. All I can do now, Princess, is try to stop him.\u201d</p><p>I laughed inside that he called me Princess. \u201cSo, did the other Set leaders know about Anandene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor some reason, no. When I approached even the World Council leaders, they knew nothing of her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can that be? Weren\u2019t you all some kind of brotherhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how can you know, but they didn't?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese proceedings occurred here in the United States, and the world was a much bigger place then, Amara, gossip did not travel the way it does today. Our only method of communication was via letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they just never got on the grapevine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrapevine?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad\u2019s term\u2014for being in the loop.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I sat back a bit then and rubbed open palms over my cold thighs. \u201cI don't understand how Drake kept it a secret all this time\u2014to the point were Miss Nosey herself doesn't even know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss nosey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgaine.\u201d</p><p>Arthur laughed. \u201cWell, there was no one left to tell the story. Morgaine lived in Paris at that time and, within a month of Anandene\u2019s death, any who knew she passed were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? If Drake killed Lilith, how did he kill the vampires without her venom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used the only remaining stores we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down at my sandy feet. \u201cSo, he obviously went to great lengths to keep this a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Morgaine doesn't know any of this\u2014at all\u2014not even one bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Even Lilith kept what Anandene did and what she did to Anandene a secret from the greater population in the weeks before Drake came for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, what about Walter? And Margret. They were on Lilith\u2019s Council then? Do they know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That is why they\u2019re still alive. They were living human lives at the time and hadn\u2019t seen Lilith for some years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. So that\u2019s why Drake stormed Loslilian and killed everyone\u2014because they all knew Lilith killed Anandene?\u201d</p><p>Arthur sat back a little. \u201cFor the most part, I believe so.\u201d</p><p>I sat back too, feeling a bit more alert, a bit more awake now. \u201cWow. Devious little bugger, isn't he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, there is so much deception going on around here, I'm beginning to think myself an illusion.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cMaybe you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one cannot be an illusion and a traitor,\u201d he said mockingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a traitor.\u201d I bumped him softly with my shoulder. \u201cBut I think you have some grand plan\u2014some reason you\u2019re here that you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But until I figure out what everyone else\u2019s plans are\u2014and where, in the midst of it all, you sit, I will keep those plans to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm queen. I sit on the top,\u201d I said proudly, and Arthur smiled.</p><p>\u201cAmara, the queen very rarely sits on top. You have all the power, but you will come to find that, essentially, you make very few of the decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I'm a puppet?\u201d</p><p>He cupped my hand in both of his. \u201cBut you are not alone. I will not see them control you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't realise they were.\u201d I frowned at the distant cliffs.</p><p>\u201cI know. And this is why I watch from the sidelines, rather than to step in and make my point known. Very few people notice a pawn while the Bishops are rallying around the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd very few ever worry about the king, either, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I imagine, if David were here right now, he would be operating things from behind the scenes somewhere\u2014unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Arthur nodded. \u201cHe always knew how to play a hand, make you think you\u2019d won until he blew you out of the water. He was under Drake\u2019s rule long enough to pick up some clever strategies.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah. When he died, I found myself waiting for him to come back\u2014hoping it was just some kind of ploy, you know, that maybe he found out about immunity before I did and was just faking his death.\u201d</p><p>Arthur gently rubbed his hand against his heart. \u201cWhen I first discovered immunity, I had hoped the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever go back?\u201d I asked delicately. \u201cTo the chamber. Did you ever go see his remains?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI wanted to. I wanted to sweep them from the fireplace and set them free on the wind, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to open that door.\u201d His eyes pooled with the agony of that memory. \u201cThat was once a room of gathering where, when I was a child, my father and mother would invite our guests to dine and dance. To reach that door and find myself unable to enter was the final straw for me. I left the castle and haven\u2019t returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm so sorry, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved as if he was going to say something, but he didn't.</p><p>\u201cHey, maybe when we get rid of Drake, you can refurbish it and make it grand again,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cIt will not change the fact that I've seen so many die there\u2014many of those being people I loved.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but to smile then, thinking about what Arthur said before. \u201cYou must have known him pretty well\u2014like, better than he knew himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid. To know he\u2019d be working in the background, using his queen as a pawn\u2014a distraction from what he was really doing.\u201d I shook my head, dusting some sand off my leg. \u201cIf he was alive, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>Arthur reached across and, using his thumb, swept a piece of dried seaweed away from my ankle. \u201cI know. And I like that you knew him well enough to know that, too. I'm glad he found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I thought back to the school football field\u2014David's secret smile, his hair with the gold tones in the summer sun and the vibrant green of his eyes that turned blue when we made love. \u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Peter loved Lilith enough to marry her, why did he betray her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower,\u201d he said simply. \u201cDrake was well-known for his significant, paranormal skills, and Peter wanted something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he sold the information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he ask for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe power to transform into any creature he desired, so he could stalk the homes of men, feed from them, unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? For blood? That's it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur scratched the base of his ear and took a breath. \u201cYou have to understand, he was a vampire, his heart was not changed by the love of a human\u2014still driven by the raw, voracious blood-obsession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did Drake do\u2014did he give him the power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He did. And after Lilith\u2019s death, Peter disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. Some have whispered that he\u2019s the white dog we call Petey, but it\u2019s all speculation\u2014no way to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Petey? A vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a rumour\u2014a very old one. One I personally do not believe.\u201d Arthur brought his arms forward and dusted the sand off his hands.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did Peter actually discover Lilith could die? Like, what brought him to discover her head could be chopped off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had a certain amount of abhorrence between them.\u201d He coughed into his hand. \u201cIt was a love of raw passion, filled with neurotic hate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what? He just chopped off her head one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he had no reason to believe it would come off. He was merely trying to cut her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw. That's so awful.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I bet he regrets that decision now,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI imagine he would, if he is, in fact, alive\u2014perhaps a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s a dog,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe not Petey, but he\u2019s a dog all right\u2014a dirty, mangy mutt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe mindful not to judge, Amara. Until you have endured the path of those you scorn, your opinion should remain unvoiced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf!\u201d I scoffed. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get exhausted being so fanatical about this judge not stuff?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur laughed warmly. \u201cI actually do.\u201d</p><p>After a deep, calm breath, I looked up at the darkening sky. I felt better now\u2014lighter, not so clouded. \u201cThank you, Arthur. I really needed to talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Prin\u2014my queen.\u201d He chuckled then and took my fingers in his. \u201cAnytime you need a sympathetic ear, I will drop whatever I am doing and come to your aid\u2014you need only look at me with those pretty eyes, and I'm all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can get Mike to agree, would you be on my Private Council?\u201d</p><p>He smiled widely. \u201cOh, my dear, it would be a great privilege, and it is an honour that you even asked, but...I must decline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I believe I am of more use to you by being a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn't make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not to you, but\u2014\u201d he paused for a long time, his eyes shifting with what I thought were several different directions of conversation. \u201cI care for you, and I am here to see you become a great queen. Despite that...I\u2019ve been forced to keep some secrets, Amara, and I know you will trust me when I say this is for your own good. However, if I were on your Private Council, I would be obligated to tell you such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the point of the word secret.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded, resting my arms over my knees. \u201cFine then. But...can you at least advise me of things in Court sessions, you know, we can work out a wink or a nod combo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, I can't do that,\u201d he said in his austere voice. \u201cI know what influence my words have on you, and it would be unfair of me to, essentially, rule the nation like a puppeteer. It would also be irresponsible of me. You will, in time, learn what is wrong and what works, and you will do that with my guidance, not my opinions. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I turned my whole upper body to look at him. \u201cMan, you are too good at this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt what?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cAt...I don't know...being noble and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a lot of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p><p>We both sat in silence for a while. All the things I\u2019d just learned about Drake, Anandene and Vampirie skipped around in my head, lapping over the legends we\u2019d based this entire monarchy on\u2014legends that may be wrong. How was I to know what to believe now?</p> <p>I sighed and hugged Arthur\u2019s arm, resting my head on his shoulder. \u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you might know something about this.\u201d I reached down and lifted the key from under my shirt. \u201cI found it in the forest,\u201d I added as he held it in his fingertips, studying it carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry, my lady, I\u2019ve not seen it before. But this\u2014\u201d He pointed to the rope-like symbol on the top, \u201c\u2014is called a Celtic Knot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Celtic Knot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany have argued its interpretation and significance, but one truth I have come to find in all my years is that it represents an unending force\u2014perhaps immortal life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d I took the key back. \u201cDo you think it belonged to Lilith once?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d have no way of knowing, but I never saw her with any key such as this. I can tell you that this symbol is a part of Drake\u2019s family crest, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So, is that like my family crest then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was designed for him and his descendants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has descendants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Anandene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they...I mean, do I know any of them\u2014have any defected?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou have met one before, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You killed him.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cI did? Well, who was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a vile creature, Amara, do not pity him. He was born of sin and wreaked such atrocities on the world his own father locked him in a coffin six feet beneath the earth for a century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all began when Drake sought to experiment with different breeds of vampires. He tried mating with Created Lilithians, attempting to form a new species, but was never successful\u2014the Created couldn't seem to bear children like the pure bloods could. So, he had a child with a human woman, then, when that half-blood grew up, a daughter, he...\u201d Arthur left that bit hanging.</p><p>\u201cHe had a child with her?\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked down. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his own daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I nearly vomited. \u201cAnd...what was the child? I mean, was it a half-blood or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was something else, entirely. You may have heard that, throughout history, it was common for humans to inbreed\u2014which led to deformities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the powerful blood of immortals merely magnified that. The boy was normal of appearance but, inside, he was like a beast\u2014twisted, vile and cruel. He did some very...unspeakable things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked at me carefully then closed his eyes for a second. \u201cI'm afraid, Your Majesty, I should not taint your pure heart with such tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his lips tight. \u201cAll I will say is that he preferred to prey on the innocent. He enjoyed watching something pure and sweet writhe and squeal. And what he did to some of those creatures, not all of them being human, haunts my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did I come to kill him then, and when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the boy you bit\u2014in the council chamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blonde boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I still have nightmares about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He took my hand firmly. \u201cDo not. He was a creature not fit for this world. So heinous, in fact, I fear for the devil if he owns that boy\u2019s soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...I killed a monster\u2014not a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonster is too kind a word for what he was. A soulless, demonic entity, might better describe him.\u201d</p><p>I let out a really long breath and smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I've been suffering so much guilt for having killed that boy. There was never any resolution for me. I just kept wondering what he did wrong\u2014what he did to deserve being killed.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled. \u201cI wish I had told you sooner. I'm sorry. I did not think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know now.\u201d I rubbed my face firmly, then my neck, shaking my head the whole time. \u201cHow is it that pretty much any conversation we have leaves me with more information about everything to do with vampires than an entire eight week lesson with Morgaine?\u201d</p><p>Arthur chuckled. \u201cShe thinks she knows everything. I actually do.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, too, looking up when a shadow passed over my face on the left.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d Eric sat down beside me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eric,\u201d I said; Arthur merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d He knocked me casually with his elbow. \u201cEmily sent me out here to look for you. Says Morgaine told Mike you weren\u2019t in your room, and now he\u2019s gone mad looking for you.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of my eye I saw Arthur\u2019s dimple press into his cheek as he looked down.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm right here. I've just been talking with Arthur.\u201d</p><p>Eric laughed. \u201cThat's what Mike\u2019s worried about.\u201d</p><p>And that made me feel heavy. It seemed even proving myself as queen wasn't enough to get Mike off my back.</p><p>Eric placed his arm around my shoulder and pulled me into him, kissing me quickly on the top of the head. \u201cGood job last night, kiddo. I nearly fell over with pride when you came up that hill today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Eric.\u201d I rubbed his chest then sat up again.</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d He stood and dusted the sand off his jeans. \u201cI\u2019ll go tell Mike I found you down here alone and sent you to your room, okay?\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then gave Arthur a slight bow, a force of habit, I guess, and wandered up the giant, steep stone stairs, like a human.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you, isn't he?\u201d I said.</p><p>Arthur laughed. \u201cOnly with good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still bows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cI noticed that.\u201d</p><p>I linked my arm through Arthur\u2019s and rested my head on his shoulder again. \u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear,\u201d he said in a much warmer tone than any before.</p><p>\u201cI'm glad you're here.\u201d</p><p>He patted my hand. \u201cMe too, princess.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Sitting in front of my dresser, I angled my wrist into the light and rolled it, making sure the Markings had completely faded. The absence of black ink showed the perfect, unblemished white skin; all my scars had healed now, even the few Jason left when he kidnapped me at the Masquerade. I touched my fingers to my neck and traced down my chest to where he literally tore my heart out only a few months ago. That scar was gone, too. I\u2019d made the full transition to queen\u2014to Lilithian, and completely left the past behind\u2014even its scars. But somehow, that made me feel a little sad.</p><p>The mysterious Celtic Knot key rested just above the red silk of my ball gown, looking ever so shiny, like a silvery blade in a pool of blood. It suited me, this key, and I was glad I found it\u2014glad I found something to replace the locket Jason took and never gave back.</p><p>The door opened and I looked up, putting my thoughts away.</p><p>\u201cYou nearly ready, Queen Amara?\u201d Morgaine stepped in.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is my hair okay?\u201d I motioned to the ornate pile of curls on my head, falling softly over my ears and neck.</p><p>\u201cYou look perfect. Most beautiful queen we ever had.\u201d She shook her head a few times, slumping on the foot of my bed. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am that we found you, Amara. And how lucky it is that David and I used to date because, Your Majesty, if I hadn\u2019t loved him once, I\u2019d have tortured him, and you\u2014\u201d Her face went a little pallid, her dark eyes round. \u201cYou\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled, feeling my curls tickle my neck as I nodded. \u201cI guess it\u2019s just...destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I'm just really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, plenty of time for sleep later.\u201d She held up a small, grey gun-looking thing and grinned. \u201cYou wanna wear earrings tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I looked at the silver box David gave me the night before our wedding. I did have a nice pair of black coral earrings that\u2019d go great with this dress. \u201cMaybe. But, my ears are already pierced, Morg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no, they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, they are.\u201d I turned back to the mirror.</p><p>\u201cAmara, you\u2019re a vampire. If you don't keep your earrings in, your holes close over in a matter of seconds.\u201d She stood behind me with the gun.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I touched my earlobe. \u201cDidn't think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terribly human of you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, you want me to pierce them or not?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the box again then opened it and, seeing the moonstone bangle, decided against earrings. \u201cNah, I think I\u2019ll just wear this and my key tonight,\u201d I said slipping it on.</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at my balcony for a second. \u201cAnd, Arthur\u2019s waiting for you, by the way. He requested the first dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I stood up, being careful not to step on my skirt, and wandered over to Morgaine. \u201cIt\u2019s just...does it have to be the first dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with your permission, Amara.\u201d</p><p>My head rolled slowly down as I bunched a handful of fabric in my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cShall I give you another minute or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I nodded, not looking up.</p><p>I heard the door close, and stood in the middle of my room for a few breaths, feeling the loneliness weigh me down. My dress felt too tight and the heat outside seemed to creep in through my windows and wrap my shoulders, making it hard to breathe. I ran for the cool air of the balcony and grabbed the railing, thrusting my shoulders past my hands, leaning out into the night.</p><p>The moon above was only inches from the full circle it had been last night when I made my torturous walk. Its soft, silvery glow turned everything out here pale and white\u2014as if I were in a mystical painting, with sequined sparkles glistening on a blanket of jet-black sky. The only other colour was the golden warmth from flickering candles on the other side of my curtains. It was a nice setting for a ball, really. Magic happened on nights like this.</p><p>With a deep breath of dewy air, I closed my eyes, imagining that the moonlight touching my face was actually David's fingers, his lips\u2014his breath. \u201cI miss you, David,\u201d I whispered into the wind, believing he could hear me.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too, my love.\u201d</p><p>I squealed, covering my mouth to hold it in when I turned and set eyes upon the tall, grinning vampire, leaning casually against the railing across the way. \u201cDavid. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said simply, shrugging, and I flew into his arms, feeling them wrap me up so safely\u2014their grip controlled by a tight band of longing and separation. And silently, his embrace told me all he\u2019d felt while we were apart, because I felt it too.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good,\u201d I cried.</p><p>He leaned out from our embrace and smiled down at me, his eyes becoming small with adoration, pride and so many other emotions. \u201cMy love, you look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't think the whole full hoop skirt is too much?\u201d I ran my fingers over the fitted waist of my dress.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. You are a queen now, my beautiful girl. And you look the part.\u201d He smiled down at my teary gaze, taking my hand. \u201cWould my lady care to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d My voice broke into a quiver, which David noticed, but gave no more attention than a quick, secret smile, then led me to the centre of the balcony and positioned our hands, sweeping me closer by my hips.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t honestly think I\u2019d let you give away our first dance, did you?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn't think it mattered to you like it did to me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, that same smile staying on his lips as we danced circles over the moonlight on the marble floor, stepping to the rhythm of music lilting up from the Great Hall. \u201cAra, everything to do with you matters to me.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to cry, but I was so happy to hold him again that the tears came up anyway, making it hard to see. I hid my face against his chest, sniffling, breaking the romance of this magic little moment. I\u2019d waited so long to dance like this, in his arms, as husband and wife, with nothing between us but the simplicity of our love\u2014something I\u2019d questioned so often since being here at Loslilian. But in his arms, I didn't need words or promises to know he loved me and I loved him. And that was all there was to it. It was simple; in his arms, I was home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever let me go.\u201d</p> <p>He pressed his hand over my ear and breathed cool air against the top of my head. \u201cI never have.\u201d</p><p>The song in the Great Hall ended and another began with a familiar, sorrowful stroke of the bow across the strings of a violin.</p><p>David bowed and kissed my hand, stepping back. \u201cIt has been a pleasure, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, David,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what this means to me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my hand again, smoothing the wetness away with his thumb. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p> <p>I placed my other hand over his. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d We walked back to the edge of the balcony and David turned to me. \u201cDon't ever think being apart means I'm not here with you. I will always be with you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI love you, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, and with my eyes closed, I flung myself into his arms once more\u2014dress, makeup, perfect hair and all\u2014then squeezed him as tight as possible. He kissed my hair, his lips lingering. \u201cI love you, too, Ara. I will miss you in every breath I must take without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don't go.\u201d</p><p>He laughed once and stood back, closing his eyes as he traced his fingertip in a cross over his heart. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to\u2014believe me.\u201d</p> <p>I rested my hand over his wish. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>That small moment, just a breath of silence between us before the inevitable farewell, would last a lifetime, as long as my eyes stayed closed. But I felt David lean in, his warm lips on my hand, and a cool wash of air where he stepped away. I opened my eyes and the moment was lost.</p><p>\u201cUntil we next meet, my love,\u201d he said, and evaporated, saturating me in the emptiness he left behind.</p><p>My heart sunk into my belly. I stood reaching into the darkness, as if I might feel some of his lingering energy. \u201cLove you,\u201d I whispered once more, sure this time he would hear me.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Morgaine stepped onto the balcony.</p><p>\u201cHey, Morg.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, ready or not, you have a room full of handsome men waiting to dance with you.\u201d She grinned, and the beaming light radiating off her, with the contrast of a deep purple dress on her milk-white skin, made me draw a breath.</p><p>\u201cMorg, you look so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d she took my hand as we started walking, \u201c\u2014I have a special date tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked, then smiled. \u201cIs it Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIntuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d she said, closing my bedroom door. \u201cWell, I don't need intuition to smell a certain individual all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down at my dress, then at a piece of fabric she held out to me. \u201cWhat's this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed it and wrapped it over my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Why am I wearing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has David's scent on it. It was Arietta\u2019s; he kept it after she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to wear it all night?\u201d I touched my fingers to it; it was delicate, black, transparent, and it looked nice against the red of my dress but kept slipping off my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either this or garlic. You choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stole it is,\u201d I said. \u201cSo, will this really be enough to disguise his scent on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, as we strolled through the corridor to the stairs. \u201cBut it will be enough to stop questions being raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hope.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at me. \u201cI hope.\u201d</p><p>From the balcony, overlooking the room of ball gowns and tuxedos, I spotted Arthur, laying his violin aside. He looked up, his eyes meeting mine as if he sensed me across the room.</p><p>I waved at him, and he bowed, closing his eyes for a second, then started toward us. Mike watched Arthur move, tracking his gaze, and when he looked up and saw me, placed his wine glass on the piano top, farewelled his comrades and moved swiftly across the floor, taking sideways glances at Arthur.</p><p>\u201cIs he actually racing?\u201d I asked Morgaine.</p><p>She laughed when she looked at him. \u201cIn a gentlemanly fashion, but yes, I believe he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear. If they both get to me at the same time, how do I choose which one to dance with first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on the right,\u201d Morg said. \u201cYou offer your right hand, so go with the one on the right.\u201d</p><p>My dress tugged lightly around my hips as I took each step, the skirt flowing out behind me like a shadow. When I stopped on the last step, the room came to a standstill, aside from my moving counterparts. I bowed my head to the crowd and ushered them to continue, giving a wave of my hand.</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Morgaine reassured under her breath.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said through a smile, not taking my eyes off the room.</p><p>They all moved again, joining to dance as a song began, and Arthur stepped up, beating Mike to the queen, and took my hand. \u201cAmara, may I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d I said, refusing to look at Mike.</p><p>We wandered, hand in hand, to the middle of the room, and Arthur took me in his arms like a delicate treasure. \u201cYou are a picture of beauty, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled, turning my cheek to hide the flushing.</p><p>He leaned in and kissed me gently where the heat in my face burned, but as he drew a breath against my skin, his eyes shifted to one side, like a thought escaped him, making his body slightly stiff. He stood taller and looked across the room, then to the doors leading onto the balcony.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He relaxed then and held me closer, guiding my careless feet into a gentle glide. But I felt the tension in his shoulders still, and it made my heart beat a little too fast, hoping he hadn't smelled David on me. \u201cYou ask of my well-being, Amara, but something seems to be troubling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, no.\u201d I forced a smile. \u201cI was just thinking how much I love the way all you old vampires dance. It\u2019s so...formal.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his cool breath brushing the corner of my eye. \u201cWell, I don't imagine the Nutbush would go down too well at one of these events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do the Nutbush?\u201d</p><p>He just laughed again. We passed Mike then, who still looked like he\u2019d lost his best friend, so to speak. I felt bad for him, but Arthur did, after all, make it to me first.</p><p>\u201cThis was Arietta\u2019s,\u201d Arthur noted, touching my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked up from his hand. \u201cDavid kept it when she died. Morgaine thought it might make missing him tonight less painful.\u201d</p><p>Arthur held me a little closer; I could feel a delicacy to his energy, like he was charged with the kind of adrenaline you get when you have to say something you don't want to. \u201cI wish I could make a potion that would ease a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendship helps.\u201d I squeezed his hand; he squeezed back.</p><p>\u201cYou're very much like her, you know.\u201d He nodded to the bracelet on my wrist\u2014the one David gave me the night before our wedding.</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d I asked inquisitively.</p><p>\u201cLike his mother\u2014Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>He rested his chin against the top of my head. \u201cShe was petite, like you\u2014pretty, with remarkable eyes. But it\u2019s mostly your personality which reminds me of her; your passion, your girlish confusion.\u201d He smiled fondly, looking down at me. \u201cWhen I'm with you, it makes me miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew her well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were very close. Perhaps that is why I fell so in love with her sister.\u201d</p><p>I understood that only too well.</p><p>\u201cMay I cut in,\u201d Mike interrupted, tapping Arthur on the shoulder; the politely formal request to hand over the damn girl.</p><p>As Mike waited patiently, another song already beginning, Arthur turned his back to him and lowered his lips to my ear. \u201cI wonder if I might steal you for a quiet word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mike answered for me.</p><p>\u201cI promise to bring her back.\u201d Arthur faced him, blocking my view.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I spoke over Arthur\u2019s shoulder and gave Mike the don\u2019t-you-dare frown. \u201cJust for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Mike studied Arthur through a narrowed glare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I stepped around Arthur and rested my palm on Mike\u2019s chest, pushing him gently away. \u201cGo dance with Emily\u2014she\u2019s going home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He grabbed my arm as I turned away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He wrapped his fingers loosely around my wrist, scratching his head with his other hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just...the last time I left you in another man\u2019s arms at a ball\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mike?\u201d My heart melted; I slid my arms around his waist, pressing every inch of my chest to his. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I'm not human anymore, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t stop you from being hurt.\u201d He stood back, eyeing Arthur.</p><p>\u201cI trust Arthur, Mike\u2014for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d I glanced between the two of them. \u201cBut, if it makes you feel any better, you can stand here and watch us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Mike stared me down. \u201cWhy are you being so reasonable?\u201d</p><p>I tried to hold back from laughing. \u201cBecause I realised, Mike, how much I need you, and...\u201d</p><p>He waited, smiling expectantly. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...most of the time, you actually turn out to be right about things.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed with a smile. \u201cOkay, who are you and what have you done with my best friend?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, balancing on my toes to kiss his cheek. \u201cI love you, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I took Arthur\u2019s hand and as we walked through the doors to the balcony, turned back to look at Mike. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms and leaned on the doorframe. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, feeling more love than anger for Mike and his over-protection.</p><p>Under the light of the stars outside, the cool breeze filled my lungs with a fresh, floral scent. Once far enough away from Mike\u2019s aura of tension, we stopped by the marble ledge of the balcony, overlooking the small garden we sat in on the first day I came here. I smiled at the swing, still seeing us sitting there, arguing. It seemed like so long ago\u2014and even then, I knew so little compared to what I know now. It made me feel older, in a good way.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Arthur said quietly to someone behind us. I turned to watch him shake a man\u2019s hand and walk back over to me, carrying something under his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, a little embarrassed that I hadn't even noticed he\u2019d walked away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d He placed a long wooden box on the marble ledge.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the stole from my shoulders and laid it carefully over the railing, then, using my thumbs, pushed the latch on the box up. Before I even saw what it was, shining metal glinted in the dull candlelight. I threw the lid all the way open and reached for the sword inside, but didn\u2019t touch it. \u201cArthur, this is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lilithian steel.\u201d He ran a fingertip over the blade, then lifted it and pointed to the hilt. \u201cThis snake is made of copper, to conduct electricity. If I am not mistaken about your powers, your touch should charge this blade with that energy of yours.\u201d</p><p>With wide eyes and a round mouth, I took the sword from Arthur\u2019s hand. It was light, comfortable, like it was made for my hands. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had it commissioned for you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shifted from the blade to Arthur. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Nhym.\u201d He pointed to the opaque markings on the steel. \u201cThis, in the language of the ancients, reads Where there is life, there is hope.\u201d</p><p>I felt the light reflect off the blade and shine across my face, like a mask.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead\u2014\u201d He turned it in my hand so the snake rested in my palm. \u201cTry it out.\u201d</p><p>Looking at my reflection in the darkened glass beside me, I held the sword up; face to face. Life and breath. My hands charged, the static rising, heating my wrists, my fingertips. I felt it leave my body, felt it snake up the copper embellishment into the blade, and the blue light circled the tip, soft yet powerful, like lashes of plasma in a globe. It looked pretty, innocent, harmless, but I knew the damage it would do to any who dared strike their metal against mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Arthur.\u201d I lowered the blade and let the electricity simmer away with a deep breath. Though the pounding in my head made me want to fold over and hold my temples, I didn't; Arthur\u2019s warm smile and the eagerness in his eyes forced me to show only appreciation. But not just for the sword\u2014for being the only one who ever actually believed in me. \u201cI can't think of another person in this entire manor who would\u2019ve thought of such a gift, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a gift, Amara. It\u2019s a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStatement?\u201d</p><p>He took the sword delicately from my hands and laid it back in the box. \u201cYou\u2019re ready for this. You\u2019re ready to fight for your people, my queen. This weapon symbolises you stepping into your role as not only our leader, but a warrior for your people. With the gift of life\u2014\u201d he touched Nhym \u201c\u2014at your fingertips, you will be the one who leads us to freedom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thrust myself forward, wrapping my arms around his neck; he patted my rib cage softly, laughing.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Arthur. Thank you for always believing in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Amara\u2014\u201d He cupped both hands against my sides and pulled away from the hug, holding me there, just in front of his body, \u201c\u2014You give me good reason to believe in you. What Mike sees, what your people see, it holds no bearing on what you\u2019re capable of. And I have seen it in you. I have seen you fight against all manner of terror to survive\u2014to give hope of a better world.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped my arms back down to my sides, as did Arthur, and we stood in front of each other, nothing much to say, but comfortable in the closeness of friendship.</p><p>\u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, fastening the snake latch in place on Nhym\u2019s box.</p> <p>I moved away and hoisted myself onto the marble ledge, my dress puffing up around my hips and ribs, falling in layers toward my feet. \u201cWhy don't you have a girlfriend or anything?\u201d</p><p>He half laughed, wiping a hand across his nose. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't know.\u201d I twirled a lock of hair around my finger. \u201cYou just...you seem like such a nice guy. It doesn't make sense that you never married or anything.\u201d</p><p>He leaned on the balcony ledge beside me. \u201cI\u2019ve never found someone to love after Arietta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don't you just date someone\u2014maybe you'd fall in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDate?\u201d His brow arched.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. You dated Morgaine once, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgaine?\u201d He almost spat the words out. \u201cWhat ever gave you that idea?\u201d</p><p>Cold washed through me, my cheeks burning with the warm rush after. \u201cI...that\u2019s what people say.\u201d</p><p>He scratched his head, his face all screwed up. He looked kinda human when he did that\u2014not so much like a seventeenth-century prince. \u201cUh, well...Morgaine and I may have...\u201d He moved his hand down and scratched his neck. \u201cWe might have...bedded, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, barely covering my mouth to catch all the spit. \u201cOh, my God. Arthur, you're so awkward about this stuff.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand, a Cheshire cat grin narrowing his eyes. \u201cWell, Majesty, I come from a time where men did not discuss such things, especially not with a lady\u2014his queen, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand and cupped my other one over it. \u201cBut times are moving, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, I'm sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you, but I think about it a lot\u2014how lonely it must be to have no one. You know, you go back to an empty room every night, for all eternity. Never have someone to lay with, talk with, tell secrets to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, sliding his hand slowly out of mine. \u201cIt does get tiresome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why not date?\u201d</p><p>His dimple showed with the thoughts rolling across his face. \u201cI don't fit in so well these days. I'm afraid I\u2019ve spent too much time in the depths of century old traditions and monarchies. I would have to either date someone from our world, or make a fool of myself in the human realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d fit in with humans just fine,\u201d I said, jumping down off the ledge, feeling shorter suddenly beside him. \u201cYou just need to loosen up a little. Here\u2014\u201d I grabbed both his shoulders and pulled forward. \u201cSlouch a bit. You're so stiff. This isn\u2019t the army.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his spine, making himself shorter. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I laughed. \u201cNow you just look like you have a hunch.\u201d</p><p>He stood straight and tall again. \u201cI'm afraid my century of birth suits my personality better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you...do you think, if we find a way to turn vampires back to human, like, if the prophecy child was real, do you think you\u2019ll ever fit into that world again.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI'm sure of it. It might take practice, but I would be more than willing to try. However\u2014\u201d He slid his hand down my arm, making little bumps rise with his soft touch, and took my hand. \u201cYour husband is gone, Amara. What hope is there of a prophecy child now?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Maybe I\u2019ll love again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the child would not be the one foretold; she would not be blood of Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s meant to happen, if the only child that can cure vampirism is one from that bloodline, then Fate wouldn\u2019t have taken my husband\u2014and Jason as well.\u201d</p><p>He swiped his thumb over his chin and folded his arms, glancing quickly over at Mike then back again. \u201cThey were not the only blood of Knight, Amara.\u201d</p><p>Before I could stop it, a snicker grumbled in the back of my throat. \u201cAre you...are you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm glad the idea amuses you.\u201d He turned away and leaned over the railing.</p><p>I thought he was upset, until I leaned beside him and noticed a smile in his eyes. \u201cI'm sorry, Arthur. I didn't mean to laugh. It\u2019s just...you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little creepy.\u201d His breath of laughter eased the tension.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. It\u2019s, I mean...it\u2019s not that I don't find you sweet...and even attractive, it\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid was my nephew.\u201d He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That. It kind of makes you family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does make us family,\u201d he breathed. \u201cBut, for us to have a child would not be incestuous, my dear. We\u2019re not of the same blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And...I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d I laughed again, feeling way too much blood under my cheekbones. \u201cBut...I mean, we probably better not mention this to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d He stood tall again. \u201cI agree. I imagine no amount of ancient experience would save me from the wrath of Mike if he were to find out.\u201d</p><p>I laughed too. \u201cNo. But...thank you, Arthur. You know...for offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you're welcome, but somehow, that just seems inappropriate.\u201d He cupped both my arms and rested a gentle kiss on my brow. \u201cI'm proud of you, Amara. And I love you dearly. I would do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to rub the kiss away, not because it was gross, but because it was a little chilly. But I let it rest there, knowing he could see the moisture his lips left on my skin, because it felt rightly placed. It was a kiss of friendship. And I liked this friendship. \u201cYou know I feel the same, right? And if\u2014\u201d If David wasn't alive. \u201cIf the need ever arises and the prophecy child is possible, I would be proud for you to be her father.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled with tears; he didn\u2019t even try to hide them.</p><p>I touched his face and let my hand slide down the gristly stubble on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and sniffed once. \u201cWe should head back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I took his arm and rested my head on his shoulder for a quick moment. \u201cI better go dance with Mike.\u201d</p><p>My footprints left a lonely trail in the sand\u2014the only proof life here existed. The morning was new, but the red sky and wild winds gave warning that today would not display summer so much as it would the wrath of Mother Nature.</p><p>I closed my eyes and listened to the wind caution the rocks, roaring and wailing\u2014each breath of its cry thrashing my hair out in claw-like fingers around my face.</p><p>Last night had passed like a softly spoken story to a child; I smiled and danced, playing the role of a queen, but inside, I felt only the heart of a girl\u2014one who wanted nothing more than to mend the past and undo the future.</p><p>When Mike finally got the chance to dance with me, I nearly told him what Arthur offered, but bit my tongue instead. Poor Arthur would be so humiliated when he found out that David was actually alive, and with the secret of immunity out now, part of me wondered if he already suspected it. But, if he did, then why would he have offered a child?</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. I thought I might find you out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I smiled, not turning around. \u201cOr you just asked your knights where I was.\u201d</p><p>He tromped up right beside me and cast his eyes to the sea. \u201cLooks like rough weather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. A storm.\u201d I rubbed my temples.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to come sleep by your window tonight?\u201d</p><p>I drew my shoulder up to my cheek. \u201cI'm okay. They don't scare me so much anymore. Mostly, I just get headaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably something to do with static energy.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s Arthur\u2019s theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve talked to him about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talk to him about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding the secret of immunity,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn't. Not about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, don't lie to me, baby. You couldn\u2019t hide a lie on that face if you wore a mask.\u201d</p><p>My lips tugged on the corners, making me smile. \u201cOkay. Maybe. But it was an accident. He said I let something slip, but I don't even know what it was.\u201d</p><p>Mike became smaller beside me, his arms hanging loosely by his sides. \u201cDoes he know about David?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, hugging my cardigan around me.</p><p>\u201cYou think we should tell him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>My mouth gaped. \u201cYou're asking my opinion?\u201d</p><p>He looked back out at the grey day. \u201cI know you\u2019ll tell him if you want to\u2014despite what I say. I\u2019d just rather you told me if you were going to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I touched just under the sleeve of his shirt, where his Mark showed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a heads-up if I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask, baby.\u201d</p><p>I took a breath, feeling the slight warmth of it blow back in my face with the fierce wind. \u201cIsn't it strange that we don't have to yell over the wind anymore?\u201d</p><p>I heard a soft laugh beside me. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s great. When we finally get a vacation one day, we should go back to Australia, go surfing. We\u2019d be able to talk to each other in the barrel of a wave.\u201d</p><p>I laughed too. \u201cMm. That actually sounds really good. Tubetalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Tubetalk,\u201d he repeated to himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be nice to see your mum and dad again. I bet they\u2019re missing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He stuffed his hands in his pockets and toed the sand, becoming the boy I grew up with all of a sudden. \u201cBut they\u2019re okay. They just got a spa installed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded.</p><p>\u201cAwesome. We\u2019re staying at your house when we go back then.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and gave me a gentle peck on the cheek. \u201cI miss you. Miss us.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry I\u2019ve been a bit absent lately, baby.\u201d His tone sounded as if he was going to continue, perhaps with an explanation, but he didn't. He just looked back at the ocean, his hands still in pockets, his shoulders high.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you know. I get it. I'm just glad you\u2019re here if I do really need you.\u201d</p><p>The shadow he cast nodded. \u201cWell, I gotta get up to training. See you in a few?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Oh, hey, Mike?\u201d</p><p>He stopped a few steps away.</p><p>\u201cThe Immortal Damned\u2014how\u2019s the new quarters coming along?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back down the sand to me. \u201cGood. I told you we moved them to the upper cell block, right\u2014so they\u2019d have sun?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cRight, well, the new prison should be done by week\u2019s end. I\u2019ve got sixty knights working on it, and the Lilithian community has rallied together to help as well.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, picturing the plans from blueprint, rising up to the three dimensions, all bright and white and airy. \u201cGreat. And when can we move them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even once the building\u2019s finished, I still wanna wait a few extra days, maybe a week. They\u2019re being fed more often and we\u2019re seeing small changes in general behaviour, but they attacked Mr. Keeper last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be like that, baby. He\u2019s been really good to those kids lately. He just needed to be taught how to treat...well, humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I rescinded. \u201cAnd, by the way, don't call the new quarters a prison again, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he laughed my name out. \u201cIt is a prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does a casino, but you don't call that a prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d His whole body jolted back with fake laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re so funny.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a soft shove. \u201cGo to training.\u201d</p><p>He skipped off like a ten-year-old boy. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya soon, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I called, without turning to wave at him.</p><p>The heat of electricity formed a shield around me, and even with my eyes closed, I could feel the barrier of the cage. I heard Mike\u2019s voice over the noise, yelling at me, counting down to the second I was allowed to stop, but the pain in my head made it sound as though he was standing on the opposite side of a mountain gorge.</p><p>\u201cI can't, Mike,\u201d I yelled, scrunching my eyes tighter. \u201cI can't do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ten more seconds, baby.\u201d</p><p>His count and my count went at different speeds. I ground my back teeth together, forcing my feet to stay flat, my hands shaking as the electricity fired from my raw fingertips and into the metal cage protecting those on the other side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThree, two...\u201d I heard Mike call.</p><p>\u201cAh! No more.\u201d I dropped to my knees, the electricity ceasing, leaving my fingertips icy cool.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mike said. My eyes stayed shut, but I felt him nearby, felt him kick the cage softly, mockingly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really bad this time, Mike.\u201d I winced, pushing my hands firmly against both sides of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn't feel like it.\u201d</p><p>The cage door came open and Falcon lifted me to my feet. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, stumbling a little.</p> <p>My butt found the bench at the side of the room, and Falcon squatted down in front of me, his hand just between his legs, a smile on his face. \u201cYou lasted ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. It felt like forty.\u201d</p><p>He gently pulled my hand away from my head and studied my brow, running a fingertip over where it pulsed the worst. \u201cYou might need blood. Your vein is showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErg!\u201d I pressed it back into my head. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s going to split open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, good job, Ar.\u201d Mike tapped my toe with his heavy boot. \u201cYou\u2019re getting stronger.\u201d</p><p>I looked up, my face all pinched. \u201cI know. But it\u2019s hurting more than it did before.\u201d</p> <p>He just smiled, writing something down on his iPad. \u201cWelcome to getting fit. Remember I could hardly walk for days after seeing my personal trainer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d I drew a tight breath through my teeth. \u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, baby. You just need to grow up.\u201d</p><p>Falcon frowned, his eyes thoughtful. \u201cI dunno, Chief,\u201d he said, half turning to look at Mike. \u201cI think she might need to lay down for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. She needs to keep exercising it.\u201d He put his iPad down and reached a hand out for mine. \u201cCome on. One more, then we\u2019ll call it quits for the day.\u201d</p><p>I looked at his hand, then Falcon, and covered my face, breaking to tears. \u201cI can't, Mike. Please. Please don't make me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe strong, Ara,\u201d he said with flat sympathy. \u201cJust one more. Come on, then I\u2019ll take you up and run you a nice warm bath.\u201d</p><p>My hands tightened against my forehead. I felt red, like my whole face would be blazing, coloured with my agony, as if the electricity was still lashing my fingers, sending violent surges into my brain; I held my breath, moaning in the back of my throat as the pain intensified, travelling down my neck, into my spine.</p> <p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike squatted beside me. \u201cBaby? Why are you making that noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts!\u201d I screamed, slipping off the bench. \u201cMake it stop, Mike. Make it stop!\u201d</p><p>A hand came upon my ribs as I curled into a ball, tucking my knees as close to my chin as they\u2019d go. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cI don't know.\u201d Mike knelt beside me, cupping a warm, strong hand over the two I had fused to my skull. \u201cShe just fell to the floor.\u201d</p><p>Arthur lifted my chin and looked into my eye, forcing it open with his thumb. \u201cDear God, look at her pupils.\u201d</p><p>Mike leaned in and his eyes went wide, but I didn't care what they looked like. The white shock of pain locked me down, trapping me in a world where absolutely nothing mattered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mike grabbed Arthur\u2019s arm as he slipped them under me.</p><p>\u201cI have some herbs that will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp? How? Tell me what it is before I let you touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassion Flower.\u201d Arthur rolled back on his heels, leaving me on the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s used in humans for conditions of anxiety and tension. In vampires, it can help bridge the communications between electrodes in the brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't like it. No!\u201d Mike shook his head, scooping my arm over his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d A jolt of heat shot from my head, through my arm and stabbed my shoulder. \u201cArthur! Please? Don't listen to him\u2014just help me.\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked at Mike, and Mike stepped away with a sigh. \u201cFine. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, princess.\u201d He bundled me in his arms, warm and safe, and kissed my head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you well in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Mike blocked our path. \u201cAnything happens to her, I\u2019ll have you drawn and quartered.\u201d</p><p>Arthur bowed his head and pushed past.</p><p>\u201cAnd have her back before the Council meeting at four.\u201d</p><p>Arthur stopped again, his whole body tensing, kind of trembling. \u201cTo hell with your Council meeting, Michael. The girl needs rest.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and snuggled into Arthur\u2019s neck, seeing Mike drop his finger of caution before I buried my face.</p><p>As the fresh air of the countryside washed across my limbs, the screeching grate of claws in my head became knives\u2014scratching, pulsing. White spots filled my eyes as they rolled back in my head.</p><p>\u201cAmara? Stay with me,\u201d Arthur said, panic lucid in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI just want David, Arthur. I miss him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, my dear. I know.\u201d</p><p>The curtains were open, the sun brightening everything, but I was lost behind the pained circle of shadow shrouding my vision. \u201cArthur?\u201d I gripped my head, rolling onto my side in his bed. \u201cWhy is it so much worse this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know, my dear.\u201d I heard the scratch of his curtains along the railing and felt the darkness close me in. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second. I'm just getting my kit.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even bother to answer, not even a nod. Arthur\u2019s voice dissolved under the ringing in my ears, and I flinched when he landed beside me again, a few glass bottles clanking together.</p><p>He rolled me onto my back and laid my arms neatly by my sides, then lifted my head and wiped a wet, potent-smelling slime under my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll make you relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt stinks,\u201d I said, but the deep breath I took made my heart slow, and a warm calm inched down my throat, my chest and along my arms\u2014not reaching my curled toes. \u201cWill it make me sleepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said from right above my face, his eyes concentrating on my forehead, his thumb smoothing dots of a cinnamon-scented powder across my hairline.</p><p>\u201cMy head feels tight now,\u201d I noted, watching him sit back and crush something in his stone bowl.</p><p>\u201cTight is good.\u201d He smiled and kept mashing. \u201cTight is better than sore.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and closed my eyes, opening them again to his fingers unbuttoning my shirt. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy darling girl.\u201d He pushed my hands back down. \u201cI'm not going to touch you. I just need to put this across the top of your chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I looked at the black slime on his fingertip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Ginkgo extract; you breathe the vapour\u2014it helps oxygen flow through your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need more oxygen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don't pass out.\u201d He opened my shirt, stretching the collar apart enough to reveal my red bra, and smoothed a firm, cold hand over my sternum and collarbones\u2014nowhere near my breasts. Thank God. \u201cThere. See?\u201d He closed my shirt. \u201cAll done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d I whispered, feeling a loose, spinning sensation in my head.</p><p>\u201cShh. Rest now, my dear.\u201d He ran his fingertips over my eyes, making them close.</p><p>\u201cI can't take much more,\u201d I said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cOf what, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf life,\u201d I whispered as my mind started to drift. \u201cI need him to come back. I can\u2019t go on much longer without him.\u201d</p><p>He shifted my body and laid under me, his widespread fingers closing over the side of my face as he held me tight, his chest dropping as he exhaled. \u201cPlease don't say that, Amara. It hurts me deeply to think you would rather live for someone else, or be dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d I murmured, my words flaking away.</p><p>\u201cIt is, my sweet, young girl. It is.\u201d He stroked my head. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very sad.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes, opening them again to the morning light in my own bedroom\u2014the headache gone, Arthur gone, my shirt buttoned back into place and the blankets pulled all the way up to my chin. Nowhere, in any of my thoughts, could I find the memory of how I got here.</p><p>I laid back and smiled, thinking, Thanks, Arthur.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Mike stopped me by the library door.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019re you doing in this wing of the manor,\u201d I said playfully.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to let you know that we moved yesterday\u2019s council meeting to tomorrow\u2014so you can be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, joy\u2014er, I mean, thanks.\u201d I flashed a fake smile.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d he said, then ran off in the direction he\u2019d come from. And that was that. Quick flashes of my old BFF were all I seemed to get these days.</p><p>Brushing off that pitiful gut wrench of loneliness, I pushed the heavy library door open; it made a fuss about being moved, and when I stepped into the nook of the little third floor balcony and turned around, I saw why. It was no door at all, but a passage concealed in a bookcase. As it closed, the exit disappeared, and I stood staring at it for a second, wondering how I\u2019d get back out again.</p><p>\u201cOpen sesame.\u201d I waved my hands around; the door stayed hidden. \u201cAbracadabra?\u201d My lips twisted, moving from side to side. I tried knocking, even tugging on the shelf, but it didn't open. \u201cLooks like a one-way access.\u201d</p><p>I turned on my heel then and leaned over the railing of the balcony, spotting another door down on the second floor underneath me, and smiled with relief. Hopefully that one opened without any mumbo-jumbo.</p><p>The whole room had a lonely kind of feel to it, as if the books on the shelves, covering the entire room, had not been opened and read in centuries. I felt lonely here, and I think even the books felt lonely. I took a quiet moment then to really appreciate the sheer height and magnificence of floor to roof books, divided by snaking platforms with winding staircases leading up. In my personal little nook, the landing fattened out a little, making room for a cosy armchair, a round rug and a small table to rest a coffee cup on. Perfect. This was my new favourite room.</p><p>All the books on the shelves in this dark little nook looked like old non-fiction reads, half of them behind locked glass screens. But since Morgaine said this was my own personal reading space, I\u2019d have them all replaced with paranormal romance and classics.</p><p>I propped my hands on my hips, looking up then down, and all around; somewhere in these shelves there had to be a book on the Markings I inherited from my oath. Morgaine promised they\u2019d all fade, but each time I checked my body in the mirror, one line kept staring back out at me. It hadn't bothered me until I woke this morning to realise it wasn't planning on going anywhere.</p><p>I fingered the spines along the shelves, reading the titles aloud to myself, and came upon an opening in the rail, the ground dropping for a windy staircase. It was sturdy, made of solid wood rather than metal, taking my weight easily as I headed down; I half expected it to rattle and tremble.</p><p>Downstairs, the room opened out to the massive windows overlooking the south side of the manor, and between them, a round rug sat guard in front of a huge fireplace, flanked by another armchair\u2014a place I could envision Arthur sitting, with two eager-eyed boys looking up at him while he read stories, maybe even with Arietta beside him.</p><p>I smiled and wandered forward, touching the large oak tables, chairs and lamps as I passed, familiarising myself with every surface in the room. But it would take a lifetime to be that familiar with all these books. There was no way I\u2019d ever find the time to read them all. And as I gazed over the locked cabinets and thick spines of century-old hardbacks, I realised there\u2019d be no way to find a book about a topic I wasn\u2019t sure anyone had even written about.</p><p>I scratched my ribcage, where the Mark remained, then headed out the second floor door. There was only one person I could think of who\u2019d know where to find a book about my Markings.</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d I wandered into his room, uninvited.</p><p>\u201cAmara, how are you feeling this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm okay,\u201d I said, and nodded at the bowl on the table in front of him. \u201cWhat's that for?\u201d</p><p>He looked down, considering the contents carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s to relieve extreme night terrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight terrors? What, like, bad dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I pulled out a chair and sat down opposite him. \u201cWell, who\u2019s having night terrors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from the bowl. \u201cIs there something I can help you with, Amara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d My shoulders sunk. \u201cIt\u2019s just...can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgaine said all my Markings would fade after I finished my coronation, but one didn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Arthur placed the stone utensil he was mixing with into the bowl. \u201cWhere is it? May I see?\u201d</p><p>I stood up, gathered the base of my top and lifted it up over my belly then my ribs, and turned slightly so Arthur could see the two lines of scripture just below my breast, like a poem sneaking its way toward my spine.</p><p>His eyes traced my curves, stopping on the tattoo. \u201cAnd this is a remaining Mark\u2014it\u2019s not new, is it? You found this immediately after the coronation?\u201d he asked, wandering over to kneel in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was there when I got undressed that night.\u201d I giggled a bit when he smoothed his hands up my ribs to push my top completely out of the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watched his lips move and his face contort as he obviously translated the text inside his head, his long fingers firmly holding my waist, looking ever so much like David's skin against mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Morgaine was right, Queen Lilith was not left with any Markings, but this is simply a signature\u2014a line of promise, like a wedding band. Speaking of which\u2014\u201d He stood again and gently lowered my top, then turned and grabbed something off the table. \u201cMike asked me to give these to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d I slipped my wedding ring back on and put the key in my pocket, wondering why Mike didn't just give them to me himself. \u201cHe makes me take all my jewellery off when I go in the cage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He leaned his butt on the table, bobbing his head like he was thinking. \u201cI don't like that cage, Amara. I\u2019ve asked him to stop using it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won't. He thinks it\u2019s vital to the study of my powers. And Mike\u2019s always right\u2014about everything.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d His folded arms tightened. \u201cI won't see you treated that way. It\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all in the name of science.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and looked at my hand where I scratched at my Mark. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p> <p>I dropped my hand. \u201cI don't like tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then, it suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, his gaze running from my waist to my eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s very...sexy.\u201d</p> <p>I thrust my head back, laughing loudly. \u201cThat word sounds so funny coming from your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well\u2014\u201d He nodded, clearing his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time I attempt crass modern-day lingo for the purpose of flattery.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again. \u201cSo, what did the Mark actually say, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you not read it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt says something along the lines of By oath of blood, by promise of heart, I honour my vow,\u201d he said, then turned away and wandered over to his window box, grabbing the scissors to trim leaves off a plant.</p><p>I walked around to the side of his bed and sunk down. \u201cWell, I don't want it there. It sucks.\u201d</p><p>He looked up quickly. \u201cLanguage, please, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at the old man and flopped onto my back with a huff. \u201cWill it go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find out, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere's a book\u2014in the library. Shall I get it?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my top again and arched my spine so I could see the Mark. \u201cYes, please. If you don't mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, my lady.\u201d And he disappeared.</p><p>On the nightstand, his phone buzzed. I reached across and grabbed it, saw the message didn't show up on his screen automatically, like mine did, then pressed my thumb to an orange icon, leading me to his playlists. We liked a lot of the same music, strangely. I half expected his selection to be like David's, but it almost seemed as if he made a point of having nothing but modern stuff on here.</p><p>\u201cBon Jovi? Seriously?\u201d I said to myself.</p><p>\u201cI move with the times,\u201d he said, standing by the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh. Crap. Sorry.\u201d I put the phone down beside me. \u201cI was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiled, carrying a book under his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s more than all right, princess.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back and grabbed his phone again. \u201cYou got a message, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cDunno. I wasn't gonna go checking your messages, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the edge of the bed, making it dip a little, and opened the book in his lap. \u201cCan you check it for me, since you clearly have no intentions of handing my phone over?\u201d</p><p>I grinned to myself and opened his messages. \u201cIt\u2019s just a phone service message. Apparently you\u2019ve won an iPad if you text this word to this number.\u201d I showed him the screen; he laughed. \u201cSo, find anything in that book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, flipping the pages. \u201cThis one mentions certain markings that appear after acts of sin or treason, there doesn't seem to be anything on the Mark of the Queen\u2019s Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure you\u2019ll find it,\u201d I said absentmindedly, scrolling through the playlists again. He had some good combinations of music, but when I came across one titled \u2018A Rose\u2019 and pressed my thumb to it, my world shifted. Every song in that list was some heartbreaking melody of lost love.</p><p>\u201cWow, talk about depressing,\u201d I said, laughing a bit. \u201cDid you make this list about Arietta?\u201d</p><p>Arthur stopped reading and looked out the window. \u201cA Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I moved up and laid on his pillow, my thick dark hair spilling out around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, why\u2019d you call it that, then? It has a lot of sad songs.\u201d</p><p>He placed the book on the bed and stood up. \u201cIt was not my playlist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I stared at it for a few seconds, unable to see through a sudden coating of tears.</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d Morgaine popped her head in.</p><p>\u201cYes, Morgaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a courier here. Says he\u2019s picking up a package from you.\u201d</p><p>Arthur sighed and touched my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when I come back up.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sliding my bottom lip over the other to move a tear from it. Arthur tipped the bowl of stuff he was mixing into a small container and left, shutting the door.</p><p>The grandfather clock ticked noisily by the drawers across the room, and the gentle sound of rain on glass made me feel closed in. I scrolled down the sad playlist, hearing each song in my head. If this was Jason\u2019s, then he made it for me. I could feel it. But why did Arthur keep this list\u2014why not just erase it? And that thought made me wonder what else he\u2019d kept.</p><p>I pressed the circular button at the centre of the phone and went back to the home page, then clicked on \u2018contacts\u2019 and scrolled down only far enough to see the start of the \u2018J\u2019 names. I\u2019d never seen his name written down anywhere. Isn't that funny? How you can know someone, come to care for them, but never think of such a silly thing as seeing their name written down?</p><p>So, I scrolled down, J by J until I saw Jason Knight, losing my heart to the beat it skipped.</p><p>I copied it to my contacts, and the phone was to my ear, ringing, before I even realised I\u2019d pressed call. I couldn't believe it was still in service. Maybe it was in his pocket, buried with him, and I would once again, if only in a small way, be able to affect his world for a moment. Or maybe the phone fell from his dead body as they carried him away; perhaps it was kicked across the floor, never to be found again. Or maybe they would find it, and just toss it in the trash or get a new sim card and use it for themselves, as though he never even existed.</p><p>It rang out. I half expected to hear a recording of his voice, but to my disappointment, the line only went silent\u2014a rushing of air filling the emptiness of my lost hopes.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d I said to the nothing, as if his ghost might be out there, on an electrical wavelength I could reach by having dialled this number. \u201cI wish you were here,\u201d I continued, wiping tears from my face with one side of my hand, then the other. \u201cI dream of you still. I cry for you. Do you know that? I cry for you, and I have no right to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d Arthur stood in the doorway.</p><p>I put the phone down, hanging it up with my thumb. \u201cI'm sorry, Arthur. I thought I\u2019d get voicemail.\u201d</p><p>He appeared beside me, wrapping me up in his long, firm arms.</p><p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d hear his voice for real,\u201d I sobbed.</p><p>\u201cOh, princess.\u201d He looked at the phone carefully, pressed \u2018end\u2019, as I obviously hadn't pressed it properly, and wrapped his arms back around me.</p><p>\u201cWhere is his phone? Did you bury it with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, why would I do a thing like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know.\u201d I wiped my face. \u201cI just...I guess I just feel like he was taken so quickly. I...there's no closure. What happened to all his things? What happened to everything he loved and cared about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right here\u2014in my arms.\u201d He looked down at me, and I couldn\u2019t help but let the hysterics out. The sadness of everything Jason\u2019s life was before he died made my heart so, so heavy.</p><p>\u201cIs that true? Did he really care about me that much?\u201d</p><p>Arthur laughed a little. \u201cMy dear, it is near impossible not to care for you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed too, using my thumb to wipe the corner of my eye. \u201cWhy are you always so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>He sat down and pushed both phones away from our legs as he pulled me into his chest. \u201cSomeone has to be.\u201d</p><p>Once the tears finally eased, Arthur went back to his work, and I laid on his bed, on my belly, kicking my feet to the songs on his \u2018Jogging\u2019 playlist.</p><p>\u201cWe like to run to the same songs,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d He barely looked up from his work.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I rolled onto my back and rested my lower leg on my knee. \u201cHey, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see your Mark\u2014from your oath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>His shadow appeared over my face. \u201cBecause, it would be terribly inappropriate for me to remove my shirt in front of you while in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan't you just roll your sleeve up?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the long arm of his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of shirt, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you show it to me another day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He extended his hand and helped me to my feet. \u201cPerhaps I will wear a t-shirt tomorrow. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, straightening my clothes.</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, for now, we best part ways, my dear. Dinner will be served in a quarter hour, and I need to freshen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I wandered over and opened his door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>He smiled kindly. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>I shut his door behind me and turned around to look at Falcon, leaning on the wall, arms folded, legs crossed out on a slant.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to be in there with him\u2014alone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, Falcon.\u201d I started walking. \u201cBut he means no harm. He was just teaching me about plants and herbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Falcon wandered slowly behind me. \u201cI was listening to every word.\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at him. \u201cAre you allowed to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn't that a little invasive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cMike says it\u2019s not.\u201d He folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cFine. I don't care. Go ahead. Listen. You won\u2019t hear anything juicy going on.\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly. \u201cI know, Ara. I'm not worried about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019re you worried about? That he\u2019ll kill me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm worried about his intentions\u2014romantically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down at my feet. \u201cWell, don't. Our relationship is about as platonic as it gets.\u201d</p><p>He walked quietly behind me then, like a good little bodyguard. When we reached my room, I opened the door and waved at Quaid, who popped up on the balcony and darted around the space, way too fast for me to see.</p><p>\u201cIs it really necessary to check my room every time I go in there?\u201d</p><p>Falcon folded his arms and stared at that spot of nothing on the wall he always looked at while playing guard. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm going to win this, you know. I will have you guys reassigned while I'm on manor grounds.\u201d I used my best queen-sounding tone. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be followed everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He just bowed his head a little, keeping his eyes on that spot.</p><p>I stood next to him and angled my head to look at it, too, as if there was something of great interest there. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI see what you mean. Fascinating patch of paint, isn't it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. Mock me,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cWon't change the fact that you can't walk anywhere, talk to anyone or so much as look at a painting in this manor without my knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>I curled my lip up, my head wobbling side to side as I repeated his sentence in a very mocking tone.</p><p>He just smirked, unperturbed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, there\u2019ll be two less of you for a few weeks soon. Mike told me you decided to send Pure Createds to Elysium to spy on Drake.\u201d</p><p>Falcon nodded once.</p><p>\u201cIs...you know who going?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, and I knew he could tell from my eyes that I was asking about David. \u201cNo. We can't risk him being discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre...\u201d I hesitated. I didn't really want this answer. \u201cAre you and Mike going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Quaid and Ryder are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy them? Why not ordinary Created Lilithians?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMike wants a quick, clean mission. Quaid and Ryder are highly trained for this kind of operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like, from when they were human?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm glad you\u2019re not going.\u201d I leaned on the wall beside him again. \u201cYou\u2019re the biggest pain in the arse when it comes to guard evasion, but...I kinda feel safer with you around.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, moistening his tight lips.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d I skipped off. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>He gave one last nod as I closed my bedroom door to a bad-guy-free room.</p><p>The sweet, spicy scent of butter chicken wafted away as a plate of custard and apple pie took its place. I closed my eyes and drew a deep breath. Down the line of vampires at the dining table, most meals went back to the kitchen untouched. But I knew Chef wasn't insulted, he was used to it. They only really ate if it was something sweet or salty. Arthur and Nathan ate on most days, but Eric was more of a drinker than an eater. Half the pitchers resting between the soft glow of candles were filled with wine, and the other half with blood. David never drank blood that way, well, not in front of me anyway, but I\u2019d recently learned it was quite pleasurable for vampires to enjoy it as a beverage with a meal. It made me wonder why they couldn\u2019t just do that instead of killing. And when I piped up to ask that question, was quickly shot down with several arguments.</p><p>Now, I had taken the role of the quiet, eloquent queen, who only spoke when she had something of real value to say. Which worked well for me, because it actually made me seem more intelligent when I just nodded in agreement to whoever was getting the most positive reaction from their statements at the time. I\u2019d finally figured this queen thing out.</p><p>\u201cSo, when do you plan to send the knights to the castle?\u201d Nathan asked, projecting his voice down the table to Mike.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still debating over who\u2019s going,\u201d Blade said.</p><p>Mike pinched his lips, drawing his hand away after. \u201cBlade. The decision is final. I won't argue this with you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was under the assumption the queen\u2019s Private Guard were employed to protect only her,\u201d Margret said, emphasising enough words to make that sound patronizing. \u201cNot go on recon missions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur reasons for sending the guard are private,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cAll we\u2019re saying, young man, is that you should give more value to what our associate here said about Drake seeking to kidnap a Pure Created and drain it.\u201d Walter motioned to the vampire side of the table.</p><p>Arthur looked up from his dinner as though he\u2019d been dragged into a conversation he didn't want to be a part of. \u201cIt is not for us to decide, Walt,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether I am right or not is irrelevant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is more than relevant, Arthur,\u201d Walter said. \u201cImmunity could mean a war that tips in Drake\u2019s favour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we need to work harder to find other ways to kill vampires,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf The Department for Vampiric Research has not been successful in that venture after all these centuries, what makes you think we will find a way within a month?\u201d a man said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my electric power thing?\u201d I held my hand up. \u201cCan't we look into that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need, Ara,\u201d Mike cut in, pushing my hand down. \u201cDrake is not out to kidnap a Pure Created, nor will he actually catch one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do they leave?\u201d Nathan asked.</p><p>\u201cIn a few days. I'm waiting on word from an informant of mine\u2014\u201d Mike meant David, \u201c\u2014to let me know when Drake leaves the castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were keeping that informant away from Elysium,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Mike shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s just sweeping past, Ar. Don't worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this informant you trust so much?\u201d Walter asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not privy to that information.\u201d Mike went back to eating his dessert, ignoring the insult his little remark caused.</p><p>\u201cAnd what then?\u201d Nathan asked, sitting forward. \u201cOnce the knights return\u2014what are you doing about Drake?\u201d</p><p>Mike sighed, dropping his fork with a bit too much agitation. \u201cWe may still attack\u2014we may not. It depends what the knights find. Why so many questions, mate?\u201d</p><p>Nathan shrugged, looking down. \u201cJust curious. Kinda worried we might have a battle or something. I mean, I like war movies and stuff, but I never wanna be in one.\u201d</p><p>Mike eased off then, laughing to himself. \u201cYou\u2019ll be right, mate. We won't bring a battle to Loslilian.\u201d</p><p>Nathan nodded, seemingly satisfied with that, and went back to eating.</p><p>I brushed my fork along my plate and scooped up a heap of apple pie, smothered in sweet vanilla custard, then popped it in my mouth, smoothing the fork past my lips really slowly. It tasted divine\u2014like forbidden fruit with the creamy sap of the world\u2019s truth. That chef was a culinary master. I could even taste the cinnamon infused in the apple. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d he said with his mouth full.</p><p>\u201cCan I go down and meet the chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse. Why?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cJust wanted to tell him how good his food is.\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed. \u201cHe\u2019d love that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll go see him after dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But the staff usually go down to the ground floor once they\u2019re done for the day. You\u2019ll need Quaid to show you down\u2014he\u2019s on duty tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need him to show me which one is Chef, too. It\u2019s pretty bad if I have to ask my own staff who cooks all our food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the big black guy\u2014the rest of them are white.\u201d Mike chuckled. \u201cYou can't miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Cool. And...thanks, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you thanking me?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder. \u201cFor letting me go down there, I guess. You usually say no to everything I wanna do.\u201d</p><p>He bumped my knee with his under the table. \u201cI'm fine with anything you want, if you\u2019re fine with taking a knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not an Arthur Knight.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha. Funny.\u201d</p><p>I smiled into my plate. I thought it was funny.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Quaid guided me back to the grand staircase and stepped back into guard mode once I knew my way around. I spotted Mike heading up to the east wing and darted after him, grabbing his sleeve. \u201cHey, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChef said we got popcorn in the pantry. You wanna watch a movie or something tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, baby, I can't. I got a thing with the boys.\u201d He pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, as if the knights were standing there, which they weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I could cancel\u2014if, you know, if you\u2019re feeling really lonely or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201d I smiled, waving a hand. \u201cI'm actually pretty tired anyway. I might just get an early night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said softly as I walked away, holding my breath.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right, my lady?\u201d Arthur\u2019s smiling face met mine at the base of the stairs, his eyes warm, as if he\u2019d smelled me coming around the corner from a mile away.</p><p>\u201cI'm okay,\u201d I said, but knew it wasn\u2019t convincing. I crossed my arms and walked past him. \u201cG\u2019night, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just headed down to the kitchen,\u201d his suggestive tone rose an octave. \u201cI hear they have popcorn in the pantry. Would you like to watch a film with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking, smiling to myself before turning around. \u201cDid you just hear me talking to Mike?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, looking at his feet, his blue eyes sparkling under those thick lashes. \u201cMaybe. But I was planning to watch something anyway. I\u2019d like the company.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cYeah. Okay. I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand, and I took it, instantly feeling better\u2014a little less...lonely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to himself as we wandered slowly down the stairs. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And it was pleasant. Turns out he and I like all the same movies, too. I even quizzed him a few times just to see if he was lying. But he passed every time.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you say you liked Kate and Leopold. Why?\u201d I said, while Arthur, sitting beside me, scrolled through the files on his iPad.</p><p>\u201cLeopold reminds me of myself, I guess, in many ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kate?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the screen resting on his knee. \u201cI like her boisterous personality. She\u2019s not like other girls and, as hideous an attribute as that can be, it is also incredibly charming.\u201d</p><p>I settled back on his pillow and dusted some popcorn and salt off my shirt. \u201cSo, what are we watching next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew one. Not even released in cinemas yet.\u201d</p><p>I sat up a little when he tilted the screen to show me. \u201cOh, my God. You film pirate.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cActually, this was given to me by the producer himself. We\u2019re good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d I sat back. \u201cDoes he know you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMet at a convention.\u201d He shrugged, closing the case on his iPad after pressing play; the movie stared on the LCD at the foot of his bed, and a tickle of excitement charged my skin. I\u2019d actually been waiting for this movie to come out for two years.</p><p>\u201cThis is really cool, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>I hooked my arm around his and rested my head on his bony shoulder. \u201cThis\u2014the movie, the big screen\u2014even that thing you play the movie through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApple TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s really cool.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I can get a TV in my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear\u2014\u201d He kissed the top of my head and covered my shoulder with his blanket. \u201cI'm sure you can have whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven a piano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, especially that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>By the time the credits rolled on the third film of the night, I was so sleepy I didn't even bother to walk down the hall to my own bed. I snuggled up safely next to my good friend, and he leaned down, rolled my shoes off my feet, tucked me up tightly and switched out the lamp. The next thing I felt was cool lips on my brow, then the absence of Arthur\u2019s energy as I let myself slip away.</p><p>At some ungodly hour, the sound of snoring pulled me from restful slumber. I sat up, rolled the thick blankets back and hopped out of bed. Arthur was miles away in dreamland, his head cocked awkwardly to one side, a thin blanket pulled up to his chin, and his feet propped on a stool across from the armchair he was sleeping in.</p><p>I sighed, brushed his thick dark hair back and kissed his head, then grabbed my shoes and left, closing the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Quaid,\u201d I said, when he stood from his lean on the wall and started down the hall after me.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Queen Ara. Sleep well?\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at him. \u201cWhy are you laughing at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't sleep with him, if that\u2019s why you\u2019re implying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His dark face was almost red with humour. \u201cOnly that Mike\u2019s gonna spit chips when he finds out.\u201d</p><p>I huffed, stopping in the middle of the corridor. \u201cDon't tell him. Simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop disappearing on me, and I won't tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d I took off walking again. \u201cYou\u2019re too easy to get away from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but, I get in trouble when I lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get better at not losing me.\u201d I smirked, slamming my bedroom door on him.</p><p>The morning crept along the treetops outside my window, but in here, it was still quite dark and peaceful. I slipped into bed and snuggled down into my soft mattress, hugged warmly by the weight of my quilt, which, for some reason smelled like David. And just like Arthur\u2019s grandfather clock, the one on the wall across my room ticked, a steady beat to ensure time was passing, but as I slipped beyond the realm of wake, it slowed down and I felt kind of weightless, hooking my hand under my pillow to stay grounded.</p><p>Jason stared back at me from a memory; his green eyes so full of life, so vibrant and bright, as if his soul held all the purity in the world. \u201cI miss you, Jase,\u201d I whispered, but my breath came back in my own face, thick with the putrid scent of beef or rotting flesh. \u201cEw!\u201d I looked up, and Jason\u2019s green eyes became the cool blue gaze of my marshmallow pal, sitting by my bed, his inquisitive stare probing me to wake. \u201cWhat, Petey?\u201d I sat up a bit, rubbing my face. \u201cIt\u2019s early, boy. What\u2019d ya want?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to the floor and came back up with something delicate and silver in his mouth. I reached out and touched his head; his fur was cold and a little moist with dew.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What ya got?\u201d I said in my best get-excited-we\u2019re-going-walkies voice.</p><p>Petey nuzzled my hand, making me open it, then released the slimy silver string into my palm, and my eyes grew inside my head, becoming wider to take in what I only thought I saw. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>He didn't answer.</p><p>I looked back at my hand and gently flipped the trinket over, sure only once I saw an inscription in French that this was my locket. My heart. The silver representation of my attachment to David.</p><p>\u201cPetey,\u201d I said with a little more urgency. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>He got to his feet, as if someone had just grabbed his lead, and wagged his tail, making his whole body sway with the movement. I threw my covers back and stood up, drying the locket on my leg. There was no way he could have found this here at Loslilian\u2014unless Arthur had it. Maybe Jason gave it to him to give back to me. Maybe Petey found it and knew it was mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Petey\u2019s sudden excitement and the fact that he bolted out my balcony door and stood on his hind legs, paws on the railing, whimpering and licking his chops, filled me with a tiny bubble of hope.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s out there, boy?\u201d I looked across the treetops to the grassy field. \u201cIs it him? Is he here?\u201d</p><p>He barked, dropping his paws to the ground, then ran to my bedroom door.</p> <p>I pocketed the locket and followed him, hesitant but shaking with excitement.</p><p>My fingers wrapped the handle slowly. There was no way Jason could be alive. No way. I saw him die. I watched him fade. I...I threw dirt on his face.</p><p>The handle grated in the turn, and I became ultra aware of each breath, rolling the door slowly toward me, closing my eyes for fear I\u2019d see nothing there.</p><p>\u201cRolf!\u201d Petey brushed past my leg, knocking me into the doorframe, and ran down the hall\u2014disappearing around the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cPetey? Wait.\u201d</p> <p>He didn't wait.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Quaid asked.</p><p>\u201cUr, yeah.\u201d I blinked a few times, discreetly checking every square inch of the corridor. \u201cWas...did you see anyone out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No reason.\u201d</p><p>He looked to where Petey had run. \u201cThat dog\u2019s mad, Ara. He probably just ran off \u2018cause he needed some private time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Probably.\u201d I shut the door and leaned against it, my heart thumping in my throat, then reached into my pocket and pulled out the locket. I never thought I\u2019d see it again. A part of me never wanted to see it again. I guess I hoped Jason had taken it to his grave with him\u2014forever to hold a part of my heart.</p><p>Huffing silently, I looked down at my bare feet and jeans, then flattened my hair with my hands a little. I needed to follow Petey, which meant I needed to give Quaid the slip.</p><p>I opened my door again. \u201cQuaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do me a huge favour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, maybe...\u201d He stood taller, looking around. \u201cI am on duty, so, I can't leave my post. But what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I screwed my face up as if this was awkward for me. \u201cI kinda just got that girlie time of the month.\u201d</p><p>Quaid went totally stiff, wide eyes and all. \u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, um, and...I don't have any tampons.\u201d Ha! An embarrassed man. I love it. \u201cCould you maybe go down to the Medic room and get me some?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shifted to the end of the corridor then back to his feet, anywhere but my face. \u201cI...you know I'm not s\u2019posed to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay right here. I swear. In fact, I\u2019ll be in the shower\u2014\u201d I looked down, keeping half my body hidden behind the door. \u201cI can't go anywhere while I have blood dripping down my legs.\u201d</p><p>And that was enough for Quaid. I\u2019d never seen black skin go so white. He turned stiffly away, taking wide steps down the corridor.</p><p>I ran back to my bathroom, twisted the shower taps on and locked the door, closing it behind me, then left a note telling Quaid to leave the tampons on my dresser.</p><p>Petey appeared in my doorway, his head angled like a curious puppy.</p><p>\u201cDon't judge, Petey. You\u2019d have done the same.\u201d</p><p>He gave a high-pitched groan and turned away, his tail knocking my door into the wall, as if to open it further\u2014inviting me along. And without a second more thought, I grabbed my cardigan and followed him. Hopefully, Quaid wouldn\u2019t call through the bathroom wall to ask if I was all right. If I knew Quaid like I thought I did, he wouldn't. He\u2019d be too afraid my answer might be descriptive.</p><p>Petey trotted down the quiet, empty corridors, and I scaled along behind him, keeping close to the wall, making up excuses in my head as to why I might be wandering around at this hour, should anyone catch me. But I owned the breath of relief I took when we reached the Great Hall and tiptoed over the shiny wood floors, past the partially-set breakfast table and into the garden, unnoticed.</p><p>Staff were busy all around the manor; the gardener was trimming roses, the maids were obviously dressing in their rooms on the ground floor and there were several people at the far end of the manor, carrying boxes, walking up and down the stone steps leading to the kitchen. Breakfast wafted out through that door with the homely warmth of bacon and stewed apples. My stomach groaned, but my heart jumped with anticipation as I followed my furry friend through the dirt path between the trees of the forest and came upon the field.</p><p>It was empty. I squinted against the morning sun to see the tree, and though the base was darkened by dawn\u2019s shadow still, I was sure no one was sitting there. Petey, however, was not convinced. He charged forward, and I followed, glad I hadn\u2019t been sucked into the enchanted forest. The sun was probably high enough now to class this as morning, not dawn. Either that or the forest saw me as a welcome wanderer, given that I was One with Mother Nature now.</p><p>\u201cPetey?\u201d I called. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><p>He was fast, the little bugger, and in my weakened state, still recovering from the headaches, I\u2019d lost some of my ability to run. I came up on the tree, huffing and puffing, and folded over to grasp my knees.</p><p>\u201cOutrun by a dog?\u201d a humoured voice said.</p><p>My mouth popped open and I rolled incredibly slow to stand, my eyes wrapping in tearful disbelief around dark hair, intense green eyes and a smile that could melt a glacier. \u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh.\u201d He flashed a grin.</p><p>He looked so sassy and so boyish, leaning against the tree in a pinstripe jersey and a blue Yankees cap. I didn't know he was a Yankees fan.</p><p>\u201cWhat surprises you more?\u201d he said, holding his shirt out from his chest a little. \u201cThat I'm alive, or that I'm a Yankees fan?\u201d</p><p>My shaking hand rose slowly to cover to my lips. \u201cWhat are you...how are you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d He rushed in, scooping me into his arms before my buckling knees sent me to the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I cried into his collar, cupping my hand around his neck, running my thumb over his hair at the back just to see if he was real. \u201cYou\u2019re dead. I watched you die.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me a little tighter. \u201cI know. I'm sorry you had to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I...\u201d He smelled so normal, like a human; no orange chocolate, just powdery fabric softener and a light hint of some spicy cologne, and it was the most darling scent in the world. My human version of David. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, his voice vibrating through his throat against my brow. \u201cI got a very heartbreaking call from a strange number.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed a little harder.</p><p>He laughed and continued. \u201cAnd, I mean, what could I say to that? I shouldn\u2019t be here, and quite frankly, my uncle will probably give me a beating for this.\u201d He half laughed. \u201cBut I needed to be with you. That phone call just cemented it.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my face upward to look into his radiant, shining green eyes. \u201cI thought I\u2019d get voicemail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I heard, and I also heard the pain in your soul through only the whisper of your voice.\u201d His eyes seemed distant then, like he was remembering something\u2014something that hurt really badly. \u201cI know my being here stuffs up everyone\u2019s plans, but I couldn't leave you alone any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been? What...how are you alive?\u201d</p><p>He smiled\u2014his secret smile. \u201cI was never dead, Ara. I had to fake my death so Drake couldn\u2019t order me to hurt you again. Now that you\u2019re queen, only you can do that, and even then...\u201d He shook his head, smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cSo...but, the venom?\u201d I looked at his chest, where the syringe had gone in.</p><p>\u201cCreated venom.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>My world rocked back\u2014everything going blurry and ultimately still. \u201cHoly crap!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDamn needle broke off in my chest, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tapped it. \u201cDo you have any idea how hard it was to get that thing out by myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you...\u201d I pictured the way he was laying; the way breath left his body and he stilled, as though he had no life left, and the way I said goodbye, accused him of being the worst kind of monster. In fact, I'm pretty sure I may have even condemned him to Hell. But it was all kind of fuzzy. \u201cCould you hear what was said once you...fainted?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and held it softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara. I tortured you, beat you, made you cry\u2014\u201d His voice quivered. \u201cAnything you said or did to me after that was fair.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, it wasn't. You helped me. You...you saved me from so much worse.\u201d</p><p>He stroked my chin with his thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s all over now, sweet girl. Nothing like that will ever happen to you again.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, cupping my hand over his against my cheek. \u201cDoes Arthur know you\u2019re alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open, dry, my lips numb.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t tell you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one...\u201d He let out a breath. \u201cI've not even shown you a quarter of the things I'm capable of. Drake knows many of my powers, many of which could have, all this time, helped him get to you. If I was alive, he would\u2019ve compelled me to grab you.\u201d He looked over his shoulder, motioning to the field. \u201cLook how easy it was for me to get in here. No one has a clue. I could\u2019ve come here many times, and no one would\u2019ve known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? Come here, I mean.\u201d I wiped my nose with the back of my wrist.</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cNo, sweet girl. I wanted to, but that would, and I guess has, ruined Arthur\u2019s diabolical plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always has a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he asked you to have a child with him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I blinked a few extra times. \u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, shaking his head, and wandered over to our tree. \u201cHow did you react to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know he was going to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s one of the reasons he\u2019s here.\u201d He slid down the bark and sat in the long grass, still kind of laughing.</p><p>\u201cTo have a baby with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that just because he wants to be free\u2014you know, \u2018cause he wants the prophecy to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of my conclusions, but...I suppose he never told you he was sent here by Drake, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He left that bit out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I wonder why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? Was he really sent here on a mission to impregnate me?\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cFor one, yes. But also to find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dagger of Yahanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath? Yahanna means death, in the ancient language, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019ve been studying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sat down beside him. \u201cI just know a few words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, he\u2019s after this dagger\u2014forged from the bone of an original and spelled on the Stone of Truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Drake want it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to kill your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he kills this child created of two immortals, all the power the child is born with will negotiate to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, so, he asked Arthur to father this child, then hand it and the dagger over so he could kill it?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded, grinning.</p><p>\u201cArthur would never do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...why did he ask me to have a baby with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only conclusion is that he wants to see if this myth that a child can set vampires free of immortality is true\u2014or he wants to be king by right of heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy right of heir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your first husband is always the only true king that can rule in your absence, unless he fails to provide an heir. In that case, the father of your child would become rightful king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...what if he had a baby with me, but then that child died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he would no longer be king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So, how is your presence here ruining Arthur\u2019s plan to impregnate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, if I was alive, you would never give yourself to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr!\u201d My lip curled. \u201cAnd you just...you were just going to allow that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d He sat back, straightening his shirt. \u201cOf course not. I knew you wouldn\u2019t do it with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Ara. I know you. There's no way you\u2019d have sex with Arthur, even if David were actually dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say about David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, come on\u2014you don't seriously expect me to believe he actually died, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so...you know about immunity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why do you think I let you bite him?\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cI thought you were ordered to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrdered. Not compelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you would never have killed him?\u201d</p><p>He rose to his knees right before me, taking my cheeks in his hands. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut...I thought you hated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough to kill him, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down, feeling pretty bad about that assumption. \u201cSo, how did you figure out the immunity thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn't. It was you.\u201d He leaned in and kissed my forehead. \u201cYou, with that beautiful mind of yours.\u201d He kissed it again. \u201cYou tried to keep the thought from me, about you and David having shared blood and bitten each other, but I saw it, and it was all I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.

He said I slipped up. But I didn't,\u201d I said, sitting taller, shaking my head. \u201cI went through it, I really didn't. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDoes he know about David, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not heard any thoughts.

So, it\u2019s just David and Morg then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Emily?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Good. At least I still had one friend who was on my side.</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Jason cleared his throat, holding up two fingers and a cute grin.</p><p>\u201cDid you just read my mind?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't do that. Figure me out some other way. Stay out of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Easy. I can figure you out by watching your face.\u201d He sat back, smiling. \u201cWhat I can't figure out is why Morg and David are sticking to this prophecy child thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven't caught on?\u201d</p><p>I scratched my nose. \u201cI didn't know there was anything to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course you didn't, sweet girl, because you trust David too much for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, think about it. If the whole point of David being dead is to stop Drake coming after you, because the prophecy child must be conceived only with a firstborn son of Knight, then why do they think it\u2019s okay for Arthur to be here, and not David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid could return, and there is still the same chance of Drake attacking as there is without David. I don't know why he\u2019s pretending to be dead still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don't know. Maybe so he can follow Arthur\u2014perhaps Arthur will lead him to the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut David isn\u2019t following Arthur.\u201d Jason ushered around the grounds. \u201cSo, what are they up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s sneaking around Elysium and giving us info on Drake\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head again, the smug grin growing. \u201cNope. Wrong again. Mike has a vampire informant\u2014one who lives at Elysium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...why\u2019s David putting me through this\u2014making me live without him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure. But, whatever it is, it must be pretty serious to be keeping him from you.\u201d</p><p>I slumped back, running everything over in my head. \u201cSo, Drake wanted to kill me because of some prophecy child that could kill him, but now, all of a sudden, it\u2019s that he wants me to have this child so he can steal its powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the latest.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a second. \u201cThat doesn't really fit. He ordered me dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the council ordered you dead because Drake swore death to all Lilithians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he didn't really want me dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>The frown on my face deepened, disappearing with a sudden realisation. \u201cIs that why Drake put you in charge of my torture\u2014because he knew you wouldn't really kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He smirked. \u201cI have a funny feeling Drake may have had his own agenda this entire time\u2014perhaps one not even a high councilman like my uncle was aware of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...wow. This goes so much deeper than I thought. I can't even begin to piece it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I know. I've been trying. The only things I can deduce are that Arthur is here on Drake\u2019s request but has an agenda of his own, and I believe Drake actually thinks David's dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that, what, there\u2019s no hope of a prophecy child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. Drake wants your child. He doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about which Knight it comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But, you have to realise that, no matter who the father is, Ara, that child will be born of immortal blood. She will be very powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think he made the prophecy up\u2014just to make me have a baby that he could kidnap and kill to steal powers from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. He may have even forged prophetic parchments to throw the Lilithians off his true plan all these centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s his only plan\u2014just to kill an infant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. There could be more to it. It seems like a great length to go to just for a bit of extra power. I...\u201d He tapped his head. \u201cI keep going round in circles with it\u2014even storyboarded it and couldn\u2019t figure it out. He's a master of strategy and deception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so let\u2019s focus on the facts. One; Arthur is here for the dagger\u2014on Drake's request, but we don't think he plans to hand it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if it\u2019s true that the child can restore life to those who are immortal, then Drake would gain that power by killing your child, and it\u2019s possible that\u2019s what he offered Arthur in exchange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Arthur give up his own flesh and blood for his freedom? Does he want it that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>I went quiet. \u201cI feel really unsteady now, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know who to trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you're staying, then?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at me, gently brushing my hair back behind my ear, and I felt the closeness between us, the heat from his body alongside mine, barely two inches away. \u201cOf course I am. Not only will it be impossible for me to leave you now, but the fact that Morgaine, who\u2019s known about this dagger since the day after you were rescued, hasn\u2019t told you, indicates there are several different agendas in effect here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to help me figure it all out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to devise our own plan\u2014draw out some of the motives of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy redesigning the board at every move. We\u2019ve got to analyse first, then discuss. We\u2019ll figure things out as we go. But, to start with, I want to see what Mike knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm, yeah, I don't see him having a sit-down chat and cuppa with you, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll read his mind.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s best not to raise suspicions by asking questions, anyway. We also need to know what Morgaine is hiding, and if David\u2019s in on it or not. And we need to find that dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur probably has it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, without a doubt. But I need you to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can destroy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? What about Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to find a way to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019d be immune now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy electricity?\u201d I held my hand up and let a flash of blue spark my fingertips.</p><p>Jason grabbed it, smiling in wonder. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Have you studied the full extent of this power yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike puts me in a metal cage and makes me shoot things with it, but I get headaches when I do.\u201d</p><p>His whole face screwed up. \u201cA metal cage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just so that I don't shoot anyone unintentionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're not a goddamn Tesla Coil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He frowned, looking away. \u201cDoes Arthur know Mike\u2019s doing that to you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He didn't tell me. He didn't even tell me you had that power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Weird. I wonder why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because he knew what I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, I would have been on the first plane back here, and when I found out they were forcing you to shoot things, I\u2019d have shut Mike in a cage and made him run on a spinning wheel for ten hours, like a lab-born hamster.\u201d His voice got gradually louder. \u201cThat\u2019s just plain stupidity. I can't believe he did that. He knows nothing about science. Nothing! He could have really hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to be studying your powers, Ara, not forcing you to use them as a weapon. Those headaches could be serious. You might not be able to die that easily, but you can get brain damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I'm not sure if it would be permanent, but being in that state, even for a few months, would be horrible for you\u2014and for your people.\u201d</p><p>I twiddled my fingers in my lap. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s right, though? What if I do need to be exercising this power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll find another way\u2014a kinder way.\u201d He moved my hands apart and stole one, looking carefully at my fingertips and nails. \u201cSo, the light\u2014it just shoots up out of your skin?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closing my eyes; his tickly touch felt so soothing, kind of relaxing.</p><p>\u201cAnd how often do you get these headaches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much every time now.\u201d Except when I have sex.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s sex got to do with it?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flung open. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I read your mind. What has sex got to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um. I light up when I have sex, and I can read David's mind when I get...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned on?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling the pulse of extra heat in my cheeks.</p><p>He stared down at my hand, his eyes small with thought. \u201cThat\u2019s just...that is fascinating on so many levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but, it\u2019s also bad, because if I shoot anyone with it, like, if I accidently shoot vampires, they feel their hearts beat for a second.\u201d</p><p>He folded his fingers firmly around mine and pressed my hand to his chest. \u201cDo it to me. Shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I drew my hand back. \u201cI nearly killed Falcon when he was human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't care.\u201d He took my hand again. \u201cShoot me. I want to see what it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d I looked into his green eyes, watching the morning shadows of leaves dance across his nose and cheekbones. \u201cIf I shoot you with it, I\u2019ll have a headache for the rest of the day, and I'm really too stressed to deal with that as well right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He patted my hand, keeping it against his heart for a second, then dropped it into his lap. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll work on it another day.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes around the deep, smooth tone of his voice, feeling it melt through me; it was so different to David's\u2014softer, kinder almost, like he\u2019d never say a harsh word or speak ill of anyone else. \u201cGod, it is sooo good to hear your voice again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to touch you again.\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cAnd even sweeter that we\u2019re here, in our field, awake.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked up at our tree. \u201cIt doesn't feel that different.\u201d</p><p>He placed his thumb to my chin and tilted my face up to his, then gently and so sweetly pressed his lips to mine. I let him do it; let him stay there for the single breath we both took through our noses, before he pulled slowly away, staying right in front of my mouth. \u201cDoes that feel different?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded, tasting him on my lips. It felt warm and loving and so real. \u201cI really missed you, Jase. There's so much I've wanted to say\u2014so many things I wanted to tell you. I just...\u201d I cast my teary gaze to the wide field of grass, moving and dancing in the breeze, hiding the fluffy white dog chasing crows in the distance. \u201cThe thought of you being gone forever, I...now that you're here, alive, I'm sure I'm going to have nightmares about losing you again.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face and turned it to his. \u201cI will never, ever leave you again. Not for anything. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, placing his hand over my heart. \u201cThank you for coming back to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would only have been a matter of time before I came back.\u201d He looked at his hand, then slid it up to my shoulder and, in one move, swept me into him, spine to chest between his legs, his arms wrapped tightly around my ribs. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And you have no idea what those words mean to me.\u201d He leaned in, pressing his cheek firmly against mine, and I could almost feel that his eyes were closed, holding in everything that wanted to burst out from his soul. And I held my breath, trapping all the chaotic emotions inside; the desire to cry, to laugh, to jump up and down and to hold onto him tighter than I\u2019d ever held anything before. All the things I wanted to say, all the regrets I had after losing him, none of them mattered now, because I got that second chance. And I wouldn\u2019t waste it. I wouldn\u2019t ever let him go again. I would use this chance to make his life right\u2014to see that he found happiness, even though that happiness couldn't be with me.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I rubbed his forearm. \u201cYou have to understand that what you're doing right now isn't right, though\u2014holding me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He ran his nose down the side of my face, breathing me in.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I'm married.\u201d I laughed, working up the strength to believe my next words. \u201cAnd, I mean, I know how things were before\u2014in our dreams, but that was all due to the bind. That\u2019s passed now. I don't love you that way anymore.\u201d</p><p>He released me a little. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, besides\u2014\u201d I turned around to look at him. \u201cYour feelings for me aren\u2019t real, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I ignored that sarcastic grin of his. \u201cSee, there\u2019s this curse\u2014the Curse of Seduction, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou've got to be kidding me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s said to be passed down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, I can't believe you actually think my feelings are because of the curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they're not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra\u2014\u201d He grabbed my hand and placed it on his chest. \u201cTell me what you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, a chest.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled once. \u201cPrecisely. No heartbeat, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curse only works on those with a heartbeat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Morgaine told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right, I see now.\u201d He sat back against the tree trunk, shaking his head. \u201cAra, that girl knows nothing. She is beginning to really piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...she\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she is wrong on so many levels it\u2019s not even funny.\u201d He leaned forward, his elbows over his knees as I moved to sit beside him again. \u201cTake the prophecy, for example; she\u2019s got the whole nation convinced this child\u2019s gonna come in and cure vampires of immortality. She hasn\u2019t checked her facts, and no one seems to care that she's misinterpreted the scrolls or that they, themselves, haven\u2019t actually seen them. I\u2019ve seen them, so I know it\u2019s not all based on some bogus lie, but I don't interpret them the way she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how do you interpret them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. I read them a long time ago when I was at college\u2014studying Lilithian History as a minor subject\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey study that at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot human school. Vampires have, well, had universities as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So, you don't remember what the scrolls said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had any real reason to commit them to memory, and all my assignments were tossed out decades ago. But I don't remember there being anything about a child that could cure vampires, or I\u2019d have been hunting it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is that why no one else knew there was a prophecy until now\u2014because there isn't one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, the scrolls are there\u2014for all to see. She's just the only one who would\u2019ve interpreted them to be a prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it might not be?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his forehead. \u201cI don't know. The page she\u2019s talking about\u2014the one that mentions blood of Knight\u2014was hidden. In truth, I came across it by accident, so, there is a possibility that it\u2019s a prophecy. I\u2019d need to take a look at it again to make any real conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the library, apparently. Maybe we can go down there once you're settled in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already planned to,\u201d he said. \u201cThis prophecy thing has had me going around in circles. I've tried to believe Morgaine\u2019s side of the story, but it doesn't really fit. I mean, there's no way Drake would leave a scroll, prophesising the coming of a pure blood that could end him, in the library. Locked up or not. No way. He\u2019d have destroyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think it\u2019s there because he wanted it to be found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...the curse...Lilith\u2019s curse...?\u201d</p><p>He took my hand. \u201cI will show you that book. Morgaine interprets things as she wants them to sound. She\u2019s...I'm sorry, it\u2019s not nice to say, but she\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOkay, come on. Let\u2019s go up to the manor. I want to find her and get to the bottom of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, I think you and I should go about this slowly.\u201d We both stood up. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they kept the dagger from you. I don't think we should go in there unprepared. We need to play dumb for now\u2014do some digging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather go in there and strangle them all.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed, scratching Petey\u2019s head as he came up beside us\u2014all puffed out. \u201cWe can do that if you want, but, like I said, it seems everyone here has a different agenda. If we let them know we\u2019re smarter than we look, they might be more careful around us\u2014possibly cover it up with another lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderdogs?\u201d I looked at Petey; his ears pinned back as he cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jason said. \u201cTeam Underdog. You and me. We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d He hooked his fingertip under my chin and rolled my face upward. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014\u201d I turned my body away but kept my arm around his waist. \u201cWhat will we tell people about why you\u2019re back?\u201d</p><p>He spun his baseball cap forward and hugged me closer. \u201cTell them I was returning your heart.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Jason stayed by the wall, while I crept up the sandstone steps to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s in there,\u201d he whispered loudly.</p><p>\u201cShe always has coffee with Mike at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d his voice dipped on the \u2018e\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Shh.\u201d I scowled at him, repairing it with a smile before peeking over the lower half of the split door. Sure enough, there was Morg and Mike, sitting face to face, chatting quietly in the calm of the country-style kitchen. If they were wearing old-fashioned clothes, they\u2019d look like they were on set of a photo-shoot for \u2018History Magazine\u2019. I stood on my toes and reached a hand up, waving it a little.</p><p>Morg laughed at Mike, shaking her head, then said something that made him laugh, too.</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d I whispered, trying to make it loud enough for her to hear, but not the vampire directly across from her. She didn't hear it. \u201cPsst,\u201d I said louder and ducked down.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cHiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up. You can't psst someone then hide from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d I stood a little taller and peeked over the door again. \u201cPsst.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine frowned then looked around, as if she wasn\u2019t sure she heard that. I waved my hand and quickly pressed my finger to my lip when she opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll take that,\u201d she said to Mike and took his cup, then wandered over to the sink just near the door.</p><p>I squatted down when Mike stood, his chair scraping loudly against the stone floor.</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019ll see you up there,\u201d Morgaine said\u2014not to me.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I gotta go see Quaid before his shift change.\u201d</p><p>Gulp. Crap, Quaid was about to be caught out with a missing queen.</p><p>A head popped over the door and Morgaine\u2019s piercing gaze made me shudder as I stood up and stepped back. \u201cWhat are you doing, Amara?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders came up; I nodded down the steps to Jason, hiding flat against the wall.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Her hand flew over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I grabbed her and we hustled down the stairs to stand with Jason, concealed from the gardens by the steps.</p><p>\u201cAra! Are you crazy?\u201d She grabbed my arm and pulled me away from Jason. \u201cHow is he magically alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not magically alive\u2014\u201d Jason placed his hand between us and gently pushed Morgaine aside. \u201cI was never dead to begin with. I staged my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaged? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the oath, Morgaine,\u201d he said, like it was obvious. \u201cDrake compelled me to hurt Ara. I wasn't free of that until she was crowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you've been alive? All this time. Just waiting to come back here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jason practically yelled. \u201cDon't think like that and don't say it!\u201d</p><p>Morgaine shrunk, folding her arms. \u201cSorry. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I cut in. \u201cWhat did she think?\u201d</p><p>Jason huffed and leaned on the wall, his head angled to the sky.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, both of them ignoring my question. \u201cSo why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d He sounded a bit defeated.</p><p>\u201cDoes Arthur know you\u2019re not dead?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes...\u201d</p><p>Jason looked up and smiled, dropping the foot he had propped under him. \u201cMorg, I know he\u2019s alive. I knew about immunity all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>Both Jason and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoes...anyone else know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Drake?\u201d he said, his brows high. \u201cYeah, he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he knows? I mean, how can you be sure, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still alive\u2014that\u2019s how. I was the one who gave that Warrior the venom-tipped sword, Morgaine. Drake should be dead. He either knows about immunity or is indestructible.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou choose which one to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She rubbed her brow. \u201cSo...you\u2019re here to stay, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d both Jason and I said together.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She smiled\u2014it was forced, though.</p><p>I looked carefully at Jason, knowing only too well that he was reading her mind and she was doing her best to think of other things.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Morgaine laughed, scaring me a little with the sudden noise. \u201cMike\u2019s going to flip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I spoke quieter. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came to you. Can you tell him for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Mike what?\u201d Mike asked, leaning over the bottom half of the door.</p><p>\u201cThat I'm alive,\u201d Jason said, stepping into Mike\u2019s view.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Mike jumped down from the top step, landing gracefully on the ground between Jason and I, as though Jason was some kind of threat.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cHe\u2019s not here to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't care.\u201d He pushed me aside and grabbed Jason by the shirt. \u201cI get a second chance at killing you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Mike,\u201d Jason said calmly. \u201cI don't want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d Mike laughed and slammed Jason into the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll rip your damn arms off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You give me no choice.\u201d Jason sighed then looked at me. \u201cI'm sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor wha\u2014\u201d My words slipped away as Mike\u2019s grip loosened and he dropped to his knees, folding forward into an unconscious heap at Jason\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Morgaine screeched, squatting beside Mike.</p><p>Jason just smiled, dusted off his shirt and stepped over Mike. \u201cI put him to sleep\u2014a deep sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d I knelt beside Morg.</p><p>\u201cWell, what did you expect? He wasn't willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped with a breath. \u201cMorg, go find Jason a room and get him settled in, please. I\u2019ll deal with Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure thing, Your Majesty. Um\u2014\u201d She stood up and looked back at Mike. \u201cWhen will he wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Jason winked at me and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Mike groaned, rubbing his head. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason taught you a lesson in humility. You should have been more civil.\u201d I helped him to his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCivil?

That guy is the reason for all of this. If he\u2019d never turned you over, we\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d never have known what I was, Mike. Or maybe we would, who cares. That\u2019s not the point. He only did that because he was compelled to. Otherwise he\u2019d have taken me away and looked after me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? Mike, you made a blood oath. You know that what happened to me was out of Jason\u2019s control. If my husband can forgive him, then you should, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood oath,\u201d he scoffed, folding his arms. \u201cNo excuse.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms, too, smiling ruefully. \u201cHey, Mike?\u201d He looked up at me, and I summoned my most authoritative voice. \u201cPunch yourself in the face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he said as his fist flew up to his jaw, sending him tumbling backward.</p><p>\u201cBlood oath, huh?\u201d I walked away with my arms folded. \u201cNo excuse.\u201d</p><p>When I reached my bedroom door, Quaid looked up from his phone and frowned. \u201cHow did you get out of your room?\u201d he said.</p><p>I pushed past him. \u201cDo yourself a favour, Quaid. If Mike asks, you followed me this morning and I talked with Jason in the field, okay?\u201d</p><p>His mouth popped open but I shut the door on him, sliding down it to the floor. The taps were still running in the bathroom, giving me a sudden pang of guilt for the water I would\u2019ve wasted. I got myself up and headed in there to turn them off, but opted for a shower instead, and came out feeling almost human again. But the soft hum of Arthur\u2019s violin flowed off the early morning breeze and came in through my window. And instead of feeling joy and radiance like I usually did with that sound, I felt only blind rage. He lied to me. He watched me cry over Jason. He held me while I grieved a person who wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>I stormed out of my room and down the corridor, with Quaid wandering behind in the cloud of my infuriation.</p> <p>\u201cQuaid. Unless you want me to tell Mike you weren\u2019t there when I chatted with his arch enemy this morning, I suggest you stay here.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking. \u201cI can't. I have to follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don't.\u201d I pointed at him, stopping long enough to make my words as clear as the goddamn day. \u201cI will compel you to stay put if you follow me. And I won't order you to move for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cTo see Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not in his room.\u201d</p><p>I stopped by Arthur\u2019s door. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat Hall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, and his round eyes watched me as I turned away. I felt mean, but he couldn't know the subject matter I was headed to argue with Arthur. No one could.</p><p>Arthur spun around as I approached at a very fast, human pace, and his eyes lit with surprise at the obvious anger in mine. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I practically yelled, not really meaning to.</p><p>\u201cAmara? What is it?\u201d He placed his violin on the stand and reached for me.</p><p>I shoved him away, forcing my palms into his chest; he didn't even stumble back, just grabbed my thrashing arms and held them.</p><p>\u201cAra, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d I shoved him again. \u201cYou lied to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl.\u201d He cradled me against him as my knees went weak. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me he was dead. You told me you buried him!\u201d</p><p>His chest sunk. \u201cJason came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sat there\u2014\u201d I stepped away and looked up at him. \u201cYou listened to me grieve for him\u2014confused about grieving for him, and you didn't tell me.\u201d</p><p>He took both my hands in his again. \u201cI'm sorry, Amara, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed him.\u201d I pulled my hands free, feeling hollowed out, breathless and so betrayed. \u201cWhy would you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you think I wouldn\u2019t have one with you if he was here?\u201d I asked rhetorically, pointing off to the stairs. \u201cArthur, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he were here or not. I won't do that. I won't have one with you. What makes you think I would ever let you touch me that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I want to! Do you think I want to betray my nephew, who I loved, by fornicating with his wife!\u201d He turned away, brushing a hand across his brow. \u201cThe child of the prophecy is only that if she is your firstborn. And those scriptures, whether you believe it or not, Ara, say it must be conceived with a firstborn son of Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter to you so much\u2014so much that you\u2019d be willing to watch me hurt like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be free. I told you this.\u201d</p><p>I looked away from his wrists; from the way he presented the clear veins as if they were shackles. \u201cAnd you think you're the only one who can give me that child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, you know how I feel about you.\u201d He moved in and grabbed the tops of my arms. \u201cYou are one of my dearest friends, and if Jason could father the child, I\u2019d have brought him here already. He loves you, and you two, in David's absence, should be together. But your child needs to be with me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, sniffling, inching away from him. \u201cArthur. I can't. I can't ever do that with you. I don't love you that way and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not asking you to love me, Amara\u2014merely...\u201d He looked away, shaking his head. \u201cMerely give me one night with you.\u201d</p><p>My lips went tight. \u201cIt would make me sick.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders dropped; he looked away.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Arthur, you know I love you.\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cYou know I do, but I can't be with you that way. I never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all hope is lost.\u201d</p><p>I took another step back, nodding to the ground. \u201cThen I guess it is.\u201d</p><p>Arthur, with a hand to his heart, bowed and walked past me at human pace; his shoulders stiff, his head held high.</p><p>\u201cI'm so sorry, Arthur,\u201d I whispered to myself.</p><p>Morgaine came up the steps outside then and practically skipped into the Great Hall. \u201cMorg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hey, what\u2019s up?\u201d she said, stopping beside me, the smell of summer grass and sunshine gently wafting off her skin with each pulse of her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you put Jason?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders dropped. \u201cI'm not telling. Mike doesn\u2019t want you near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg. I don't care.\u201d I angled my head to the ground, the sound of impatience festering in my tone. \u201cMike is not the queen. I am. Now, where is Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the west wing,\u201d she huffed the words out.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Second floor, I imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She followed me as I headed up the stairs. \u201cMike tried to put him in the east wing\u2014as far away from you as he could get, but we\u2019ve run out of rooms. Jason got the last one in the entire manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat number\u2019s his room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the one at the very end\u2014no number on the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said and walked a little faster\u2014my silent indication for her not to follow. She dropped back, obviously \u2018sensing\u2019 it, and by the time I stepped onto the landing of the second floor, she was completely gone. The only other people around were Ryder, quietly taking over from Quaid\u2019s shift, a maid cleaning the windows with lemon-scented Windex, and Nathan, charging toward me at full human speed.</p><p>He nearly bowled me over, glancing back as he passed. \u201cAra! D\u2019you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s alive,\u201d he called over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smiled to myself. \u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>I followed Nathan down the softly-lit corridor, him running, me walking gracefully, all the way to the room at the very end, and stopped beside him with my arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said, then rapped on the door four or five times. When it opened, he laughed, charging Jason. \u201cKnight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate!\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of back patting and jumping around, before the boys stood back from each other, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, man?\u201d Nathan said. \u201cAre you a zombie or something\u2014coming back from the dead?\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed, slipping his shirt over his head, pulling it down past his golden abs. \u201cI'm not back from the dead, Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so what\u2019s the deal? Why\u2019d you stage your death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing was after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude. Not cool. Wah\u2019d ya do?\u201d</p><p>Jason looked at me and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got some mad skills and a blood oath issue that would\u2019ve made me his super slave if he knew I was alive.\u201d</p><p>Nathan rocked back, running a hand over his shaved head. \u201cWell, I'm glad you\u2019re alive. How ya been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, okay, I suppose.\u201d I could tell it was a lie.</p><p>\u201cSo, your bro wouldn\u2019t happen to be alive, too, would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, man. He\u2019s six feet under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss him.\u201d Nathan wandered over and sat himself down on Jason\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cWe all miss him,\u201d I said and stood with my arms folded, leaning on the wall by the open door. This room was exactly the same as Arthur\u2019s, but smaller, with only one window. I could see why it was the last room left.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just...I haven't seen him since he dug me up,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI never really got to thank him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDug you up?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Nathan looked back at me then at Jason.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you mean, Nathe?\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cThis is spoken under the brotherhood code, right?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded, sitting next to Nathan; he had a real human look to him when he smirked that way, as if he already knew what Nathan was going to say. \u201cYeah. No probs, Nathe. Ara won't say anything, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay. Well, I got sick, right\u2014doc told me I had cancer. \u2018Cept, we didn\u2019t wanna tell anyone, you know. Didn't want the pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was all cool. They gave me six months to live. So, David comes to me, right, tells me he\u2019s a vampire\u2014says he thinks he figured out how to turn a human. He said he wanted to turn his girlfriend but wasn't sure if it\u2019d work\u2014said if it didn't, she\u2019d die.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. So, what, he wanted to test on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was dying anyway, we figured it was a good way to go.\u201d He laid back on his elbow, smiling. \u201cWe got some beers, got wasted, and he did his thing. Next thing I know, I'm being hauled away in some pine box.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cSo you got buried?\u201d</p><p>He looked back at me. \u201cYeah. But David warned me I would. Said he\u2019d come for me before my phone battery ran out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he knew you were alive? That whole time\u2014even at your funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Nate laughed. \u201cWhen they closed the casket, he walked up and made some smart-ass joke\u2014had me pissing myself laughing. I couldn\u2019t hold it.\u201d He looked at Jason. \u201cI had to lay in my own waste for about ten hours\u2014playin\u2019 Tetris.\u201d</p><p>Jason covered his mouth with a tight fist, laughing. \u201cGood thing you didn't get your mouth sewn up by the mortician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, David said he took care of all that\u2014said I went into a coma for a bit first, so he had a doctor diagnose me with some rare virus, then forged himself a degree and was the \u2018on-call\u2019 guy for the funeral home the day I \u2018died\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mum?\u201d I stomped my foot down. \u201cShe cried for you!\u201d</p><p>Nathan stood and faced me. \u201cI know. But...I was dying. There was nothing we could do about that, and I couldn\u2019t stay\u2014how would I justify my sudden cure and lack of heartbeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention, the Set wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d Jason added.</p><p>I knew that\u2014I knew all of it, but somehow it just didn't make it okay.</p><p>\u201cDavid left her some money,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI didn't have none to give, so he paid all the expenses, you know, made an anonymous donation at that benefit concert.\u201d He shoved his hands in his jeans pockets. \u201cI miss her, Ara, you know. I didn't wanna leave her, but I check in on her all the time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. I'm sorry, Nathan. Of course you didn't want this. I just...I'm just still struggling to deal with all this, too.\u201d</p><p>He appeared beside me at vamp speed and touched my shoulder. \u201cI know how you feel.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nate.\u201d Jason stood. \u201cCan you give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He dropped his hand from my arm and shook Jason's. \u201cGood to see you again, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, bro.\u201d Jason gave a one-armed hug and walked him to the door, closing it behind him.</p><p>\u201cI didn't know you knew Nathan.\u201d I dropped my hands to my hips.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s the only one of Em\u2019s friends I ever met. They hung out quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I nodded. \u201cSo, David turned him. Did you know that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head, coming to stand right in front of me. \u201cNah. But I kinda suspected it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he told me it wasn't him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I said I didn't kill Nathan.\u201d</p> <p>I looked up to the new voice in the room. \u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s happiness to see me,\u201d he said, wrapping his arms around my head and shoulders as I launched into his loving embrace.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a call\u2014heard my brother was still alive.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back from the hug and looked at the two boys. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMike,\u201d they both said, and laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d</p><p>He looked at his watch. \u201c\u2019Bout twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d I bit my lip, looking from one face to the other. \u201cAre you guys okay? I mean, there weren\u2019t any fists flying or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d David said. \u201cWe\u2019re all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, death has a funny way of putting things into perspective,\u201d Jason added.</p> <p>\u201cSo, are you back?\u201d I hugged David's arm, looking up at him. \u201cI mean, now Jason\u2019s here, won't they try to say the prophecy child can be with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, despite him being of my blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn exact copy of your blood,\u201d I challenged.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn't matter, Ara. He is not the firstborn\u2014nothing can change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think the people will care. I think you should just come home and we\u2019ll face Drake together if he wants to come get us.\u201d</p><p>David groaned and walked away.</p> <p>\u201cDavid, please. Come on. We\u2019re strong now. He can come here, he can fight us\u2014he won't win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you so sure, Ara?\u201d David spun around from where he stood facing the window. \u201cYou don't know what he\u2019s capable of, and you don't even know what you\u2019re capable of. Mike fills me in, my love\u2014he tells me everything to do with you, and I know you can't use that static light as well as you\u2019d like to think. We can't put all our cards in that basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re putting them in the prophecy child one? We\u2019re putting them all there when you\u2019re never even here to create a child, we put them there when we don't even know if she can be conceived.\u201d</p><p>David rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cAra, just stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I won't. I'm tired of this. I...I have all these questions, David, and I never ask. I never question what you do, because I trust you. But I don't think I should anymore. Either you're incredibly dumb or you're incredibly na\u00efve and you just believe everything Morg tells you or...\u201d I paused. \u201cOr you're keeping things from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I was, Ara?\u201d He stepped up and grabbed my arm. \u201cWhat if I am keeping things from you\u2014would you leave it alone? Would you back down and let me do my thing?\u201d he asked, his eyes shifting to each of mine.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He dropped my arm with a sigh. \u201cLook, I can't do this anymore, either, Ara. I don't want to be away from you. I don't want to lie to you. But I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you won't like the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I promise to at least go along with it\u2014even if it\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head then looked over at Jason. \u201cThere are things...\u201d</p><p>I stood very still, like a doe that spotted a hunter, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>David sighed and sat on the bed, his head in his hands. \u201cThings that we\u2019ve discovered about certain people here, Ara. We may have more than one traitor in our midst, and we just don't know who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>He half looked up at me. \u201cMy being away is for reasons I cannot share, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the traitors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they may hurt you to get information I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, won't they do that anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot while they believe you to be this na\u00efve, easily-led young girl. If I shared even half my knowledge with you, you wouldn't be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, looking back down at the ground. \u201cAll I can tell you right now is that I went through Arthur\u2019s room at Elysium. I found notes on the prophecy. Turns out he knew about it long before the vampire council came to find you. And it wasn\u2019t common knowledge. I was ordered to kill a Lilithian upon my entrance to the council, and even I wasn't told about this prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Arthur knew about this child\u2014even before he knew a Lilithian had been found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect so. But his notes on the deciphering of the prophecy differed. And it makes sense\u2014all of it. There is no evidence that this child will kill Drake, Ara. I don't know where Morgaine got that information, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Drake,\u201d I said, and both the boys looked up. \u201cShe got it straight from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur told me Drake was the one who told Morgaine about the prophecy. That's what made her go searching for parchments and scrolls.\u201d</p><p>David stood up, his eyes narrowed. He walked slowly toward me but stopped and turned to look at Jason. \u201cWhat do you know, brother? You know more than you\u2019re letting on. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Jason moistened his lips, looking from me to David.</p><p>\u201cDrake told Morgaine what he wanted her to know,\u201d I cut in. \u201cTo serve his own greater purpose. These scrolls you all get your information from could possibly have been forged by Drake to look like prophecy scrolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Jason said. \u201cThere was no signature on those scrolls. Every other prophecy held Vampirie\u2019s seal. You know that.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cBut I never questioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>David's lip turned sharply on the corner. \u201cAll this began because you were kidnapped by Drake. I trusted Morgaine\u2014she was willing to help me rescue you. I\u2019d have believed anything she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now the dust has settled,\u201d Jason said, \u201cit seems as though there are a few things coming into sharper focus.\u201d</p><p>David frowned then, and as the same idea he obviously had sunk in to my head, my mouth dropped. \u201cIs she the traitor?\u201d</p><p>His hand came slowly up to his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>I took a few steps back and let out a long, quiet breath, almost seeing it come past my lips in the colour of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cLook, we don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d David said. \u201cI mean, what motive would she have for getting you on the throne, for saving you? All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, like you said, maybe this was never about the child. Maybe all this\u2014\u201d I motioned around the room. \u201cIs for some other reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but, what?\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cI don't know. But we need to flush it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I said.</p><p>They both scratched their cheekbones on one side.</p><p>\u201cIs the child even possible?\u201d I placed a flat hand across my belly.</p><p>\u201cI don't know,\u201d David said, looking at my hand. \u201cAre you pregnant yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I let my hand fall away. \u201cI mean, I haven't had my period, but that\u2019s probably the stress.\u201d</p><p>David half smiled. \u201cMaybe. Have you taken a pregnancy test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what then?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat if I am pregnant? What do we tell our people? The king is dead. They\u2019ll demand to know whose baby it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them it\u2019s mine,\u201d Jason piped up.</p><p>We both looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAra and I can just pretend to be together.\u201d</p><p>David ran a hand over his hair. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s actually a good idea, but she\u2019s not pregnant, Jason. I can smell her. She smells exactly the same as she always does.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cSo, why not tell them she is anyway? Tell them it doesn\u2019t change her body like it does a human. None of them would know. None of them were around when Lilith had children, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Arthur,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo. He wasn't. He was alive, but he never came to Loslilian,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we talked about it\u2014talked about Lilith having children. He said he never saw the miracle occur, but was told stories of this childbearing vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, why would we lie\u2014why would we tell them I'm pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see what reaction it has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, it would make Jason king by rights,\u201d David said. \u201cIt would appease the distress of the people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but when I go to swear my oath, David and I can switch places,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>I looked up at David with a smile. \u201cYes. You could become official.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as if this idea suited him. \u201cCome to think of it, feigning pregnancy would flush out Morgaine\u2019s true motive as well\u2014if she has one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, especially if she doesn't really believe in this prophecy child,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cAnd who knows, if she is the traitor, it might change her allegiance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on the bright side, Ara,\u201d David said, reaching across to pull me into him. \u201cWith Jason here, I can come back more often and no one will question the scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Everything brightened, like the sun just shone down through the roof. \u201cI didn't think of that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my forehead. \u201cIt was one of my very first thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into him and squeezed his ribs tight. \u201cSo, will you stay tonight?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head against the top of mine. \u201cI can't. When I got the call, I was in the middle of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Jason, sighing.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jason said.</p><p>David nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d I looked up at David.</p><p>His jaw went square, tight. \u201cI'm not ready to tell you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me. Or at least tell me what it\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family,\u201d Jason said. \u201cYour bloodline.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back a little so I could look at David without angling my neck. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>He let the hesitation out through his open mouth in a hard breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get your dad\u2019s DNA. I wanted to test it against yours, so I took some of Sam's.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...I gave it to a friend of mine who works in human medicine. She ran a DNA scan. I wanted her to run some other tests but she couldn't get permission for those kinds of investigations\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to know, not only if Sam was biologically related to you, through your father, but if he had odd cells, maybe proving if he was a half-blood or even of Lilithian descent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like my dad might be Lilithian and not know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. If Amara was his mother, then he would be Lilithian, surely. We just don't know how it works; we don't know why only females are born to Lilithians, but I wanted to find out. She couldn\u2019t do those tests, but she did check the DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...there is a distant ancestral connection.\u201d He paused.</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that your father is not your father, Ara,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>My heart sunk; David grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cBut he is related to your bloodline\u2014just, perhaps not the Lilithian bloodline,\u201d David said. \u201cMaybe he was your real father\u2019s cousin or uncle or something. I don't know. That wasn't discussed, but, my love?\u201d He sat beside me where I fell onto Jason\u2019s bed. \u201cOne fact was certain; Greg Thompson is not your real father.\u201d</p><p>My hands shook, my eyes tearing to blindness. \u201cThen my namesake\u2014his mother. Was she...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Greg may have been adopted by Amara\u2014and it\u2019s possible she\u2019s not the same Amara I saved.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, biting my lip.</p><p>David delicately wrapped me up in his arms. \u201cI'm sorry, Ara. I didn't want to tell you this.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wiping my face. \u201cI...we both kind of knew it was a possibility. It\u2019s just...I have no one now, David. My mum, who wasn\u2019t really my mum, is dead, and now I don't have a dad, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have a dad, Ara.\u201d He cradled my face against his quiet heart. \u201cThat man loves you and would give his own life for you. He is your dad whether that relation is biological or not.\u201d</p><p>I sat up from him and looked at Jason for a second, who seemed as though he was fighting some great internal battle not to push David aside and hold me. \u201cSo, you need to trace his family tree, in order to find mine, right? If we were distantly related.\u201d</p><p>David stiffened. \u201cWhen I say distant, I mean, quite possibly, centuries of distance.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cSo, what are you doing about it then? Just...nothing?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI've traced back as far as I can go, but, I had an idea this morning. I remembered a book in Arthur\u2019s study back home, and the name Greg came up, but the book was ancient. The only reason I even thought of it\u2014connected it to you, was because it also mentioned something about grapevines.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrapevines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He kind of laughed. \u201cIt was a novel written by a very old vampire. The story followed a man named Greg. I don't recall the surname, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThompson,\u201d Jason said out of the blue. We looked up at him; he wandered over and sat beside me. \u201cI remember it. It was Thompson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, so...what does that mean? Was it a prophecy or just some fictional story, written by my dad, who is actually a vampire?\u201d</p><p>David laughed. \u201cYour dad\u2019s not a vampire, Ara. He ages. I\u2019ve seen it and I\u2019ve heard his heartbeat\u2014even read his mind. I can't read vampire minds, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he\u2019s another breed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, but I'm looking into it. And this book, I don't remember the story\u2014\u201d David looked at Jason; Jason shrugged as if to say he didn't either, \u201c\u2014But I'm going in to Elysium to get it. I want to find out how many similarities there are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think, if this was Arthur\u2019s book, maybe he knows something?\u201d</p> <p>David shook his head. \u201cThe book was of very little significance, Ara. I only thought of it because I was thinking about us and remembered when you first mentioned grapevines. It was an unassuming, unimportant thought that flittered past in a memory, and something just clicked. It probably has no relevance at all.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWill you tell me? Like, if you find anything, will you tell me?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Jason. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around him again. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't mention it. Now\u2014\u201d He stood up, taking my hand, and pulled me into another hug. \u201cI have to go. I need to sneak into Elysium at sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause that's when the guards change over. It\u2019s the easiest time to get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. So, why don't you take Quaid and Ryder with you\u2014I'm really worried Arthur might be right about Drake trying to get his hands on a Pure Created, but Mike won't listen.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, cupping a hand over my head and placing a soft kiss on my hair. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go sneak down to the barracks and see what the deal is.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed him tighter. \u201cThanks, David.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed back. \u201cYou take care, okay? I\u2019ll hopefully have word back about this book before tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nodded against his chest. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Jason stepped up, and David broke away from our embrace to hug his brother. \u201cI'm glad you're alive, bro,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jason patted David's back. \u201cMe too. And don't worry, I\u2019ll watch over her for you.\u201d</p> <p>David nodded, studying me then Jason carefully. \u201cThe bind...it is broken now, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, brother.\u201d Jason reached across and clapped David on the shoulder. \u201cI won't touch her. I swear.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, satisfied, and leaned in to kiss my cheek softly before disappearing into thin air, leaving only a wispy breeze and the billowing curtain.</p><p>\u201cGood thing this isn't Australia,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019d have a hard time getting in and out if there were flyscreens on all the windows.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed loudly.</p><p>\u201cSo, what were you thinking before?\u201d I asked, remembering back to when David demanded he share his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOh, um.\u201d He looked at me, half smiling, kind of surprised as well. \u201cI can't believe you picked up on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pick up on everything,\u201d I said, and sat down on his bed.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He sat down, too. \u201cDavid said Arthur\u2019s notes differed to Morgaine\u2019s deciphering of the prophecy\u2014that he didn't seem to have scribed any possibility of a child that can cure vampirism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why does he want a child with you, on the premise that he wants to be free, if he doesn't believe the prophecy?\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from my face.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Jason said, grinning. \u201cWanna know something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid had a flash of an image in his mind while we were talking; it was mostly just scribble, but I saw the dagger in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, a picture of it, or the actual dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a picture\u2014done in charcoal. He knows what he\u2019s looking for, but hasn't found it\u2014and his not being here has something to do with it, so does his eagerness to be crowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, and you got all that from one thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoughts happen very quickly, Ara. Once a neuron in your brain fires up, it sends other signals, like knocking over a line of dominoes, until the thought becomes whole. I simply grab that first thought at the flick of that switch, and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do to stop me. By the time you realise you\u2019re thinking something you don't want to share, I\u2019ve already seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you think he wants to be sworn in as king for some greater purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I want to know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe just to finally be king.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. It wasn't that. I felt it\u2014saw the look on his face. He thought it was a great idea but not for that reason. Enough of a great idea that he\u2019s going along with you and I pretending to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, didn't he like that idea?\u201d</p><p>Jason nearly laughed. \u201cNo. I think I caught a flash of him slowly rolling my entrails out through my anus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d I slapped his chest. \u201cThat is really gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He laughed. He wasn\u2019t sorry. \u201cBut he\u2019s going along with it. So he either really wants to flush out the traitor by lie of a pregnancy, or really wants to be crowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to think of it, he agreed to us in a pretend romance awfully quick for the David I know\u2014and that was before the idea of crowning came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he thinks you\u2019re already pregnant and knows he\u2019ll be forced to return if that truth comes out,\u201d he said through a yawn, covering his mouth.</p><p>I nodded and looked down at my belly. \u201cSurely he\u2019d have said that\u2014if he thought I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Jason shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Personally, I'm beat, Ara. I\u2019ve been on a plane all night, unable to sleep, followed by a two hour run here. I need to hit the hay.\u201d He jerked his thumb to his bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stood up and headed for his door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I look forward to it.\u201d He leaned his cheek against his door while I stood in the hall. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll announce our plans to be a couple.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo way. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think Mike would take it too well, Jase. I'm pretty sure he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s shoulders lifted with his single breath of humour. \u201cWell, I don't really give a damn about him, Ara. We have limited time until Drake comes along and reveals his true plan, by then, we need to have flushed out the traitors and have some kind of defence prepared.\u201d</p><p>I reached across and touched his left arm, imagining his Mark beneath the sleeve of his shirt. \u201cI'm glad you\u2019re here. I hate to think how things would\u2019ve turned out if you\u2019d not come back.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cArthur\u2019s been watching out for you, Ara. He probably suspects Morgaine already\u2014probably knows exactly what's going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d It felt kind of scary to know I\u2019d been left here alone with traitors in the mix\u2014possibly people I was close with.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always the people you\u2019re close with, Ara, they\u2019re the ones you really have to watch.\u201d</p><p>I frowned up at him, rolling my eyes when I realised he\u2019d just read my mind. \u201cWill you stop that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He grinned. \u201cG\u2019night, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Jase.\u201d</p><p>Our new guest didn't join us for dinner, but despite his absence, Mike was super quiet and everyone else was charged with excitement, except Arthur, who was clearly sulking.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn't matter,\u201d Margret said. \u201cIt\u2019s the law. The queen must take a king within her first six months and produce an heir within a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose laws are out-dated, Margret,\u201d Mike said, practically spitting. \u201cShe\u2019s too young to have a baby, and without blood of Knight, there\u2019s no hope of the prophecy child, so what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo have an heir to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have one. Just not yet,\u201d Mike finished.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered a child with Arthur?\u201d Walter asked; Arthur dropped his fork onto the table and folded his napkin. \u201cHe\u2019s a firstborn\u2014perhaps you should try. The worst that can happen is that the child be powerless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that would make Arthur king regnant,\u201d Margret said, and everyone on the table broke into mutters among themselves.</p><p>I looked at Arthur; he looked away.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jason has returned,\u201d Grey Sideburns said. \u201cWas it not rumoured he and our queen were once in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, smiling at the almost audible sound of Mike\u2019s blood boiling.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should switch focus\u2014forget this prophecy. I knew nothing of it until recently and I care nothing for it, either. I care for our freedom, and it seems\u2014\u201d the woman motioned around our table of united breeds, \u201c\u2014that Her Majesty has already achieved this much. She should focus on finding a king and bearing an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here.\u201d Mutuality united the table with rapping knuckles.</p><p>\u201cDrake plans to attack in a month,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWe should focus on a battle plan\u2014or a way to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your job, young man,\u201d said Margret, waving her hand as if he was a fly. \u201cOurs is to worry what the queen and the people do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said another snooty old woman with almost purple hair. \u201cLet us do our part, and you can take care of yours.\u201d</p><p>I blocked out the other conversations around the table and leaned in to Mike. \u201cDid you speak to your informant\u2014about Quaid and Ryder going to Elysium?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe took my side. We wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down. \u201cDid he mention...anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>I sat back in my chair. So he hadn\u2019t told Mike that Jason and I were planning to feign a relationship and a pregnancy. I wondered why. Maybe he really was opposed to it and was using it to distract Jason and I from something else. But what?</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it makes sense, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe being with Jason.\u201d</p><p>She studied me carefully, her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWe could crown him king,\u201d I said suggestively, hoping she \u2018got\u2019 me. \u201cAnd, who knows, maybe I\u2019ll fall pregnant straight away.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Mike; I could feel his burning gaze in my neck. They weren\u2019t getting it.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d I continued, half aware that several people had stopped talking and were listening. \u201cHe looks just like my dead husband. Maybe I could just imagine it\u2019s him\u2014maybe I\u2019ll come to love him one day.\u201d</p><p>I saw the light switch on in her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mike huffed, sinking back in his chair, while Morgaine sat straight. \u201cShe has a point, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think that's a wonderful idea,\u201d Margret joined our private conversation. \u201cWhat does our new guest think of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I haven\u2019t mentioned it, but I think he\u2019ll be happy with it,\u201d I said.</p><p>Arthur slammed his napkin on the table then pushed his chair out and stormed away. Mike sat staring into his plate, his face red, holding his breath for about two beats after Arthur left, then shoved out from the table and stormed away, too. A quiet hum of laughter settled over the room, lightening the mood. And it stayed that way for the rest of the night. With the tension of a kingless nation eased and the renewed possibility of an heir to the throne, I think my people felt a sense of hope for the first time in so long, even if that heir to be born wasn't the prophecy child Morgaine had told everyone about.</p><p>I placed a soft hand to my belly and looked around at all the smiling faces. Very soon, I was going to make everything all right for these people. Very soon, their king would return and, together, we would finally unite all vampires and Lilithians.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>A circle of darkness made the field an eerie place to be; I slowly wandered forward, seeing the grass appear at my feet with each step, following a distant, gloomy hum of a song. Each word came like a lost soul sung its last wish, and the hollow, haunting ring of the tune left bumps of chill down my bare arms.</p><p>I stopped dead when I saw a man kneeling on the ground under my tree; his shoulders hunched, his dark hair shining with flames I could feel but not see. His hands moved purposefully up and down, and when I stepped closer, hesitant and ready to run, he looked up at me; his green eyes like glass, his face smudged with red.</p><p>I gasped, jumping back, and the man went about his business, ignoring me.</p><p>In his lap, a mess of hair and blood coloured the night, seeping down the pale white skin and yellow dress of the limp girl, her head buried facedown against his knees. A great gaping tear seemed to spilt her in two, following her spine, and the man rocked back and forth over her, singing his song, stitching her skin closed from the top of her neck, down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe trusted me, and I hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d I touched his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cI can't make her smile again.\u201d He stopped rocking and looked up at me. \u201cLook what I did to her. Look how broken she is.\u201d</p><p>We both looked back at the girl, and almost as if he forgot I was here, his song started again with a new kind of melody, laden with a sliver of malice, as he continued his vain attempt to suture her up. But she couldn\u2019t be fixed. She was damaged beyond repair, and no matter how tight he pulled that stitch, she would never look at him again.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d I tried to make him see, tried to make him realise I was here, but he was lost in his own agony\u2014too far gone for me to save. He was with her, in whatever Hell they had been dragged down to.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara.\u201d He lifted the girl, making her spine bend in an unnatural way, and cradled the back of her head against his face. \u201cAra. Ara. Ara,\u201d he said, over and over again.</p><p>It started echoing away, becoming a ghostly call, like a wild wind howling through the treetops. I looked up, heard it resonate from over the hill, out there, somewhere in the darkness.</p> <p>Ara.</p><p>I looked behind me.</p><p>Ara.</p><p>My eyes flashed open to a dark room, my blanket scrunched in a tight fist, the cry of the wind living outside my dream. It howled again, screaming my name. I jumped out of bed and wandered slowly across my room, following the noise. It was so dark I bumped my leg on several things as my bare feet fell carefully over the floorboards and rugs beneath them. When I reached the fireplace, the sound of my name being screamed carried up the emptiness inside it and whirled around my head.</p><p>\u201cAaaaarraaaaa!\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the mantle and leaned in, holding my breath, but the noise stopped.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called cautiously, squatting down, placing flat palms on the hearth. It was empty, deep, nothing but a draft and the smell of soot and ash inside. I slightly crawled into the hollow, praying nothing creepy sprung up out and grabbed me.</p><p>And the noise came again; I lifted my head, rocked back on my heels and looked around. It wasn't coming from the fireplace; it was coming from the wall.</p><p>I was just about to rush across my room and flick the light on, when I heard glass breaking down the hall. I ran for the door, yanked it open and looked past Falcon to the end of the corridor. Arthur came out from his room, cursing to himself, and walked toward the stairs, carrying his stone mixing bowl.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked Falcon.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNothing. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard screaming.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cIt was probably just a bad dream. I haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but I knew I heard it, even if he didn't. \u201cI don't expect you to understand, Falcon, so you can follow me if you want to, but don't stop me. I need to see what Arthur\u2019s up to.\u201d</p> <p>I took off walking, vaguely mindful that Falcon was behind me, and also extremely glad. That noise was a sound of pure terror; the person who screamed it, a lost soul, suffering an agony that couldn\u2019t be repaired. I had to find them. I had to set them free.</p><p>When I came upon the second floor landing, Arthur was already gone. I spun around a few times, trying to catch his scent.</p><p>Falcon cleared his throat and pointed toward the west wing.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Falcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't mention it,\u201d he said, and we started walking.</p><p>The noise continued down here, and this time, I knew Falcon heard it. He went stiff, coming up quickly beside me. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the screaming I heard.\u201d</p><p>A door popped open at the end of the hall, and Falcon grabbed my arm, pulling me closer to the wall. A man closed that door behind him, and when he approached, becoming visible in the light, I let myself breath again.</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d I said, shrugging out of my knight\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He stopped dead. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d I nodded to the bowl. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He looked weary, worn. He rubbed his brow and walked past me. \u201cNight terrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight terrors?\u201d I looked at Jason's door. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep now. As should you be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard my name being called.\u201d</p><p>Arthur dropped his hand from his brow and pressed it to my back, guiding me down the corridor. \u201cHe was calling for you in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWho do you think he was dreaming about?\u201d</p><p>My heart tightened. \u201cIs it...does he dream about the tortu...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he cut in. \u201cLeave it in the past, Amara. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>And that was that. He walked ahead and disappeared, leaving me in the darkness of the second floor corridor.</p><p>I looked up at Falcon. \u201cNight terrors.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGuilty conscience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...he shouldn't be feeling guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn't be human if he didn't, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s not human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. He\u2019s just an immortal human.\u201d</p><p>The evening chatter seemed to be louder tonight, the people alive with the presence of our newcomer. And though I was feeling quite refreshed from having seen my husband yesterday, I still found myself looking at his empty chair.</p><p>Morgaine hardly took her eyes off Mike all night, and he\u2019d hardly touched his food, even Eric was quiet. None of the knights were yelling jokes down the table at each other and the tell-tale sign that Arthur was in some deep pit of turmoil was when Margret forced her opinions around about the reign of Genghis Kahn, and he just sat there, with nothing to say. Her theories were enough to make me choke. In fact, the only time Arthur came to life was to rap Jason across the back of the head every time he leaned forward to gawk at me.</p><p>On the bright side, at least Mike and Arthur shared one thing in common, for once; they both wanted to flatten Jason.</p><p>The same conversations we\u2019d had nearly every night continued down the table, except, tonight, Jason was joining in. I tuned out most of it, since it was all irrelevant; my husband was alive, so, who the father of my child should be really wasn't important.</p><p>\u201cThese discussions have gone on long enough,\u201d Walter said. \u201cFact is, we need a new king and an heir\u2014the prophecy is of little significance at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Jason shrugged; everyone looked at him. \u201cEven if the queen doesn\u2019t love me, I\u2019ll be more than happy to step into my brother\u2019s role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what a powerful king you would be, too,\u201d Old Margret said, grinning bashfully at Jason. \u201cI\u2019ve only heard stories of your talents.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cEven then, I bet you haven\u2019t heard the half of it.\u201d</p><p>You tease!</p><p>He looked over at me and scratched his nose, attempting to hide his laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes, imagine the gifts their child\u2014our future queen\u2014would possess,\u201d Walter said.</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cI still believe she should pair with Arthur. He is, after all, a firstborn son,\u201d a vampire woman said. \u201cPerhaps we can achieve the prophecy child, and I am sure Arthur would make a great king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we stop deliberating who my best friend needs to have sex with, please?\u201d Mike said and dropped his head into hands. \u201cWe\u2019re at the damn dinner table, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>I reached over and pried his hand away from his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d He looked around at everyone. \u201cForget the prophecy child. She is not having sex with him or him!\u201d He pointed at both Arthur and Jason.</p><p>\u201cI disagree. I think she should unite with her former husband\u2019s brother. If the prophecy child was supposed to be with blood of David Knight, then surely his own DNA would suffice in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in magic this works, too,\u201d Grey Beard said. \u201cWith a spell based on one\u2019s blood, a twin can offer themselves up in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d the other grey beard man said. \u201cOur runes never predicted anything which indicated your child need be blood of a firstborn, or that she would be powerful\u2014only that there were two options; one path would lead to the end of all this, the other would see it resolved but not final.\u201d</p><p>A few arguments broke out across the table. I looked at Morgaine.</p><p>\u201cAra, what matters is what Drake believes,\u201d she said, obviously sensing my confusion. \u201cHe\u2019s the one we\u2019re running from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but, what does it matter if we have a prophecy child or not, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she is the one foretold to free the Damned,\u201d Morg said, practically singing each word out in an impatient tone.</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d I folded my arms, finally ready to challenge her. \u201cYou said the prophecy foretold her making a change, seeing an end to Drake, not that no one else could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with Ara,\u201d Jason said, smiling as if he\u2019d been in our conversation the whole time. \u201cOur queen may be the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jason. You're just saying that because you want to be the one who fathers the child!\u201d Morgaine spat.</p><p>Jason sat back in his chair, his smug grin making him look incredibly cute. \u201cLast I checked, prophecies foretold events that happen. If this child were meant to be with my brother, he wouldn't have died. It was always meant to be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d said a woman. \u201cI say they marry at once.\u201d</p><p>Mike spat his food out on his plate, coughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, for now, we\u2019ll just see what happens.\u201d I looked at Mike then Arthur. \u201cJason and I aren\u2019t even together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your majesty, you have a duty to uphold.\u201d Margret sipped her drink, her pinkie in the air beside her goblet. \u201cI agree with Francine; you should marry tomorrow and conceive immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute.\u201d Mike stood up. \u201cAra is only nineteen. There are plenty of years for a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be so\u2014\u201d Arthur stood too and glared at me, \u201c\u2014but she has a responsibility to her people. If there is a possibility of a child, she should take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. There are to be no more discussions about this,\u201d Mike said, slamming his hands on the table.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d be more willing to discuss it if you were among the options,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with my feelings for Ara. She is a young girl, goddamn it, and I won't see her forced to have a child with someone she doesn't love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you've got no choice. Neither does she.\u201d He pointed at me, his face red with fury. \u201cNone of us bloody well do.\u201d His voice softened on the end and he walked briskly from the room, shaking his head.</p><p>A wash of stunned silence rolled over the table until, one by one, everyone went back to their meals and Mike sat down.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, clearly biting his teeth together inside his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNone of this matters.\u201d I motioned around the table, referring to the topic of childbearing with other men. \u201cOur informant will see to it.\u201d</p><p>He looked around, probably checking no one caught on to my not-so-cryptic remark. \u201cThat's not what this is about, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you so upset about?\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his chair, shaking his head, then exhaled and pushed out from the table.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I called, but he kept walking.</p><p>\u201cWow, this party is getting smaller and smaller,\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him, Morg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was kind of hoping the people wouldn't support a union with anyone else for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they can make you marry and sleep with Jason if that\u2019s who they choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why do you think Lilith hated Peter so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I smiled down at my empty plate. \u201cAnd Mike\u2019s worried I might end up with more than one husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to get over it,\u201d Jason said, sitting in Mike\u2019s chair.</p><p>Morgaine\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of her head. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope Mike doesn't come back and see you sitting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Morg.\u201d He threw a pea at her from Mike\u2019s plate. \u201cI'm not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be,\u201d she scoffed under her breath.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d he grinned, leaning closer, \u201c\u2014care to sneak away from this dreary evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Morgaine sat forward, throwing her napkin down.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cMorg, stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mike will freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Mike is about this close to getting replaced by Falcon.\u201d I held up an imaginary tiny thing between my fingers, \u201cHe needs to chill out. He\u2019s making me tense all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t replace him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Morg. I would.\u201d I stood up with Jason. \u201cI can only take so much of his over-protectiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for a good reason, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jason is officially my boyfriend, now.\u201d I stared her down. \u201cIf my advisor says it\u2019s a good idea, then you can damn well go along with it, Morg. Discussion closed.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, folding her arms, practically resting her bottom lip in her lap with its pout. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI've never been in the Garden of Strategy before,\u201d I said, strolling over the squares of marble and grass, patterned like a chessboard.</p><p>\u201cElysium has one just like it,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone ever hold a game here?\u201d I nodded to the decaying ruins of stone pawns and knights, their cracks bleeding vines and moss.</p> <p>\u201cOnce.\u201d He nodded, keeping his gaze ahead of us. We strolled along, quiet then, until we reached the end of the manor, just below his room and, above that, my windows. We both looked up, my head turning slightly to the side to catch his thoughtful gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We could go to the Garden of Lilith,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe guards aren\u2019t allowed in there.\u201d</p><p>He looked over his shoulder to Blade, standing in the shadows, playing with his phone, not too concerned about what we were doing or saying. \u201cI\u2019d rather go someplace else they\u2019re not allowed to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp.\u201d He grabbed my hand, grinning, and jumped into the air, taking me with him. I felt his arms wrap my waist and barely had time to hold my breath before we flew through the open window and into his room.</p><p>\u201cJerk!\u201d I shoved him when he released me to the safety of the floor.</p><p>He just laughed and wandered over to light a lantern. The room came to life under its golden flame and he sat down on the foot of his bed, placing the lantern on his blanket box. \u201cCome. Sit.\u201d</p><p>I plonked down right on his hand; he moved it, clearly finding my sudden moodiness quite amusing.</p><p>\u201cI'm going to get in trouble now, you know. You should have told me you were gonna do that,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Then Blade could\u2019ve stopped us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I folded my arms.</p><p>\u201cDon't do that.\u201d He shoved his hand between the fold and pushed them down. \u201cYou know damn well you would have come anyway, if I asked you.\u201d</p><p>I smirked at his smirk. \u201cOkay. Fine. I would. But, just tell me next time you're going to hoist me a few feet into the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d He laid back on the bed, his hands behind his head.</p><p>I could smell the strong, aromatic spice of his cologne, coming up from the heat under his shirt, and I wanted to lay on his chest and sniff him. He was just so gorgeously human.</p><p>\u201cYou like human?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head!\u201d I slapped his chest, letting my hand fall down on the bed right by his ribs. In truth, I didn't really want him to stay out of my head; I liked it. I missed when David used to be able to read my mind. Things had become so complicated since I had to explain my thoughts and emotions to him now.</p> <p>\u201cSo, he can\u2019t read your mind anymore\u2014at all?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe were working on projecting thoughts, and I could sometimes read his mind\u2014\u201d when we were having sex, \u201c\u2014but I can\u2019t really control it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can help you.\u201d He rubbed the side of my arm, rolling up a little. \u201cI'm kind of an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really that important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it is.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder, looking around his room; it had so much personality already, like he\u2019d gathered things from his childhood and brought them here. There was a baseball glove and ball on his drawer top, his wallet on his nightstand, a gold-trimmed picture frame with a drawing of what I assumed was Arietta, and a pair of jeans, a shirt and two socks on the floor by the foot of his bed. It seemed like he was kind of untidy, like me. I glanced over at the stack of books on the wooden table by the fireplace, sitting under his Yankees cap, but couldn't make out the titles on the spine. I wondered if he sat up late reading them, avoiding sleep\u2014avoiding the nightmares. \u201cHey, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your nightmares about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but that,\u201d he said dismissively, looking at the bedpost.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He shut his mouth and sat quiet for a second. \u201cI guess I don't really want to let you in to that part of myself, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not really sure how to describe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what, like, the deeper part of you\u2014your emotional soft spot?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, you\u2019re already in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can you try to explain it to me?\u201d I touched his hand. \u201cI actually just want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause unless you can cure guilt, then I just have to let this run its course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilt?\u201d I closed my eyes, flashing back to that cell, where he beat me and cut me open and did things I had scars from but no memory. \u201cDavid said there were things on that list, Jase, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please?\u201d He shut his eyes tight.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you erase anything\u2014of what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He held his hand up. \u201cDon't ask me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, if I lie, you\u2019ll know, and if I tell you the truth, you\u2019ll pester me for more information until I give in. And I can't, sweet girl. I can't tell you, and I find it really hard to resist you when you bug me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you did erase things?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head to himself, angling his face to look away from me, making the shadow of his nose, down the underside of his arm, longer. My thoughts flashed to the scar I had on the base of my spine\u2014the one Eric seemed to know something about but would never tell me, and with that, came a flashback of the horrible dream that woke me last night.</p><p>\u201cHow did you see that?\u201d he asked, startling me with the sudden panic in his tone.</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>He sat up and grabbed my face. \u201cThat dream.\u201d</p><p>I sat confused for a second. \u201cOh, the one I had last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I dreamed it, I guess,\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>Jason sat back, staring into nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I waved a hand in front of his face.</p><p>He shook it off\u2014whatever it was, and smiled. \u201cArthur was a bit...uh, pissed-off tonight.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, letting him slink away to the land of dark secrets concealed for another day. \u201cYeah. What was with him?\u201d</p><p>A few seconds of silence passed. \u201cI've never seen him behave like that, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d He rolled onto his side, softly tracing a strand of hair that fell down my back. \u201cI don't know what you said to him yesterday, Ara, but one thing I do know is that what you saw tonight wasn\u2019t anger, it was heartbreak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't say that, Jase.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI feel really bad as is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't. He\u2019s a grown man. He\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know if he will.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI told him it\u2019d make me sick to have sex with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I...I didn\u2019t mean it to sound so nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm, well, I wouldn\u2019t worry. For the sake of whatever his plan is, he\u2019ll have to force himself to get over it.\u201d He moved forward and lifted my arm, sliding under it so his head rested in my lap. \u201cIf you think he\u2019s gonna drop this child thing just \u2018cause I'm here, you're kidding yourself.\u201d</p><p>I gently ground my teeth together. \u201cWell, I better hurry and fall pregnant then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need my brother here for that,\u201d he said, inching away from me as though I was going to jump on him and steal his seed.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha. Jerk.\u201d I poked his upper arm. \u201cI know. But, can you talk to him for me\u2014to David? I can't fall pregnant if he never comes to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled softly, his beautiful fangs showing under those perfect dark lips. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him. I\u2019ll threaten to impregnate you myself if he doesn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't do that. He might think you're serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I'm not?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cSo, when are we going to announce our imaginary pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they believe we\u2019re in love.\u201d His grin set my heart ablaze, those fangs showing again, and without mind for territorial boundaries, I smoothed my thumb over his lip and touched it gently to his fang.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, removing my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long now since I've been bitten. Mike won\u2019t let anyone bite me, or feed from me. I'm like a golden shrine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he let you bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014 I have to get my vamp-immunity from approved veins, and even then, only through a pre-cut slit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. Appetising.\u201d He winced.</p><p>\u201cNah. It\u2019s okay. I feed from Eric sometimes. And Lilithians don't crave the bite like vampires do. Well\u2014\u201d I looked at his mouth again, \u201c\u2014we\u2019re not supposed to. I miss it, though, and I miss being bitten.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my neck for a second too long, then let out a deep breath, focusing on the roof. \u201cI wish we could share blood. But, before you freak out listing all the reasons we can't, just know, not only can I not do it, but I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there is no way I could resist going further with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so that's the why, what\u2019s the can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not immune\u2014I don't drink Lilithian blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I whacked my own brow with the heel of my palm. \u201cI forget you haven\u2019t been here. Are you going to, though\u2014be immune, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing I can escape from life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath? Why would you want death?\u201d</p><p>He let out a breath through his nose. \u201cIt doesn't matter. Look, it\u2019s getting late. I\u2019ll walk you back to your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>He stood up and appeared by his open door, not looking at me. \u201cCome on. Mike\u2019ll go crazy if he can\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>I laid on my belly, my forearm under my chin, one fingertip in the cool pond, watching my reflection under the backdrop of a cloudy sky. The Garden of Lilith had a kind of presence to it, as if all life, all living things gathered here to celebrate the beauty of nature. And it was peaceful. Private. Secluded.</p><p>A frog jumped up from the water, sending ripples out in circles that grew and overlapped each other, stopping on the marble edge of the pond.</p><p>\u201cAre you a prince?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWould you like a kiss?\u201d</p><p>He croaked at me and hopped back into the water, and as I sat up and looked across the reflection, I thought I saw a child on the rope swing.</p><p>I spun around quickly to look at the tree; the leaves rustled in the soft, warm breeze, and the swing rocked purposefully back and forth, but there was no child there. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>When I looked at the pond again, the ripples were gone, leaving a definite image of a little girl in the reflection\u2014swinging on the swing. But, sure enough, when I looked up, she was gone.</p><p>I got to my knees, leaning right over the water to focus on her, gasping when her eyes met mine. I jumped back, landing on my butt and hands in the grass, while a soft giggle trickled around the treetops then, following the child as she hopped off the swing and ran through the gates, out of the garden, leaving me feeling very alone.</p><p>The clouds closed in above me, bringing the night sky with them, and a cool chill settled on the pond, making plumes of fog rise up off the surface in whorls.</p><p>I got up and walked backward toward the gate, squealing when an ill-mannered crow yelled at me from the brick wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked it.</p><p>It buried its beak in its wing, pulling something silver and long from within. I walked slowly toward it and held my hand out, looking up quickly when it dropped my silver key into my palm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d The little girl appeared beside me, snatching the key.</p><p>The crow cawed again, swooping at me as I covered my head.</p><p>When I looked up again, the girl was gone, the garden gone, the crow, everything.</p><p>I sat up in my bed and looked around.</p><p>The key.</p><p>On my dresser, the music box sung when I opened it and moved my treasures aside; David's moonstone bangle, my coral earrings, my engagement ring and\u2014phew, still there\u2014my key. I closed my hand around it, feeling its warmth, then tucked it safely back in the box and closed the lid. But somewhere, maybe resonating from within that dream, I thought I could still hear that child giggling\u2014like the sound was coming out of my fireplace again.</p><p>I shook the idea off quickly. If there were actually ghosts haunting this place, I was not going to go looking for them.</p><p>Outside, the sun was quite high in the sky, and despite today being Sunday, it seemed odd that no one had come to wake me. I wandered over and looked out my window, seeing Jason down in the Garden of Strategy, running about with Petey and some old rag they were using as a chew toy.</p><p>He stopped as Petey ran off to fetch the cloth, and looked over his shoulder, right up at me.</p><p>I waved; he waved back and went about his game.</p><p>He was a different kind of guy when he played with that dog, almost like a younger, freer version of himself. I liked that version\u2014a little too much.</p><p>I turned away, shut my curtain and headed to get ready for the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Morgaine pulled a chair out next to her when I stepped in late to the council meeting. But, since learning she might be a traitor, I\u2019d had a hard time pretending to be her friend, so I stood slightly behind her instead, pretending not to have noticed her gesture.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cAt least then David can come home sometimes, since it\u2019d explain the scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Blade said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll also explain a pregnancy if it ever happens,\u201d Falcon added.</p><p>I realised then that they were discussing the idea of my feigned relationship with Jason.</p><p>\u201cI say we fake a pregnancy so we can crown David now\u2014why wait until Ara actually conceives?\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cHey, good idea, Morg,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cWhat\u2019d you guys think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm okay with it,\u201d Eric said, and it seemed everyone else agreed.</p> <p>But not me, because it spoiled my plan to draw out Morgaine\u2019s motives. I shrugged when they looked at me. \u201cWorks fine for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mike stated, standing taller. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, they will force her to marry soon, and I can't be back there yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mike cut David off. \u201cAll your reasons for being away make no sense, given current events, David. What's really going on?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine shifted in her chair; I finally sat down.</p><p>\u201cI'm with Mike on this one,\u201d Eric said, looking at the phone. \u201cHow can we protect our queen, and our nation, if you\u2019re keeping things from us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I said.\u201d Morgaine stood up. \u201cWhat Margret or Walter or any of the Ancient Rune Readers have to say is irrelevant. Drake believes David to be the knight of the prophecy, and the only reason he didn't attack before the coronation is because, Ara might be powerful, but she is not worth a damn without that child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d I said, though I didn't agree. In truth, I knew David had things to hide, but I trusted him. After all, he was the one person who absolutely had my best interests at heart. So, I\u2019d help him keep those secrets for now, even if I didn't know what they were. \u201cDavid's been busting his chops trying to find another Lilithian\u2014trying to find Vampirie, and you guys have the audacity to question his motives.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at me.</p><p>\u201cHe has nothing but our best interests at heart, and you would all do well to respect his decisions,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cWe stick to plan A; get this prophecy child conceived and get David crowned under disguise of Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to do that, Jason has to be Ara\u2019s husband,\u201d Mike yelled. \u201cThey have to wed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she\u2019s pregnant first,\u201d Morg reasoned. \u201cThey don't have to be married if he is king by right of heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the child has to be born first, doesn't it?\u201d Quaid asked.</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d Blade said. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s conceived, the father will have rights to be ruler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which get revoked if the child dies,\u201d Morg finished for him.</p><p>\u201cRight. So, again, we\u2019ll feign a pregnancy and crown David in Jason\u2019s place,\u201d I said simply. \u201cLike we planned before you started debating this, Mike.\u201d</p><p>Mike dropped his head against his fist. \u201cAra, you're killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t really be together,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it means David will inherit greater powers from the Stone, too. Who knows, maybe he and I can kill Drake together.\u201d</p><p>Mike sat down.</p><p>\u201cHow long before we can announce a pregnancy?\u201d Emily asked, her voice quieter through the phone than David's had been.</p><p>\u201cA month\u2014maybe less. Better give it about that long, anyway, since Jason\u2019s only just arrived,\u201d David said. \u201cI'm not sure how the people would react to an instant pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mike nodded, pushing off the table to stand up again. \u201cA month then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d David said. I knew he was happy because that would give him a month longer to do whatever it was he was doing out there. But I was sad because it meant a month longer that he\u2019d be gone\u2014for reasons I knew nothing of.</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d Morgaine clapped once, seemingly happy with all this. \u201cThen Jason will officially be Ara\u2019s new boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David said, his voice disappearing under the crappy connection.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the phone somewhere private, please. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I felt everyone\u2019s eyes on me as I snatched it, then flew up the stairs to the Throne Room, switching it from loudspeaker to handset. \u201cHey, what's up?\u201d I said chirpily.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor covering for me in there.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019ve been an absent husband\u2014left you alone, yelled at you, confessed that I'm keeping things from you, yet you stepped up to support me despite that.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. \u201cWell, what else would I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know how much I appreciate that\u2014especially since you don't even know what you're supporting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, David. I'm supporting you. Whatever you decide, I know it\u2019s always for the best. So, you don't have to be honest with me, yet, okay. You\u2019ve got my hundred percent backing.\u201d</p><p>He went quiet for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing you grow up.\u201d</p><p>My bottom lip pouted. \u201cYou think I'm grown up?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMy love, you have no idea how different you sound each time I talk to you, and it makes me so happy to see you becoming the woman I always knew you were\u2014deep down inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally deep down,\u201d I said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, the past doesn't matter now. I'm so proud of you, and I can't even begin to tell you what your support means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I love you, David. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Ara. And I always will. No matter where I am or how long we\u2019re apart\u2014I will love you in this life and the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next?\u201d I laughed. \u201cWe don't get an afterlife.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWith immortality, we live many lifetimes, and in that, we change our lives. That's what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I smiled. \u201cWell, I look forward to thousands of lifetimes with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d he said and hung up the phone. I stared at it for a second, turning around when my council came out from an adjourned meeting. \u201cAnything interesting happen while I wasn\u2019t there?\u201d I asked Mike.</p><p>He snatched the phone, then took my hand. \u201cYes. I'm taking you down to see the new Immortal Damned house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I grinned up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s finished?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah. I wanna be with you when you see it for the first time.\u201d</p><p>After following a leaf-covered trail, we stopped by some hedges, and Mike covered my eyes. \u201cNo peeking until I say, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, placing my hands over his as we walked forward.</p><p>He guided my heels with his toes, and after about thirty paces said, \u201cOkay. You can look now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mike.\u201d I touched my collarbone, taking in the white rendered brick and red roof of the prettiest little home I ever saw. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that?\u201d He pointed forward. \u201cWe painted the bars on the windows white\u2014so they\u2019d blend in.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, covering my smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of sunlight, comfortable beds, toys, games\u2014everything you asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Even a few recently immortalised child-health experts to help teach the Damned how to use them\u2014since most of these children have never seen a modern toilet or shower before.\u201d</p><p>I couldn't take my eyes off the house, imagining how happy the children would be now, how nice it must be to live in darkness for so long, and then suddenly feel the sun\u2019s warmth, see the grass, splash fresh water over your face.</p><p>\u201cCome see.\u201d He headed down the small hill toward it.</p><p>I caught up and looped my arm through his. \u201cWhen can we move them in?\u201d</p><p>He patted my arm, grinning to himself as we neared, and I heard the unfamiliar sounds of children laughing and talking nosily under the booming of a loud yet kind voice.</p><p>\u201cIs that them? Are they in there?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, smiling warmly, as if he knew what that meant to me. \u201cNow, just be sure you don't get this building mixed up with the training hall.\u201d</p><p>We stopped by an iron gate. \u201cMike, it may look the same\u2014aside from the bars, but it\u2019s at a completely different end of the grounds. I'm not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if I caught you here alone, that\u2019d be the first excuse you'd think to give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So, for you to think of it, does that make me smart, or you stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither\u2014it makes me big and you small, and if I catch you here with these demons, alone, I will hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t test me, Ara-Rose. I'm at the end of my tether with you, young lady.\u201d He gently squeezed my cheeks between his fingers, smiling, so I squiggled my tongue out through my puckered lips and licked his hand. \u201cEr! Ara, that\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>I dried my mouth, laughing.</p><p>\u201cNow\u2014\u201d He wiped his hand on his jeans then grabbed a key from his pocket and turned it in the lock. \u201cWe have a double entry. It\u2019s important to make sure you close and lock this gate before you open the interior one. Clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, wait.\u201d He placed his hand on my shoulder as I stepped inside and moved toward the second door. \u201cI'm not letting you in there today. You can watch from back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not ready for visitors, yet,\u201d he said, closing the outer door.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The entrance was small, with a bench to the left for personal effects, a door off to the right leading somewhere else, and just enough space for about four people. I peered in through the glass screen covering the next iron door, and there, across the room, in a square of sunlight over the floorboards, sat a little boy, pressing a sail into place on a wooden boat.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>The boy looked up; his hair was golden and clean, his face round and his cheeks coloured with pink.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s him,\u201d Mike said warmly.</p><p>\u201cHe looks so...human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike laughed. \u201cHe kinda does. Hey, see what we did with the beds; space and planet theme for the boys, and princesses for the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery cute,\u201d I said, my eyes running along twelve or so small beds with squishy quilts, lining one side of the room, then over shelves full of books and toys on the other side. The keeper stood centre to it all, tall and clean-cut, his metal stick beside him like a staff. \u201cWhy does he still have that stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the children aren\u2019t cured, Ara. They are still dangerous and we do still have a few issues with them. It\u2019s why we\u2019re only moving ten over at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where are the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey're in the cells, still. But they have beds and sunlight and they\u2019re being properly cared for. We had to take all the toys away, though, because the little buggers used them as weapons against their keepers.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cBut these kids are okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are the ones that showed the ability to be reasoned with.\u201d</p><p>Behind Max, another boy squatted down and pointed to the sail, then picked up some glue and helped him put it in place. \u201cWho\u2019s that other boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Joshua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he? He looks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve? Why would they lock away a twelve-year-old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to stay with his brother.\u201d Mike nodded toward them.</p><p>\u201cMax is his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He ran a hand over his head. \u201cWe hold the most hope for those two.\u201d</p><p>Joshua looked up at Mike with a timid smile and a half-wave.</p><p>Mike waved back: his eyes lighting up. \u201cWe\u2019re pals.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>I looked around the room, seeing children on beds, talking to each other, watching them play cards or knuckles on round rugs by the window, and thought back to the first day I met them. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the little boy the caretaker beat?\u201d</p><p>Mike moistened his lips, smiling, and nodded to a child coming in from the bathroom, holding the hand of woman with soft brown hair and a kind smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>The little boy glanced over at us, curiosity showing in his frown. I gave a little wave, but he looked away, sitting down with his carer on an armchair by the bookcase.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I asked Mike.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, physically, yes, but we haven't been able to get him to speak yet\u2014or sleep.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed around the image of him cowering under that metal weapon. \u201cMaybe we should have Jase come down and erase his memory.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s head moved quickly, his eyes going a little wider. \u201cHey, that\u2019s not a bad idea, Ar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cShall I ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure, go ahead.\u201d He took my hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s leave them to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I asked as we headed for the door again, \u201cdo you think they\u2019ll be okay? One day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Ara?\u201d He stopped and placed both hands on my arms. \u201cI think, for once, you might\u2019ve been right. I'm sure they\u2019ll be fine\u2014one day.\u201d</p><p>Self-satisfaction made me smile; I wanted to bathe in the glory of being right, but didn't want to ruin the moment. \u201cEven if there\u2019s no such thing as this prophecy child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked back at Joshua and Max. \u201cI mean, it\u2019ll be a long eternity for them\u2014never growing up, but, they do have the option of death\u2014if they want it.\u201d</p><p>I didn't like that idea\u2014or the idea that they\u2019d never grow up, never marry, never get their first car or have their first beer. But this was the best we could do for now, until I figured out all these different agendas and uncovered the truth of the past that we so solidly based our entire future on. \u201cSo, um, when will you bring the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen this group are successfully adopted out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you lined up any Lilithian families yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm pleased to say, yes, we have.\u201d Mike opened the door for me, closing it behind us. \u201cAnd there are even a few vampire families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, nice couples too. Very human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they're not still mental from the blood-lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the couples who\u2019re adopting are one\u2019s who\u2019ve been in love with a human before\u2014most of them still with that partner. So, they\u2019re only as messed-up as you or David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat's great, Mike. This is the kind of thing I've been needing to hear.\u201d I stopped walking and stood on my toes, my lips by Mike\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d He grinned as I kissed him. \u201cNow, about this Jason thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Mike. Don\u2019t give me hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI was just going to say I give it my blessing. I don't like it, but I understand it. Okay? Just don't let me down\u2014just don't\u2014\u201d he paused, \u201c\u2014don't do anything with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And just because I'm not going to give you a hard time, doesn\u2019t mean I'm gonna go easy on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be too much to ask for, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d I remarked sourly.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He leaned on the wall. \u201cYou know how much I hate that guy. Okay? So just let me be the protector, and you just be a good girl and live with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You can treat Jason civilly, or I go back to being a pain in the arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he huffed. \u201cI\u2019ll try to be civil. I\u2019ll even spar with him at training today, how\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he can put you out, Mike, if you cross him? You better not try to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHu!\u201d He breathed. \u201cYou're worried about me hurting him? Where\u2019s the loyalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't need it. He does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because no one likes him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry me.\u201d He pointed at me and walked away.</p><p>After sparring with Ryder, and losing in front of the entire Guard, I sculled some water down with a couple of aspirin and sat back to watch Mike spar with Eric. They were a good match; Eric had years of experience in kickboxing, but Mike had brute strength and courage. They reminded me of lions in the wild, fighting over a kill, except, both of them were laughing and making comical observations about each other\u2019s mums.</p><p>I smiled up at Jason as he sat beside me on the bench by the mirrors, with Petey in tow.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jase. Petey.\u201d I scratched the dog\u2019s head. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen him for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe comes and goes.\u201d Jason shrugged. \u201cSometimes we don't see him for a couple of decades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows, and it\u2019s not like we can ask him, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He looked around at a few knights standing nearby. \u201cI rather people don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they might try to use him as a spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnap you\u2014threaten to torture you if I don't tell them everything the dog, who everyone talks openly around, knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Never thought of that.\u201d As I sat back again, my blood ran cold, and I looked up with wide eyes. \u201cHas Petey told you anything I've ever said to him?\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s closed lips twitched, turning up a bit, while his eyes stayed forward. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Petey!\u201d</p><p>Petey barked once over Jason\u2019s laughter, and Mike looked up to the noise, copping Eric\u2019s fist to the side of his head; he went down, hitting the sparring mat hard, Eric\u2019s knee jamming into his skull in a knockout strike.</p><p>The knights roared, some howling like wolves, others exchanging money.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d I shrunk a bit.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn't your fault, Ara.\u201d Jason stood up and peered over the crowd at Eric, propping his foot on Mike\u2019s chest, his arms raised to the ceiling, flaunting his own victory. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Eric knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>I got to my feet, too. \u201cIsn't someone gonna help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Jason took off on one foot, but Mike slowly rolled up to sit, rubbing his head.</p><p>\u201cToughen up,\u201d Eric said, offering a hand.</p><p>\u201cThat was a lucky strike.\u201d Mike stumbled to his feet and gave Eric a one-armed hug. \u201cI pity the next guy to try that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pity Ara.\u201d Eric winked at me. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who distracted you.\u201d</p><p>Mike threw me a vehement glare, wiping his face on a towel.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay, baby. I was just kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood fight, man!\u201d Jason slapped Eric\u2019s palm, bumping shoulders with him as he came over.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eric swiped blood off his lip. \u201cMike had that round \u2018til the end there, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll have the next one,\u201d Mike said, then pointed at Jason. \u201cYour turn, villain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on.\u201d Jason flipped his chin in Mike\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cEager for another beating, are ya?\u201d Mike took off to the centre of the room and stood waiting like a hungry wolf in a standoff.</p><p>Jase just scoffed coolly, as if he didn't care, then rolled his spine, taking his shirt over his shoulders. \u201cKeep hold of that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, catching it.</p><p>As he wandered over to Mike, flexing his fingers and wrists, my mind subconsciously compared the two; Mike, with his broad shoulders and huge arms, sweat covering his hairless chest in a fine layer, and Jason, who was half Mike\u2019s bulk; his arms and back thin, but contoured nicely with definition, enough that my heart started a little faster.</p><p>He turned to grin back at me, clearly having heard it. The rest of the immortals in the room kept their eyes forward, politely pretending not to have noticed.</p><p>\u201cKnock him dead, man,\u201d Eric said playfully.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara?\u201d Jase called over to me. \u201cHow \u2018bout a good luck kis\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase!\u201d I leaped from my seat as Mike smashed his elbow into Jason\u2019s head, sending him flying into the mirror; it cracked under Jason\u2019s weight, his hand pressing hard to the glass as he found his balance and pushed off the wall, forcing himself back up to swing at Mike.</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d Mike said, ducking, and grabbed Jason\u2019s waist, slamming him to the ground. All the knights rushed in, surrounding them, making a ring of bodies with barely a millimetre between shoulders.</p><p>I stood on my toes, and Petey took off under the knights\u2019 legs, barking loudly. The roars came in waves, the men wincing and waving their fists in the air.</p><p>\u201cI can't see,\u201d I whinged, pushing at them.</p><p>\u201cHere, climb up.\u201d Eric took my hand and helped me up onto the bench. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't mention it.\u201d</p><p>He stood with his arms folded then, feet slightly apart, watching the crowd of soldiers barking like animals, while I steadied myself with a hand to his shoulder, rising onto my toes to see over them. It was a mess of flesh and red, moving so fast I could only make out dark hair to blonde, until Mike caught Jase in a chokehold, sweeping his foot under the huddle, dragging them both to the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jase,\u201d I said to myself.</p><p>As if he heard me, Jase managed to disentangle his arm from under his ribs, and reached up, jamming his thumb into the soft flesh below Mike\u2019s chin, sending him backward.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got spirit,\u201d I said, but as soon as the words left my mouth, Mike spun a really wicked roundhouse kick into Jason\u2019s chest, which he blocked, only to receive a straight-cut jab to the skull that would\u2019ve lobotomised a human. \u201cGo for the balls, Jase!\u201d I yelled, and several of the knights turned to look at me; I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Eric tugged my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't watch anymore, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to. I have to make sure Jason\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's my point.\u201d He cupped his hands under my arms and pulled me down to the ground. \u201cMike ruled that we can't use special abilities in sparring, and Jason\u2019s nowhere near strong enough to beat him in a fair fight.\u201d He nodded to the men exchanging more money. \u201cWe all know that.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth slowly. \u201cWait, how come he lets me use my static power then?\u201d</p><p>Eric smirked. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I frowned over at the heat cloud of sweaty bodies surrounding Mike and Jase. \u201cSo, what, he made that ruling on knights only?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jason\u2019s not a knight. Neither are you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his smirk growing. \u201cThat rule applies to whom and to when it suits Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, this is just some lame excuse to beat the shit out of Jason?\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s head whipped around to look at me. \u201cI don't think I\u2019ve ever heard you swear before.\u201d</p><p>My teeth grinded in the back of my mouth, my fists tight. I charged forward, electricity flickering in my hands.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Eric grabbed my shoulder. \u201cStay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you intervene, you may as well label Jason a pansy now. No, in fact, how \u2018bout you tie a big pink ribbon around his chest and call him Mary-Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't care about his reputation, Eric. Someone has to help him.\u201d</p><p>He dropped back from his lean toward me. \u201cI\u2019ll step in soon, okay. If it gets much worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can you step in but not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I'm a guy, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I scratched my head and looked at Jason, on the floor\u2014just able to see his hair through the legs of a knight. He was beaten bloody, weak, and still trying to finish the fight.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t watch him get hit again. \u201cFine. I have a headache from Mike forcing me to zap things today, anyway. I need to go rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eric nodded and smiled, keeping his eyes on the fight as I wandered away. \u201cOh, and Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He held his arm out; I folded into his embrace, frowning while he hugged me tightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d I asked, stepping back.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust because.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO...kay,\u201d I said, and walked away again. As I made it to the doors, the knights\u2019 roar of disgust barely masked the sound of something wet splashing across the floor. I walked faster. I didn\u2019t want to know who or what just split open, and I so was not petting either of them up afterward.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Morgaine stroked the brush through my hair. Tingles of pleasure trickled through the long waves, like static fingers, kissing my nerves. I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the headache now, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fading.\u201d I looked down at my hands. \u201cIt seems like every time I get stronger, the headaches get more severe. I shot Falcon back ten feet today with my spark, and Eric said he felt his heart start when he got hit\u2014like David, at the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what it would do to a vampire if their heart actually started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. Maybe they\u2019d turn back into a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only it were so easy.\u201d Morg laughed.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock.\u201d Mike tapped lightly on the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, with more than a little hostility.</p><p>\u201cUr, can I come in?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Morgaine through the mirror, and she put the brush down, walking over to push Mike out. \u201cHer Majesty isn't talking to you, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAr, come on,\u201d he whined. \u201cI'm sorry, okay. Maybe it was a bit mean to go up against him that way, but he asked for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I stood up; Morg stepped back. \u201cBy doing everything he can to help us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp us out?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cHow\u2019s he helping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy being a friend. By...I don't know. He\u2019s on our side. I thought that counted for something.\u201d</p><p>Mike sighed and wandered into my room. \u201cI don't trust him, Ara. I never will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat down on the blanket box. \u201cBut you were unfair today. You...if you did that to any of your knights, you\u2019d be dishonourably discharged, Mike. That was flat-out abuse, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Morg; she shrugged and slinked backward, closing my bedroom door behind her.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe you\u2019re right. But\u2014\u201d He huffed and sat down beside me. \u201cCan you blame me, really?\u201d</p> <p>I folded my arms and turned my body to face away from him. \u201cI thought you had more honour than that.\u201d</p><p>In the reflection of my dresser mirror, I saw him rock back, sitting a little taller, my statement clearly hitting him in the heart. \u201cLook, I didn't come up here to argue this Jason thing, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you leave him unconscious in the training room, or did you at least have him moved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the Medic room.\u201d</p><p>My heart shattered. \u201cMedic room! What did you do to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay. He just...He hasn't regained consciousness yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I stood up. \u201cMike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, look\u2014\u201d He stood up and grabbed my forearm. \u201cI came up here to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to go see him.\u201d I went to walk away, but his fingers tightened on my arm.</p><p>\u201cBaby, Eric\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I screeched. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean, he\u2019s leaving. He\u2019s got his bag and he\u2019s outside, right now, waiting for a taxi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Mike shrugged and opened my door.</p><p>\u201cWhen was he going to tell me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t. He was just gonna leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hates goodbyes, Ara. He didn\u2019t want to upset you\u2014or more to the point, have to see you upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! If he's leaving, he can damn well say goodbye.\u201d I stormed out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cEric!\u201d I leaped past the last set of stairs and sprung up on the front doorstep. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He looked up at Mike as he came out behind me. \u201cThanks, Mike. So much for a clean getaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA clean getaway?\u201d I said. \u201cEric, you don't make clean getaways from your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Ara. I just didn\u2019t wanna do the goodbyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about me? What if I wanted to?\u201d I turned away so he wouldn\u2019t see me cry.</p><p>\u201cAw, kiddo.\u201d I heard a car pull up on the gravel as Eric\u2019s hand came down on my shoulder. \u201cI'm sorry, but my band just got signed. This a great opportu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I spun around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He toed the ground. \u201cWe got a contract with a really huge record label, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut his words off with my arms around his neck. \u201cEric, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed, patting my back. \u201cI know. So, please don't be upset. I never wanted to leave you, but...this isn't really my thing.\u201d He motioned around the manor. \u201cI kinda got dragged into all this, and, I mean, I\u2019ll always be a friend, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a life to live.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His lip twitched on one corner.</p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d I patted his shoulder and nodded to the taxi. \u201cThis is why I disbanded the Sets, Eric. I want nothing more than for you to have your freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s exactly why I didn\u2019t wanna tell you I was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, you\u2019re such a great girl, Amara, and I...I owe you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me? Eric, I think I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously.\u201d He stopped me. \u201cLook at it from my point of view; I\u2019ve spent my entire vampire existence dying for a way to escape this prison\u2014watching people rise to fame\u2014Biebers and other pop-music douchebags, when I\u2019ve got a sound that could rock the world. You\u2019ve given me the freedom to live that dream, Ara. I owe you, and I really didn\u2019t wanna make you unhappy by leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Eric, it\u2019ll make me happy to know that you're living. Okay? So, go\u2014\u201d I gave him an affectionate shove. \u201cGo rock the world.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his bag and wrapped his arms around me, lifting me slightly off the ground. \u201cThank you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Just...make sure you send a postcard every ten years or so. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Eric. I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Ara.\u201d He swallowed, his throat moving with the size of the lump, then picked up his bag. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya \u2018round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. See ya \u2018round.\u201d I nodded, slipping my hands into my back pockets as Eric hopped into the taxi, closed the door and disappeared out of my life.</p><p>Mike\u2019s solid form came up beside me.</p><p>\u201cThanks for telling me, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d wanna say goodbye.\u201d He looked into the distance and waved.</p><p>The manor was dead quiet\u2014all the vampires sleeping. Not a creature was stirring, not even a ghost of the past. I wandered through the open spaces, down lengthy corridors, bare feet over cold ground, carrying a sandwich and a cup of juice. When I reached the stairs, the grandfather clock in the common room down the hall sounded the hour of midnight, and the front door popped open, eyes of surprise meeting mine.</p><p>\u201cAra, what\u2019re you doing out of bed this late?\u201d Jason said, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d I stepped back off the stairs and wandered over to him. \u201cAre you okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He wiped his thumb over his chin, removing a splotch of blood. \u201cNot mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner.\u201d He shrugged, popping it in his mouth. \u201cI went hunting.\u201d</p><p>My lips fell apart with the drop of my jaw, and I stood motionless, looking at my sandwich then at Jason. \u201cWell, I'm not hungry anymore.\u201d I shoved the plate into his chest and dumped the cup in his hand.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cDon't talk to me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it bother you so much for me to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know, Jason.\u201d I spun around to look down at him. \u201cMaybe because I used to be your prey!\u201d</p><p>The heartbreak across his face made me feel awful. I didn't mean to say that, but I guess that's how I felt. I spun on my heel quickly, running up the stairs to my room, and slammed the door.</p><p>By the time clocks all over the manor sent two loud chimes into the air, my guilt had not settled, and only seemed to grow as three, four, five and six chimed, too. The sun came up, shining pink light over my ankles, my legs and my nightdress, where I sat on my settee, repeatedly seeing the look on Jason\u2019s face. He already suffered enough guilt for what he did to me in the past, why did I have to go and make matters worse?</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d Quaid stood above me, holding out a sandwich; I didn't even hear him come in.</p><p>\u201cQuaid. Hi.\u201d I sat up a little, taking the plate.</p><p>\u201cJason dropped this off for you.\u201d He sat down on the coffee table in front of me. \u201cHe told me what happened.\u201d</p><p>I thumbed the bread, checking the filling. \u201cYeah. I feel awful. I shouldn\u2019t have said that to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay, you know.\u201d He grabbed the blanket from behind me and wrapped my shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s not mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s not him being mad I was worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe might be a little hurt. But he knows you\u2014we all know you, Ara. You didn't really mean that\u2014especially not if you were getting a sandwich at the time.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hell grumpy when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, true, I guess.\u201d I popped a bit of bread into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019d you get that?\u201d He nodded at my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d I grabbed my locket. \u201cJason had it. David gave it to me when we were younger.\u201d</p><p>He smiled warmly. \u201cMy mum had one just like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I bought it for her thirtieth birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirtieth? I don't think I was even crawling when my mum was thirty.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMum was pretty young when she had me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>His eyes wandered away. \u201cShe died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was her time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, breaking off another small corner of my sandwich. \u201cCan I ask you something personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come your name is Shamus? I mean, isn't that kind of a weird name for a guy who\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack?\u201d He laughed, nodding. \u201cYeah. My mother was Irish.\u201d</p><p>I frowned to myself. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed louder. \u201cI uh...I actually changed it when I fled the US a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYeah, Mike told me you were accused of \u2018crimes against your country\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was...am innocent, though.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. Mike wouldn\u2019t have you in the Core if he didn't believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy\u2014Mike,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cI know you two haven\u2019t really seen eye-to-eye lately, but he cares for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, sitting up a little more. \u201cSo, why did you choose Shamus?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna come looking for black guy named Shamus?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cTrue. What was your name before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKamau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d I nodded. \u201cWhy not change it back then? You\u2019re free here. Nothing to run from.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed once, his eyes thoughtful. \u201cMost people call me Quaid now. Not much need to change it, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBut, can I call you Kamau\u2014when you\u2019re off duty?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou most certainly can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuaid?\u201d Mike said, tapping on the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Chief.\u201d Quaid stood to attention.</p><p>\u201cAt ease.\u201d Mike leaned into the room. \u201cJust checking you hadn't left your post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever do, sir.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Quaid then at Mike. \u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t wanna waste taxpayers\u2019 money on a guard who\u2019s not doing his unnecessary job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just delivering a sandwich, sir.\u201d Quaid\u2019s eyes remained forward.</p><p>I stood up and dumped the sandwich on the table where Quaid had been sitting. \u201cDon't worry about it, Quaid. Mike\u2019s just afraid he might miss out on two seconds\u2019 worth of gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossip?\u201d Mike stepped further into my room. \u201cWhat's that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cYou remember how I said I\u2019d win this fight\u2014that I\u2019d get the knights reassigned and off my permanent trail?\u201d</p><p>Mike frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, the Upper and Lower House believe you\u2019re paying these guys to be your private spies\u2014to report all my business back to you because of your insane jealously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, what have you done?\u201d he asked in a clipped tone.</p><p>\u201cI may or may not have gotten the council on my side. They may or may not be making a ruling about how the Private Guard\u2019s time should be used.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you know why I have the Guard on you. It\u2019s not so I can get all the gossip.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThen why do you have them report back everything I do?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, his shoulders dropping.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I thought so.\u201d I angled my head to the side, propping one hand on my hip. \u201cWe have fifty guards who line halls, doors and walls around this place who, if we get attacked, are trained to save me, and only me. I think I can get by without these guys manning my door and my heels, for that matter.\u201d I jerked a thumb in Quaid\u2019s direction.</p><p>Mike sat on my blanket box, his thumb to his brow. \u201cYou stupid, stubborn little brat. I can't believe you went behind my back on this, Ara. This has got to be about the dumbest thing you've ever done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mike\u2014this is a game to you. The truth is, you don't like not having control over me, and clearly they keep you too busy here to keep an eye on me yourself. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s twisted that you pay people to report back everything I do. If they were just guards, who looked at a blank place on the wall, said nothing, kept my business confidential and didn't think it was okay to listen in on my private conversations, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this overprotection. But face it, Mike\u2014you know, and everyone here at the manor knows, I am more than safe. You don't need these guys on me.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved up his brow, over his head. \u201cSo this is what the House meeting has been called for this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>My smirk widened. \u201cGirl one; guy nothing.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and stormed out of the room. I looked at Quaid, who couldn\u2019t close his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I'm wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The stiff soldier fled his spine, leaving the casual, relaxed Kamau behind. \u201cIn ways, but in ways, no. I think we should be assigned to watch over you if you\u2019re leaving the manor grounds, but here\u2014\u201d he looked around, shrugging, \u201c\u2014I kinda think you\u2019re okay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does Falcon think?\u201d</p><p>Quaid frowned. \u201cWhat's he got to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI trust his opinion over Mike\u2019s when it comes to what's best for me, because he's not using his heart to judge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Right. Well, I know he thinks you need to be watched over, but he\u2019s eased off a bit since your coronation\u2014says you don't make as many stupid mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He's not worried anymore that you\u2019ll cross the wrong boundaries with Arthur, either. I know he even told Mike we should just place a guard on you while you sleep\u2014leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDo you think it was wrong of me to seek the opinion of the House?\u201d</p><p>Quaid shook his head. \u201cNot if they also agreed with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich they did.\u201d I looked at my door.</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d I ran up behind him, feeling lighter without guards flanking my heels.</p><p>He stopped on the landing and turned slightly to look down at me as I came bounding toward him. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, um.\u201d I stopped, huffing a bit. \u201cCan I borrow you for a few minutes today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I enquire the reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, formal Arthur.\u201d I frowned at him, quickly covering it with a smile. \u201cI need to go to the scroll room, but Morgaine said I could only go in there with her or you, and I can't go with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s a big fat liar, and I need to get the truth.\u201d</p><p>One of Arthur\u2019s brows lowered.</p><p>\u201cShe told me about this curse,\u201d I said. \u201cThe Curse of Lilith, you know, the seduction one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I've heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she neglected to mention that it only works on men with a heartbeat. And Jason said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Jason\u2019s in on this, too.\u201d He turned and started walking away.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s going to show me the correct interpretation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you never thought to come to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I didn't know I could\u2014or should.\u201d I folded my arms, following him. \u201cJason pointed out these oddities, Arthur. You never even talk to me about the prophecy or anything to do with my family history.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking; I stopped, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you avoid it\u2014for some reason,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been avoiding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that may be the case, but you, of all people, should have been talking to me about it. I didn't even know how many things I had wrong. I mean, I always just assumed everyone in the vampire world knew about the prophecy, and then you tell me they didn't\u2014that no one knew, and now Jason tells me he was studying Lilithian History at college and read the scroll, which he doesn't believe is a prophecy at all, and...I\u2019m really confused.\u201d</p><p>Arthur turned back around. \u201cJason\u2019s right. But he\u2019s also wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many lies for us to sift through. Morgaine is not lying, and I'm not one hundred percent sure she\u2019s aware of her misinterpretations, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you don't think it\u2019s deliberate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been by herself all these centuries, Amara. She\u2019s been one of only twenty Lilithian\u2019s allowed to walk the light, and any information she has come across that gave her hope for a better future, she\u2019s held onto like a precious stone.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped.</p><p>\u201cShe may have read the scrolls wrong, but look at all she has achieved because of that.\u201d He stepped into me. \u201cIt was her knights who stormed Elysium and rescued you. It was her interpretation of the scrolls that saw hundreds of vampires and Lilithians follow a young girl\u2014possibly to their deaths, should Morgaine be wrong. Of course I have not spoken with you of the correct interpretation, because everything good we have here is based on what Morgaine started. And that is more than enough to have brought freedom to many who were suffering.\u201d</p><p>I didn't realise I was standing on my toes until I relaxed back and felt shorter again. \u201cSo, you think I shouldn\u2019t meddle in this, because the lie works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie, my lady. It\u2019s a misconception\u2014and that's the truth. The problem with that is, no matter how many men read those scrolls, it is subject to the opinion of the interpreter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you even think there is a prophecy?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>Mike came out from the east wing staircase and started toward us. \u201cHey, Ara, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLibrary,\u201d Arthur said quietly, touching my shoulder. \u201cEight o\u2019clock tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and he disappeared. \u201cHey, Mike. What\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeading home for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I noticed the duffle bag over his shoulder then. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aside from the fact that I am clearly not needed here,\u201d he said spitefully, but smiled at me after. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a problem with Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe just screamed down the phone at me\u2014told me to admit that I don't love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Why?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGuess I\u2019ve just been so busy I haven\u2019t really had time to call her and tell her otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou always do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He followed me to the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou were great when you were with me, but before that, half those girls you dated ended up sobbing piles of neglected waste. You...I don't know, it\u2019s like you want them there when you need them, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that with Em.\u201d He sighed and opened the door. \u201cOkay, in truth, it might\u2019ve been like that with the others because I didn't love them, but I do love Emily.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, staying inside as he stepped onto the front landing. \u201cIt\u2019s not me you need to convince.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in to give me a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya tomorrow. Oh, before I go\u2014\u201d He pulled out his phone and stood beside me, holding it up. \u201cI gotta snap a recent pic for your mum and dad. I\u2019ll drop by and tell them all about my holiday to Paris.\u201d</p><p>I smiled for the photo, stepping away from Mike after. \u201cTell Dad I said hi, and give Sam a slap for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...take your time, Mike. We\u2019re okay here,\u201d I said, leaning on the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cNo, I gotta be back tomorrow arvo for training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? We can train without you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI know. But I'm sparring with your dead husband\u2019s brother again.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, groaning, and slammed the door in his face. \u201cPig.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d rather get back here to kick Jason's butt instead of staying and making sure his fianc\u00e9 felt loved. That poor girl. A part of me started to wonder if maybe she deserved better than Mike.</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d Jason popped up out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cGod, don't do that.\u201d I touched a hand to my heart.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He walked alongside me toward the stairs. \u201cSo, did you get Arthur on board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Eight p.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He bounced off. \u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d I waved.</p><p>After pressing send on a dad-appeasing email, I sat back and looked out the giant window in the library. My House had kindly decked out a few desks with modern research tools, called computers, and were in the process of digitally cataloguing all the books. We\u2019d even hired a librarian, who would arrive in about three days.</p><p>Beside me, a few neutrally-coloured hardbacks, covered in two inches of dust, gave off a stuffy, mouldy kind of smell. I slipped my fingers under the one on top and dragged it down in front of me, swiping some of the dust from the cover, then gently opened it; the pages were old and yellowing on the edges, kind of stuck together. It took a bit of extra care and effort to part some without tearing them.</p><p>I read over the titles and text of historical events, looking for something of interest, and each time I flipped a page, the scent of ancient paper became stronger, almost reminding me of the way libraries smelled when I was a kid, like it had changed somehow\u2014faded as I grew older. Then again, maybe it hadn't. Maybe I just didn't notice it so much anymore.</p><p>Halfway through the book, an image stared back at me, one I knew well from my studies at school; Vlad the Impaler, enjoying lunch around a forest of staked bodies.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of my favourite books,\u201d Jase said, pointing to the page. \u201cAll these stories are the human versions of historical events, and here\u2014\u201d He flipped one page over. \u201cAre the original versions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled and sat down beside me.</p><p>\u201cSo, you guys started the Vlad legend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Drake did, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flicked over the page a few times, a small smile on his lips, then he looked up. \u201cThat\u2019s right, now I remember. He was fond of impaling as punishment\u2014used it for offences like infidelity or cruelty to one\u2019s wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Cruelty I can understand, but, infidelity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and this picture\u2014\u201d He flipped the page back over to \u2018Picnic Impalement\u2019. \u201cThis is a depiction that Drake himself described to the original artists, so it could be published in a local news rag, showing what would be done to any who continued to break those bonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage bonds. The promise to love, honour, protect and obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s big on promises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVows, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I ran my fingers over the page, studying the face of Vlad. \u201cThis looks nothing like Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jason stood up and wandered across the room. \u201cIt wasn't supposed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder and smiled at Nate as he walked into the library\u2014that confident human bounce still a part of his step. \u201cHey, Nate. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNommuch.\u201d He leaned on the table beside me, his hands under his hips. \u201cBored. What you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust looking at this. You might be interested in this book, actually,\u201d I said, turning it around for him to see. \u201cIt\u2019s all about stories that were made up by vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVlad the Impaler,\u201d he read aloud, squinting at the page. \u201cWhat\u2019s impaling?\u201d</p><p>I pointed to the image of men, speared through their mid-sections on sticks rising up out of the ground. \u201cHe would sharpen the tips of stakes, oil them up so they slid in slowly, then tie the legs of his victims with ropes strapped to horses and other objects, then have them lowered onto the point very, very slowly. It could sometimes take days for them to die.\u201d</p><p>I didn't know it was possible, but the vampire nearly turned green. \u201cYeah. Um, I think I\u2019ll pass. Got any books on sports?\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud, my heart warming to the sound of Jason\u2019s chuckle coming from across the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Nate?\u201d Jase said, cupping hands with him then bumping shoulders. \u201cNot feeling too good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you guys talk about that stuff like it\u2019s on topic at a Bible reading?\u201d he shoved the book away, closing it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re used to it,\u201d Jason said, massaging my shoulders gently.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Nate looked up to the wall of books. \u201cI think I\u2019ll try the comedy section. Arthur says I should read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the second floor,\u201d I said, smiling as Nate walked away. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweet guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. One of the better vampires in this community.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, shuffling the papers on the desk. \u201cI never knew him in life, but everyone said he was a good guy. Seems to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't...like him, do you?\u201d</p><p>Insult littered my upturned lip. \u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He stepped back, palms raised. \u201cJust asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I don't like every guy that walks in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry. It\u2019s just...you know, there\u2019s a lot of guys around this place, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are a lot of girls, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you don't notice the girls.\u201d</p><p>I huffed, folding my arms. \u201cYou wanna know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause boys aren't whiny and nosey and bitchy. I like video games and running around and joking about things of bad taste. The girls don't. They\u2019re boring. All they wanna do is shop and talk about boys.\u201d I held my hands up. \u201dI'm sorry, I just don't enjoy that sorta thing. I never have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point.\u201d</p><p>I slumped down lower in the chair. \u201cWhy does everyone always think the worst of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't, sweet girl.\u201d He turned my chair and squatted down in front of me, a hand to my knee. \u201cI just...you talk about the boys all the time. You laugh with them, joke with them, but it makes sense\u2014you getting along better with boys. It all makes more sense now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the lines now, you know.\u201d I looked into his warm green eyes. \u201cI can think a guy is cute, I can want to give him a hug when he\u2019s down\u2014care about him, it doesn\u2019t mean I'm falling for him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I twiddled my thumbs in my lap. \u201cI don't blame you for thinking that, though. I mean, I never really understood the lines before. I never knew the difference between what it felt like to love a friend and what it felt like to love someone more. But it\u2019s clear now. And I think Nate is sweet and an absolute gem of a person, but I don't have feelings for him other than a friend.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking down at his hand on my leg. \u201cI'm sorry, Ara.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon't be sorry, okay.\u201d I stood up, agitation coming with me. \u201cI kinda\u2014I guess I just get sick of Mike always thinking I'm gonna cross lines with people, and then telling the guards to watch me for it.\u201d I ushered a hand to Falcon, walking too casually past the door\u2014again. \u201cI\u2019ve changed. And Mike can't see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just doesn't want to see it.\u201d Jason came up behind me, his fingers draping my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do to prove to him that I'm not that confused, messed-up little girl I was when I left him at the altar?\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s fingers tightened comfortingly; he pressed his lips to the back of my head. \u201cGive it time, sweet girl. He\u2019ll see one day\u2014he\u2019s just gonna be the last, is all.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, touching my hand to his.</p> <p>The cuckoo clock chimed eight and, right on cue, Arthur walked in, carrying a set of keys. He waltzed straight over to the middle of the room, shifted the oak table aside like it was plastic, and kicked the rug back, bending down.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I appeared beside him.</p><p>\u201cOpening the scroll room hatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHatch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, hatch.\u201d Jason grabbed my arms gently and walked me backward as the ground sunk where I was standing.</p><p>Arthur pulled the giant key out from a dent in the stone and stepped back, too. \u201cJason, go get a lantern, please.\u201d</p> <p>I leaned closer and peered into the cold, musty-smelling space, coughing into my hand. \u201cWhen was the last time anyone was down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks ago. Morgaine came down to make a copy of the scrolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know we\u2019re going in there tonight?\u201d</p><p>Arthur hesitated. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Nate?\u201d Jason called out, passing a lantern to Arthur.</p><p>\u201cYerp?\u201d Nate\u2019s head popped over the railing on the next floor.</p><p>\u201cKeep watch. Anyone comes, holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d He saluted and disappeared over the railing again.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. Let me show you my theory,\u201d Jason said, tweezing a corner of the scroll to flatten it.</p><p>I leaned in to look closer, holding the candle up to see the text. \u201cThat's a lot of weird symbols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. So, I\u2019ve interpreted these runes to the ancient language.\u201d He pointed to a sheet of paper beside the scroll. \u201cAnd here, I've translated the ancient language to English. Now, see the words in brackets here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've underlined those words on this page. What that means is that there are a few different interpretations from the symbols to the spoken words, and even to English. We have several words that can mean what these do\u2014\u201d He pointed to the three underlined words.</p><p>\u201cSo, this symbol that looks like a fork with curly prongs can mean...\u201d I tried to read the words in the ancient language on the next page, but couldn't even begin to pronounce them, so I went straight to the English translation. \u201cPure one, noble or even clean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Arthur. \u201cDo you agree with that, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look over them once you\u2019re done,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes on the few loose leafs he was reading, sitting in the armchair across the room.</p><p>Jason rolled his eyes when I looked back at him. \u201cAnyway, as you can see, the English translation reads, A time will come for the Pure One to rise. In Her reign of light and hope, she will free the land of the fated curse and bear a child with great power.\u201d He grabbed the other piece of paper and placed them side by side. \u201cHere\u2019s where it gets tricky. See, this line says something along the lines of, A child, possible only if conceived of pure\u2014\u201d He pointed to the English words. \u201cBut can also mean noble blood\u2014knight. Not necessarily even knight with a capital K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it could be any knight\u2014any noble blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and this word\u2014\u201d He pointed to another between the words Born as and Son. \u201cThis symbol actually has no translation. It\u2019s similar to a word meaning firstborn, but also to one meaning disguised.\u201d</p><p>A line of question marks floated past my eyes. \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Arthur glanced up from his papers and watched us for a second. He looked like an old man, like he should be wearing a silk robe, smoking a pipe while drinking Scotch. I smiled at him; he didn't smile back.</p><p>\u201cSo, then it goes on, and this is the bit that always had me confused.\u201d He showed the base of the original scroll. \u201cThis mark here is like a number from a filing system\u2014it\u2019s something you find on ancient Vampirian legal documents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect\u2014\u201d He looked at Arthur. \u201cThat this isn\u2019t actually a prophecy at all, but a contract.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Arthur sat taller.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, like, someone signed my child over to Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould even be that someone signed you over to him\u2014promised you\u2019d be born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the pure blood\u2014the noble\u2014could that be...me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it clearly talks about a child that will have pure blood, but, like I said, I think this symbol means it wasn\u2019t a foretold child, but a promised one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Drake made a deal with someone?\u201d My eyes widened. \u201cMaybe even Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. That\u2019s enough.\u201d Arthur stood, dumping his pages on the lamp table. \u201cStop filling the girl\u2019s head with your stories, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Uncle Arthur\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that's enough.\u201d Arthur grabbed the lantern and took me by the hand. \u201cIf you have even half a brain, my dear, you will stop worrying about what these scrolls say and start worrying about an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d He led me to the stairs, leaving Jason behind. \u201cYour head has been filled with enough misinterpretations of that damn scroll, and I've had it. This all needs to stop.\u201d</p><p>We reached the library again and Arthur blew the lantern out.</p><p>\u201cWhy don't you just tell me what your interpretation is, then?\u201d I stopped and spun to face him. \u201cIf you seem to know so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my notes on the prophecy are at Elysium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull shi\u2014that\u2019s a lie, Arthur!\u201d I challenged. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019d come here and not bring those notes\u2014or at least have them committed to memory. So, what are you hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201d</p><p>As Jason came up the stairs, he unrolled a page and held it up to the light. \u201cUncle Arthur, she needs to see the truth.\u201d</p><p>Arthur gazed at it, then at me, and stepped back. \u201cGo on then. Read that last line to her, and you will see why I asked you to stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Jase frowned at his uncle, clearly trying to read his motive. \u201cIt says, If the child is conceived, all shall be restored to what it once was. And that\u2019s where the scroll ends,\u201d Jason said, rolling it back up. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s been torn off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll will be restored?\u201d I said it over in my head, too, thinking about it all. \u201cIs that what Morg interprets to mean my child can free the Immortal Damned\u2014restore them, make them human again?\u201d</p><p>Arthur kept his eyes on Jason as he said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...that\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d My eyes watered as they brushed over Arthur\u2019s frown. \u201cIs there even any hope of freeing the Damned?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed and glared at Jason. \u201cShe needed that hope. This is exactly why I didn\u2019t want you meddling in this!\u201d</p><p>My teary gaze followed Arthur out of the room then landed on Jason. \u201cWhat does he mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn't know what he means, Ara. Look, I just wanted you to see that these scrolls can be interpreted any way you want them to be.\u201d He walked over and closed the hatch in the floor. \u201cI actually believe in the hope for the Immortal Damned, but I think it\u2019s in you\u2014not your child.\u201d</p><p>I swiped a few fat, lukewarm tears from my cheeks. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That power of yours is said to start hearts, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It could be that simple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trickiest problems usually have the most basic solution.\u201d He grinned, pressing the translated pages into my palm. \u201cI think we need to get a move on examining your powers from a scientific point of view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScientific?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you're all energy and light. It should be studied, not forced. Maybe we should reopen the laboratory in the west wing. Could even give Arthur a place to make his herbal potions again and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. We have a lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been shut down for two hundred years, so I'm not sure we can call it a lab, really, and the space is a bit dusty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don't we fix it up then\u2014renovate, make it like Drake\u2019s New York labs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jason\u2019s smile spread like the first light of day. \u201cYou\u2019d really let us set up a new lab\u2014here? At Loslilian? A real lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cMaybe you could even research more ways to kill vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He grabbed my shoulder, looking at the ground. \u201cThat would be a dream come true. I\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI tried so hard to get on the scientific team in New York, but when it came to the interviews, it was between myself and a man who\u2019d studied under Einstein, so I got stuck with the Blood Army instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are you qualified to be Head of Research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQualified?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cMore than. I've spent my entire vampire life at university studying. I only quit a few years ago when I joined the Blood Army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you go to university if you had to leave every year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but it made my experience broader. It meant that I was taught by hundreds of different lecturers and, as a result, was exposed to many different opinions and lessons. So, it was hard, but beneficial at the same time.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my butt on one of the tables. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll need to get approval from the House, but, I\u2019ll run it by them in the next House meeting. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his mouth wide with a smile. \u201cThat would be, for lack of a better word, wicked!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I sat on the deckchair in the lower garden, reading my book, enjoying the sunshine and a quiet moment to myself. But shadows formed around my face and the sweet scent of orange-chocolate filled the air.</p><p>\u201cGuess who?\u201d said a voice in my ear.</p><p>\u201cUh, gee, is it...\u201d I turned around, pulling the hand down from my eyes, and gasped. \u201cOh, my God. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The face of my husband grinned back at me. \u201cWhat, I\u2019ve been here for days, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cYeah, sorry, Jason. I just meant what are you doing in the garden?\u201d</p><p>David sat on the deckchair next to mine, running his hand over the warm golden tones in his hair. \u201cI came to check if you were okay, you know, after finding out about your dad the other day.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI'm...coping. I mean, it was a shock, but, I'm kind of getting used to it now. And you never called me, by the way. I\u2019ve been waiting for you to let me know if you got any info from that book of Arthur\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d He reached across and took my hand. \u201cSorry. I just forgot to mention it. Did you take that pregnancy test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really any need. You said you couldn't smell any difference in my scent.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on mine. \u201cI\u2019d still like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We have one in the Medic room. I\u2019ll do it later and text you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d His secret smile showed that lovely dimple in the side of his cheek, making his eyes sparkle like the Emerald City. \u201cI uh...I spoke to that friend of yours\u2014the one you asked to have a word with me about not being around to make a baby.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, I'm sorry. It\u2019s just bad timing. I'm too busy, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now,\u201d I said suggestively.</p><p>He looked at the book in my lap and smiled. \u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my book, too. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I ground my back teeth together, the irritation making a question I was going to leave alone\u2014in the past\u2014creep up my tongue. \u201cHey, Da\u2014Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Nate say that Em was, quote, \u2018David's Emily\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shifted to the side, his spine straightening. \u201cHe said that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In front of everyone.\u201d My voice quivered. \u201cSo what did he mean by that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cleared his throat and sat back, dropping my hand. \u201cWhat are you really asking, Ara?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a long moment. \u201cDid you sleep with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEver. I don't know. You share blood, you were clearly \u2018best buds\u2019 in high school.\u201d I sat up, placing my feet to the floor in front of David's. \u201cHave you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>His gaze stayed on my feet. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook me in the eye and say that.\u201d</p><p>He looked me in the eye, the pupil small and black, swimming in the green. \u201cNo. I never slept with Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she your girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just...she...\u201d He ran his hand through his hair again. \u201cWhen I first got to the school, Emily was the only nice person there. I had to work my way up in the ranks, Ara. I was pretty much the jocks\u2019 punching bag for the first semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed. \u201cGood thing I can handle a punch. But it wasn\u2019t until I joined the football team that people started to respect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you let them treat you like that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat can I say; I was pretty broken. I just didn't care.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled his hand from mine. \u201cEmily was nice to me, Ara, and I found out a few things that made me feel kinda...I guess, bad for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThis is her personal business, my love. All I can say is that I kind of took her under my wing\u2014told the jocks to lay off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just...they just treated her like a piece of meat. She didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He stood up, his shadow taking the warmth of the sun from my face. \u201cIt doesn't matter. It\u2019s in the past. I protected her, I guess. Made it seem like we were some kind of item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you owned her?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was okay with this?\u201d</p><p>He turned around to face me, dropping his hands from his head. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know she was in love with you back then?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah. But...it was little-girl-love, Ara. Very different to how she feels for Mike now.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I understood that love only too well.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d Walter said, coming down the stairs toward us.</p><p>\u201cWalter,\u201d David said, tipping an imaginary hat. \u201cLovely day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid. And I see you\u2019re making yourself acquainted with our queen.\u201d Walter clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cSo, there may be hope for this prophecy child after all?\u201d</p><p>David turned his head and winked at me. \u201cIf I have anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>I nearly laughed. He played his brother so well even I was convinced; he became lighter\u2014the weight of the world leaving his shoulders, his eyes and his voice for a second.</p><p>\u201cGood. Good. Hopefully we\u2019ll have word of an heir within the month, then we can name you king.\u201d</p><p>David bowed, smiling, and Walter headed down the base of the garden, leaving us alone again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to announce it next month,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't,\u201d he said, sitting down, the weighted, stiff version of David taking over the light-hearted act of his brother.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll check you if there\u2019re no obvious signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He held his hands up. \u201cI know we said it would be good to flush out ulterior motives and to get Ja...me crowned, but things have changed. It won\u2019t be so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d</p><p>He sat back. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. There\u2019s nothing to be done. We\u2019ll just catch Drake and leave it at that. If we drain him and starve him, his immunity will fade and then we can kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that's the plan? Just catch him and kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, yes.\u201d He frowned down at his hands. \u201cI just...I don't think you're ready for a child, Ara. And I know you\u2019ll do it for the sake of your people and the Immortal Damned, but they\u2019re not suffering right now and there are other ways we can kill Drake. I don't want to put you through a teen pregnancy if I don't have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I can't handle it?\u201d</p><p>He scratched his cheekbone. \u201cIt\u2019s not to be insulting, my love. I just...you\u2019re only nineteen.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to be insulted, but I was a little bit too happy for that.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and wrapped my arms around his neck. \u201cThank you, Da\u2014son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He laughed, patting my elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I'm not ready to have a baby, but I...I just didn't want to let everyone down.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me tight. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I smiled into his neck. \u201cYou always know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, for now, I need you to continue this fake relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I gasped, sitting back.</p><p>\u201cIt gives me time. While the people are waiting for you to turn up pregnant, they\u2019re not hassling for a wedding or pushing you to bare a child. They\u2019re at ease. If you \u2018break up\u2019 with Jason, they may actually force you to fornicate with a man of their choosing, and something tells me it might end up being Walter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalter? Why him?\u201d I nearly threw up.</p><p>David laughed. \u201cThe House want him in power. He\u2019s one of the people we\u2019ve been watching closely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he's Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Exactly why no one would suspect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn't he sworn to the throne of Lilith?\u201d</p><p>David smirked, sniffing once. \u201cCan you keep this to yourself?\u201d</p><p>I nodded eagerly.</p><p>\u201cYou can't tell Jason\u2014or think it around him.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cWalt doesn't have a Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>David sat back, making himself comfortable, as if he was Jason. \u201cI snuck into his quarters and saw it for myself. He\u2019s pretending to have taken an oath. In fact, I bet if you compelled him to do something, he\u2019d do it just to keep that pretence up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you think he wants the throne?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, squinting in the sun. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I clicked my tongue. \u201cAll this royalty and conspiracy stuff really sucks. Will there ever be any rest?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and sat up again. \u201cWhen Drake is gone, yes, I trust that things will change. And...I actually feel better knowing my brother is watching over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most powerful vampires here, Ara, and that\u2019s...partially why I want him to pose as your partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want him with me twenty-four-seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that often.\u201d He reached out and tickled my ribs, making me squirm; I grabbed his hand and held it tight. \u201cBut, yes, for the most part, I want him with you\u2014especially now we no longer have your personal guard.\u201d</p><p>I looked down. \u201cDo you think I was stupid to do that?\u201d</p><p>He lifted my chin. \u201cNo. I don't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But, I had my suspicions for a while that Mike\u2019s intentions with those guards may not have been professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think he\u2019s, like, stalking me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed aloud. \u201cI think he\u2019s...he\u2019s not used to letting you go off by yourself. He\u2019s always been there\u2014always been your...bodyguard. Even when you were kids. And, I know you liked that because he made you feel safe\u2014he was almost like the father-figure you needed. And that\u2019s a twisted way to look at it, I know, but I believe he\u2019s having a hard time not being the number-one man in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s not over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he is. But it\u2019s a habit for him to be this way with you. And you pulling against that, trying to grow up\u2014go out on your own branch, it\u2019s got him panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike he's gonna lose me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr just...that things will change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they have changed. We\u2019re vampires.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot much has changed, Ara. You\u2019re still under his wing. You\u2019re still his little \u2018baby girl\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, straightening his collar. \u201cWith a face like this? I got no need to be worried about Mike.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened wide for the breathy giggle his sexy self-appreciation forced from my lips. \u201cI love it when you play around like that. I miss that version of you.\u201d</p><p>I saw his heart melt a bit in the warmth of his eyes. \u201cI miss it, too. I miss us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coping okay\u2014being alone all the time?\u201d</p><p>I sat back, clicking my thumbnails over each other. \u201cYeah, for now. But I miss having someone to talk to, you know\u2014someone who listens and doesn\u2019t roll their eyes at me if I ask a stupid question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of question?\u201d</p><p>I looked right at him. \u201cDon't roll your eyes at me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He touched his chest. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, um, Drake never made an oath. So...how come Ja\u2014you could be compelled by him?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, exaggerating the move, and we both laughed. \u201cNo, um, it\u2019s actually because, without a true queen\u2014a pure blood that\u2019s connected to the Stone\u2014an oath made to any ruler would be upheld\u2014even the president of the Untied States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so, now that I'm queen, Drake would have to kill me to get allegiance back?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay. And...when you\u2019re king, you\u2019ll be One with Mother Nature, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because you actually swear me in by your blood\u2014as the one true king.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, like, I cut myself and bleed on your blood\u2014that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said softly, and slowly wound a finger under his, then slipped my hand all the way into his palm.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not rolling your eyes at me, like, well, for not meaning it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAra, I love you. And I know how your mind works\u2014\u201d He tapped his head. \u201cYou miss things. It doesn't make you stupid; it just means you were thinking about something more important at the time.\u201d</p><p>I smiled down at our hands. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing the fool.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...everyone thinks I'm an idiot. No one trusts me, or my opinion, and I just feel like\u2014\u201d I looked up and shrugged. \u201cWhat am I even doing here?\u201d</p><p>By command of a slight tug of his hand, we stood up and he wrapped his arms over my shoulders, kissing the top of my head. \u201cMy love, you don't see what other people see. You haven\u2019t stopped to look back and realise what you've achieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t achieved anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven't you?\u201d He tilted my chin up. \u201cDid you not give Eric the dream he always wanted; did you not give hundreds of vampires a new home, did you not turn their loved ones immortal? Have you not seen the rescue and freedom of four hundred tortured Lilithians, and have you not changed the lives of those Damned, so dramatically that when I went to see them, one of those kids hugged me\u2014actually hugged me, having remembered me from fifty years ago when I gave him an extra cup of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled down at me. \u201cAnd look at you, my girl in the yellow dress. You\u2019re still her\u2014still that same girl, but you\u2019ve changed so many lives. Look how far we\u2019ve come from that first day at school when I accidently called you Ara-Rose in the library and nearly bit my own tongue off for it.\u201d He stroked his thumb over my locket as I laughed lightly. \u201cDon't tell me you're not worth anything, Ara, because you are the blessing in so many people\u2019s lives, and you don't even know it.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lips in, unable to see through my tears.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, and pulled me in for the tightest, most loving hug I ever had. \u201cI'm sorry I can't be here to tell you this every day, but you know I love you, and you know I am always here for you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded into his shirt, letting myself cry, safe and loved in his arms.</p><p>As the conversations died down and the candles burned to the last, waxy remains under the wick, I looked over at Arthur and smiled. He shook his head, as if my mere presence annoyed the hell out of him, and I felt my gut sink.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d Jason landed in Mike\u2019s empty chair. Morgaine didn\u2019t even bother looking up this time; she just sighed and pushed her peas around her plate with her fork.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't worry about Arthur,\u201d he said quietly, reaching under the table to take my hand.</p><p>I curled my fingers over his. \u201cI don't like it when people are mad at me.\u201d</p><p>We both looked up at Arthur then, who turned his head a fraction, breaking himself away from a conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason gave me a reassuring smile. \u201cHey, why don't you come to the lighthouse with me tonight?

As he passed, I looked up, hoping he\u2019d at least make eye contact. He didn't.</p><p>\u201cStop feeling bad, Ara.\u201d Jason slid closer in the seat, leaning his elbow on the table, practically face to face with me. \u201cIn human years, he\u2019s nearly twice your age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s only thirty.\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cAnd you're nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's hardly twice my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014but it sounded more repulsive.\u201d He sat back in his chair. \u201cHe\u2019s like my father\u2014it\u2019s disturbing to me that you\u2019re friends with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI'm sorry. I know that\u2019s unfair, but it\u2019s also that...clearly, you\u2019re hurt by his not speaking to you, and...I don't like that. I don't want you to be sad.\u201d</p><p>I stood up. \u201cI'm going to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to sort this out.\u201d</p><p>Jason folded his arms, entertained. \u201cYou just can\u2019t leave anything alone, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when people are hurting, Jason.\u201d I shook my head and walked from the room.</p> <p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d He grabbed my arm. \u201cWhat about the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there after.\u201d</p><p>He stayed put, his eyes burning into my back as I walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I drew a breath. \u201cI was thinking about some of our earlier conversations, and I remembered you said that you used the war as an excuse to turn Jason and David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...it was their idea to go, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s, yes. I believe David followed so as not to appear a coward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? I was under the impression he followed to protect Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave you that impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d</p><p>Arthur frowned. \u201cHm. Why do you ask, anyway, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when we first met, you and I, after the...the whole kidnapping thing, you said something about the blood feud\u2014about it being the reason you changed them.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slowly became straighter all the way across. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then you also said that Drake had made a deal with you, that if he let the boys live here after Arietta died, you\u2019d change them when they grew up. So, it\u2019s connected, right? Drake wanted the boys immortal because he knew, even then, that they had something to do with this prophecy\u2014and the prophecy has something to do with the feud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, Amara, I'm not so sure now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany things have come to light since that day, and what I knew then was only half of what I have come to learn since.\u201d He moistened his lips. \u201cFor many centuries, I gave this prophecy little thought. I knew it foretold a child and the involvement of knight blood, and in the back of my mind, wondered if it spoke of myself and my blood\u2014my heir. But I never believed it would come to fruition\u2014until Drake strangely requested I turn the boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that change your belief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, for Drake to request such a thing directly contradicted the agreement he and I made in the days before I became immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat agreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if I was to be his loyal, eternal servant, I would honour the promise to my dying brother, and watch over his family and their descendants for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not turn them into vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. My brother knew what I was about to become. He was also given the option, but he believed vampirism to be sinful lifestyle. He chose to die along with many others in those following years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he die of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Black Death.\u201d Arthur looked down at his open palm. \u201cIn my new state, free of human limitations, I was able to comfort many people as they passed\u2014most of them had already watched their own children wither, and die. And when my brother took his last breath, a part of me wished I had gone with him. But I had made my choice, and I kept my promise to watch over his bloodline, until I broke it for the sake of David and Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how did Drake\u2019s request to turn them make you connect the boys to the prophecy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake is a man of honour; he upholds his word, no matter what. For whatever reason he needed those boys immortal, it must have been of great importance to him. I concluded that it had something to do with this prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, so, you thought David was the Knight the prophecy spoke of then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was born first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your interpretation of the scrolls was different to Morgaine\u2019s, wasn't it? So why did you think David was the one?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flickered. I could see he hadn't expected me to be so alert, and I was starting to wonder if he was getting caught up in his own lies. \u201cI have reasons for keeping my interpretations to myself all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn't sure who I could trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Drake told Morgaine about the prophecy. He very rarely confides in a person for the sake of an eased conscience. I had no way of knowing what he had truly said or even offered her to either help fulfil the prophecy or see no one ever heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want it to come true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we can trust Morgaine now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm still not sure. But as long as her aim is to see you safe and in power, then it seems we all have the same agenda.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands, seeing the history, the lineage, the ancient ancestral connections in all the fine lines. \u201cDid...were you searching for a Lilithian\u2014or did you just stumble across me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t searching, but I believe Drake was. However, we found you purely by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Amara\u2014my grandmother? Was finding her an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Drake\u2019s scouts found her,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cSo I have no way of knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know David hadn't really killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I actually went to kidnap her from the orphanage, but she had already been adopted\u2014and her family, when I searched for them, had disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack then, I suspected that Drake had discovered David's lie and taken to kill the child and all humans who knew she existed. But, David was never arrested for lying, so I had to move on with the belief that Drake was unaware, and the hope that maybe Vampirie had found the infant, instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, none of this makes sense.\u201d I scratched my eyebrow. \u201cDrake knew about this prophecy\u2014told Morgaine of a child that could kill him, and then made sure the only man who was capable of fathering that child was turned into a vampire, and gave the only remaining Lilithian at the time to a newbie Council leader to kill. I thought he was trying to stop this prophecy from happening\u2014not help it along.\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded to himself, then smiled. \u201cI never quite understand why Mike has so little faith in you. You\u2019re a very clever girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I'm right? He could have just killed David when he was born if he didn't want this to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this isn\u2019t just about Drake being afraid of a vampire-hunting kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, it would take a lot more than a powerful child to turn Drake in fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why does he want me dead\u2014my child dead? And why did he kill David if he thought he was the prophecy knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you concluded about David's death, at this point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Drake wanted him dead because of the prophecy, but that he couldn\u2019t let anyone else know about it, so David died under the disguise of laws he\u2019d broken\u2014by associating with me.\u201d</p><p>Arthur breathed out through his nose. \u201cThe truth, my dear, is what I already told you\u2014that David broke the law. Drake himself could not change the outcome of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, if David's the prophecy knight, then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a word in the prophecy. You saw it\u2014saw that the whole document is written in hieroglyphics. That language has no real base. Some say the English language was based on that of the Ancients, but I see no real evidence of that aside from the pattern of words. But there was one rune, between son of and knight, that may depict firstborn, however, this could also mean many things. In my own interpretation, it can mean \u2018a\u2019 son of knight, and I believe Drake also reads it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, in your interpretation, the knight could even be Jason?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded.</p><p>\u201cOr you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s any possibility it could be a contract?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his stubbly chin. \u201cIt\u2019s a clever theory. And, in truth, there may be some fact there. I noticed that same mark and thought nothing of it. Our laws and filing systems changed so much over the centuries that it took a person who studied our society as subject in History to point out something I should have seen. But, if we focus on that, we lose sight of what\u2019s important, and right now, killing Drake is at the top of the priority list\u2014especially if that is, indeed, a contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d I tried to piece things together in my head. \u201cWhat does he want my child for if she can't kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she cannot kill him, or that she will not have the power to mortalise vampires, but his true interest in your child is not known to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I stood up, shoving my chair back with my legs. \u201cNo more lies. I already know, Arthur. Jason told me you're here to steal my child and give it to Drake.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, rubbing a hand across his mouth. \u201cJason knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, calm. \u201cWhat else has he told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he doesn't believe you\u2019re a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know that? You came here on Drake\u2019s request.\u201d</p><p>He appeared beside me, taking my trembling hand. \u201cI was already planning my stay here when I was called to Drake\u2019s bedside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis bedside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was dying,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cHe had consumed the entire box of blood stores Jason took from you in order to survive that venom-tipped sword, and even then, he was struggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he knows about immunity\u2014that\u2019s how you found out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, he called you to him for what\u2014to come get more blood from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My king addressed me as his friend, not his council leader. He thanked me for all that I had done and asked that I go to Loslilian on one last mission before I took my leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo impregnate me and kidnap our baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...there was something else.\u201d</p><p>Arthur wandered across the room, then opened his drawer. \u201cLoslilian is also home to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked, eyeing a box very similar to the one Nhym came in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Dagger of Yahanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d He flipped the lid and spun the box around on the table so I could see inside; above the bone blade, the hilt was twisted silver, rising up around a red stone, like snakes on a Celtic Knot. \u201cThis dagger is said to be spelled; that if Drake uses this on the Stone of Truth, forces it through the heart of your infant child, he will gain all power the child holds. Including the rumoured power to reverse immortality.\u201d</p><p>Bingo! The truth. I tried not to grin. \u201cBut...if my child can do that anyway, why would he want to take that from her? Why not just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s power. Why would anyone follow a dark entity when they can follow the light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he holds all power, he reigns supreme.\u201d I nodded to myself, feeling numb. \u201cAnd, what...he promised you mortality if you gave up my baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I felt my fingertips twitch, a stroke across his face their destination.</p><p>\u201cBut it was a lie.\u201d He grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you really here?\u201d I yanked away from him.</p><p>\u201cBecause this goes deeper than any of us can possibly imagine. I am here to protect you\u2014protect the world from what may come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it\u2014what does Drake know? What kind of power will that child have that he\u2019s willing to wait six centuries for it?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed my own words, dropping back on my heels.</p><p>\u201cThis is not just about the reversal of immortality, Amara, because, quite frankly, Drake does not give a damn whether a vampire wants to live or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...\u201d I unclenched my fists. \u201cWhat does he want her for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d he said, then sighed, pinching his brow. \u201cLook, after Drake let you escape, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me escape?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arthur half laughed. \u201cYes. My dear, if he truly wanted you dead that day, you would have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought he thought I was dead all that time\u2014before I was crowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He knows all that goes on in that castle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen he must know Jason\u2019s alive.\u201d And David.</p><p>\u201cPossibly. But many other people also knew you were still alive. No one knew about Jason. He was taken away with the rest of the dead.\u201d</p><p>I pictured that in my mind; a pile of bloodied bodies, and Jason beneath them.</p><p>\u201cThe castle was unattended for a long period of time preceding that,\u201d Arthur continued. \u201cYour escape happened before Drake was stabbed. Anything after might have slipped his attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if he let me escape because he wanted me to have this kid, then he\u2019s not really going to attack us, is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>\u201cHow long will he give us to deliver what he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled nervously, numb and confused, sitting on the chair again. \u201cI bet he was pissed when the council arrested me in the first place, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He was muttering something about changing tactic when I first entered his chamber.\u201d He knelt down in front of me. \u201cI promised him I would come to Loslilian, father a child with you, and bring it to him. But that was never my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is your intention, Arthur?\u201d</p> <p>He sighed heavily, standing up. \u201cAt first, I was going to help you flee the country, change your identity\u2014make you safe. But, after Drake told me of the dagger, I went to the library to research the location and legend surrounding it. All I found was Drake\u2019s Book of Shadows, which had a half a page of information, a spell Drake had placed on it long ago, and ripped away and stuffed in the back of the book, I found a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't remember the exact words, because when I returned to the library after getting the Dictionary of Translation, the note was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho took it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no way of knowing. All I know is that the runes I remembered on the note gave indication that the dagger had another use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChopping up steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed and gently lifted the dagger from the box, squatting before me again. \u201cThat, if wielded by one deemed ruler by the mother of the Earth, one who is sworn in on the Stone of Truth, it could pierce the heart of any vampire, and send its soul to the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot just kill.\u201d He rested his elbow over one knee, loosely holding the dagger. \u201cDo you remember being told that it is near impossible to sever the connection of a Lilithian soul from the realm of life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires are not so different. Our souls are created immortal\u2014to reincarnate over and over again. They are the reason only some humans can be turned to vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s because of the sucky gene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s because you must have a soul capable of immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a gene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no gene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a lie made up to generate fear\u2014to stop vampires changing men randomly and creating the wars we had at the beginning of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d I frowned at nothing. \u201cThat gene lie caused so much trouble for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He patted my knee. \u201cBut, even if it were true, and you had the gene, you could not have been a vampire, because you were born of Lilithian blood. You cannot be Vampirian and Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it just...I just wish I knew then what I know now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do we all,\u201d he said sympathetically. \u201cBut, even if you\u2019d known you were Lilithian back when Jason bit you at the masquerade, it wouldn't have saved you from slipping into a coma as the venom poisoned your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But, it would have saved David a lot of anguish for thinking I was going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could have trusted him to protect you, knowing what you were, I would have told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was concerned, at first, that his love for the law outweighed his love for you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded to myself. \u201cSo, how can you tell if someone has an immortal soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in their eyes. Have you ever met someone, seen a child born who has a certain depth about them\u2014wise, as if they\u2019ve been here before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are the souls who reincarnate\u2014the ones who become great leaders, wise prophets, scientists\u2014vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, what about Lilithians? No human has ever died when being turned Lilithian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We believe the Lilithian venom can immortalise a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure, but your kind is so much closer to nature than the Vampirian bloodline and all its created. Perhaps a way to look at it would be that one is created of God, the other manmade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are there many immortal souls in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, roughly over a third of today\u2019s population.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, those Drake turned to create his new army\u2014why did so many die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was exactly the question I asked myself, and my answer was\u2014\u201d He stood up again, \u201c\u2014I suspect he killed half of them deliberately to maintain the lie of the gene. Our people would ask questions if he suddenly created masses of vampires from mere men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So the story unfolds,\u201d I said; Arthur laughed. \u201cSo, this dagger can send an immortal soul to heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrevents it from reincarnating.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the dagger. \u201cThen, it could kill you, or even me?\u201d</p><p>Arthur touched the tip of his finger to it. \u201cYes. But only if wielded by the hand of the king\u2014an entity we do not posses. Unless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy right of heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that's why you want a child with me\u2014not because of the prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So I can kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to be the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, there is something else you must know about this dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He angled it to the light, making the silver sparkle on the edge of the hilt. \u201cHe who drives the dagger takes the fate of that beneath it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever kills Drake will die along with him.\u201d</p><p>My lips parted, cold breath making them dry.</p><p>\u201cDo you see, Amara, I never wanted to hurt you; never wanted to have a child with you for my own selfish reasons. I want to die, knowing I've taken that son of a bitch to Hell with me, and that, in the process, I would be saving my nephews.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking up quickly when the ring of his plural registered in my ears. \u201cNephews? Then you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat David's alive, yes.\u201d He nodded.</p><p>My jaw almost hit the floor. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed, leaning back on the table. \u201cI suspected it for a while. But, the Coronation Ball was a dead giveaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled him all over you. At first I thought Jason had come back, but you were much too melancholy for that to be the case. And Jason was supposedly out of the country. It meant only one thing...my David was alive.\u201d His lip pulled into a smile as he turned around, placed Yahanna in its box and closed the lid.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you tell me you knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure you even knew. I watched you closely when you cried for him, when you were sad talking about him, and I could not, for the life of me, decipher your true emotions. I thought maybe he had come to you that day, while you slept, and kissed your hair to show you how proud he was, but that you were left unaware.\u201d</p><p>I touched a hand to my chest, feeling it burn. \u201cThen why didn't you just ask me if I knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, my dear, if David believed it was safer for you to be left in the dark, I would respect that. I know nothing of his intentions or plans, only that he has good reason for every decision he makes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you think he knows that the dagger can kill Drake?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cI suspect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you weren\u2019t surprised when I mentioned the dagger, which means Jason knows about that as well, and if Jason knows, there is no way he would keep that kind of information from his own brother.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMy David is a smart boy. He knows what this dagger does by now, I would bet my life on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he thinks he has to kill Drake? Is that what he plans to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I know him, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...why isn't he here? Why hasn't he come to see me, tell me, spend time with me before he just wanders off to die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure, but whatever his reasons, it must pose some risk to you for him to be here. Or\u2014\u201d He took a moment before continuing. \u201cOr he is mentally preparing you for his death?\u201d</p><p>My chest lifted, moving my shoulders with each panicked breath. \u201cBy leaving me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps to learn to cope without him\u2014to see you do not need him to be strong.\u201d</p><p>The tears broke past restraint. I cried into my hand, my shoulders shaking. \u201cHow can he live with that? How can he have known all this time that he\u2019s going to die\u2014going to give up our forever, and not tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine he would not have wanted to see you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s ridiculous! So, he was just going to go off and die, and what, someone else would pick up the pieces?\u201d</p><p>Arthur sighed, sympathy warming his soft smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. No! He doesn't get to do this. He doesn't get to just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, calm down.\u201d He cupped both my shoulders, holding me firmly. \u201cIt doesn't have to be that way. It won't be that way.\u201d</p><p>I shook, letting my head fall against his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd...you understand now, that I'm not the creepy uncle trying to fondle his niece in-law?\u201d He stroked my hair gently. \u201cMy offer of a child still stands, but it may not be the prophecy child\u2014if she is, indeed, possible. However, it will save your husband from certain death\u2014a death he is only too aware he's headed for.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered. \u201cSo, we have to stop the coronation from happening. If he gets crowned\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s all he\u2019s waiting for\u2014aside from the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he hasn't found it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s still here, so, you needn\u2019t worry. And he won't find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that, my dear\u2014\u201d he nodded to the box, \u201c\u2014is not the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere's the real one?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cOnly I know that. And it will remain that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsurance policy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s to protect those who seek to protect you, from themselves.\u201d</p><p>I ran that over in my head.</p><p>\u201cBy stopping David from using the dagger,\u201d he clarified, \u201cI am stopping him from letting it fall into Drake\u2019s hands. Without that, your child is merely a child. He can kill her, but there would be little point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept to take revenge on me for being Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>Arthur shook his head softly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Amara, I told you already; everything any vampire living today knows about Lilith is based on rumours created by Drake himself. Some people don't even know what year this all took place. I once heard Eric reference the death of Lilith to have occurred in early thirteen hundred, and had to laugh to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen hundred and\u2014I can't remember the exact year. But I know she ruled for only twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, Arthur?\u201d I looked at him carefully, swallowing my nerves. \u201cThis child...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He held his hand up, looking down. \u201cSay no more. We\u2019ve shared enough for tonight, my dear, and I do believe you have a lighthouse date with a certain nephew of mine.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He helped me to stand. \u201cGo relax, have some fun; we can talk more about this tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll....\u201d It all started to sink in. \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll give it some very serious thought.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHowever, I know that mind-block of yours is getting stronger, but you must be careful to keep this from Jason, or we will have a fight on our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his head to one side, smiling. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think he\u2019ll want to father the child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014so he can die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My heart turned hard inside my chest. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Arthur stood staring at nothing, biting his lip a little. \u201cThis stays between us.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen the council brought Eric before them to question his whereabouts on the night several people had reported seeing David, he lied, told them he had been with Jason and his girlfriend. But when the security tapes were checked, evidence proved that the man in the tape was David. Eric was arrested and sentenced to six years hard torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said into my fist.</p><p>\u201cJason panicked\u2014told the council he and Eric had been following David, that they\u2019d not reported his whereabouts because they suspected he would lead them to a pure blood Lilithian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He had no way of knowing then exactly what he had set in motion, and he had no intentions of ever letting them catch you. I was there when he confessed to the king, and it is only that confession that saved both himself and Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what did Drake do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He stood in the shadows while his World Council discussed our options and made plans for David's arrest and your capture. I reported the information back to Jason each evening, and we devised our own plan\u2014to help you escape. But we needed a back-up plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were only too aware of what would happen to you if they brought you in. One of us, who cared for you, needed to be approved as your persecutor. And I knew Jason\u2019s good soul could not handle that. I offered to be the one, but he fought me on it\u2014said that you were safe in his hands\u2014that no one in this world could possibly love you the way he does, and in that, could not torture you delicately enough.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered, my gentle exhalations jagged.</p><p>\u201cI put forward the request for this young Blood Warrior to be your persecutor, and strangely, Drake approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason was young, new to the army, not really qualified for this kind of mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d been denied, would you have applied?\u201d</p> <p>He looked at his feet. \u201cYes, but, to be honest, when Drake approved Jason, I was relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't want to hurt you. I\u2019d seen your pretty face once or twice when I\u2019d checked up on David, and it tore my heart out to even think of you suffering. I'm afraid I would have blown our cover in the first act. But Jason\u2019s heart was stronger, as was his love for you, and he knew the importance of holding out until help came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was it\u2014he was going to kill himself after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason sat me down, made me swear an oath on our bloodline that I would get you to safety when the time came. When he asked this of me, I realised only then that he did not plan to live with what he\u2019d be forced to do to you. He didn't want that burden on his soul.\u201d He rubbed his brow fiercely, then dropped his hand into folded arms. \u201cThe plan was for him to erase everything from your mind, then erase himself from this world. And the fact that his plans to kidnap you and keep you safe failed, meant that everything you suffered was his fault\u2014because he told the council of your existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did that to save Eric, Arthur. That wasn't his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I argued this with him, but he\u2019d made up his mind. He took an extra vial of your venom, planning to use it for his own death, until later that week, when we realised that Drake was playing along too easily with Jason\u2019s excuses as to why he hadn't finished the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying along?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm. You see, Drake is a hard man; he does not allow excuses, of any kind. But he allowed this. And it seemed strange that each time the council gathered to watch your torture on the monitor, Drake had somewhere else to be, almost as if he couldn't watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn't he watch?\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled softly at my face. \u201cYou\u2019re his niece, essentially. He\u2019s always been a family man, and he loved Lilith. I believe it pained him to see you cry that way.\u201d</p><p>I looked away then, from the wash of hurt across Arthur\u2019s face as he clearly remembered things he\u2019d seen. \u201cDid you watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome, yes. Only for Jason\u2019s sake, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it for his sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was watching him for signs of psychological distress. But it seemed the compulsion act Drake gave him\u2014to hate your kind\u2014helped Jason cope in those moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, when Drake refused to watch, you suspected he didn't want me dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected that this went deeper than just what we had learned about the prophecy so far. I managed to convince Jason to stay alive until we figured this out, told him that, even once we rescued you, you would not be safe from Drake. He promised to live only until we had seen Drake\u2019s demise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...he still plans to die?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to end his life just because he was forced to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just for what he did to you in that chamber, Amara, but for all he did before that. For the fact that he was at fault, for the fact that his torture of you at the masquerade was the reason I discovered you were Lilithian, but, most of all, for the guilt he suffered because of the bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the bind?\u201d</p><p>He scratched his chin with his thumb. \u201cWhen he confessed that to me, that he had tricked you into loving him under disguise of your best friend, he was so aggrieved that the words came out unintelligible. He is a good man, was always a good boy, and he let his anger turn him into something he was not\u2014something he could only try to be. But it ate away at his soul. And I know, of all the things he did to hurt both you and his brother, the bind was the one he regretted the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I forgive him for that, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But he cannot forgive himself. It would be like a man of God\u2014a priest\u2014murdering someone. The forgiveness of others does not heal the hatred we have for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth tightly, holding in a sharp snivel.</p><p>Arthur softened, coming to wrap an arm around me. \u201cWe will see this resolved, my dear. I will not stand by and see either of my nephews die. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking up into his kind eyes. \u201cArthur, how am I going to do this? How am I supposed to talk with Jason, knowing how deeply he regrets things he doesn't need to regret, and how will I see David\u2014how will I look into his eyes, knowing he believes he\u2019s going to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are strong, my dear. What David suffers for the fear of his own fate is, as far as I'm concerned, his own doing. He could have come to you\u2014he could have come to me, but he chose to deal with this on his own. That is not your burden. And, as for Jason,\u201d he said, walking me to his door. \u201cTime heals hearts. He needs your friendship right now, and that is all. Do not try to reason with him, because it will only see him tunnel into his own proverbial shell. Just hold your tongue, bide your time, and I will see that everything will be all right in the end.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him tightly. \u201cThank you, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are most welcome.\u201d He patted my back then opened the door for me.</p><p>\u201cAnd thank you, also, for...you know, for being okay after what I said to you the other day. I really need your friendship. It\u2019s...it\u2019s kind of all I have right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will always have my friendship, Amara. Even if your words have destroyed my heart, I will be here for you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him once, then walked down the corridor, wiping my face dry, nodding to convince myself I was okay.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The wind subsided as the doors closed behind us and we walked, our feet clonking up the steel steps through the barrel of the lighthouse. All around us, the smell of damp, briny leather and engine fuel on heavy ropes reminded me of the time I went on a submarine, while a strong breeze coming down in howling gusts from the room at the top of the stairs weakened the scent the higher we climbed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Arthur?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a breath, stepping more carefully, concentrating on the mind-blanket. \u201cHe\u2019s okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he unkind to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been crying. Your face is all red.\u201d</p><p>I wiped it again, massaging my cheeks to help the blood-flow. \u201cI was crying because he accepted my apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology for what?\u201d He grabbed my wrist, stopping me.</p><p>My eyes met his for a second before I started walking again. \u201cFor saying I\u2019d be sick if I slept with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn't need to apologise for that, Ara!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Well, maybe not for feeling that way, but at least for hurting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s hurt by the way you feel about him, that\u2019s his problem. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust drop it, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I spun around. \u201cThen I'm going back home to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He blocked my path, lowering his head to swallow his issues. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll drop it. I'm sorry. I just\u2014I don't like it if you\u2019re crying and I'm not there to make it okay.\u201d</p><p>I reached across and ran my fingers over his hair, feeling it slide through them like soft ribbons. \u201cI'm okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d he said, and started up the stairs again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hm?\u201d I asked, pushing past him to stay in front, as if it\u2019d help me keep the mind-blanket in place.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, but I could hear the suspicion in his tone. \u201cYou know, that dress probably wasn't really the right thing to wear up here tonight, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I looked behind me. \u201cDon't look up then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to look?\u201d He showed his palms defensively. \u201cIf you put a cute little butt in front of a guy and show him you're wearing red lace over it, he\u2019s going to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I pinned my dress to my legs. \u201cPervert.\u201d</p><p>His hand shot out and he pinched me.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't pretend you don't like it.\u201d</p><p>I huffed and started walking faster. Jason\u2019s steps picked up behind mine, the clang of metal louder as our feet thumped at full human speed\u2014the narrow walls echoing our laughter into the night.</p><p>\u201cRacing me, huh?\u201d He pushed past. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d I grabbed the handrail to pull myself up faster.</p><p>He started taking two steps at a time, leaning deep into his thighs, and reached the top before me. \u201cTold ya I\u2019d beat ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He laughed and offered his hand as I stepped up onto the wet, wooden platform of the room at the top. The wind washed a cool, salty spray across my face\u2014leaving tiny dots of moisture over my cheeks, and the gigantic globe at the centre of the room spun around, shooting light out to sea. I half expected there to be glass covering the windows, like other lighthouses I\u2019d been to when I was younger, but there wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Ara?\u201d Jase spoke slightly louder over the clatter of the wind, as if I was human and couldn't hear him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I breathed, trying not to fold over. \u201cJust a bit puffed-out.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his eyes nearly black in the dim light. \u201cYou shouldn't be puffed-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded, making myself stand straight. \u201cSo, how do we get on the roof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe climb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClimb?\u201d I gasped.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014come on.\u201d He took my hand and we stepped through the window frame onto a thin platform, wrapping the lighthouse like a balcony with no railing. \u201cStay here\u2014I\u2019ll go up first then reach back down for you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, resting my hands and butt flat against the wall, trying not to look at the crashing waves I could hear abusing the rocks below. \u201cJase?\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long?\u201d</p><p>After a few choice words in another language, Jason popped his head over the ledge above and smiled. \u201cGive me your hand?\u201d</p><p>My hand didn't want to move; it stayed stuck to the wall, safe there.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d I shook my head. The width of a wide world stood before me, open and wild, eager to challenge this girl and her need for gravity. If I reached up\u2014if I moved my hand off the wall, I would feel that space. I would feel the absence of ground, and I could fall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jump down after you if you fall, Ara. Not that I\u2019d let that happen.\u201d He hung right over the edge, using one hand to support himself, and grabbed the strap of my dress. \u201cCome on. Give me your hand.\u201d</p><p>Shaking, I moved my hand, and as soon as my fingertips were in reach, he grabbed them and hoisted me out over the ledge, swinging my body by the wrist so I came up into his arms. I screamed, hiding in his chest for a second, while the violent wind rushed up my legs, revealing my underwear. Jason swept his hands over the back of my thighs and held my dress down for me.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get down?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI'm okay. Just gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>He drew a really deep breath against the top of my head and let it out slowly, warming my hair, wrapping his arms just a little tighter around me. \u201cNo problems. You take all the time you need.\u201d</p><p>And I did. I stood there, in his arms, warm and wrapped up like a child, until the wind softened and died down to a breeze. \u201cMy legs are numb,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jase laughed and took my hand, guiding me down to the curve of the white metal roof, helping me and my shaking legs to sit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With the dark of night surrounding me, and the wind soft enough not to knock me off the edge, I took a moment to appreciate the sheer height of the lighthouse and the magnificence of everything below it. \u201cHoly cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, isn't it?\u201d Jason noted.</p><p>I nodded and rested back on my hands, tilting my chin upward to the stars. \u201cI've been meaning to get up here for so long now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you would have made it here that last time, too, but Mike got wind of your plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bonfire night.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were planning to come out here then, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded. \u201cBut how did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He linked his hands together under his bent knees. \u201cI read Mike\u2019s mind. He found out what you were planning and, since he was too busy to watch over you that day, and the Private Guard were still human, he had Eileen extend her speech until nightfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it was so long?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d I slammed my hands into the cold, hard surface under me. \u201cHe\u2019s so damn controlling.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded, amused.</p> <p>\u201cEr!\u201d I let my frustration out in a loud gust. \u201cI'm really mad at him. That whole afternoon was a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure you\u2019ve suffered worse,\u201d he said quietly, looking away.</p><p>I studied him as he stared with wide, glassy eyes, at the sky. \u201cYou okay, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey're magnificent, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stars?\u201d I sat up and rested my hands in my lap. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent my life studying them, you know, and still, even though I know each one, I can\u2019t help but to feel like there must be something bigger out there than us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d</p><p>He placed his arm around me and squeezed my shoulders. \u201cIs there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-hu.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJupiter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d He rocked back a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I snuggled into his shoulder. \u201cNo one else in the entire vampire community would have laughed at that, but, I appreciate your amusement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re funny, Ara. I \u2018get\u2019 you,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>I hugged his arm, shivering a little. \u201cWill you tell me about one of the stars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked down at me, surprise alight in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I always wondered about them, but just never thought to read a book or ask someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would actually love to tell you about them,\u201d he laughed his words out. \u201cNo one ever wants to talk about this stuff. It seems like all the immortals have lost that sense of wonder, and any human I ever hung out with lacked the depth to sit and talk about such things.\u201d</p><p>I shuffled my hips a little bit closer to his, stealing some of the warmth from his body. \u201cYou can talk about them all night to me, Jase. I\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what I love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you call me Jase. No one ever has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s just you. And I really like it.\u201d</p><p>I grinned into his shoulder. \u201cWell, Jase, talk stars with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, see that star up there?\u201d He pointed into the eternity of night.</p><p>\u201cThe silver one, or the silver one next to it?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He rubbed his chin and shook his head, smiling. \u201cGood point. Um, pick the brightest star in the sky.\u201d</p><p>My eyes scanned the firefly convention and stopped on one; my wishing star. \u201cOkay. I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sirius. As a scientist, I'm tempted to say it\u2019s technically not the brightest star in the sky, just the brightest one you see. And I should tell you it\u2019s made of this and that, but you\u2019d prefer the romantic, historical side, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHistorians consider it to be so much more than just a star\u2014some actually believed it was magic. A nineteenth century writer said that it has some kind of mystic influence over our world, and ancient Egyptian\u2019s believed it was responsible for the flooding of the Nile each year, which, in turn, brought new life through soil regeneration\u2014an occurrence they relied on for survival and prosperity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA star flooded the Nile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they believed. So, even as far back as when the Pyramids were built, Sirius was influencing people\u2019s imaginations\u2014and lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is a magic star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Has a wish ever come true for you?\u201d</p><p>I angled my face up to smile in the radiance of his grin. \u201cYou came back.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened and he looked away. \u201cThen maybe my wish will come true, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your wish?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at my knees, pressed tightly together to keep from shaking. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, biting my teeth together so they wouldn\u2019t chatter.</p><p>\u201cSilly girl. You should have told me. I don't feel the cold like you do.\u201d He rolled his shirt off his shoulders and wrapped it over mine, leaving himself in the white T-shirt he had under it. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d I tugged it around me, laying the base slightly over my knees.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I'm fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine. You\u2019re shaking.\u201d He put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit better,\u201d I said, pushing my shoulder into the warmth of his armpit.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just a few more minutes and we\u2019ll go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>But a few minutes passed and turned into hours, and the stars rotated in the sky, taking today and turning it into tomorrow.</p><p>I calmed myself from the laughter of his last comment about movie topics no one had ever covered, and a good one came to mind. \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d I said. \u201cAliens versus vampires.\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cWho do you think would win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it depends what the alien race is capable of. But, if you think about it, we\u2019ll probably get to find out one day. I mean, we\u2019re immortal, so we may have to defend the Earth against evil aliens somewhere in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He nodded. \u201cNever thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about never dying, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, being able to see if aliens are real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cLearning the secrets of the universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing around for the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd of the world,\u201d I said very quietly to myself, thinking about that as I looked across the almost pitch-black ocean. \u201cDo you really think there\u2019re aliens out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is. We\u2019ve already found proof of living organisms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean like aliens on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d He shrugged, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s a big universe out there, and we\u2019ve only got the technology to actually see about four percent of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what's the other ninety...?\u201d Oh, crap, brain not working.</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I knew that. What\u2019s the other ninety-six percent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the eternal question, Ara, and the answer is; we have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpful.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWe have theories, though. Since the nineteen-thirties, we scientists have come to call the stuff we can't see\u2014the invisible substance that holds everything together\u2014Dark Matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark Matter?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cSounds like a problem you have with a Sith Lord.\u201d</p><p>Jason chuckled. \u201cAnd yet it is much more complex than a bad guy with a Lightsaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we can't see it\u2014yet. We know it\u2019s there, because we can see the gravitational effect it has on objects around it, but light just shines right through it\u2014we can't touch it or capture it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiiiight. A force that no one can actually see, yet you\u2019re sure is there,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, realistically, the stars in the galaxies don't contain enough mass or gravity to stay together; Dark Matter is that bond\u2014it\u2019s what stops them all from flinging apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA magic bond.\u201d I smiled to myself.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know what\u2019s great about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not solid?\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cFunny tonight, aren\u2019t we?\u201d He pinched my cheek. \u201cNo, what's great is that we don't know much about it. Right now, it\u2019s just a mysterious form of energy. Imagine the things we can dream from that\u2014imagine what may be possible if we could study it\u2014harness it. Maybe all the magic of life is hiding up there, inside that secret. \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe in magic now?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don't really know, but then, if there's no magic in the world, what are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the result of a genetic polarity that\u2019s been triggered by vampire venom to change the way your cells interact with the universe and each other.\u201d</p><p>Jason lifted my hand into his, threading his fingers through mine. \u201cAnd you are simply a miracle.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the stars all the way over to my right so he wouldn't see my probably very red cheeks. \u201cWhy do they twinkle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stars, dummy.\u201d I backhanded him; he caught my wrist before impact.</p><p>\u201cAstronomical scintillation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, kissing the back of my hand, then tucked it into his chest. \u201cThe light has to come through the atmosphere before we see it, and the interference of various elements bends that light, giving stars the appearance of twinkling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that's not very magical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He leaned his head on top of mine. \u201cBut it doesn't mean they\u2019re not wishing stars. Nothing is impossible until you\u2019ve proven it impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that, until you can give me proof that each and every one of those stars in the sky cannot and will not ever have the capacity to grant a wish, then I, and you, have every right to believe they will.\u201d</p><p>I bit my smiling lip. \u201cDavid says wishing is good time wasted.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDo you know where he got that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I sat up and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYup. It was Father\u2019s favourite line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His shoulder came up to his ear then back down again. \u201cHe never had a lot of faith in anything good\u2014especially us boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I looked out at the ocean. \u201cDavid tries to justify your father\u2019s behaviour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his way of dealing with the abuse.\u201d</p><p>I sat back a bit to look at him. \u201cHow bad was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worse for David than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought your father saw you as evil or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely why he saved his fits of rage for the child who was not protected by the devil.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cWhat did he do to David?\u201d</p><p>Jason rested his arms over his knees and leaned forward. \u201cHe wanted to break him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis spirit?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDavid never cried. Didn\u2019t matter what Father did to him\u2014he never cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his only defence. He wouldn't give Father the satisfaction.\u201d His jaw came forward a bit, his brows pinching in the middle. \u201cI saw him cry once, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your father see it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather came home drunk one afternoon to find David and I fighting again. He pulled us apart and gave us a lecture about being young men\u2014being good brothers. And David didn't mean to, but...he laughed. So\u2014\u201d He sniffed once, \u201c\u2014Father threw him into the wall\u2014broke his arm.\u201d</p><p>I pressed my palm firmly to my lips.</p><p>\u201cHe had the maids toss David into the cellar; told them not to open the door until he cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he cried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in that cellar, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was walking home from school a few days later when Uncle Arthur came back into town\u2014just passing through. He asked where David was, and I told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he helped?\u201d</p><p>Jase nodded, still not really looking at me. \u201cThat night, David was in his bed, his arm all bandaged up, and I saw him wipe a tear from his cheek.\u201d</p><p>The picture of the lonely scene made me ache all over. \u201cDid you comfort him?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, breathing out, and I could see that he was reliving that memory, because he just couldn\u2019t stop shaking his head. \u201cDavid and I had grown apart more and more by that stage. We loved each other, but for me to acknowledge his pain would have been to humiliate him. So, I blew out the lantern and went to bed with a pillow over my head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou poor, poor things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He stood up, grabbed my arm gently and helped me to my feet. \u201cTime to go inside. Your lips are turning blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Look at you, you\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I pinched the hem of my dress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019ve hardly spent any time with you since you\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can come out here again,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll still be here tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, looking at my feet. \u201cDo you think...Can...when we get back to the manor, can you stay with me for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>He grew a little taller, and the wind moved under his arms as he rubbed his head, brushing a mix of his cologne and him across my nose. \u201cAra, I want to\u2014God knows, but it\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm not ready to go to bed yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. I can see how tired you are.\u201d He ran his icy thumb across the skin under my eye.</p> <p>\u201cI know, but, I like spending time with you, Jase\u2014time that\u2019s not just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you sweet thing.\u201d He tucked my hair behind my ear. \u201cHow can I possibly resist that?\u201d</p><p>The stars faded, keeping the secrets of this pair who sat talking all night, watching the sun rise in each other\u2019s company. There were so many things I wanted to ask him\u2014so many things I wanted to say, but each time my thoughts brushed on horrors of the past\u2014things he locked inside as his own torturous regrets\u2014he\u2019d switch the subject. He was fighting a battle inside for what he\u2019d done to me, and he was fighting it alone.</p><p>I shuffled down a little more on the settee by the fireplace and crossed my ankles, my legs straightened out over his lap. \u201cI wish we could do this every night.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled down at my wedding ring, twisting it around on my finger for the hundredth time. \u201cI'm sure my brother would approve of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking. I don't think he\u2019d mind.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my legs. \u201cI\u2019d mind\u2014if I was him.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOnly because you know you have all the wrong intentions. Whereas, I, on the other hand, don't.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, his eyes small, his tight lips blossoming into a full grin. \u201cYou are a terrible liar, Ara-Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? A liar?\u201d I said, crossing my ankles the other way. \u201cYou\u2019re just reading into it wrong. And why do you keep doing that with my ring?\u201d</p><p>He grinned down and brought his other hand up slowly, pinching the white-gold band between his fingertips. \u201cI'm taking it off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I straightened my finger, letting him slide the ring over my knuckle.</p><p>\u201cBecause it looks wrong. We\u2019re supposed to be a couple, yet you wear this like some shrine to your supposedly dead husband.\u201d He slipped it into his pocket. \u201cRemoving this will give the people some hope.\u201d</p><p>I kept my eyes on his pocket for a few seconds. \u201cFine. But don't lose it.\u201d</p><p>He laid a hand to his chest. \u201cI've never lost anything I hold close to my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your heart is in your back pocket?\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s on my sleeve,\u201d he said.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, but inside, thought that was really sweet.</p><p>In the background, an acoustic playlist of my favourite bands kept time to our magic little world; each song bringing this closer to an end. We sat quietly then, both hearing the words to a song about being in a dream together, and Jason smiled, because they fit so perfectly to our situation.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this by?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGavin DeGraw.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his lip turned up sharply and his smiling eyes focused on nothing, as the words played out around us. \u201cDo you think he wrote it just for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he did and he doesn't know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>I ran the tip of my thumb over his nail, feeling the melody fill me up like Jason\u2019s mere presence did, and neither of us had words for a while, because everything we wanted to say was being sung to us by a person we\u2019d never met. But the song ended with the rise of day, and the sun reached out to all corners of the manor, blowing away the intimacy of candlelight with the cold light of truth.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d he said, rubbing a hand over my leg, warming it a little. \u201cIt\u2019s not really right for me to be in here with you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow noble of you.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cYet it was okay while it was dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Ara. It\u2019s just\u2014I forget sometimes, you know.\u201d His eyes narrowed as if he was thinking really hard. \u201cI'm so used to you being mine, so used to being in that world of neither here nor there that it\u2019s automatic for me to love you as my own. But it\u2019s wrong, and I don't wanna be that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I don't want to be that girl, either.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb over my jaw, smiling. \u201cI know you don't, Ara. And when we were in those dreams before, we were both so caught up in the confusion of it all, and, honestly, I never cared if I hurt David, but, somehow, throwing him on a fire to burn alive kinda mended the hatred I had for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn't you try that in the first place\u2014instead of ruining the first ball I ever went to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, low-blow,\u201d he said with a grin, his lovely dimple showing. \u201cWell, if I could go back, I\u2019d do it all differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Jase.\u201d I patted his hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right, you know\u2014David would be very pissed-off to see us sitting like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so hard, though,\u201d he whined. \u201cI want to be this way with you, and I know you want it, too. And maybe that\u2019ll change when you\u2019ve got David here to love you like you need, but, right now, while he\u2019s not, and while you\u2019re willing to let me be close with you, I will have to fight incredibly hard with myself not to put us in situations like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituations?\u201d I looked down at his hand on my lower thigh, his fingers falling softly between them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, getting closer, hanging out like we\u2019re in love\u2014spending the night together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we slept together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will happen, though, Ara,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf we keep this up, I won't be able to let you go when he comes back, and neither will you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed then because, as he said that, a song playing said, \u201cI won't let you go,\u201d as if my playlist had been perfectly selected to musically portray our emotions. If Highway to Hell came on, I\u2019d be very concerned.</p><p>Jason laughed, obviously having read all that in my thoughts. \u201cSpeaking of highway,\u201d he said, shifting my legs as he stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll hit it\u2014leave you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He grinned and wandered over to my fireplace.</p><p>I sat up. \u201cUm, Jase, the door\u2019s the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, then just stood there, rapping on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a theory about this wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my room has only one window, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, from the outside of the manor, there are exactly sixteen windows on the west wing\u2019s second floor. So...where is the last room, if my window is number fifteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrm...I don't know.\u201d I walked over to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So, I got to thinking, and I did a little digging around.\u201d He pushed on the wall panel. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we used to find secret passages all over this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you show me some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He pushed another spot on the wall and smiled. \u201cOne thing we came to learn was that most secret doors were a push-release panel; you shove it, it pops out, then you can open it.\u201d He stood back and revealed a small opening where my wall was a second ago.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret passage.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLeading into whatever is beside my room.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, then at the door. \u201cCan we go check it out?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, pressing the panel back in place. \u201cNot today. You need sleep, and I want to make sure it\u2019s safe before you go wandering around down there. This passage may not even lead to that room. I only suspected it because you said you heard noises coming up from the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, no, you thought it, but, the point still stands. I\u2019d just really like to be there to explore it with you. Will you wait for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can't we go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cYou have to be up for queen duties in two hours, and I\u2019ve got to go into town today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI didn't bother packing any clothes when I left Rome, so I've been borrowing Eric\u2019s, but he\u2019s a bit bigger in the waist than I am.\u201d He lifted his shirt and showed the gap between his golden V of muscles and the waistband of his jeans. \u201cI need some new clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant anything from town while I'm there?\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide. \u201cA block of chocolate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. If you promise to wait for me before you go down that tunnel, I\u2019ll bring you a month\u2019s supply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and lowered his face to meet me eye-to-eye, then held out his little finger. \u201cPinkie promise?\u201d</p><p>I looped mine over his. \u201cPinkie promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now.\u201d He kissed my head. \u201cGet some sleep. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, folding my arms, watching him open my bedroom door. \u201cNight, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Ara.\u201d</p><p>As the door closed, the loneliness of my room swallowed me up again. All around my head, overtiredness mixed with confusion, and I felt a tear on my cheek. I swiped it away and looked down at my hand\u2014at the clear patch of skin where my ring should be.</p><p>Since speaking to Arthur last night, I\u2019d not had a chance to digest what he told me, because I couldn\u2019t think of it while Jason was around. But, alone, in my room, finally with time to think, I didn't want to.</p><p>I waltzed over and sat by my dresser mirror, my eyes tracing lines over the face of the girl there. When she looked back at me these days, I saw only myself\u2014not the mask, not the confusion or the troubled eyes of the lost soul\u2014just me. What I felt for David, what I felt for Jason and even Mike was all clear in my head now. And it was okay. I loved Jason, though I had to keep that secret for the rest of forever. I loved David, but couldn't be with him yet. And I loved Mike as a friend. Clear.</p><p>But being clear about how I felt meant one other thing confused me more; what to do about this dagger and Arthur.</p><p>I grabbed my phone from the nightstand and texted, Arthur, I don't need to think about it anymore. I can't lose him. Meet me tonight?</p><p>He didn't reply.</p><p>I tapped my heel, drumming my fingers on my knee while I waited. But there was nothing. I sent another; Arthur. Did you get my message?</p><p>A reply came through immediately; My dear, you haven\u2019t thought this through. Get some sleep. We\u2019ll talk about it in a few weeks.</p><p>No! I sent back. I need to do this before I chicken out and run away to another state. I'm scared, Arthur, and we\u2019re running out of time. It could take a month or more before we\u2019ll even know if I'm pregnant.</p><p>I crawled into bed and hugged my pillow, tugging a corner of my blanket over my knees, when my phone bleeped with another message.</p><p>Have you done a test to make sure you\u2019re not already pregnant?</p><p>Yes, I wrote. It was negative.</p><p>The clock across the room ticked, and I focused so intently on it that the minute hand moved over three or four numbers, my heart remaining steady the whole time, until another message came through; Ok.</p><p>What does \u2018Ok\u2019 mean?</p><p>Tonight, he wrote.</p><p>I swallowed, blinking away the hot, stinging tears, then wrote back \u2018Ok\u2019 and deleted the messages before turning off my phone.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>We were just two shadows in the darkness of the training hall; no one passing would see us here, and no one was close enough to hear what we were about to do\u2014how I was about to betray my husband to save his life.</p><p>Last night, being so close to Jason on the lighthouse rooftop, then spending all day away from him, made me realise that I may have admitted I loved him, but had in no way come to terms with it, and in that, wasn't ready to let him die for me\u2014or for my people. However, I knew if it was a choice between Jason and David, I\u2019d let Jason go, but while I had a choice\u2014while Arthur was here, right in front of me, ready to give his life up, I\u2019d let him.</p><p>He took my hand and drew me closer, sliding his cool touch down my spine and back up again, lifting my dress, taking it over my head. I watched it fall to the floor in the dark, tucking my elbows into my bare chest\u2014not quite ready to let him see.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tiny. Such a fragile little thing.\u201d He cupped his hand to the side of my face, gently moving my wrists away from my chest. \u201cDon't be scared, Amara. I won't hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not scared,\u201d I whispered in a shaky breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just...it just feels so wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He slid his fingers down my face, over my neck and cupped my hips. \u201cLet\u2019s just do this quickly, okay. Lay down.\u201d</p><p>My knees trembled until I felt the ground beneath them\u2014felt the aged blood and sweat these floorboards had soaked up since this whole thing began. And Arthur lowered himself, too, kneeling before me, making the hairs along my neck prickle under his smooth touch. He traced every inch of my spine, slowly wrapping me up in his arms; I felt small but safe, cradled into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like strawberries,\u201d he said, kissing my neck; his lips were so warm, so wet and so foreign, his breath hot down the curve of my tight shoulder\u2014his teeth grazing the flesh above my artery. And it felt nice, but wrong; this was Arthur\u2014not David, not even Jason; he was my husband\u2019s uncle\u2014a man I looked up to. A man I cared about, but never wanted to be with this way. I closed my eyes, praying for strength.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he whispered in my ear, and though my stomach was tight and my body so stiff I could hardly swallow, I managed to roll myself back, restraining my tears, focusing on the chill of the cold ground under my tailbone, up each vertebra in my spine and across my shoulders.</p><p>As I lay flat, the world around me felt wider, larger, like there was suddenly more space, or like the roof I\u2019d seen a thousand times before, laying right here, usually pinned by a knight, seemed to sit miles up in the sky.</p><p>My chest lifted, my ribs expanding around the fear and hesitation inside me. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d I asked Arthur.</p><p>He studied my thigh, running his hand along it so slowly I held my breath. \u201cYou\u2019re just so young, Amara\u2014too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm nineteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d He dropped his hand, his head following. \u201cI'm afraid what this will do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but I couldn't really see his smile in the darkness. He could see me, though\u2014his perfect vampire vision making him privilege to all the things I would never have showed him.</p><p>I bit my lip when his cool touch parted my legs at the knees, and he knelt between them, his bare hip brushing the inside of my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I said to myself.</p><p>\u201cJust don't look.\u201d He wiped his thumb over my eyelid. \u201cJust close your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...I can't,\u201d I said, looking up at him, and I couldn't help it, I cried.</p><p>He clicked his tongue, sinking back. \u201cAmara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm okay. I'm...I'm okay.\u201d I let my knees fall softly together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not okay.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do this another time if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt needs to be now.\u201d</p><p>He moistened his lips, breathing out through his nose, his eyes square with hesitation. \u201cOkay. Just...just imagine I'm him.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, tangling my fingers in my hair.</p><p>\u201cLift your hips,\u201d he said, touching the rim of my underwear. \u201cWe won't get far with these in the way.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes again, feeling the lace slip past my thighs, over my knees and away from my ankles. And we were naked. Together. My legs completely open; Arthur between them.</p><p>He slid his hands under my bottom and pulled me forward so the harder part of him brushed softly against the warmest part of me.</p><p>I looked into his eyes, seeing the fear and concern I was feeling, too. One movement, one millimetre and he\u2019d be in me\u2014and with just a few strokes, all this would be over. Providing I actually fell pregnant.</p><p>\u201cI'm just going to check you first\u2014make sure you\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWai\u2014?\u201d My toes curled over and I jumped when he placed a cold finger just inside me, then pulled it away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready. It\u2019ll hurt if you\u2019re dry.\u201d</p><p>All I could feel was a flood of adrenaline in my arms, making them weak, unattached, disturbed by the tension and memory of his finger inside me, and as soon as that feeling reached my heart, I broke apart into a mess of short, hiccupping sobs.</p><p>Arthur\u2019s whole body moved, as if his soul had just been dragged backward inside him. \u201cI'm so sorry, Amara,\u201d he said. \u201cI never wanted to see you this way\u2014to touch you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Arthur,\u201d I said, wiping warm tears from my temples and ears. \u201cBut I can't lose him. I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, watching my trembling lip.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d The shaking in my chest spread to my gut, twisting it, making dinner inch up my throat. I covered my mouth with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. No.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI think I'm gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p>He moved back just in time for me to roll onto my side and blast the contents of my gut all over the training room floor. As I heaved and gasped, a shirt came over my shoulders, and I felt the air on my cheeks and jaw where my hair had been. Arthur held it back until I finished, reaching around to guide my spine against his chest after.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d He chuckled, wiping my mouth with something cool and cotton, then placed the square of fabric into my hand.</p><p>I nodded, swallowing the horrid, sour taste in my mouth. My stomach hurt, contracting and quivering. I wrapped my shaky arms across it. \u201cI'm sorry, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be sorry, my dear.\u201d He sat down under me then, turning my body a little so I no longer felt his nakedness against me, and stroked my hair, wiping a few vestiges of puke or saliva away with his thumb. \u201cYou know I care for you a great deal, don't you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded into his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I...I love David, too, Amara. But, I'm sorry\u2014\u201d His chest sunk. \u201cI just can\u2019t do this to you. I just can't have you this way.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm saying I...\u201d He moistened his lips, his eyes focusing on something across the room.</p><p>\u201cArthur, please?\u201d I sat up from him; he looked down at my naked chest and pulled his shirt to cover me, slowly buttoning it closed, staying quiet. \u201cArthur. Please say something\u2014anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should just let Drake live.\u201d</p><p>My world rocked, heat rising as anger inside me. \u201cDavid will never allow that\u2014not as long as he knows Drake wants to steal power from our unborn child.\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cI know this. But look at you\u2014look what you've done to yourself.\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at the stinky pile of vomit. \u201cI can't lose him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will have to find some other way to kill Drake, my dear, because this friendship has been pushed to its limits, and neither of us can take this. I won't see you destroyed by my touching you, and I won't see my nephew die because I can't bring myself to hurt you this way.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my face with his handkerchief, sitting back as he stood up and, in the dark and the quiet of our little world, pulled his jeans on, grabbed his jacket and walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be sorry,\u201d I said to the ground, swiping a tear off the tip of my nose. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at this pathetic heap and then at my mess. \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to clean that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cDon't. I just...I just need some time to myself first.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head and left me, in the middle of the training hall, wearing nothing but his shirt and deep concern for the fate of my husband.</p><p>The moon\u2019s shadows gave proof of time passing. By now, the men who sat in the parlour and drank Scotch after dinner would have retired, and all around the manor grounds, lights would be going out, maids shutting their doors on the day, and knights and guests would be laying their heads on their pillows. But I was here, huddled against the mirror on the wall, half naked, feeling numb, sick, cold and so, so alone.</p><p>I failed David. I couldn't give him the one thing he deserved\u2014life.</p><p>On my finger, the bare skin where my ring was until Jason took it off felt cold and empty\u2014a reminder that David and I were so far apart and that, worst of all, might possibly be separated forever. What would my life be without him now? How would I kiss him when I saw him next, knowing it would be one of the last times? How could he kiss me each time he came here, knowing that when he said forever, it was a lie?</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d a cautious voice called into the room.</p><p>The moonlight outlined a broad silhouette. I tucked myself into a smaller ball and hid my eyes when the light came on, blinding me.</p><p>\u201cAr?\u201d Mike landed beside me, taking my face in his thick fingers. \u201cBaby, what are you doing out here?\u201d He looked behind him then. \u201cDid you throw up?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, clutching my hands to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat...how did you...what were you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think I was sleepwalking.\u201d I hid Arthur\u2019s hanky under my arm.</p><p>He sat back on his heels, frowning. \u201cThen why can I smell Arthur all over you?\u201d</p><p>I took a quick breath and looked down at the shirt covering my otherwise naked body.</p><p>He looked too. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d He stood up, hauling me to my feet by the arm. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naked,\u201d he said, running his hand up the back of my thigh.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, Mike. I swear, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d he screamed, the veins in his eyes bulging. \u201cDid you fuck him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, running his hands over his head. \u201cNo. Nup, this doesn\u2019t make sense. None of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, please?\u201d</p><p>He appeared in front of me, pinning my back to the ice-cold mirror. \u201cWhat are you playing at, Ara? What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Mike. I honestly don't know how I got down here.\u201d</p><p>He studied my cheeks and my lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I'm okay.\u201d I reached up and wiped the moisture of remaining tears from under my eye.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Mike grabbed my hand, squeezing it so tight my fingertips pulsed with blood. \u201cWhere\u2019s your ring?\u201d</p><p>I looked at my hand then back at his fierce eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your ring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I took it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he said quietly, but an eruption of volume festered underneath. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt...\u201d I couldn\u2019t think. I couldn\u2019t even remember when I took it off.</p><p>His fingers tightened on my arms, saliva leaving his lips, spattering all over mine as he screamed something in my face.</p><p>\u201cJason took it off me!\u201d I wailed. \u201cIt looked wrong. My husband is supposed to be dead, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not dead.\u201d He slammed me against the mirror again, cracking it under my spine. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, and you're down here, naked under Arthur\u2019s shirt!\u201d</p><p>I looked right into his eyes then, both of us seeing truths about each other we didn't want to see, and my legs moved out from under me; I wanted to sink down and curl into a ball, but he held me up, leaning on my body with so much weight my lungs couldn\u2019t draw a breath. \u201cI didn't do anything with him, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d He walked away again. I sat on the floor, looking at the exit then my best friend. \u201cAra, you can't lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not lying. I...All I remember is getting down here and then I threw up.\u201d</p><p>He appeared beside me, squatting, lifting my face. \u201cIf that's true, then why are your clothes over there on the floor?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at them, my lie falling apart before my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid little slut,\u201d he said through his teeth and snapped his hand across my cheek.</p><p>I squealed, slowly touching my fingers to it, swiping my hair away from my lip.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what this will do to him? Do you!\u201d He grabbed me again, shaking me. \u201cHe will hate you, Ara. He will never touch you again, he\u2014\u201d His words stopped and he jerked backward, cool air rushing between us as he skidded into the wall across the room.</p><p>\u201cBack down, or I will put you in a permanent state of vegetation!\u201d Jason pointed at him, coming up out of nowhere.</p><p>Mike sat up, clutching his jaw, then stumbled to his feet. I saw the same shock I was feeling become present in his eyes; he looked down at his hands, and I turned away, burying my face in Jason\u2019s shoulder as he squatted beside me.</p><p>\u201cBaby. I'm sorry,\u201d Mike said, and when I looked up again, he was gone.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason covered me with his jacket.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it, Jase. I can't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a person am I?\u201d I whispered to myself. \u201cI couldn't even...I just couldn't...\u201d</p><p>I felt his hands on me, trying to comfort me, but my breath became too thin, my head swirling as the sound in the room rang through my ears in a high-pitched tone.</p><p>I opened my eyes and smiled, turning my head away. \u201cDon't look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Jason jumped up from the chair by my bed and came to sit right against my hip.</p><p>\u201cLike you're really concerned.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his thumb over my cheek. \u201cHe hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a tiny slap,\u201d I said, pulling his hand away. \u201cAnd I kinda had it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through enough. He had no right to touch you that way. I will skin him alive.\u201d He closed his eyes in emphasis of the word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI'm okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t be. You shouldn\u2019t brush this off like it doesn't matter, Ara. He is ten times bigger than you, and he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've got bigger things to worry about right now, Jase.\u201d I rolled away, pulling the blanket up over my shoulder. \u201cJust let it go.\u201d</p> <p>He swept my hair back, pressing his lips firmly to the side of my head. \u201cI love you, Ara. I won't let this go. But we\u2019ll talk about it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He tucked me in a little tighter. \u201cJust sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rolled over and shoved the blanket back. \u201cLet it go. Mike didn't mean to do that. He\u2019s...I mean...look what I put him through. This was just the final straw, okay. He clearly can't take anymore of...well, me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and turned away, lowering his head to his hands. \u201cI understand that, Ara, probably better than you might think, but he\u2019s not just your friend anymore; he's head of security. No matter what you do or have done, he should have more self-control than to have slapped you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a little tap.\u201d I smirked.</p><p>He turned his head to look out from behind his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cJase. Go to bed. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI am tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep at all last night?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened a little. \u201cWhat would make you think I hadn't slept?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know already, Jase, you can read my mind.\u201d I reached across and touched his arm. \u201cHow long have you been having those night terrors?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he studied me carefully. \u201cYou...so you did see that dream?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He sunk back, exhaling.</p><p>\u201cAre they always that bad\u2014the dreams?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please don't\u2014just...don't say you\u2019re sorry. I'm sorry. I'm the one who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grabbed his hand and tucked it against my locket. \u201cAll of that\u2019s in the past. I know what you did for me. I know it was to protect me, Jase, I forgave you a very, very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don't. It hurts me for you to feel such deep regret. You\u2019re punishing yourself for something you had no control over.\u201d</p><p>He drew his hand away from mine. \u201cI just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase. It\u2019s. In. The. Past,\u201d I said slowly to make it clear as a bell. \u201cStop dreaming about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do that, I\u2019d have to stop sleeping.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHow \u2018bout you come visit me in our sleep again instead. We\u2019ll make some nice dreams for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure it\u2019s really appropriate for us to be alone like that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I can't have you reliving that torture every night. I won't. Not to mention, if I'm slipping into your dreams somehow, I don't really want to be seeing that every time I close my eyes, either.\u201d</p><p>He kind of laughed, looking boyish and sweet. \u201cOkay. No more nightmares then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said in a business-like tone. \u201cNow, I have question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mind-links?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid...\u201d I tried not to smile. \u201cDid you visit me\u2014in our dreams\u2014while you were supposedly dead?\u201d</p><p>His smile grew. \u201cMaybe. Once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d I slapped my covers then looked back at him. \u201cSo...the yellow dress.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYes, I...figured I owed you a new dress\u2014since I ruined the blue one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I can't believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged timidly.</p><p>\u201cAnd, what about the memories? Did you leave mind-blocks in place, or were you actually in those dreams with me, showing me all those things yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany of those were memories\u2014things we did before...\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cI never placed mind-blocks. I erased those things, but only enough to hide them from a human mind. As you grew stronger, your brain lifted the sheet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheet? But you said you erased them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can ever truly be erased from a mind. It\u2019s like a hard drive\u2014unless you have some pretty high-tech equipment, there\u2019s always an imprint left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So, all those things you showed me about your childhood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked. I answered.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDid you want me to hate David?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if you did. But, no. I did and do want you to know what he\u2019s like, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He looked at my cheek and wiped his thumb over it. \u201cYou have such a forgiving heart that, well, now I'm sure you\u2019d forgive David if he struck you in anger\u2014and his strike would not be a tiny slap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only say that because you think I'm going to let Mike get away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I say that because my brother can seem to do no wrong. I\u2019ve seen him raise his voice at you, and you only blame yourself\u2014tell yourself not to push him. Ara, that\u2019s a recipe for a submissive nineteen-fifties abused housewife. I just don't want to see you crying on a kitchen floor, punished because the Pavlova sunk, and, sweet girl, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't think very highly of him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my brother. I do. But I know him\u2014inside and out, and he\u2019s old fashioned. He doesn't see anything wrong with disciplining his wife. It\u2019s not a personality fault; it\u2019s a time corruption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d never hit me, Jase.\u201d</p><p>He softened, stroking his thumb gently down my cheek again. \u201cNeither would Mike.\u201d</p><p>I pushed his hand away. \u201cAnd David would never even do that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. And I hope, if he ever does, you would come to me\u2014you would see it as an error on his part, and not just think yourself the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Okay? I know it might seem like I let him get away with being all controlling and forceful, but if he ever did anything to me that I didn't like, I\u2019d leave. I have a no-strike policy with men, Jase. If he hits me, even once, he\u2019s gone, because that\u2019s not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit you.\u201d</p><p>My heart sunk. \u201cJase. Don't. Okay? Just stop feeling guilty. Look\u2014\u201d I sighed. \u201cOkay, you hit me, you\u2019re a bastard. I hate you.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>He rocked his jaw, swiping his thumb across a tear on his cheek. \u201cYou were just so small and precious. Every strike felt as if you\u2019d snap, shatter, like porcelain. I\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat, his voice breaking. \u201cI hit as softly as I possibly could, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I placed my hand over his, bringing him back from the world he\u2019d slipped away to. \u201cDon't go there anymore. Just, when you think about it, go to a place where we were happy, instead.\u201d</p><p>He flipped his hand over under mine and wound our fingers together. \u201cOnly if I can take you there with me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, tightening my hold. \u201cI will go anywhere, do anything to make you okay again. It kills me that you\u2019re stuck in that torture without me, Jase. I'm okay. I'm here. I'm alive, and I...\u201d I knew what I wanted to say, but couldn't let myself say it. Not ever. \u201cI care about you. A lot. So, please, just...just don\u2019t go back there anymore. Move on. Leave it behind where it belongs\u2014in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee\u2014\u201d He moved forward and sat closer, tucking my hair behind my ear. \u201cThis is why I love you. Look how easily you can heal my heart. See how effortless it is for you to take my terrors away.\u201d He shook his head looking down at his hand. \u201cI just...I don't know where I\u2019d be if I\u2019d not found you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from our hands. \u201cNo one has ever cared so much before\u2014to want to take my pain away and see that I dream of things that don't leave scars when I wake.\u201d</p><p>I stroked his dimple with my thumb. \u201cI'm sorry you never found a girl who would see you the way I do.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened even more on mine. \u201cBut I did find one.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly at him, attempting to hide the sympathy. \u201cYes, but, I want you to have love\u2014like David and I do. I want you to find your eternal person.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cEternal person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I found her. I'm just waiting for her to realise we were made for each other, then I get my happy ending.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my hand free. \u201cThat won't happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He cupped his hands in his lap, nodding. \u201cBut eternity is a very long time. I can hope that, one day, you\u2019ll feel the way I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really do care for me, then you won't think like that. Because, for all the confusion I have in my heart, I only want David.\u201d</p><p>His head bounced in a kind of nod\u2014to himself, I think. He took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cOkay. Then I hope you never love me. I hope you and David live eternally happy lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>\u201cI'm trying, Ara. I do want what's best for you. And if that's my brother, then, in my heart, he's who I want you to be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should stop touching me like your girlfriend. If he saw that, he\u2019d be really pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He moved his hands off my body. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d He sat back on the chair beside my bed.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you demand I give your ring back?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI didn't know that was an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you never sit by and let things happen if you don't approve. If you wanted that ring, you\u2019d have stomped your foot until I gave it to you. So, why didn't you?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a second. \u201cYou're reading into it too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d With a boyish grin, he reached for my hand, pressed my wedding band into my palm and folded my fingers around it. \u201cOr are you just not telling me what you really think?\u201d</p><p>I rolled over again, slipping the ring back in place. \u201cGo away, Jason. You don't know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don't know anything about you, huh?\u201d He pulled the blanket away, his voice light with humour. \u201cI know your ticklish spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I squealed, jerking around as he dug his fingers into my ribs. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his voice deep and gentle, while his strong fingers forced my body to thrash about in a very unladylike manner, wriggling and screaming. But he seemed so young and so human when he played this way that I really didn't want him to stop\u2014and he knew that, so he didn't.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Breathless, a little puffed-out, he pinned both my hands beside my face and leaned right down. \u201cI know more about you than anyone else in this world, Ara-Rose. And I know you didn\u2019t ask me for that ring because you liked the fact that I had it. You liked knowing how it made me feel to carry it\u2014as if I owned a part of you my brother never would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened; he smiled, and his eyes slowly travelled from my face to where his legs rested between mine, Arthur\u2019s button-down shirt rising up to reveal I wasn\u2019t wearing anything underneath.</p><p>He released my hands and pulled the shirt to cover me. \u201cWhat happened down there tonight, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the training hall. Why were you down there\u2014practically naked?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, and the pictures of everything that happened flashed across my thoughts before I could stop them.</p><p>He swept my hair off my brow, frowning. \u201cWhoa. Ara, you\u2019ve gotta be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked up, half panicked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you were doing down there tonight? Arthur? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I blinked a few extra times. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet girl, I saw everything.\u201d He backed off me a little, resting on his knees, his hand on my open leg. \u201cSo that's what the dagger\u2019s for\u2014that\u2019s what David wants it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he hasn't been coming to see me.\u201d I grabbed my locket. \u201cHe can't bear it. He\u2019s wanted to tell me so badly, but he knows I\u2019ll fight him on it. He\u2019s planning to just disappear.\u201d</p><p>Jason moved forward quickly, dropping his hands beside my shoulders, and looked down into my eyes, an intense stare swallowing all the animation from his face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip, shaking his head. \u201cNo. I won't let this happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not letting you do this to yourself.\u201d He reached down and started undoing my buttons. \u201cI won't see you suffer my uncle\u2019s touch then hate yourself for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d I cupped my hand over his. \u201cI can't lose David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can lose me,\u201d he said, and rolled the shirt off my shoulder, opening my bare skin to the night.</p><p>\u201cJase\u2014\u201d My hand slowly came up to rest along his face. \u201cIf you father the heir, you\u2019ll be going to your death.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't know?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYou really have no idea what you are to me, Ara, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...it would take a lifetime for me to show you how I feel. There are no words I could find to say it in one breath, and I love you just doesn\u2019t hold enough weight for the feeling I have in my soul that you are everything. You are my life, my breath, my reason to get up, to smile, to live each day. I will never let you go.\u201d He wiped his soft, long fingers down my cheek. \u201cDon't you see? One day my brother will come back here, and I won't get to be with you anymore, and, eventually, that will kill me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jase,\u201d I said, trying not to cry. \u201cHow can I live in a world without you?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, taking in my half naked body as he peeled the shirt completely away. \u201cBetter than you can live in a world without David.\u201d</p><p>My whole heart tightened with sadness, because I knew it was true, and I knew I could love Jason for one night without hating myself as much as if it was Arthur.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I pressed my hand to his abs as he lifted his shirt over his head. \u201cWill David really hate me if I have a baby to stop him from dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d He ditched the shirt and fell on his hands, his body over mine. \u201cThink of the agony he's been going through these past few months, probably worrying whose hands he\u2019d be leaving you in once he\u2019s dead.\u201d He looked down at my hips and cupped them both firmly, sliding me down the bed. \u201cHe knows this will happen, he just believes it\u2019ll be when he's gone\u2014cold in the ground. But it doesn't have to be that way.\u201d</p><p>I was surprised at that, really. I kind of thought he\u2019d jump at the chance to have me for eternity.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, having read my mind. \u201cNot sad\u2014not eternally grieving him, Ara. If you really do love him more than me, then you will not ever be happy again if he dies.\u201d He reached down and unzipped his jeans. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this. I'm giving you my child, and I will die happy, knowing that I at least left a part of myself behind\u2014in you.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes, taking a few deep breaths while he fussed about between my legs, taking off his clothes. And when his bare skin fell smoothly and warmly against mine as he came back down on top of me, I felt myself only more drawn to him. Ready for him. Wanting him.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, but...while I have you completely naked, I'm gonna do something I've wanted to do for a long time,\u201d he said behind that mischievous grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked shyly, my cheek to my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cKiss you somewhere naughty.\u201d</p><p>As if my body belonged to his every touch, my spine curved, making my ribs press against his, my chin tilting upward by command of his lips; his mouth opened, warm breath over soft skin, and traced lovely wet little kisses from my collarbones to my ribs, then over the line of promise.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said through the kisses, running a finger over my Mark, \u201clooks incredibly sexy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure I fit in a sentence with the word sexy,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cTell that to my body.\u201d He smiled against my flesh, taking his lips down my belly in a curve, finding the join of my hip and sneaking off to that patch of forbidden hair. I gasped, a rush of heat moistening between my thighs as his tongue entered me where no man had ever kissed before.</p> <p>I grabbed the edge of my pillow, opening my legs wider, trying not to moan loudly, but the glorious ability of this mind reader meant that he knew exactly where to put his fingers and exactly how soft his touch needed to be. He slid one finger slowly out and back in again, kissing me each time it entered.</p><p>The electricity in my hands snapped, making me hotter all through my core; I drove them under my pillow and bit my lip, giggling inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat kind of tickles.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, running his wet hands up my hips and to my breast, his lips following, his hair touching my chin, the faint smell of myself all over his mouth as he kissed my nipple, moving up my neck to my jaw.</p><p>I wanted to reach down and grab him, slide him inside me, but he kept his hips away, reaching up to grab my hand as soon as the idea entered my mind.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cArgh! You\u2019re killing me!\u201d</p><p>His breath left his chest, tinted with a low tone of his beautiful deep voice, and I felt so close to him, hearing him that way, hearing his voice against my skin. I opened my mouth as he came to it, and let my tongue touch his\u2014felt his lips perfectly shape to mine, his hands reaching around to cradle my spine, as if he couldn't possibly hold me close enough to drive the desire away. And as I wrapped my legs around his hips, felt the driving force of his love so solidly, so clearly in that first thrust, that I let out a little cry, scrunching my fingers into the flesh between his shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, laughing into the curve of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d David was never that passionate. \u201cI'm okay.\u201d</p><p>His hips moved away from mine, coming closer again, the muscles in his butt tightening each time. I never imagined it could feel this way\u2014all of it; skin on skin, chest to chest, his thin body, so toned and so firm, pressing my breasts flat between us, while the sharp bone of his jaw rested against my head, his throat just above my nose and lips\u2014just close enough to bite. There was a kind of energy between us, surrounding us, that felt solid, like we were grounded by a force outside our awareness.</p><p>I leaned down and kissed the Mark on his arm softly, closing my eyes as I remembered the first time I saw it\u2014how much I loved him even then.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped for a second, and his soft hair tickled my nose as he drew back, then looked down at me. \u201cI love you, too, Ara. For forever.\u201d He leaned in and kissed my lips once. \u201cAnd I will die loving you.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my head back and tilted my hips up to meet his, inviting him to move in me once more; he obliged, keeping his chest and belly off mine, looking down between my legs, watching himself go inside me. And it was about the sexiest thing I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Hot liquid flooded my insides, making Jason grin as he reached down to press his thumb against a really sensitive spot.</p><p>\u201cHoly shi...!\u201d I said, as if I\u2019d just plunged down the dip of a roller-coaster. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClitoral stimulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I looked up\u2014saw the amusement in his eyes, the tongue of concentration sitting in the corner of his smile. His thumb made my body do things it\u2019d never done before\u2014make noises my throat didn't know it could make, and I felt myself tighten around him, from the inside out, pulsing in little twitches as he acted on my every thought.</p><p>At the point my body could no longer take it, he shoved himself hard inside of me again, hitting a spot way up that sent everything flooding back down. Moisture swam between us, his thighs wet against mine\u2014the night air sweeping between us, cooling what was so hot I could hardly breathe.</p><p>Jason moaned loudly then, his chest above my lips, his arms so tight the veins bulged around his elbow as he gripped the bed, holding himself at the deepest point within me. And I felt it\u2014felt him release, felt his life force rush through me. We were One. There was no going back. A threshold had been crossed and the door closed. And I was nothing but content, even though I knew he would pull away at any second, because right now, he was mine and I was his\u2014just the way I wanted it to be.</p><p>As my gasps died down to soft breaths, he pressed his body to mine again, moving slowly, teasing that overexcited spot. I let out a long sigh, feeling so tight in all my limbs, but most deliciously, where he and I connected.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He slid his hand behind my back, cradling my spine as he rolled me up, gently tucking my face against his chest. \u201cI wish I could hold onto you like this forever.\u201d</p><p>And I felt so loved, so safe in his arms that I wished it, too.</p><p>I angled my chin to his chest and kissed him where his heart should be beating, breathing deep his spicy cologne and the delicious orange-chocolate of warm blood through his veins, then wrapped both my arms and legs around him, squeezing his body tightly. I never wanted to let go. He was a part of me now, and always would be. I wasn't sure it meant I had come to terms with how I felt, but I was certainly face to face with it, unable to deny it any longer.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He shuffled back, slipping out of me.</p><p>\u201cThis won't make it okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...I love him. I really do, and I...I can see his face. I can see the way he\u2019ll look at me when I tell him the baby\u2019s yours.\u201d I shut my eyes around that thought.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He kissed the bone just above my eye. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll tell him together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My eyes shot open. \u201cWe can't. He needs to be free to have an emotional reaction\u2014he can't do that with you there\u2014with anyone else there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his emotional reaction I'm worried about, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won't hurt me, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don't know him very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you don't.\u201d I shoved him off me and stood up. \u201cStop always thinking the worst of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I\u2019ve seen it. I've goddamn well seen him hit a girl before.\u201d He stood up, too, following me. \u201cWhy won't you listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s irrelevant, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what we did.\u201d I pointed back to my bed. \u201cWe betrayed him. We...we loved each other in his bed. He\u2019d be right to hurt me for that, Jason.\u201d</p><p>He ran forward and gently grabbed my arm. \u201cNo, Ara. He wouldn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014get off me.\u201d I shrugged away. \u201cI don't want this anymore. I don't want the confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not confusing, Ara. You love me. You said it yourself.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him away again. \u201cNo. I don't want this! I don't want to love you!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>He stood taller, the centre of his being turning to ice, breath by painful breath. His arms fell to his sides, his eyes glazed. \u201cAra, I can't read you right now,\u201d his voice shook. \u201cI need you to tell me you don't really mean that.\u201d</p><p>I sunk down, my head in my hands, tears falling over my knees and onto the carpet. \u201cI don't know what I feel. I just need you to go. I just need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Okay, I\u2019ll uh\u2014\u201d His words stopped.</p><p>I peeked through my fingertips and saw his long toes twitch then shift back, step by step, as he walked away, slipping into his jeans, closing my bedroom door a second later.</p><p>A sharp ache struck the core of my wretched heart then; I folded into a ball, crying aloud until, as the sun showed a lighter horizon in the distance, the silent sobs of my soul dying rang out into the emptiness around me.</p><p>Agony finally turned clarity to fog, and everything from my heart deep went numb.</p><p>The morning felt new, quiet, dark. I thought of Mike, down the other end of the manor, probably unable to sleep because of our fight, and wondered what he\u2019d think to know what I just did.</p><p>Right now, before the sun rose, no one had a clue, and I could still live in the dream-like state where nothing bad ever truly happened\u2014where everything I ever did wrong was just a nightmare.</p><p>But it wasn't a nightmare\u2014not this time. I slept with Jason to keep David, and the regret I felt wasn\u2019t just for the betrayal of my wedding vows; it was because I\u2019d sent Jason to his death, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could live with that\u2014not after having loved him that way\u2014felt him love me back like no other man ever had...or would.</p><p>I might have saved David, but I\u2019d revealed an inner truth that was worse than betrayal.</p><p>I shut my eyes, clasping my hands under my chin, and whispered to that One Entity out there, somewhere past the stars, beyond Dark Matter and planet Jupiter. I needed to be heard; I needed to take back what I did. \u201cPlease don't let me be pregnant to Jason. Please, please,\u201d I repeated over and over again. But my words became weak by the time the sun crawled along my naked body, and I sat at the head of my bed, my knees tucked up, thumb against my lips, staring into the truth of the life I just destroyed.</p><p>There was no wind outside, no sound; the ocean was still and the birds...all gone. I deserved no hint of life this morning; deep inside, I was a disgusting soul\u2014gifted with beauty, love, opportunity, and I wasted it.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>A white nightdress was the only thing covering my lustful, sinning body as I stumbled through the halls toward the gates of release. Freedom. I needed to feel the wind on my face and the sun on my skin to know I was still alive\u2014that I wasn't dragged away by the reapers in the middle of the night.</p><p>I walked through the forest at dawn, praying it would trap me, praying something evil would come to get me. But it let me pass, led me to the field\u2014to the place this all began.</p><p>Clouds rolled over the sun as I cried my eyes to blindness, fumbling through the long, itching grasses; a storm was on the way, and I wanted it to come, wanted it to electrify the skies with its power and strike me down where I stood.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t, because I was immortal\u2014no longer so blessed to be gifted with death. It was something I\u2019d have to force upon myself\u2014take myself apart so that I never opened my eyes again. I couldn't go back to that life. Everything was ruined. What once was innocent now was tainted so black it could never be loved again. David saw a pure soul in me, but in truth, that was the lie. There was no escape from the pain\u2014no escape from the truth that I wanted Jason as badly as I wanted David\u2014in equal measures. The only release I could expect would be a release from life\u2014into an eternity of Hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had no memory of taking the steps to the lighthouse roof, no memory of climbing up and finding my way to the edge, but as I stood atop it, the wind whipped its wild fury against my nightdress, and my hair lashed out behind me, circling back in my face and around my neck.</p><p>The sun turned the base of the clouds red, and thunder rolled over the ocean, raising the waves into a swirl of viscous claws, gripping the rocks below.</p><p>Under me, a light flashed out to dawn sailors, warning all of the treacherous beast that lay among the rough seas\u2014Do not dare endure her heart, it screamed, for you will surely be destroyed.</p> <p>I slowly reached up and yanked David's locket from my neck. It felt so heavy, weighed down by guilt. I had no right to wear it any longer.</p><p>I took another step toward the edge, wiping my hair and the mess of tears from my cheeks, but didn\u2019t look down\u2014couldn\u2019t look toward my fate. The Devil could take me, he could have my ruined soul, but I would not look into his eyes as I fell into his arms.</p><p>I closed my eyes, and the wind cried, howled across the planes behind me as my toes edged out over the emptiness. And, holding my breath, I launched myself with a soft step, into the open space of nothing.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Peace.</p> <p>There were no voices here, no tears, no regrets.</p><p>The ocean roared louder the closer I came, calling to me, reaching for me like claws of sanction, pounding the rocks with blowing, bursting white foam.</p><p>I closed my eyes and lifted my chin, feeling the ocean rip the locket from my fingers as darkness obliterated everything else.</p><p>When you disregard your own heart, you betray the ones you love before you\u2019ve even committed the act.</p><p>As the ocean waves washed over this desiccated, abandoned wreck, I waited for death to come\u2014or maybe it was already here, and the agony paralysing me, preventing me from lifting my face out of the drowning waves, was Hell.</p><p>The sun had not returned from its prison in the clouds, and the darkness felt empty, scary\u2014like anything could be out there, but nothing worse than what I\u2019d become.</p> <p>I had to get up. I had to try again. I couldn't let myself live to tell David what I did with his brother\u2014or what I truly felt for him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cIf there is a God up there\u2014\u201d I rolled my head, choking on the burning salt water, \u201c\u2014just take me, please?\u201d</p><p>A sharp ache and a rushing frost spread over my entire body then. I could feel my limbs being pulled, shifted, moved about by the ocean\u2014could feel the rocks gashing my soggy skin, and I wanted to feel it. I wanted to feel that pain.</p><p>When I closed my eyes, I saw a face\u2014David. My David. He looked so scared; his eyes round, ragged, a kind of horror filling them, dragging his soul down behind those tears.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I lost her,\u201d he said.</p><p>I stood beside him on the beach, watching the waves shape the rocks, making that fragile body a part of their imprint for eternity. White cloth shifted as the waters receded, and black tendrils floated out from her head, like snakes on the skull of a beast.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a good death,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cOne suited for the fiend she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014she wasn't evil; she was just a girl,\u201d he said, suddenly squatting beside her, lifting her head. \u201cShe just got lost and couldn\u2019t find her way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHelp her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let her die.\u201d I turned away, disgusted in her.</p><p>\u201cI will. But she needs help. She can't die on her own.\u201d He dropped her head back into the water and held it under. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to see her like this\u2014to hate her so much after I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed; why did you stop loving her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked up. \u201cShe betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flashed open to the dry, open surrounds of the field. The grass remained still, even in the breeze, but my hair lashed out around my face.</p><p>I stood under the tree, looking off to the cliffs.</p><p>A silhouette appeared over the horizon, stumbling, and as he came closer, time lapsing to show his movements in skipped scenes, I saw his face\u2014saw him holding his breath; lost, unable to cry. He carried a girl so close to his heart she looked like a child, while her bloodied arms hung down loosely from her body, her neck tilted back awkwardly, her dark hair dripping with blood and regret.</p><p>\u201cLeave her there, David,\u201d I yelled, watching him pass. \u201cPut her back!\u201d</p><p>But he didn't hear me. He walked forward, knowing what he had to do; knowing nothing else in the world mattered but to make her safe, because he had no idea what he was saving.</p><p>His eyes were aged with the pain in his heart, his soul withering under dying hope. He walked with the strength of an eighty-year-old man, and I loved him for that, but hated that, even in death, she brought him pain\u2014the only colour she ever gave his life was in blood.</p><p>He started screaming before he even reached the steps to the Great Hall, his voice travelling throughout every corner of the manor. But no one would come. Not if they knew the truth. They would say Let her die.</p><p>He fell to his knees, dropping the girl to the polished floor by the table she dined at every night with those who once loved her. He tried to touch her\u2014to make her pain go away, but he just didn't know where to place his hands. \u201cOh God.\u201d He covered his mouth. \u201cI should never have left you alone so long. What have I done?\u201d</p><p>I stood over him, blinking, watching, wondering if he would cry such deep agony if he knew what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cMy love.\u201d He calmed, placing a flat hand to her chest, feeling the stillness that accompanied death. \u201cPlease. Please don't be gone. Please.\u201d</p><p>All around us then, the sour scent of shock and fear filled the room as, one by one, faces came from the shadows and stared at the bleeding, massacred remains of my once beautiful body.</p><p>Each person stood motionless, no one coming to her aide. Perhaps they knew. Perhaps they\u2019d been told what lies would do\u2014how they would destroy, trap, torture any who bathed in the profits.</p><p>An eerie silence drew the air in then, like taking a deep breath, as the energy of four familiar beings broke the crowd; I heard them scream, heard them cry, but couldn't understand it. Why would they do that, when they know what she is? Why did Jason fall to his knees beside his brother and search for a place to touch this girl\u2014a way to hold her? What was it she meant to them that they could cry for her, when she did such terrible things?</p><p>David knelt back, closing his eyes, as the people around stared at him and Jason\u2014side by side, both alive. Shock marred any joy they may heave felt as realisation sunk in.</p><p>The king had returned.</p><p>Mike stepped in then and slipped his hands under my knees and ribs, but Jason held strong long enough to kiss my brow, his lips bloodied as Mike tore me from his arms. I heard none of the yelling, but saw their eyes, their mouths wide as they all screamed at each other, blaming each other\u2014forgetting my broken body, forgetting what needed to be done.</p><p>But one knew. One slowly walked up, pried my body from Mike\u2019s arms and walked away, speaking a name into my brow as he left the arguments behind.</p><p>\u201cPut me back, Arthur,\u201d I said quietly, knowing he wouldn\u2019t, even if he did hear me.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>David sat by the bedside, holding her hand, whispering a prayer into her skin, while Jason leaned on my dresser, watching through tear-worn eyes. I could tell from how still the body was that she hadn't started breathing yet. They\u2019d sewn her flesh up with tight, jagged stitches, washed the blood away and dried her hair, but she wasn\u2019t there anymore.</p><p>And I wasn't going back.</p><p>Jason looked up then, to where I stood at the foot of the bed, and his pupils became darker, larger, the colour draining from his face. I looked behind me, saw nothing there, then frowned at him, moving a little closer.</p><p>\u201cJase, can you see me?\u201d</p><p>He stood from his lean and unfolded his arms, reaching into thin air. As he moved, I saw a pale-blue light in the reflection\u2014faint, hard to see; its lashing spectrums fading with every tick of the clock on the wall. I felt his fingers go through me, like a sick feeling, and looked down my own body, seeing it as it was when David pulled me from the ocean.</p><p>Jase didn't see what I saw\u2014the ruined remains\u2014he saw something beautiful, ghostly, while I was lost in the nightmare of a horror movie.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I looked up from his hand. \u201cDid you tell him\u2014did you tell David?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cKill me\u2014\u201d I looked back at David. \u201cHe can never know. You have to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d Jason whispered, and everyone in the room looked up; I couldn't see their faces, but felt their eyes\u2014their energy.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Arthur walked over and reached out.</p><p>And as if I was some freak on show at a fair, several hands came through my body.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David stood, staring; his eyes tracing every inch of what I knew he saw as light. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>His warm hand went through my gut, and my soul broke apart, catching hold of his and latching on, feeling the instant connection; a lifetime of emotion swirled around us both, and I knew he felt it, too; I saw the look in his eye. But in his heart, he was broken. His soul was broken; I could feel that\u2014could feel the darkness coming to get him. If I died, if I faded away, he would come with me\u2014but I realised, as I looked deeper into everything he was, that if I went back, he\u2019d go into the night alone.</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he said. \u201cJust come back to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I see now,\u201d I said, looking at David. \u201cI can never tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, you don't need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she saying?\u201d David cut in.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason reached out, as if he could grab me. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said softly, touching David's face; he closed his eyes, feeling me there. \u201cTell him I love him. Tell him I always will, but I just...I can't be in this life anymore, Jase. Too much has been broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cDamn it. Please?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at the open, waving hands of the curtains across my balcony door, greeting me like arms of the soul-taker, and felt peace, somewhere out there, away from the sudden panic of everyone in the room.</p><p>\u201cUncle Arthur?\u201d Jase said, his quivering voice panicked. \u201cShe\u2019s fading. Do something.\u201d</p><p>I stepped away from Arthur. \u201cTell David goodbye for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, no!\u201d Jase reached out, but time froze around us, leaving me free to follow the desires in my heart. I kissed my David on the head and stood by the ghostly arms of the soul-taker, looking back once more as time sped up again and darkness took them all away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s done it,\u201d Jason said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI don't know that she\u2019s even aware she can,\u201d Arthur added.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. And it stays that way,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cTalent like that could be dangerous if she\u2019s left in the dark about it. I'm telling her,\u201d David said, and my eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He rose up from a chair beside my bed.</p><p>\u201cDavid? What are you doing here?\u201d I tried to sit up, but he pinned me down by my chest.</p><p>\u201cI found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound me? I was lost?\u201d</p><p>He looked off to the side of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou had an accident,\u201d Arthur said, appearing in my peripheral.</p><p>I rubbed my head. \u201cWhat kind of accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't remember?\u201d Jason popped up on the other side of my bed and took my hand.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I looked at David then at Jason, trying to find any memory, but everything was just white\u2014even what I had for breakfast. \u201cNo. Did I get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur stood at the foot of my bed. \u201cWe suspect you fell from the lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat up. \u201cWhat was I doing on the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don't know.\u201d Jason rearranged the pillows behind me, smoothing my hair down after. \u201cWe all thought you were safe in bed, until David came in screaming.\u201d</p><p>Hot, silent air stopped my words like a golf ball in my mouth. \u201cI don't remember going out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2014\u201d Arthur looked down at me, \u201c\u2014it was a case of noctambulism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepwalking.\u201d David smiled.</p><p>I laughed a little. \u201cOh. Well, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, because of your little brush with death, the whole kingdom knows David\u2019s alive,\u201d Mike said from across the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>David looked at me, shaking his head. \u201cI brought you back to the manor and came straight through the Great Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014\u201d Jason reached over me and punched David softly. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the look on their faces when I walked up to see what all the yelling was about.\u201d</p><p>David rubbed his brow. \u201cI just wasn't thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the past, son.\u201d Arthur touched his shoulder then looked at me. \u201cEverything has been smoothed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell the people\u2014about where you\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth. We told them we were trying to conceive a child that could kill Drake\u2014that we\u2019d gone to great lengths to keep my existence a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they okay with that?\u201d</p><p>David's face warmed with his smile. \u201cThey're rejoicing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, are you home now, David?\u201d I asked. \u201cSince everyone knows about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few days, yes.

Whatever thought Arthur just had, Jason was clueless to it before. He sat back, his head dropping, and stared at the floor.</p><p>\u201cKing David?\u201d Morgaine popped her head in the door.</p><p>\u201cMorgaine,\u201d David said in a very authoritative, kingly voice.</p><p>\u201cWalter asked that I\u2014\u201d She stopped dead and stared at me. \u201cShe\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d David smiled at my hand. \u201cWhat did Walt want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she stammered, pushing past Jason, and sat on the bed, taking my hand.</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d David insisted.</p><p>\u201cHe, uh...oh, Amara!\u201d Her arms stretched out and she wrapped them around my neck; I grimaced at David from behind her hair, brushing it away from my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried about you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm okay.\u201d I patted her shoulder.</p><p>She sat back, wiping her cheeks. \u201cYou were just so broken. I didn\u2019t really know what to do. I was so scared you weren\u2019t going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d David said. \u201cMessage from Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um.\u201d She stood up again, her eyes averted, back straight. \u201cSorry, Your Majesty. Walt asked if I could let you know that he\u2019s calling the House meeting early today because he\u2019s leaving for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d David nodded. \u201cWhat time is the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d She shuffled her feet and looked at me. \u201cI'm sorry, we didn't know our queen was awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>David stood and kissed my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOne of you stay with her while I'm gone, please?\u201d He looked at Jason and his uncle.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Arthur sat beside me, taking my hand up gently in his.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle.\u201d David gave a slight nod and turned on his heel, closing the bedroom door behind himself, Mike and Morgaine.</p><p>\u201cDid he just bow to you?\u201d I looked at Arthur.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur chuckled. \u201cForce of habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I don't think I've ever seen David bow.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cHe probably always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what was up with Morgaine?\u201d I tried not to laugh. \u201cShe looked like she was afraid of getting a lashing from David or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe commands a certain amount of respect,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cAs king, that has merely magnified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s slipping into his new role well then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly.\u201d Arthur nodded once.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to have him back.\u201d I smiled over at my door, catching a strange shift in Jason\u2019s smile as I looked back. \u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d He looked up from the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>He studied his hand, running the tip of his thumb over his finger, then stood up. \u201cYeah. I'm just hungry. I\u2019ll be back in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I angled my cheek to his lips as he dropped a gentle kiss there.</p><p>\u201cTake care, okay, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and backed away, disappearing out my bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cThe incredible shrinking bedside vigil,\u201d I said, smiling at Arthur.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been that way for days. Poor David has not had a moment alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He patted my hand. \u201cYour people love you. We\u2019ve been very frightened for you these past days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, looking at my quilt. \u201cDo you truly have no recollection of the events of that night?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the training hall?\u201d</p><p>I looked into my thoughts again and tensed all over. \u201cDid we...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, then? I remember you leaving the room but...how did I get to the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>He ran a firm hand down his mouth, looking back at me with tears in his eyes. \u201cAmara, tell me honestly, my dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d I touched my hand to his knee. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>His hand shook. \u201cDid you jump, because of what I tried to make you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Arthur, I really don't think so. Surely I\u2019d remember something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I'm not so sure you would tell me if that were the case.\u201d</p><p>My eyes travelled slowly away from his face to the sitting room across from my bed. I squinted against the pain in my head, searching for something\u2014any little thought that might give me a clue about what happened that night. But it was almost as if the event were a painting I\u2019d heard about but never seen, because I couldn't even muster the slightest image in my mind. \u201cI'm very anti-suicide, Arthur. There\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve jumped. I'm just not that selfish. Think about what it\u2019d do to David\u2014to my people, to my Mum and Dad if they lost me,\u201d I said, taking his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I jumped.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his fingers gradually becoming tighter on mine. \u201cI would not forgive myself if you had, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think I did.\u201d I looked out to my balcony where a man was standing guard, and knew only too well that one of my knights would be right outside my door, too. I wondered if that meant I\u2019d lost the argument about having no guards. \u201cDidn't any of the Guard see me that night\u2014at least walking toward the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. However, all we\u2019ve concluded so far is that you came back to your room before you went down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wearing a nightdress when David found you\u2014not that there was much left of it.\u201d</p><p>That painted a grisly picture in my head. \u201cDidn't anyone report having seen me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not since dinner that night. And the men in the Guard who line the halls are not permitted to divulge, even if they had seen you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey swear a vow of secrecy, which protects you from infiltrators. Often, a simple thing like the whereabouts of the queen or the company she keeps can be enough to tear a monarchy down or see a traitor get the upper hand.\u201d He eyed me for a few seconds. \u201cI do find it awfully suspicious that you have no memory of anything after I left you that night, though.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my head. \u201cArthur. I fell down, like, four hundred feet, onto jagged rocks. I bet my brain was the first thing to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His gaze became shadowed then, his thumb brushing my right brow. \u201cYour skull was caved in on one side.\u201d</p><p>I touched my head, my eyes wide. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDavid said you were down there for quite some time; he was, unfortunately, sitting on the lighthouse when he saw something strange against the rocks, but saw no need to investigate until a blue flash sparked from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what was he doing up on the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for the manor to stir. He was here to see you\u2014planned to tell you the truth about everything\u2014ask for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting the dagger.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor him, I believe you would.\u201d He nodded once.</p><p>\u201cNot to send him to his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He nodded again. \u201cAnyhow, it matters none, my dear. The issue has been resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered him the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat up.</p><p>Arthur pushed me back down. \u201cOn the condition he stays until you\u2019ve conceived a child\u2014an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I don't want that. I don't want him to die...\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled, his eyes betraying a deeper plan. \u201cEver heard of a turkey baster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can create a child in the artificial method.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAs if I were merely a donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. You wanna put your....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201c...Into a turkey baster, and....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d He held back laughter. \u201cYou can be alone when you do this, and there is no need for me to hurt you by touching you that way. Then, as per our previous plan, I will become king by rights, and I will take to kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd David doesn\u2019t know this bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But when he learns the child is not his, we may have a hard time convincing him I\u2019d not touched you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd then what? Will he hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while, I'm certain of it.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe feels strongly about infidelity, my dear\u2014so strongly, in fact, that after Arietta was murdered, I suspected David had killed her. He never approved of Arietta betraying Victor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her though, right?\u201d I held my breath.</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d Arthur patted my hand. \u201cJust be prepared when he learns the child is not his. He will be bitter for a while, but he will come to see that you were not unfaithful, and hope for your future will not be lost entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen should we, um\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do we need to stop the coronation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Go ahead with it. If I father the child, I will reign higher than David anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jase said, rapping on my door as he opened it.</p><p>\u201cHey. Did you eat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked in humbly. \u201cYeah. All good now.\u201d</p><p>Both Arthur and Jason remained quiet for a second, looking at each other, until Jason nodded and Arthur stood. \u201cWell, my dear, I shall leave you in Jason\u2019s capable hands. I have a few things to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed my brow. \u201cBe safe.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him as he walked away; he stopped by Jason, cupped his shoulder firmly and gave him a reassuring smile.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Uncle,\u201d Jase said, nodding, and Arthur left.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there was one,\u201d I said.</p><p>He appeared on the chair where David was when I woke up. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly killed him, you know.\u201d He stared at the ground between his legs. \u201cI thought he\u2019d\u2014\u201d He paused. \u201cI thought he did that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head, his gaze distant.</p><p>\u201cI'm really sorry.\u201d I reached for his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t say it won\u2019t happen again, because I don't know how it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s safe to say it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cThat I can promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I challenged, with a grin. \u201cAnd what are you going to do, sleep on the end of my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think David would approve of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can bite me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed aloud, throwing my head back. \u201cHe just might do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019d get more joy out of torturing me by touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, he\u2019s only too aware that every time he kisses you, strokes your hair, sends me away, tells me I need to leave you to rest, it kills me\u2014it kills me that he gets to make that decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn't mean I don't love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother.\u201d David stood in the doorway, his eyes dark, his shoulders so straight I almost didn't recognise him as my husband.</p><p>Jason stood up. \u201cDavid. Impeccable timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, perfect, I\u2019d say.\u201d He walked slowly into the room. \u201cI don't know what you think is acceptable, brother, but confessing any feelings toward my wife is crossing the line.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jason bowed his head, turned back and smiled softly at me, then left, offering David a scowl as he passed.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I said, slapping the covers.</p><p>He dropped his shoulders, a smile breaking out across his stone mask. \u201cDid you see the look on his face?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. That was mean.\u201d</p><p>He sprung up on the bed, letting his human weight jiggle it a bit, and wrapped both arms around me, sweeping me into his chest. \u201cI know. But it was funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't think he found it funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn't find it very funny that he was sitting by your bed, confessing his love for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, David. You know how he feels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said into my brow, kissing me after. \u201cAnd I know you are too careful of people\u2019s emotions to tell him that\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do tell him that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my head again. \u201cI'm sure you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I sat up a little, wincing at the dull ache in my hip.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201d He rolled me onto my back and lifted my top, his face hovering just above my waist. \u201cI don't believe his affections are one-sided.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled down at my skin, tracing a line over it. \u201cPerhaps I know you better than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d I rolled up a little and looked down. \u201cWhy did you pinch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever suffer from eczema as a child?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, thinking. \u201cYes. When Mum used certain laundry detergents.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI might go speak to housekeeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a mild rash coming up.\u201d He lifted my top a little more, showing the red, raised rash on my hip, just below my underwear.</p><p>I placed my fingertips to it; it was hot. \u201cDo immortals get eczema?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, pulling my top back down. \u201cGuess they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s itchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only itchy because you know it\u2019s there.

You\u2019re still healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d I rubbed my hip. \u201cSo, who fixed me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur, Morgaine and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do\u2014just pour blood down my throat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe actually administered it intravenously. We had to stitch you up, too. You just kept bleeding everywhere once we got your heart started again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt stopped?\u201d</p><p>His chest sunk, his belly no longer moving with his gentle breath. \u201cYou were dead, my love. Completely dead. Your soul left your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I sat up, crossing my legs under me.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd we learned something new about your kind from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you can not only die from having your head chopped off and kept off, nor just from having your heart removed, but if your soul leaves your body\u2014even if it\u2019s perfectly intact, you will slowly decompose and become, essentially, dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, until my soul goes back in my body or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. See, if your body is taken apart, your soul cannot re-enter, but, you, my love, have this magic talent where you can choose to leave your body\u2014almost like your soul isn't tethered to this form. But if you stay out too long, you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, if I did die from staying out too long, can I ever go back in my body?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cI'm not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how long does it take me to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur thinks it\u2019s about twenty-four hours or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you know my soul left my body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stood right there like some freaky ghost, haunting us.\u201d</p><p>I looked at where he pointed to the foot of my bed. \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-hu.\u201d He tucked his hand back behind his head. \u201cI actually think you can do it on command. In fact, I think you\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always disappear from your own head. A part of me wonders if you might actually be gone\u2014maybe you have no recollection of it when you return.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the backs of my hands, then my wrists and up the length of my arms. \u201cI remember a dream I had once\u2014where I felt my soul pull away from my own body, and when I looked back, I was watching myself sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWow. I might try to do that a little more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grabbed my wrist, his eyes wide. \u201cDon't. We weren\u2019t sure you were going to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always come back.\u201d I slid my wrist through his grasp until my hand fell into his. \u201cAs long as I have you to come back to.\u201d</p><p>His fingers closed around mine. \u201cAnd what if you didn't? What if, say...Drake killed me\u2014what then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d kill myself and come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you had a child to care for\u2014our child?\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a second. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>He smiled, looking off to the wall across the room. \u201cGood thing we don\u2019t have to worry about that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said shakily and laid on his chest, stuttering a little as I noticed my wedding ring\u2014back in place. I wondered if Jason had given it to David\u2014told him he took it off me, or if he just slipped it on when no one was looking. \u201cSure is,\u201d I finished.</p><p>Emily skipped into the throne room and held up her mobile phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned at her.</p><p>She pointed dramatically to it, mouthing some word with a round sound between two short mm\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cM...m...Mum?\u201d I jumped up off my throne. \u201cIs that Vicki?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>I waved my hands around in a criss-cross through the air.</p><p>Emily nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered gruffly. \u201cI'm not here, Em. I\u2019ll let something slip if I talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d she said through her teeth. \u201cYou need to tell them the staying in Paris plan.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped. \u201cFine. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>She placed the phone in my hand, practically jumping out of the way after.</p><p>I held it just by my ear and centred myself, taking a deep breath. \u201cVicki. Oh, my God, hi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d she practically yelled. \u201cHow are you? You didn't tell me Emily was on holiday over there with you. What have you been up to, when are you coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d I tucked my neck into my shoulders and walked back to my throne. \u201cIt turns out we\u2019ve been having such a good time, we\u2019ve...well, we\u2019ve decided to stay in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid got a job, and I got accepted to university after I sat a test\u2014even though I didn't finish high school, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the honeymoon to Paris that turned into a world tour, has now become permanent?\u201d Vicki yelled down the phone. \u201cAra, we haven\u2019t seen you since March. How do we even know you\u2019re still alive? I mean, you ran out on your own wedding\u2014\u201d she softened her tone to a reasonable level. \u201cNow, I understand that you realised your flight times were booked wrong, but you didn't even say goodbye, and now you're telling me you're not coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki, I'm sorry, but David landed a great job. We\u2019d be silly to leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you at least come home for a week? Just a week. I\u2019ll pay for the ticket, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicki. I can't. I'm starting school this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don't even speak French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now\u2014a little,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cWell, what does Mike think of this whole arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s happy. He and Em have been keeping my house safe for me, and he made me promise to come for a holiday next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes. I promise. But David's really happy about this job, Mum. It could mean setting us up for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't like it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Mum. David and I are happy, and I really love Paris. I\u2019ll come home in a month, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. So, how's dad\u2019s conference been going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe almost didn\u2019t go, since we hadn\u2019t spoken to you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he always goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s how worried we\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry. I just lose track of time here; it\u2019s so lovely and there's so much to do.\u201d I looked around the empty courtroom. \u201cI\u2019ll take more care to call, okay. But I better go. I have to be somewhere in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, you take care then, and keep sending emails or letters. I\u2019ll be checking the post daily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mum. I will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell Emily to take a picture of you holding a sign with the date on it to prove you're not just a voice recording.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cBye, Ara-Rose, and say hi to David for me as well, send him our love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Bye.\u201d I hung up with my thumb and glared at Em.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d She shrunk. \u201cShe\u2019s been calling my phone for, like, a week, leaving panicked messages \u2018cause she can never reach you on the number you gave her; she said she was going to call the police. I didn't know what to do. I answered the next call, and I panicked\u2014told her I was in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s going to figure out the truth when she checks her phone records, Emily. That wasn\u2019t an international call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Emily winced. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I pulled my phone from the pocket of my light denim jeans. \u201cI\u2019ll get David to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm really sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, resting the phone to my ear. \u201cLike I said, don't worry about it.\u201d</p><p>The Upper and Lower House filed into the courtroom and took their seats. I nodded to each one, keeping the phone to my ear, then looked at Emily. \u201cHe\u2019s not picking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could send Jason,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I hung the phone up and dumped it in my pocket. \u201cGo tell him, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She bowed, then stopped. \u201cUh, I mean, yes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Queen Amara.\u201d Morgaine bowed as she passed.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Morg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s soon-to-be King David?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on a conference call with the FBI,\u201d Walter said, without even looking up from his notepad.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d She slapped a palm to her head. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard when you have half a brain,\u201d Blade scoffed, pushing past her.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Butt-face!\u201d</p><p>I watched Blade walk over and sit down at the council table, then looked back at Morg. \u201cThings didn't work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, hugging herself. \u201cTurns out he\u2019s just a big fat jerk like the rest of the men around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Mike scoffed as he walked in.</p><p>Morg smiled at him. \u201cYou don't count, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, as a man or as a jerk?\u201d</p><p>She bumped him with her elbow and they walked over to the table together.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Emily stood behind me, her arms behind her back, her eyes to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s taking care of that thing for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I turned away and readied myself for Court, half noticing Emily walk off quietly and take her seat beside Blade.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason called as I reached the front door. \u201cWait up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take care of the phone issue yesterday?\u201d I asked, opening the door.</p><p>\u201cYup. That\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d He followed me outside. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I held up my book. \u201cTo the fountain; peace and quiet time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fountain?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of running water\u2014it\u2019s soothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Well, can I sit with you for a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kinda defeats the purpose of peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you wanted to talk to me about something.\u201d We stepped off the porch step into the hot August sun. \u201cSo what\u2019s it going to be? Talk or quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Ara?\u201d He stopped walking. \u201cYou've been pretty cold to me today.\u201d</p><p>With a short huff, I sat on the edge of the fountain, setting my book down beside me. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I'm just a little moody.\u201d Itchy was the right word. I scratched my hip. \u201cAnyway, what did you wanna talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d He sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She was crying last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe feels really bad about the phone call.

But not at Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she has this way of beating herself up for things that aren\u2019t her fault. No matter what it is, she will trace a situation backward until she finds some way she can be to blame. You need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Jason grabbed my wrist as I stood. \u201cThere's something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I feel like I haven't seen you since you woke up from the mini coma the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d I huffed. \u201cThat was four days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but four days is enough for me to feel like I haven't seen you in four years. Can we hang out this afternoon\u2014maybe watch a movie or take a walk together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jason stood up as I walked away.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I'm married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were married before,\u201d he called.</p><p>I stopped and turned back to face him. \u201cI know, but the people didn't know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you're breaking up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never together.\u201d</p><p>He stood quietly for a second, shaking his head. \u201cHow am I supposed to react to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't care.\u201d I turned away.</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do. Don't do that.\u201d He grabbed my wrist again. \u201cDon't pretend you don't care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ara. I know this is hard. I know you\u2019ve never had to deal with having David and I in the same world, but if you just cast me aside now he\u2019s back, I...\u201d He swallowed, his brow furrowing. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect, Jase?\u201d</p><p>He dropped my wrist, closing his eyes. \u201cI didn't think that far ahead. I guess...I just liked it better when David was faking dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he still would be if I hadn\u2019t gone diving off a lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, exhaling. \u201cI just wish I could rewind time.\u201d</p><p>I sat down on the porch step, sweeping my skirt under my legs to hide my undies. \u201cAnd what would you do differently, if time travel were possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make sure I was standing in the street by that phone booth the night you called your mum.\u201d He stepped closer and squatted down in front of me, the height of the manor shading us from the sun. \u201cI\u2019d take the phone from your hand and hold you close\u2014tell you everything would be okay. Then I\u2019d drive you home and see you every day until I asked you to marry me\u2014and you\u2019d say yes, because you love me.\u201d</p><p>I let that play out in my mind\u2014how different my life would be if I had never made that phone call. But my eyes snapped open again to the hot summer of reality. \u201cYou can't say that, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay that you think I love you. I can't let that be true. I'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, closing it at the sound of gravel crunching under tyres.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPost.\u201d He stood up.</p><p>\u201cThat's not a postal van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unmarked. That\u2019ll be official mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I walked beside Jason to the van.</p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d The delivery guy jumped out and smiled. \u201cGot some mail here from the First Order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign for that.\u201d Jason reached for the clipboard, scribbled his name and took the sack from the man.</p><p>\u201cDo they let just anyone sign for the mail?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shrugged and handed the clipboard back.</p><p>\u201cHave a good one.\u201d The driver tipped his baseball cap and jumped in the van.</p><p>\u201cWas he...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman?\u201d Jason grinned and set the sack down on the ground. \u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Don't see those much anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see them at least every three days.\u201d He threw the sack over his shoulder. \u201cBut they\u2019re usually under my teeth, screaming for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw!\u201d I whipped the back of my hand across his chest. \u201cThat is really poor humour, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He laughed and stopped by the fountain to grab my book. \u201cLet\u2019s go sort this mail out. I\u2019ll bet the letters your dad\u2019s been sending are in here.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the sack; that was a lot of mail to sort. \u201cIt\u2019d be easier if we could just have them sent directly to Loslilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But a part of keeping up a lie is putting up with inconveniences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as being dumped because your girlfriend\u2019s husband came back to life.\u201d</p><p>Each letter from dad said the same things; Sam\u2019s doing well, Vicki bought something new to fill the empty space that used to be my bedroom, constantly changing it to be a room for some other hobby she couldn't stick to, and also told me about \u2018Conference Season\u2019\u2014his annual fly-home-and-leave again period, where he\u2019d give History lectures all around the country. He\u2019d stopped asking so much when I was coming home, or if I was coming home.</p><p>I dumped the pile of letters in my nightstand drawer and looked over at the dog sleeping on the settee across my room. He looked peaceful. I wasn't sure I\u2019d ever actually seen Petey sleep before.</p><p>As my gaze moved from the sleeping fluff-ball to the edge of my bed, something caught my eye; a thick, leather-bound book stared back up at me; it was small, like a diary, the aged leather brown and soft, with words in the ancient language embossed on the front.</p><p>I sat on my dresser stool and thumbed the pages, looking up when Petey woke with a loud, whiney yawn. \u201cHey, boy.\u201d</p><p>He jumped off the settee, ran straight to me and snatched the book up in his teeth, dropping it to the floor by my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Petey?\u201d</p><p>He pawed at it, his thick, heavy nails scratching up the ancient paper; I bent down to take it from him, but he turned his head, eyes sharp, growling at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Do your thing.\u201d I backed away, kneeling beside him.</p><p>He came to a page showing several figures of various body parts\u2014marked with patterns and runes, and sat back on his hindquarters, air snuffing from his nose in gusts. I studied his heaving chest and the little slightly discoloured patches of fur above his eyes that looked like brows.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to see something on this page?\u201d I said, knowing it was probably asking the obvious.</p><p>He snuffed again, sitting tall like an army general. I rested my hands down by my knees and peered over the page; there were English translations of several Marks. I read each one, saying them aloud to myself. \u201cI don't get it, Petey. What are you trying to show me?\u201d</p><p>He leaned across and nuzzled my ribs, biting at my top a little, making it soggy with his hot breath.</p><p>\u201cMy rash?\u201d</p><p>After doing that sneeze thing that I\u2019d come to conclude was a nod, he pressed his heavy paw to the page again, resting it over a picture of a torso. I shoved him off and leaned closer. \u201cNow she wears the Mark of Betrayal; the Cursed Rune of one who will eternally suffer the consequences of her own undoing.\u201d I looked into the dog\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He stared me down.</p><p>My brow scrunched, my eyes becoming small. \u201cPetey, I don't get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that beautiful girl of mine?\u201d David said, coming out of the bathroom. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown here,\u201d I called, standing up. I went to grab the book, but Petey flicked it with his paw, sending it under the bed. \u201cEnjoy your shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoroughly.\u201d David ran up behind me, scooped me into his arms and threw me on the bed, landing between my legs in nothing but a wet towel.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I squealed.</p><p>\u201cMaking love to my wife.\u201d</p><p>I giggled, pushing his hands off my ribs, trying to inch up the bed away from him. \u201cStop. That really tickles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>My body thrashed about under his, my face going tight with blood from all the laughing, and his fangs gleamed in the afternoon light, looking so white and sharp against those oh-so-kissable lips.</p><p>He stopped then, and we both panted heavily, his sweetly-scented breath coming down on the bridge of my nose. \u201cMy coronation\u2019s tomorrow,\u201d he said, still a little puffed. \u201cI want to make love to you now in case all the extra power affects my manhood.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my chin so my nose brushed along his, then kissed his soft, full lips once. \u201cI want to, David, but I can't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan't?\u201d he scoffed, his voice high. \u201cCan't what?\u201d</p><p>I rolled out from under him and jumped off the bed. \u201cI...I can't have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He got up, too.</p><p>\u201cI'm just...not really in the mood.\u201d I looked away from his eyes, worried he\u2019d see I was lying. In truth, I just couldn\u2019t risk falling pregnant to him until Arthur and I had done our deed with the turkey baster.</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood?\u201d He pressed the back of his hand to my brow. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I walked away and flopped back on the bed, huffing. \u201cI'm just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He grabbed me from under the arms and slid me up to the pillows, cocooning me in the covers from his side of the bed. \u201cSleep. I\u2019ll go take care of Court this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't. You haven\u2019t been crowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see them argue that with me,\u201d he said with a smirk and kissed my brow, sweeping my hair back as he stood up again. \u201cJust rest. I\u2019ll be back up in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I rolled over and snuggled into the pillow, smiling. \u201cThanks, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't mention it.\u201d He disappeared, closing the wardrobe door a second later.</p><p>The afternoon ticked by. I laid on my bed, looking up at the dome, imagining Little Lili playing with her uncle. In my dreams of her\u2014the labyrinth one and the Garden of Lilith one\u2014she was different. I assumed the child with hair of gold, playing on the rope swing, was Little Lili, but Lilith\u2019s hair was dark, like mine.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d David asked, leaning on the doorframe, his arms folded, watching me get lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>I nodded at the dome.</p><p>He appeared beside me, angling his head to touch mine as well as look up at the glass. \u201cLilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That was the third dream I\u2019ve had about a little girl, except, this time, she was running through the passage Jason discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat passage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the fireplace. I don't know\u2014he just pushed on a few places, and a door opened in the wall.\u201d</p><p>David appeared by the fireplace, rapping and tapping on several different spots.</p><p>\u201cOther side of the fireplace,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He walked over and did his thing, then stopped midway down the panel and pushed. Sure enough, it popped out, and he opened it.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find that so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm just that good.\u201d He turned back to smile at me, holding out his hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Down there?\u201d I asked, flying over to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I pulled back. \u201cI promised Jase I\u2019d go with him.\u201d</p><p>David spun around to look at me, his lip lifting over his teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s not your husband. You don't get to make promises to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He grabbed my hand and dragged me into the darkness. I didn't mind, though. I kind of wanted to go exploring with David.</p><p>\u201cSo, where do you think this leads?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe to the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Quite often, in older buildings that housed the rich or important, they\u2019d build these escape tunnels in case of invasion or robbery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come no one knows it\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point. You can't escape out a secret passage if everyone knows you have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, wouldn\u2019t they be able to tell it\u2019s here\u2014I mean, there\u2019d be a gap between the end of the manor outside and where the walls end inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn't notice a gap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I suspect all the rooms on this end of the manor end short to allow for this passage\u2014no one would notice a few inches if it was consistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, it\u2019s not big enough to take up a whole room.\u201d I reached out and touched both walls at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does in Jason\u2019s room\u2014he only has one window, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He rubbed his chin. \u201cClever girl. I didn't think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I. Jase did.\u201d</p><p>He stood taller. \u201cCan you stop calling him that, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase,\u201d he said in a mock girl\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s just a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the name I have a problem with; it\u2019s the affectionate undertone, the big dough eyes and the way your voice softens on the end, Ara.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt so does not.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, shaking his head, and wandered down the stairs, rapping on the inside walls.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I ran down after him.</p> <p>\u201cLook.\u201d He stopped and turned to face me. \u201cI know how you are, Ara. We\u2019ve always had to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and...other guys. You get too close. You get too caught up, and...you\u2019re not a child anymore, my love. You just can't behave that way now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm trying, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying isn't enough. It stops. All the flirting, all the mucking about, all the looking at other guys. From this moment on, you will not \u2018hang out with\u2019, notice, smile at or even think about a guy, unless it\u2019s me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, I can't even have guy friends, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can't tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can't! You\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when?\u201d I put my hands on my hips.</p><p>\u201cSince I married you. Discussion closed.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>\u201cNo! I'm allowed to have friends, David. And it\u2019s twisted and sick that you would even say something like that.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, sighing heavily. \u201cLook, I know, okay. But I have to be more careful with you than I did with other girls, Ara. You can't keep yourself in check. You don't know how to control yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, David. Okay, maybe I'm a little closer with Jase-on, than I should be, but I can stop that. I can make distance between us, but you can't tell me what I can and cannot do.\u201d I made myself a little taller. \u201cI love you, but I won't stand for that.\u201d</p><p>He groaned again and started down the stairs, banging around, searching for something.</p><p>\u201cDavid, are you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said in short. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m mad at my brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don't want him to love you. I understand why he does; how can he not?\u201d He presented me with a flat palm. \u201cBut I don't like it.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my feet then back up, grinning. \u201cI can be a bitch to him, if you like. I can make him hate me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t. You\u2019re not capable of that. Just...just be careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>I reached out, and he placed his hand in mine. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stop calling him Jase.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to himself, but it was weak. \u201cAnd, can you just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d I prompted him out of his pause.</p><p>\u201cIf I was ever...if Drake ever...\u201d He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cDavid? Don't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to say this.\u201d He put his hand up between us. \u201cIf I was ever not around for any reason, you...just...not my brother, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay. But it\u2019s not an issue, we\u2019re immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who then?\u201d I asked, following him down the stairs. \u201cHypothetically, if you ever got hit by a car and died, who would you choose for me?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat again, grinning when he pushed on the wall and it gave way, revealing a door. \u201cTo be honest?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo one. Ever.\u201d He shoved the door open and it creaked over my shock. \u201cGet a cat.\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously, squeezing his hand as we stepped into the greyish darkness of a shadowy room. The musty smell of dust dried my nostrils out, and my eyes shot straight to the boarded windows, blocking out all light, all life. The room was cold, ghostly, a bedroom clearly cut in half by the wall of Jason\u2019s room; a doll house, a small table laid out with a tea-set, and a few other things had been shoved aside, sitting awkwardly in a cluster by the four-poster bed. Wooden stars, painted gold, hung down from hooks in the roof above it, and an old round rug, grey with dust, cradled the rail of a wooden rocking horse; its mane streaked in purples, golds and blues. On a shelf by the wall where we stood was a collection of expressionless dolls, copper-eyed bears, tiny lace gloves and other trinkets.</p><p>\u201cI know what this is,\u201d David said, walking across the room.</p><p>\u201cA child\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, tugging a board on the window. \u201cBut not just any child\u2014it was Lilith\u2019s first daughter.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped.</p><p>David chuckled, tossing the plank of wood aside, and light peeled into the room all around me, showing dancing motes of dust, woken from centuries of slumber or hiding. The bedcovers were still ruffled, once slept in, and right between the window and the fireplace, an old chair sat proudly, a book still open in place on the seat.</p><p>I ran my fingers over every surface, touching the detailed carvings in the foot of the bed, running my hand down the post, feeling the presence of my ancestors.</p><p>\u201cThis room must be centuries old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d David muttered, nodding at the torn curtains around the bedposts, nearly worn away to nothing but silvery webs.</p><p>I reached across and plucked a small ragdoll from between the pillows, standing up again to look at her; she was loved once. But someone came in here, took away that little girl and she never saw this place again. Never outgrew her toys, never heard the end of that story\u2014never even crawled back into bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d David came up beside me.</p><p>I flattened the doll\u2019s hair and hugged her to my chest before placing her back and tucking the blanket around her. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad. What happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome say it was losing the summer, some say it was heartache.\u201d</p><p>I touched the torn white curtain over her bed, unthreading a web from the base. \u201cHow old was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have been nine the year she died, as far as I\u2019ve read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvangeline\u2014The Rose of Winter. She was born on the first day it snowed that year, with lips red as a rose, and there was never a more loved little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvangeline? Wasn't Lilith\u2019s granddaughter named Evangeline, too\u2014my ancestor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I\u2019ve learned recently?\u201d he said, like he was asking if I wanted to know. \u201cNone of Lilith\u2019s children reached adulthood. Everything we\u2019ve been taught about her is lies. I'm not sure how your bloodline survived, but I'm starting to wonder if you\u2019re even related to Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...this Evangeline\u2014\u201d I nodded around the room, \u201c\u2014isn't the one I descended from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the version of the story I read.\u201d</p><p>I took a moment to combine that with the information Arthur had given me about Drake and his reasons for killing Lilith. \u201cWhat broke her heart so badly\u2014Evangeline? Why did she lose the summer?\u201d</p><p>He wandered over to the rug, then bent down and picked something up, dusting it off as he stood. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I reached for it, smiling when I felt its round body, smooth and cool in my palm. \u201cAn apple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father Christian, Lilith\u2019s first husband, had this preserved in gold for Eve when she had her accident. It was his way of bringing some of the outside back to a little girl who would never see it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d I spun the apple between my fingers softly.</p><p>He sat down on Eve\u2019s bed. \u201cShe liked to play in the orchards, back when we still grew apples here. But, one winter, she went down there alone and climbed the oak tree where the workers would sit for lunch, but her foot slipped. She fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She was paralysed. If she\u2019d been of age, they would have given her blood, but they were afraid it would trigger immortality and she would be trapped as a child for eternity. So, they prayed. But as the weeks passed, that vibrant, spirited little girl became a ghost, and she grew ill. She died before she saw the summer again, and I guess they locked this room off to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d I sat beside him, sinking into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing some reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a book about all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some. But this was in a maid\u2019s diary\u2014at Elysium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get it for me\u2014when you go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I already planned to bring you all the books, anyway. I just need to take a car with me next time so I can collect all the stuff from my old room, too.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the apple, polishing it with my fingertip; it was small, for an apple\u2014only the size of a plum. \u201cWhy is it so tiny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was winter. Apples don't grow in the winter.\u201d He took it and studied it. \u201cLegend has it that her father went down to the orchard to scream at the gods, and when he looked up at the oak tree, this was sitting on the branch his daughter had fallen from.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re having me on. That\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, closing my fingers around the apple. \u201cThis is just what I read. Wanna know something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Eve died, Lilith had the orchard torn down\u2014forbid apples to be grown here or eaten here for the rest of eternity. But Christian, believing this apple to be a gift from the gods, couldn\u2019t bear to tear that oak tree down. It now marks the centre of what once was the orchard.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, my eyes becoming wide. \u201cThe field?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWow. How come you never told me any of this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a lot of time for small talk, Ara. And I only read this one a few weeks ago. I might even be wrong about whose room this was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me more stories?\u201d I said, using the bedpost to stand myself up as David wandered across the room again, touching everything.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stopped by the armchair and picked up the book, his lips turning down with thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat were they reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo title.\u201d He held the cover up.</p><p>\u201cCan I have the book?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike, can I keep it?\u201d</p><p>He placed it in my hand. \u201cIt belongs to you, I guess\u2014all this stuff does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I placed the apple and the book on the dresser next to a small wooden jewellery box. \u201cIt belongs to Evangeline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure she won't care. She's dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven still. It doesn't seem right.\u201d I opened the jewellery box and smiled when I saw the collection of trinkets Eve saved; there was a lock of golden hair, tied with a pink ribbon, which might have been hers\u2014beside that was an oval pendant on a long silver chain and a small bracelet with a flat name plaque. I picked it up and traced the letters, reading them aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d David appeared beside me.</p><p>\u201cMorgana.\u201d I held the bracelet up.</p><p>He took it and studied it carefully. \u201cI thought she was just a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. I\u2019ve read parchments that mentioned a lost child, and found only one that named her, but never any proof that she existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she died as a child, too.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and placed the bracelet against my arm. \u201cNot if this was hers. It would fit a girl who was grown\u2014beyond childhood.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the wooden box. \u201cI wonder what it\u2019s doing in here then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know.\u201d He picked up the little box, placed the bracelet in it and closed the lid, looking at the base, the sides and the top.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d he said, spotting something in the mess of fake jewels and other ornaments. He picked up a small crank handle, pressed it into the side of the box, then wound it around and set the box down again, taking a step back. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, I slowly lifted the lid, and music chimed through the air; a sad, haunting song. But I knew the tune somehow.</p><p>As it played, I circled around slowly, hugging myself, taking in the room; purples and blues must have been her favourite colours, and I imagined, from the stars on the roof and the ones I now noticed painted all over the walls, fading with age, that she must have loved the night sky, too. Maybe she was a dreamer, like me; maybe she believed wishes would come true. But she never lived to find out.</p><p>The song ended, making the room seem like a very lonely place.</p><p>\u201cHow many daughters did Lilith have?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure. I believe there were three\u2014maybe four with Morgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this room has been boarded up since fourteen hundred?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike, did the other children ever live in here?\u201d</p><p>David's eyes stayed on me, where they\u2019d clearly been the whole time. \u201cI don't know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rocking horse.\u201d I nodded at it. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even invented until, well, I can't remember when, but it wasn\u2019t until around the eighteenth century, was it?\u201d</p><p>He walked over and pushed the ear of the horse, making it rock. \u201cThat\u2019s what people say. But I heard my uncle speak of them\u2014talked of seeing one when he was child. And that was as early as the thirteen hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess that doesn't give us any clues about how long this room has been like this, does it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Unfortunately.\u201d He smiled at the horse then, focusing, a world of thoughts going on behind that secret grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be nice,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes on the horse.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo have a child of our own.\u201d</p><p>I wandered over and stood beside him. \u201cOne day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know, Ara. I...now that I can be here with you, I guess...things are changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI've been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm, you shouldn\u2019t do that. Thinking is bad for your health,\u201d I said as he slid his arms along my sides, holding me close.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s bad for your health, mon amour. I'm fine,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut, I was kinda thinking it might be nice\u2014to maybe at least start trying for a baby again.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him for a second, about to ask who he was and what he\u2019d done with my David, but Arthur\u2019s words filtered through me, making me grin, though I kind of wanted to slap him as well; he had to have a baby with me to get the dagger. \u201cAnd you think I'm suddenly ready for a baby now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He turned away quickly and picked up a doll off the shelf. \u201cI think you\u2019d make a great mother, Ara. I mean\u2014\u201d He smiled, stroking the doll\u2019s hair. \u201cI think we can do this. You always loved Harry, and you have a heart full of empathy and compassion. That's all it really takes to begin with. The rest we can learn as we go along\u2014\u201d He shrugged and placed the doll down. \u201cOr read books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know. I'm still not so sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not.\u201d He came up and placed his hands on my waist again. \u201cI made you think I had no faith in you, but I do. And I want this\u2014I want to be a family with you.\u201d</p><p>Only so you can leave me as a single mother in order to keep me safe for eternity. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a switch from \u2018I'm only nineteen\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot has changed since then.\u201d He delicately took my hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine,\u201d I said, merely because it served my own purpose. \u201cWe\u2019ll start trying again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He leaned in and kissed my cheek, his dimple showing as he stood back, even in the darkness of this room trapped in the past. \u201cI know we can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if I can fall pregnant, David. I can't even calculate ovulation because I haven\u2019t had a period since I first arrived at the manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you took the pregnancy test?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s in my drawer, if you wanna see it.\u201d</p> <p>He hugged me to him, breathing his concern into the crown of my head. \u201cI hope completing the transformation hasn't made you infertile, like other vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't say that\u2014that would be very bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sure we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He kissed the top of my head.</p><p>Everyone clapped as the saltshaker came to rest by a wine glass. I looked to the end of the table, and even David, who I half expected to groan at his brother\u2019s display, was cheering and smiling\u2014happy. I gave a little wave, to which he returned a bow, in a very kingly manner.</p><p>\u201cShow us another,\u201d Margret said, clapping.</p><p>Jason looked at his uncle bashfully and took up a spoon. Arthur didn't seem too impressed at this show of power, and I think Jase...Jason knew that. He focused on the spoon, holding it in front of his nose, and slowly lowered his hand, leaving the spoon in the air, floating.</p><p>I joined in the applause this time, too impressed to play the humble queen, but when David stopped smiling suddenly to glare at me, I lowered my hands into my lap, my eyes following, and sat quietly while our people talked animatedly about Jason\u2019s next cool trick.</p><p>\u201cOh, you are a very talented young man,\u201d Margret said.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d David said. \u201cPerhaps my bother\u2019s new role should be Court Jester.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed. Jason followed with something witty and clever that only amplified that laughter, but I actually didn't even hear it. My mouth felt dry and my dinner was stuck against a huge lump in my throat. And it wasn't because David scolded me for joining in\u2014it was something else. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but it just felt like something was missing\u2014like I\u2019d forgotten something really important, and wherever it was, it made my heart ache.</p><p>David's eyes narrowed as he looked past the long line of vampires and saw my obvious sadness. I offered a weak smile and looked back at my lap again. I could feel Jason and Arthur\u2019s eyes on me, too, but I knew if I looked up, Jason's face would be saying \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d and I would think in my mind \u201cSomething\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>What a stupid way to feel. Something\u2019s missing. What could be missing? I had everything. My David was sitting at the head of the table, finally, and tonight, we\u2019d go to bed and I\u2019d fall asleep in his arms, and tomorrow, he\u2019d be king. What more could I possibly want?</p><p>I looked up at Jason then, and sure enough, it was there; the concern, the obvious worry in his eyes. I could almost read his mind, see him jumping to his feet to hold me in his arms, but it was David who appeared beside me. \u201cMy queen. Care for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my king,\u201d I said timidly and took his hand. His touch felt cool and familiar, but strangely, not as familiar as it should have been for all the years we\u2019d been in love.</p><p>We walked to the garden, and as the loud chatters of our people became distant murmurs, he stopped, turning me in his arms, looking right into my eyes, the moonlight above making his face white, like the dead. \u201cI'm sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a jerk today, and...I hurt your feelings. I know that.\u201d He gently squeezed the tops of my arms. \u201cI'm just afraid of losing you, I...you\u2019re the one thing in my life that I've never had control over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, with wide eyes, tightening his fingers on my arms. \u201cI don't want control, Ara. I don't want to control or own you. I love you. But I just don't know how to keep you\u2014how to make sure I never lose you.\u201d</p><p>I slowly lifted my hand up between us and pointed to my wedding ring. \u201cThat\u2019s what this means. It means I love you no matter what. It means I will be with you through hell and fire, and it means I will keep my promise to be with you, even when I don't want to keep that promise anymore.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, smiling at my ring. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>I held my hand to my chest. \u201cWell, I say it because I mean it, okay.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, sliding his hands down my arms to take my hands. \u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...for treating you that way. I don't want to be that kind of husband\u2014or that kind of man.\u201d He closed his eyes, biting his teeth together. \u201cI promised you I\u2019d changed since we met, and what you saw today was me breaking that promise. I understand you, Ara\u2014I understand that your flirtatious nature is a part of you, and might always be, but I just want to make sure I\u2019ll be the only one you\u2019ll ever love.\u201d</p><p>I stepped into him a little more. \u201cEven if death comes for us, you will always be my one true love. Nothing will ever be strong enough to break us apart, David. We\u2019ve been through those fires of hell.\u201d I pointed off to nowhere. \u201cAnd we always come back. We always will.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand delicately and kissed my ring. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>The grand piano my husband learned to play on was old\u2014ancient being a better word. It sat on detailed, heavy-set legs, shining gloriously in a deep mahogany colour, the words Chickering, Boston, in curly letters below the music stand.</p><p>It must\u2019ve been a rare piano, probably been here since the eighteen-hundreds.</p><p>I stopped playing and listened to the world around me, starting up again when I was satisfied that the door I thought I heard slam was just the wind. My fingers moved fast over the notes, my wrists sore with the extra weight I had to use on the heavy, ancient keys, and I played the sorrowful song of a symphony written by favourite modern band. It was a complex piece, much too intricate for only two hands, which is why it surprised me so much to hear the harmony being played; I looked beside me to Jason, smiling as his hands moved along with mine.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He smiled warmly, and we continued to play. It was like flying, like running a race and looking behind you, knowing you\u2019re winning, and when the song came to its soft, sorrowful end, I rested my hands in my lap, breathing heavily, kind of laughing.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a rare talent, Ara-Rose,\u201d he said, kissing my hand. \u201cYou play as well as my brother, yet you\u2019re only nineteen human years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou play pretty well yourself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at the keys, then closed the cover. \u201cPiano was always really more my brother\u2019s thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s your thing?\u201d</p><p>He moved one shoulder in a gentle shrug.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYeah. I'm just...there\u2019re a few things on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>He looked over his shoulder, up the stairs and down, then back at me. \u201cI'm happy for him\u2014for David. Being king...it\u2019s a dream he\u2019d always held close to his heart. I'm not sure anyone but he, and maybe me, know how much it truly means to him. But I...I don't know if I can be there tomorrow, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cI...I wish I could tell you why, but...\u201d</p><p>I waited, my heart beating fiercely for the agony in his eyes. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll go. He\u2019s my brother, after all. I should be there to see him become king.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back a little to catch his entire frame in my sight. \u201cWho are you trying to convince?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cMyself. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike\u2019s deep voice reached us, breaking us apart from across the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He walked slowly over, eyeing Jason, then smiled at me. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing up so late, baby? You worrying about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly. \u201cKinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He reached his hand out. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back up to bed.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jason; he nodded to me, as if to say Mike\u2019s undertone of accusation hadn't offended him, but I knew it did. He hadn't told me himself, but Morgaine filled me in on what happened while I was unconscious\u2014how everyone somehow came to conclude that Jason was to blame for what happened to me, and that the memory loss I experienced was actually his attempt to cover up something horrible he\u2019d done. I took Mike\u2019s hand and gave Jason a reassuring smile as I stood. Night, Jase, I thought.</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d he said, turning back to the piano, lifting the cover as Mike led me away.</p><p>When we reached the second floor, I heard the sultry tunes of the third part of that symphony. It pained me to hear it played that way\u2014much slower and more heartfelt than I\u2019d heard before. It almost seemed like a musical message from Jason, screaming out the torment in his soul. But no matter how hard I tried, I\u2019d never be able to free him. Something had come to trouble him since I woke from the coma, and whatever it was, I felt like maybe I\u2019d lost him in a small way\u2014like there was a rift between us now that couldn't be repaired.</p><p>\u201cPlease don't wander around the manor at night, Ara,\u201d Mike said, startling me a bit. \u201cI can't sleep anymore. I find myself checking the training hall and the beach several times a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just check my room?\u201d I half laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a conscious decision. I just wake up in a sweat, panicked, and find myself headed down there.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. David's here. He won't let me fall off the lighthouse again.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, smiling smugly. \u201cHe has no idea you\u2019re out of bed now. How long were you two sitting there, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess than a minute or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I'm sorry, baby, but David's asked me to keep an eye out for you\u2014keep you and Jason apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, that\u2019s his brother, who is in love with you. Can you blame him?\u201d</p><p>I let my shoulders drop. \u201cNo. I suppose not. Guess it\u2019s kinda the same as me not liking David around Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Mike said, overemphasising his nod. \u201cI'm so glad you finally get it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the corridor ahead, silently counting the windows to my room. \u201cHey, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about why I don't remember anything about my fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he said in a stern tone. \u201cBut, given the state your head was in when David pulled you out of the water, I'm also not surprised. I did question Jason, though\u2014to see if maybe he\u2019d erased something from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would make you think he\u2019d erased something?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head to himself, sighing. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really, it\u2019s just that...I can't remember, for the life of me, what I was doing that night. I remember I had to drop some new cuffs off down at the training hall, but I don't remember doing it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you didn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, except the cuffs are in the training hall now.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p> <p>\u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t mean anything, really\u2014I\u2019ve seen it happen before, you know. In trauma situations, families of victims can quite often experience mind blanks due to shock. And, I gotta tell you, baby, the things that went through my mind when I saw you that way.\u201d He stopped walking. \u201cI wanted to rip shreds off anyone who\u2019d ever touched you. I wanted to kill David for not being here to protect you. I was so blindly angry I actually punched him in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked at his fist. \u201cHe shoulda been here. He shoulda been here all along, and none of this woulda happened.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed his chest, letting out the breath I\u2019d been holding. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mike. I'm safe now, and...if it makes you feel any better, you can put guards on my room at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His eyes almost bludged out of his head.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Can't have you losing sleep.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my hand. \u201cThanks, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>David woke early, slinking out bed without disturbing the covers, and left the room, wearing joggers. Outside, the crows cawed and the excitement of things to come could almost be heard in the very breath of the earth. Today, Mother Nature gained a king; today, David would don his ceremonial dress and, together, we would spill blood on the Stone.</p><p>I knew where he was going when he left\u2014knew he needed to run\u2014needed to clear his head because, in his mind, today marked one of the milestones of his life. He always had great respect for royalty, and to become king was an honour I knew he felt deeper than any of us could understand. But that wasn\u2019t why he went running. He went because this also marked one of the first items in his Inventory of Death. All he needed after today was to get me pregnant so he could have the dagger, and then, he believed, he\u2019d be going to his death\u2014leaving me and our unborn child alone, possibly to fall into Jason\u2019s arms, possibly to get a cat, but eternally and definitely safe from Drake. He loved me that much, loved our future child that much that he was willing to die, never to hold her.</p><p>I rolled the covers back and sat up, feeling the summer heat in the floorboards under my toes. Across the room, the long double-breasted white coat David would wear to be crowned in sat on the mannequin\u2014all tailored and cut to fit the future king.</p> <p>I wandered over and ran my fingers down the gold buttons, over the tasselled epaulettes on the shoulders and across the blue sash. I imagined him standing tall and proud in this outfit; imagined this being the happiest day of our lives\u2014one not spoiled by Drake; imagined telling the truth about what I planned to do with Arthur, so that maybe, when that crown touched his head, he could rejoice his rise as king, not mourn the death he was facing.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d The door popped open and David walked in.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, why are you awake so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He lifted his shirt off. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d He stood beside me, touching my arm. \u201cWhy are you worrying, sweetheart? It's not like I have to do the Walk of Faith.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, looking away from his toned arms, supressing the urge to throw him down on the bed and... \u201cI'm just worried you might be fighting some battle inside that you\u2019re not telling me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d he said very softly, tilting my chin to lift my gaze.</p><p>I shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cMy love.\u201d He swept me inward and cradled me against his bare chest. \u201cI love you, okay. And I'm all right. Everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it will.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cBecause I'm going to make it all right.\u201d</p><p>He stared into my eyes for a long breath, clearly trying to read my thoughts, but all he got was a firm glare, determination hovering over a burn of fight behind them that swore, upon pain of death, I would make this all right. I would not let him go\u2014not let him die to save me. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I looked away. \u201cLike you said. Everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>The manor grounds were coloured with faces from all over the world; vampires, Lilithians and humans\u2014all together, all united to celebrate. I smiled, passing each one as I walked toward the Throne Room, bowing my head to staff and guards, guests and visitors. Everyone was charged with the same kind of excitement, but my smile was a little forced. Though I drew on their energy and could relate it, the deeper concern for David's emotions today was eating all that up.</p><p>I stopped by the common room and waltzed inside to where Arthur sat in a chair by the window, staring off thoughtfully into the bright summer day.</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear.\u201d He reached his hand out.</p><p>I took it and sat down on the arm of his chair. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look sad,\u201d I said, cocking my head.</p><p>\u201cThoughtful might be a better word.\u201d</p><p>I slid down onto the tiny spot next to him, forcing him to shift over a little. \u201cAre you worried about David?\u201d</p><p>He leaned his elbow on the armrest, turning his body slightly to look at me. \u201cI'm more concerned about you, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not sure you can go through with this plan\u2014to have a child. And once that crown touches my nephew\u2019s head, you will have no choice\u2014if you want to keep him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I looked down. \u201cBut, I have a bit of a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been pressuring me to...make a baby with him, because he wants this dagger. But if I sleep with him, then I might actually fall pregnant and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't worry.\u201d He patted my knee. \u201cHe\u2019ll stop pushing you now. He and I have come to a new arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat arrangement?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat quietly as he looked down. \u201cHe came to me late last night, fighting his dark conscience\u2014told me he was uncomfortable being forced to create life under the wrong circumstances. He said if he was ever to father a child, it should be out of love, not force, and he asked that I reconsider my conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHe argued a few very good points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, instead of the dagger being provided upon conception of an heir, it would be offered on condition he stay a few more days\u2014give you a small sample of the life you deserved to have with him.\u201d</p><p>I rested a hand on his forearm, sitting up a little. \u201cArthur, promise me you won't give him that dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give it to him\u2014but not the real dagger,\u201d he added quickly when I gasped. \u201cHe will leave for Elysium next week under guise of freeing prisoners, and when he gets to Paris, where he\u2019s really going, he will not be able to find Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the letter the House received, informing that Drake had fled to Paris, was a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the original was sent to me. He wrote me as a friend, announcing his decision to travel around Romania for a month, giving me more time to \u2018impregnate\u2019 you.\u201d He held his hands up, smiling. \u201cHis words; not mine. Anyway, I forged the letter the House received, and they sent knights to Elysium to confirm Drake was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, David will come back here then\u2014after Paris?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cAnd by then, you will be pregnant with my heir, and I will name myself king, swear my oath and be in Romania before David even sets foot back on American soil.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhat if I don't fall pregnant, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will destroy that dagger, because, my dear, David won't rest until he finds it, and I don't believe there is any other way to kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even venom\u2014if we starve him first, break down his immunity?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo. In the letter Drake sent, he was bragging about a spell he\u2019d successfully used to save his own life after being stabbed with that sword. He said the side-effect was total immunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d like to get my hands on that spell\u2014or even the witch he uses to write them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a vampire\u2014an old, old woman. I\u2019ve never met her, or even seen her, but he calls her Safia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he has his own witch.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled softly, one corner of his lip pulling, his eyes distant.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Uncle,\u201d David said as he glided into the room.</p><p>\u201cDavid, my boy, all ready for the big event?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him where he stopped by the chair. \u201cJust have to dress, but\u2014can I borrow my lovely wife for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Arthur shuffled aside a little more, motioning for David to take me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He scooped me up in his arms like a child. \u201cI\u2019ll bring her back in ten, if you still need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He smiled warmly, resting his knuckles by his lips. \u201cYou can keep her.\u201d</p><p>David bowed and walked us out into the open corridor.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to help me get my ceremonial dress on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have staff for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiled into my brow. \u201cBut I want as much time with you as I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore...nothing.\u201d He kissed the tip of my nose, nodding at Jason, who flashed his obviously well-practiced fake smile as we passed. \u201cI just want to spend time with you. That\u2019s all right, isn't it?\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into him, swinging my arm over his neck, holding on tight. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever is all we ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you promise,\u201d I said, pressing my nose right to his.</p><p>He stopped walking. \u201cPromise what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you promise forever.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders became straighter, his breath quiet. \u201cI...I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise what?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>His smiling eyes went a little wider. \u201cI promise not to drop you.\u201d</p><p>I squealed as he let go of me, catching me just before I hit the ground. \u201cYou butt-wipe.\u201d I slapped his chest.</p><p>He laughed, standing up again, holding me just a little tighter this time. \u201cI love you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>What should have been the happiest breath I took, came in as more of a sigh\u2014the joy spoiled by the deep, hidden pain in David's eyes. I offered a smile, but he couldn't rise above the sadness enough to return one. It was the first real sign he\u2019d given of the things he was suffering inside.</p><p>He\u2019d been fine as we dressed together, laughing about things we\u2019d not laughed about since I was human, and while I stood in front of him, naked, he\u2019d dropped to his knees and pressed his cool lips to the rash on my hip, moving sweetly soft kisses up to my ribs and over the Mark of my promise\u2014the same line he might have soon. But as the day wore on and the sun began to sink in the sky, he grew quiet and thoughtful.</p><p>I stepped back, pinching the open vein in my arm, and David reached down to take my hand as we spoke the words of our vow, feeling the light of Mother Nature fill our souls with warmth. I didn't remember feeling this when I took my oath, but it felt like the way Mike described it; as if someone injected hot coffee down the artery in your neck and let it pass through every limb, stopping in your heart like a happy feeling.</p><p>The darkness in David\u2019s eyes faded a little then, as he spoke the last words of his promise; \u201cTo give my life in service of my people and my queen.\u201d</p><p>Across from us, Emily and Morg hugged Mike\u2019s chest, while Blade and Falcon watched on like proud uncles, and Arthur stood almost centre to it all\u2014my foundation\u2014the strong knight that would save the world, save my people\u2014save my husband.</p><p>David's fingers tightened ever so slightly on mine, and I felt the heat charge his skin, the Mark of his promise coming to life somewhere underneath. He felt it, too\u2014felt the burn, felt the power, but showed no distress, no emotion, like a good king.</p><p>Then, as if by some secret cue, our people moved\u2014parted to make way for us. We bowed to the Stone and started off between Bert and Boris, hand in hand. We weren\u2019t allowed to speak until the crown touched David's head, but we didn't need to. I knew he was smiling at me because he thought I looked beautiful in my white ball gown, with my hair falling down in curls under my crown. And he knew I was smiling at him because I was so proud to be beside him; so proud of everything he\u2019d become\u2014everything he\u2019d sacrificed to make this day possible.</p><p>I lifted his hand and kissed his palm, tasting the blood of his promise on my lips, thinking, I love you.</p><p>He reached out then and smoothed the blood away, leaning across to kiss the remains. \u201cLove you, too,\u201d he whispered so quietly, his lips shaping his breath as words no one else would hear.</p><p>I looked up in surprise. Did you hear me?</p><p>And he just smiled\u2014his secret smile growing into a radiant grin. My heart fluttered the whole way then as we walked the path of red and white roses at our feet, past the people and the marble columns, down the crimson carpet and took the stairs to the thrones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just before we reached the top, David quickly bent down and grabbed something, then stood back up again, smiling at his closed fist.</p><p>I stared at him quizzically.</p><p>To new beginnings, his voice came through my thoughts like real words, and he opened his hand, revealing a small red rosebud before pressing it between our palms, linking his fingers through mine.</p> <p>And I knew what he meant; everything we were, everything we had grown to be had started on ground so shaky, and somehow, we\u2019d survived. Somehow, the blossom of love we had between us had never died.</p><p>Ever since I first felt death in my life, all I wanted was to find my place in the world, and when I found it with this man, he was taken away from me so many times\u2014our forever always a question\u2014always only a hope we had for the future. But as we stood atop the step, two thrones behind us, hand in hand, eternity was no longer a hope, but a promise I would fight to keep.</p><p>I squeezed his hand and smiled up at him, feeling the cool flower between us; in this moment, anything was possible. Anything was acceptable. Our future might have looked grim to him as he faked the smile his people saw when the crown touched his head, but I knew in my heart that this little bud of life in my hand was the symbol of true new beginnings\u2014a beginning together. I would be the saviour now. I would never let anything tear us apart, ever again.</p><p>He came into my life as just a boy who fought to be my knight, and turned out, in the end, to be a king. And I would not lose him. We once promised each other forever\u2014nothing do us part\u2014not even death. And from this moment on, I would keep that promise, even if it meant I had to betray him. </p> </body></html>"]
