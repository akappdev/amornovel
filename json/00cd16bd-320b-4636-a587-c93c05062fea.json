You\u2019re so absorbed in yourself it\u2019s impossible to love anyone other than oneself, leaving you weak without realization of it. It\u2019s quite sad. You\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re missing either. You will never know real love and your life will pass you by.</p><p>But you will see.</p><p>One day you will blink and the haze will dissipate. You\u2019ll discover that what once defined you has wilted into graying hair and wrinkled skin. Frantic, you\u2019ll glance around yourself, in hopes of finding those you swore adored you, but all you will find is empty picture frames.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Six weeks after graduation and Jerrick had been dead for three of them. You\u2019d have thought it would\u2019ve been enough for us all to take a breather from our habits, but it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I bent to snort the line of coke in front of me.</p><p>\u201cBrent looks very tempting tonight, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d I asked Savannah, or Sav as I called her for short, when I lifted my head and wiped my nose.</p><p>Savannah turned her glassy eyes away from her Special K laced O.J., her head wavering from side to side. \u201cYeah,\u201d she lazily slurred out, \u201che looks hot tonight.\u201d Her glazed eyes perked up a bit but barely. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about saying hello to him.\u201d I smiled wickedly at my pseudo-best friend and she smiled deviously back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bitch,\u201d she teased, prodding my tanned leg with her perfectly manicured nail. \u201cAli will never forgive you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she will,\u201d I said, standing and smoothing out my pencil skirt.</p><p>I could\u2019ve been considered a dichotomy of dressers. I never showed much in the way of skin because, well, my father would have killed me, but that didn\u2019t stop me from choosing pieces that kept the boys\u2019 tongues wagging. For instance, everything I owned was skin tight because I had the body for it, and because it always got me what I wanted. I loved the way the boys stared. I loved the way they wanted me. It felt powerful.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Sav asked, her head heavily lolling back and forth on the back of the leather settee in her father\u2019s office.</p><p>No one was allowed in that room, party or no, but we didn\u2019t care. Sav\u2019s parents went to Italy on a whim, leaving her house as the inevitable destination for that weekend\u2019s \u201cHole,\u201d as we called them. The Hole was code for wherever we decided to \u201chole up\u201d for the weekend. My group of friends was, at the risk of sounding garish, wealthy. That\u2019s an understatement. We were filthy, as we liked to tease one another, double meaning and all. Someone\u2019s house was always open some random weekend because all our parents traveled frequently, mine especially. In fact, almost every other weekend, the party was at my home. This isn\u2019t why I ruled the roost, so to speak. It wasn\u2019t even because I was the wealthiest. My dad was only number four on that list. No, I ruled because I was the hottest.</p> <p>You see, I\u2019m one of the beautiful people. That truly sounds so odd to have to explain, but it\u2019s the truth nonetheless. I\u2019m beautiful, and it\u2019s not because I have a healthy dose of self-esteem, though I have plenty of that. It\u2019s obvious in the way I look in the mirror, yes, but even more obvious in the way everyone treats me. I rule this roost because I\u2019m the most wanted by all the guys, and all the girls want to be my friend because of it.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked again, agitated I hadn\u2019t yet answered.</p><p>This made my blood boil. \u201cStuff it, Sav,\u201d I ordered. She\u2019d forgotten who I was and I needed to remind her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said sheepishly, shrinking slightly into herself.</p><p>\u201cI know because they always do. Besides, when I\u2019m done with their boys, I give them back. They consider it their dues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d she said quietly toward the wall, \u201cthey do not consider it their dues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Brock, Sav?\u201d I huffed. \u201cGod, you are such a whiny brat. If he was willing to cheat on you so easily, he wasn\u2019t worth it. Consider it a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d she conceded but didn\u2019t sound truly convinced. \u201cYou saved me, Soph.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sav,\u201d I replied sweetly and patted her head. \u201cNow, I\u2019m off to find Brent.\u201d</p><p>I stood in front of the mirror above her dad\u2019s desk and inspected myself.</p><p>Long, silky, straight brown hair down to my elbows. I had natural blonde highlights throughout its mass. I\u2019d recently cut my bangs so that they fell straight across my forehead. I ruffled them so they lay softly over my brows. I studied them and felt my blood begin to boil. The majority of girls at Jerrick\u2019s funeral suddenly had the same cut and it royally pissed me off. God! Get a clue, nimrods. You\u2019ll never look like me! I puckered my lips and applied a little gloss over them. My lips were full and pink enough that I didn\u2019t need much color. My skin was tanned from lying by the pool too much after graduation, and I\u2019d made a mental note to keep myself indoors for a bit. Don\u2019t need wrinkles, Soph. My light gold eyes were the color of amber and were perfect, but I noticed my lashes needed a touch more mascara. I did this only to darken them up a bit, not because they weren\u2019t long enough. Like I said, I was practically flawless.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t know what hit him,\u201d I told myself in the mirror. Sav mistook this for speaking to her and I rolled my eyes when she responded.</p><p>\u201cYou play a sick game, Sophie Price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I admitted, turning her direction, a fiendish expression on my unblemished face.</p><p>I sauntered from the room. As I passed the throngs of people lined against the sides of the hall that lead from the foyer to the massive den, I received the customary catcalls and ignored them with all the flirtatious charm that was my forte. I was the queen of subtlety. I could play a boy like a concert violinist. I was a master of my craft.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you boys anything?\u201d I asked as I approached the elite group of hotties that included Ali\u2019s Brent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, baby,\u201d Graham flirted, as if I\u2019d ever give him the time of day.</p><p>\u201cYou look it,\u201d I flirted back, just stifling the urge to roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re offering so nicely, Soph,\u201d Spencer said, \u201cI believe we could all use a fresh round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d I said, curtsying lightly and smiling seductively. I purposely turned to make my way toward the bar. I did this for two reasons. One, to make them all look at my ass. Two, to make them believe I\u2019d only just thought of the next move on my playing board. I turned around quickly and caught them all staring, especially Brent. Bingo. \u201cI\u2019ll need some help carrying them all back,\u201d I pouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d They all shouted at once, clamoring in front of the other like cattle.</p><p>\u201cHow about I choose?\u201d I said. I circled the herd, running my hand along their shoulders as I passed each one. Spencer visibly shivered. Point, Soph. \u201cEeny, meeny, miny, moe,\u201d I said, stopping at Brent. I followed the line of his throat and caught a glimpse of him swallowing, hard. \u201cWould you help me, Brent?\u201d I asked nicely without any flirting.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure,\u201d he said, setting down his own glass.</p><p>I linked my arm through his as we walked to the bar. \u201cSo how are you and Ali doing?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He gazed at me, not hearing a word I\u2019d said. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Three hours later and Brent was mine. We\u2019d ended up sprawled out on the ancient Turkish rug in Sav\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom, our tongues in each other\u2019s throats. He threw me underneath him and hungrily kissed my neck but stopped suddenly.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he breathed sexily in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes, Brent?\u201d I asked, ecstatic I\u2019d gotten what I wanted.</p><p>He sat up and gazed down on me like he\u2019d never really seen me before. I smiled lasciviously in return, tonguing my left eyetooth. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said, a trembling hand combed through his hair, \u201cI am such a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, sitting up, stunned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a horrible mistake,\u201d he told me, still wedged between my legs. No need to tell you how badly that stung. \u201cI\u2019ve had too much to drink,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sophie. You being the most gorgeous girl I\u2019ve ever met\u2019s clouded my judgment, badly. I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake.\u201d</p><p>At that most fortunate of moments, we heard Ali calling out Brent\u2019s name in the hall outside the door and he tensed, his eyes going wide. I could only inwardly smile at what was to come. Before he\u2019d had a chance to react to her calling to him, she\u2019d walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cBrent?\u201d she asked him. She saw our position and the recognition I\u2019d seen in all the others before her was so obviously written all over Ali. She wasn\u2019t going to fight it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said politely, like I wasn\u2019t in a compromising position on the floor with her boyfriend. She\u2019s so pathetic, I thought. She closed the door. We heard her pounding the floor to the stairs, running toward Sav no doubt. Sav would have to pretend she had no idea.</p><p>He threw himself to his feet, abandoning me haphazardly on the carpet and immediately began chasing her. Well, that\u2019s a first, I thought to myself. Usually they went right back to business, but I suppose we hadn\u2019t gotten far enough. Yeah, that\u2019s why he left you lying here, half-undressed, chasing after his girlfriend, Soph.</p><p>I balked at my own idiocy and stood up.</p><p>I walked to Sav\u2019s parents\u2019 bathroom and leaned over her mother\u2019s side of the double sinks. I fixed my bristled hair and ran my nail along the line of my bottom lip, fixing any gloss smudges. I tucked my formfitting black-and-white V-striped silk button-up back into my pencil skirt and stared at myself.</p><p>A single tear ran down my cheek and I grimaced. Not now, I thought. I was my own worst enemy. That was my secret weakness. Rejection. Rejection of any kind, in fact. I hated it more than anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too beautiful to be rejected,\u201d I told the reflection in front of me, but the tears wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>I ran the tap and splashed a little water on my face before removing the small bag of coke I\u2019d hidden in my strapless. I fumbled with the little plastic envelope, spilling it onto the marble counter and cursed at the mess I\u2019d made. I scrambled for something to line it with, finally stumbling upon her father\u2019s medicine cabinet. I removed the blade from her father\u2019s old-fashioned razor and made my lines. I remembered her mom kept small stacks of stationery paper in her desk in the bedroom and I went straight for that, rolling the paper into a small tube.</p><p>The tears wouldn\u2019t stop and I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to snort with a snotty nose. I went to her parents\u2019 toilet and tugged at a few squares of toilet paper, blew my nose, then flushed it down. I swiped at the tears on my cheeks and bent over my lines just about the time a policeman came rushing in, catching me right before the act for the second time that night.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Put your hands on your head,\u201d I heard a man\u2019s deep voice say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I languidly stood from my unfinished lines and stared into the mirror. Sharing its reflection with me was a young, rather hot cop. Shit. I dropped the rolled-up stationery that smelled like old lady lavender potpourri and lazily put my hands over my head.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said, fingering the cuffs on his belt.</p><p>I turned around and faced him, his eyes widened at the full sight of me. He stumbled a little, a hitch in his step, as he progressed my way. He brought my right hand down slowly, then my left and swallowed just as Brent had earlier. Gotcha.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I whispered, his face mere inches from mine. Beats Antique\u2019s Dope Crunk rang loudly from downstairs. No wonder I hadn\u2019t heard them come in.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your concern,\u201d he said, but the hesitation in his voice told me he thought he\u2019d like it to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sophie,\u201d I told him as he clicked the first ring around my wrist.</p><p>He kept narrowing his eyes at me, but they would drop to my breasts then back up.</p><p>\u201cN-nice to meet you, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too...,\u201d I drug out, waiting for his name.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked me, throwing glances over his shoulder, no doubt worried if more officers would be joining us.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Cross my heart,\u201d I appraised, taking my free hand from his and crossing my heart, which just so happened to be at the crest of my cleavage. His gaze flitted down and he started breathing harder.</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d I said breathily, testing out his name. He fought a drowsy smile, apparently liking the way I said it, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cL-let me have your hand,\u201d he said.</p><p>I gave him my unconstrained hand without a fuss. He took it and restrained it with the other.</p> <p>\u201cAll tied up now, Casey,\u201d I whispered, raising my fisted hands just as he closed his eyes, almost drifting forward a bit.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said, pulling me from the counter. His eyes glanced down at my lines and he shook his head. \u201cWhat makes you do that shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it feels good,\u201d I told him, turning his direction and seductively running my tongue along my top teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even,\u201d he said, \u201cor I\u2019ll get you on propositioning an officer as well as possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I told him, shrugging my shoulders. \u201cIt might have been nice,\u201d I leaned forward and sang in his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. I could see the surprise on his face at his unexpected and candid response. I decided to run with it.</p><p>\u201cI bet if you handcuffed me to the closet bar just beyond those doors, I\u2019d be quiet as a mouse until you came back for me,\u201d I said, letting the double meaning sink in.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said. The breath he\u2019d been holding whistled from his nose.</p> <p>\u201cHow old are you, Casey?\u201d I asked, leaning into him.</p><p>\u201cTwen-twenty-two,\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201cHuh, I just happen to be into twenty-two-year-olds. They\u2019re currently my thing,\u201d I lied.</p><p>His eyes came right to mine and held there.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, skeptical, yet inadvertently leaned into me. The grim line that had held his face before turned into a slight grin. Seal the deal, Sophie.</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm,\u201d I said. I pushed farther into his chest, my breasts mashed against his armor plate.</p><p>I tentatively kissed the pulse at his neck, knowing full well that if he really wanted to, he could definitely get me on propositioning.</p><p>I just couldn\u2019t go to jail. Not again. I\u2019d already been once for possession when Jerrick died, and the judge told me if I showed back up in his courtroom, I\u2019d be toast. This was worth the risk.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I threaded my fingers through the belt loop at his waist and brought him closer to me. He fiercely took my face in his and kissed me like he was dying. What an amateur, I thought. Thank God I got a dumb one. His hands grappled all over my face as he had no grace whatsoever. If the guy wasn\u2019t so sexy, I don\u2019t think I could have put up the charade as long as I did.</p><p>\u201cOfficer Fratelli!\u201d we heard come from downstairs and he broke the kiss. \u201cFratelli!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m-I\u2019m up here,\u201d Casey said, flustered. He adjusted himself and wiped his mouth.</p><p>\u201cUncuff me,\u201d I said, almost panicked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can, Casey. Do it and I\u2019ll repay you exponentially.\u201d</p><p>He groaned but looked at me apologetically. \u201cWhen you get out, come find me,\u201d he said quietly as the other officer entered the room.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the upstairs is secure,\u201d Casey said as if he hadn\u2019t just kissed my face off. \u201cShe was the only straggler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d the older officer said. I thought he was going to leave but instead came through and examined the bathroom around us. \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d he asked Casey.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Casey asked.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d the older man said, gesturing to the lines of coke.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, she was attempting a line when I found her,\u201d Casey told his superior.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bag this up,\u201d the man said and waved Casey on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Casey said when we were out of the room. \u201cI had to tell him. He\u2019d have known I was lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Casey,\u201d I said with saccharine ooze. I kissed his mouth, then bit his lip playfully. \u201cIt would have been the best ride of your life,\u201d I whispered. His eyes blew wide.</p><p>\u201cWait, what? We can still see each other,\u201d Casey desperately plied.</p><p>\u201cSure we can,\u201d I lied again.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell him about the drugs,\u201d he said again, his voice quivering. \u201cI had only planned on getting you on the party. That would have only been a ticket, a misdemeanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweets,\u201d I told him, \u201cbut you still messed up.\u201d</p><p>Casey led me down the winding staircase and I felt as if time was standing still. All my friends, cuffed themselves, looked up at me as I descended over them. I smiled down at them bewitchingly and they almost cowered in my presence. I\u2019d been the one who brought the coke, and my smile let them know that if they brought me down, I wouldn\u2019t be going down with the ship on my own. If they squealed like the pigs they were, I would make their lives miserable. There\u2019s a fine line between friend and foe in my world.</p><p>Casey placed me into the back of a squad car when we reached the winding drive and buckled me in.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said softly against his ear near my mouth, \u201cwhat exactly am I being charged with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarge will probably get you on drugs, but if it\u2019s your first offense, you should be able to get off lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what?\u201d he asked, glancing over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMy first offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. If it\u2019s not, there\u2019s nothing I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, there\u2019s nothing I can do for you then either,\u201d I said coldly, the heat in my seduction blasted cold with a bucket of ice water at the flip of a switch. Casey\u2019s mouth grew wide and he could see that he\u2019d been had. I turned my face away from his, done with my pawn.</p><p>Casey got into the front seat and I could see through the rearview that his face was painted red with humiliation and obvious disappointment in himself that he fell for my game. He stuck the key in the ignition and drove me to the station.</p><p>I was booked, processed and searched. I scoffed at the women who had to search me before placing me in my cell. Stripping naked for anyone of the female persuasion wasn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d had planned for the evening. They looked down on me, knowing my charges, like they were somehow better than me.</p><p>\u201cMy lingerie probably costs more than your entire wardrobe,\u201d I spit out at the short, stocky one who eyed me with disdain.</p><p>She could only shake her head at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll go nicely with your new wardrobe addition,\u201d the dark-haired one said, handing me a bright orange jumpsuit.</p><p>This made both the women laugh. I slipped the disgusting jumpsuit on and they filed me away into a cell.</p><p>I shivered in my cell, coming down from my high. I was used to this part though. I only did coke on the weekends. Unlike most others I knew, I had enough self-control to only do it at the Holes. It was just enough to drown out whatever crappy week I\u2019d had from being ignored by my mother and father.</p><p>My parents were strangely the only I knew of who married and stayed that way. Of course, my mother was fifteen years younger than my father, so I\u2019m sure that helped and she stayed in incredible shape. If you pitched a pic of her then and now, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference, and she\u2019d gifted those incredible genes to yours truly. That was about the only thing my mother ever bothered to give me. My mother and father were so absorbed in themselves I don\u2019t think they remembered me some days. I was born for one reason and one reason only. It was expected of my parents to give the impression of a family.</p><p>My mom was a \u201chousewife,\u201d and I use that term loosely. My father was the founder and CEO of an electronics conglomerate, namely computers and software. His company was based in Silicon Valley, but when he married my gold-digging mother, she insisted on L.A., so he jetted the company plane there when he needed to. It was safe to say that one, if not two or three, of my father\u2019s products were in every single home in America. I\u2019d had a five-thousand-dollar monthly allowance if I\u2019d kept my grades up during prep school, and that\u2019s about as much acknowledgment I got from my parents.</p><p>I\u2019d just graduated, which meant I had four years to earn a degree of some kind then move out. I would retain a monthly allowance of twenty thousand a month, but I had to earn my degree first. That was my father in a nutshell.</p><p>\u201cKeep appearances, Sophie Price, and I\u2019ll reward you handsomely,\u201d my father said to me starting at fifteen.</p><p>And it was a running mantra in my home once a week, usually before a dinner I was forced to attend when he was entertaining some competitor he was looking to buy out or possibly a political official he was trying to grease up. I would dress modestly, never speak unless spoken to. Timidity was the farce. If I looked sweet and acquiescent, my father gave the impression he knew how to run a home as well as a multinational, multibillion-dollar business. If I did this, I would get a nice little thousand-dollar bonus. I was an employee, not a child.</p><p>\u201cSophie Price,\u201d someone yelled outside the big steel door that was my cell. I could just make out the face of a young cop in the small window. The door came sliding open with a deafening thud. \u201cYou\u2019ve made bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d I huffed out.</p><p>When I was released, I stood at a counter and waited for them to return the belongings I had walked in with.</p><p>\u201cOne pair of shoes, one skirt, one set of hose, one set of...,\u201d the guy began but eyed the garment with confusion.</p><p>\u201cGarters,\u201d I spit out. \u201cThey\u2019re garters. God, just give them to me,\u201d I said, snatching them out of his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He carelessly pushed the rest of my belongings in a pile over to me and I almost screamed at him that he was handling a ten-thousand-dollar outfit like it was from Wal-Mart.</p><p>\u201cYou can change in there,\u201d he said, pointing at an infinitesimal door.</p><p>The bathroom was small and I had to balance my belongings on a disgusting sink.</p><p>\u201cWell, these are going in the incinerator,\u201d I said absently.</p> <p>I got dressed sans hose, returned my ridiculous jumpsuit and entered the lobby. Repulsive, dirty men sat waiting for whatever jailed fool they bothered to bail. They eyed me with bawdy stares and I could only glare back, too tired to give them a piece of my mind.</p><p>Near the glass entry doors, the sun was just cresting the horizon and I made out the silhouette of the only person I would have expected to come to my rescue.</p><p>Standing more than six feet tall, so thin his bones protruded from his face, but with stylish, somewhat long hair, reminiscent of the nineteen-thirties, clad in a fitted Italian suit, stood Pembrook.</p><p>\u201cHello, Pembrook,\u201d I greeted him with acid. \u201cI see my father was too busy to come himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so lovely to see you too, Sophie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop with the condescension,\u201d I sneered.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019m not. It is the highlight of my week bailing you from this godforsaken pit of bacteria.\u201d He eyed me up and down with regret. \u201cI suppose I needed to get the interior of my car cleaned anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so clever, Pembrook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said simply. \u201cTo comment on your earlier observation, your father was too busy to get you. He does want you to know that he is severely disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see. Well, I shall try harder next time not to get caught.\u201d</p><p>Pembrook stopped and gritted his teeth before opening the passenger door for me. \u201cYou, young lady, are sorely unaware of the gravity of this charge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brilliant attorney, Pembrook, with millions at your disposal,\u201d I said, settling into his Mercedes.</p><p>He walked around the front of the car and sat in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he said softly, before turning the ignition. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough money in the world that can help you if Judge Reinhold is presiding over your case again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive, Pembrook,\u201d I demanded, ignoring his warning. He\u2019ll get me off, I thought.</p><p>My house, or I should say, my father\u2019s house, was built a year before I was born, but it had since been newly renovated on the outside as well as the inside so although I may have grown up in the home, it barely resembled anything like it did when I had been small.</p><p>It was grotesquely large, sitting on three acres in Beverly Hills, California. It was French Chateau inspired and more than twenty-eight-thousand square feet. I was in the left wing, my parents were in the right. I could go days without seeing them, the only correspondence was out of necessity, usually to inform me that I was required to make a dinner appearance, and that was usually by note delivered by one of the staff. I had a nanny until fourteen, when I fired her for attempting to discipline me. My parents didn\u2019t realize for months and decided I was capable of caring for myself after and never bothered to replace the position.</p><p>Freedom is just that. Absolutely no restrictions. I abandoned myself to every whim I felt. Every want I fulfilled and every desire was quenched. I wanted for nothing.</p><p>Except attention.</p> <p>And I got that, I\u2019ll admit, not in the healthiest of ways. I won\u2019t lie to you, it felt gratifying...in a sense. I was rather unrestrained with my time and body. I wasn\u2019t different from most girls I knew. Well, except the fact I was exponentially better looking, but why beat a dead horse? The only difference between them and myself was I kept them wanting more. I used many, many, many boys and tossed them aside, discarding them, ironically, like many of them did to so many other girls before me.</p><p>This is what kept them baited. I gave them but a glimpse of my taste and they tasted absinthe. They were hooked by la f\u00e9e verte as I was so often called. I was \u201cthe green fairy.\u201d I flitted into your life, showed you ecstasy, and left you dependent. I did this for fun, for the hell of it, for attention. I wanted to be wanted, and my word, did they want me. Did they ever.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Pembrook wound through the cobblestone drive of the palatial estate.</p><p>\u201cDrop me off at the service entrance,\u201d I told him. I wanted to avoid running into my father if possible.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI have to see your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said.</p><p>Pembrook had his own parking space in the last of the twenty ports off the carriage house. That\u2019s how often he visited our home. As much as it pains me to say it, Pembrook was like an uncle to me. Whenever I filled out paperwork for visiting physicians, as it was considered beneath us to visit an office, under the tab \u201cwho shall we contact in case of an emergency,\u201d I always, always, always put Pembrook.</p><p>He was the only reliable one. He was my father\u2019s attorney and yet the only adult in my life that had any interest in what I did with that life. He was Pembrook.</p><p>Pembrook was English, but had lived in America for close to thirty years. He specialized in international law as well as got me out of my minor legal tiffs. Standing freakishly tall at six-foot three, he was lean, bordering anorexic-looking. If I were to guess, more than likely hadn\u2019t had more than maybe an ounce of fat on his entire body at any given moment of his life. His cheeks were a bit sunken and he reminded me so often of one of the rare, gaunt and goth creatures who attended my prep school, but his look was natural. I suppose that\u2019s what leant him additional intimidation factor as an attorney. I believe he played it up when possible. I also believe he was a virgin. For one reason: He lived and breathed his job. For another, I couldn\u2019t imagine a single woman taking pity on the poor man. Then again, he was rich, who was I to say?</p><p>\u201cPembrook, who do you visit when you return to London?\u201d I asked, suddenly struck with the interest to know what went on there when he left here.</p><p>He eyed me strangely. \u201cYou are odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPembrook, answer me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes at me. \u201cI visit my sister and her family.\u201d</p><p>I checked my shocked expression as best I could. \u201cYou have a sister?\u201d I asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhy is this so hard to imagine, you daft girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure, Pemmy. I cannot conjure a female version of you, I suppose? What does she look like? Another Bram Stoker character inspiration?\u201d</p><p>He sarcastically looked at me with pity. \u201cWhat an astute observation coming from someone who couldn\u2019t hear the sirens blaring down the street of her latest conquest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint, Pemmy. Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are sorely in need of guidance,\u201d he said more to himself than to me.</p><p>\u201cI am fine,\u201d I spit back, folding my arms across my chest as the gravel crunched beneath our shoe-clad feet.</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d he added sarcastically.</p><p>We approached the service entrance nearest the carriage house and Pembrook opened the door for me.</p><p>Inside were members of the staff. Gerald, our head chef, stood at one of the giant Viking ranges experimenting with sauces no doubt, but the remaining crew sat strewn about the large industrial kitchen. The kitchen, aside from our everyday, more personal one, was where the food was prepared for more formal dinners and I knew then just why my father was truly disappointed in me.</p><p>I looked around me wondering why there wasn\u2019t more fire beneath their asses. The staff sat reading, listening to music or just staring into space. I suppose it was too early to do prep work. They paid no immediate attention to me either as I was often seen entering my father\u2019s abode at that hour. I used the service entrance to access my wing of the house in order to avoid my parents. They wouldn\u2019t say anything to my father and neither would I. It was an unspoken agreement we all had. They looked up briefly for confirmation, but when their gazes swung to the figure behind me, they began scrambling around. Pembrook was certainly not expected and I almost burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh, cease this incessant buzzing,\u201d Pembrook told the seemingly aimless help, his hands raised above his head, giving him a luring feel. I waited for fangs but none came. \u201cCalm yourselves, fools. I am not your boss, and I couldn\u2019t care less if you st with a knife in your hand or a magazine.\u201d But the staff continued on as if they\u2019d not heard a word. \u201cVery well,\u201d he sighed, gesturing for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cCarry on, Gerald,\u201d I said, saluting the head chef. He smiled and waved me on.</p><p>Gerald was the only member of our staff I could stand and that was more than likely because he was mute.</p><p>When we reached the grotesquely large foyer, I made a move for the winding stairs.</p><p>\u201cAh, ah, Sophie,\u201d Pembrook said and I cringed into myself. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said I had to accompany you to see my father.\u201d</p><p>This was highly unusual and made my heart beat wildly in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI never said you didn\u2019t. Come,\u201d Pembrook said as he made his way toward my father\u2019s office several doors into the first floor west wing. He expected me to follow, so I did.</p><p>Knock. Knock. Pembrook\u2019s bony fingers rapped on the door of my father\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I heard my father say.</p><p>When I walked in, my father was nose deep into a stack of paperwork on his desk as well as on the phone.</p><p>\u201cNo! How many times have I told you?! That is unacceptable, Stephen! I refuse, refuse to acknowledge their desperate attempt to hold the upper hand. Tell them I said the offer stands until midnight tonight and when it expires, the offer will not present itself again.\u201d His crony must have been acquiescing and my father nodded curtly once as if the man could see him and promptly hung up.</p><p>He looked upon me and I very nearly vomited onto the carpet at my feet. I was scared of very few things but of those few things, my father stood atop the list.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, drinking in my appearance. \u201cI see you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>I nodded once succinctly. I was standing in the doorway and Pemmy prodded me forward. I glanced behind me briefly to scowl before fixing my expression ahead. Pembrook was on the verge of laughing. Sod off! I wanted to yell, to borrow a phrase from his people\u2019s vernacular, but I kept my mouth shut instead not wanting to wake the dragon before me any more than he was already awake.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said, settling into his creaky, leather office chair. He began to stuff his pipe. \u201cA second drug offense, Sophie Price. I\u2019m not exactly sure how I plan to keep this out of the media this time. PR has their work cut out for them, it seems. I can barely stand to look at you, so this will be brief. You are required to attend a formal dinner tonight. I expect you to get some sleep, remove those hideous bags from underneath your eyes, dress properly and entertain the son of Calico\u2019s CEO. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I squeaked out.</p><p>\u201cDo you? By entertain, I mean show the boy the house, make conversation. I do not mean offer him anything illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never\u2014\u201d I began, but my father cut me short. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d He eyed me harshly.</p><p>I sank into myself and inadvertently backed into Pemmy. \u201cUgh!\u201d I heard him say before righting me and setting me beside him. He rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDinner is at seven, Sophie,\u201d my father continued, ignoring Pembrook and ,me.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said, parroting my earlier acknowledgement.</p> <p>I turned and barely contained myself from fleeing.</p><p>\u201cOh! And one more thing,\u201d my father said, making me turn to face him. \u201cIf you\u2019re caught again, I\u2019ll disinherit you. Close the door.\u201d</p><p>I closed the door, my chest pumping in air at an alarming rate and nearly sprinted for my wing of the house. I knew enough about my father to know he was in earnest. I also wasn\u2019t a stupid girl. I knew there were things I needed more than coke, and his money was one of them.</p><p>When I reached my room a few minutes later, I opened the fifteen-foot double doors and closed them behind me. I started to strip, pulling off my garments and tossing them at the foot of my bed. I needed a shower. I was on the verge of one of my breakdowns and needed a place to hide away.</p><p>But first things first.</p> <p>I went to the wall nearest my bedroom door and pressed the intercom, still undressing.</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Sophie?\u201d A staticky voice came on. It was Matilda, the house coordinator.</p><p>\u201cYes, \u2019Tilda.\u201d I glanced at my nightstand clock. Eight a.m. \u201cCan you ring Katy at home and let her know I\u2019ll need her services at four this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Katy was lovely. Tall and slender, blonde hair and only a few years older than I. She was the beautician I used when I had one of my father\u2019s soirees to attend. Katy never came alone though. She always brought Peter, her masseuse, and Gillian, her makeup artist.</p><p>\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d And with that, I headed toward my bathroom, securing the door behind me.</p> <p>The bathroom was almost as large as my bedroom. On the far back wall was an estate-sized fireplace. It\u2019s French-inspired marble mantel reached halfway up the wall. Situated in the center was the focal piece, the oversized, burnished cast-iron tub and swathed in polished stainless steel for a mirrored effect. The entire floor was bathed in three-inch octagonal tiles of Carrara marble. The Carrara marble continued on the walls in subway tile. Oval undermount sinks were fitted into the Carrara marble tops with custom washstands. The room was almost a duplicate of one I\u2019d seen when I was thirteen on a trip to Paris.</p><p>I stepped into the tiled shower and started the water. Piping hot. I closed the glass door and decided it was safe. I let go of all the unhappiness that took unending residence in my heart and soul and stomach. I sobbed into my hands and let the water wash away the salt. My heart was in a perpetual state of sadness and the only relief I could find were in those cathartic cries. I lived a fragile existence. I knew it even then but feigning I didn\u2019t was easier than embracing something so altogether daunting. If I faced what I\u2019d truly created for myself, a life of debauchery and seedy fulfillment, I knew I couldn\u2019t have lived another day and self-preservation was very much still alive in me. I loved myself too much to say goodbye. So, I would go on living just as I had been because it was the only life I knew.</p><p>I bawled for at least half an hour before washing and conditioning my hair and shaving my legs and even then the tears continued, but I had a job to do that night and damn if I was going to have bags underneath my eyes. My dad would faint, or the male equivalent, anyway. I needed sleep.</p><p>Life will continue on. Everyone will continue their worship of you. Just keep up appearances. Just keep up.</p><p>When I was done and sufficiently under control of my emotions, I shut off the water and stepped onto the heated marble beneath my feet. Reaching for my robe, I wrapped it around my body and grabbed a towel for my hair. I sat at the edge of my vanity in my room and moisturized my entire body with the five-hundred-dollar-an-ounce moisturizer my mother insisted I used.</p><p>By then, sleepiness was attempting to claim me. I was too tired to dress in pajamas so I just slipped under the covers donning my robe and the towel still wrapped around my head. Sleep came easily. It always did. It was a true safe haven from the hell I\u2019d created for myself.</p><p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p><p>I woke startled to the sound of rapping at my door.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Price!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>The doors bellowed open and in poured Katy and her entourage.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d forgotten you were coming,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Nice to see you, too,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment,\u201d I told them.</p><p>I relieved myself and brushed my teeth then met them in my room. Peter had already set up his portable massage chair, modified so Katy could do my nails while he did his thing. I almost sat before realizing I\u2019d yet to put undergarments on. I ran to my dressing room and slipped them on before joining them again.</p><p>I sat down and Peter started in with the massage. \u201cAny place in particular I need to focus on today, Miss Price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Peter. Just the standard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, miss.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d already closed my eyes when I felt Katy at my feet, removing my polish. \u201cAnd what are you wearing this evening, Miss Price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unsure. Let\u2019s just do a French. That\u2019s all encompassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Very well, Miss Price. Of course, Miss Price. I very nearly yelled at them to quiet the ridiculous platitudes but checked myself. It\u2019d be good practice for this evening.</p><p>When my nails were dry, they sat me in the leather chair stool in my bathroom in front of the mirror. I studied myself, ensuring my skin was still flawless, my hair still long and beautiful, my eyes still shining. I would never have admitted this to anyone, but I panicked if I hadn\u2019t seen a mirror in a few hours, affirming I still had the only thing that made me so adored.</p><p>Katy and Gillian worked their magic and within two hours I was plucked, polished, buffed and readied to entertain the only son of Calico, a company I knew nothing about. Shit.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d I called out to my room while Katy finished up my hair.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring my laptop in here, will you?\u201d</p><p>I heard shuffling in my bedroom and then Peter entered the bathroom with my computer. I pried open the monitor and put in my password. My father would kill me if I wasn\u2019t schooled on the boy\u2019s father\u2019s company. I Googled Calico.</p><p>Ah, plastics. And a durable product at that. In fact, their plastics were damn near indestructible. It made sense my father wanted in. Impervious electronic products would make him unstoppable. Okay, let\u2019s see. Founded by Henry Rokul, married to Harriet Rokul. One child by Harriet named Devon. Devon Rokul is a twenty-year-old Harvard student studying, what else, business. I further Googled Devon Rokul\u2019s picture and stumbled upon his social media. I familiarized myself with Devon\u2019s Twitter updates and almost gagged at how mundane they seemed to be.</p><p>Took the dog for a walk today.</p><p>Studying for an exam.</p><p>Meeting Sam for a film.</p><p>Blech! Boring! But he wasn\u2019t a bad-looking boy, and that made me not dread the evening as badly. I\u2019d also discovered he was tall and would be able to wear heels, thank God, unlike my last charade where the guests were terminally short. I was forced to wear flats that night.</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d Katy said, obviously proud of herself.</p><p>When I looked up, I saw that I looked as I always did. Impeccable.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Katy,\u201d I said drily. \u201cSettle with Matilda, I\u2019ll ensure she includes a generous tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course, Miss Price. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I stood, not bothering to see them out, and entered my dressing room. My closet was compartmentalized according to color and event. If I didn\u2019t do that, I\u2019d never find anything. The thousand-square-foot room was filled with clothing from floor to ceiling save for a small step to the massive wall mirror. My shoes were housed below the large island in the center and the counter held my jewelry and hats.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see here,\u201d I told no one. I made for the not-too-formal section of my wardrobe and chose a couture Chanel gown. Black and white. Gasp. Shocking, right?</p><p>I dressed and was downstairs in half an hour, awaiting the guests in the library where my father brought all his guests before dinner.</p><p>My mother walked in five minutes later. \u201cSophie,\u201d she said, barely acknowledging me. She leaned over the mirror beside the door and examined her makeup.</p><p>\u201cHello, love,\u201d my father laid on thickly for my mother when he entered the room. He kissed her with such fervid mania, I had to clear my throat to alert my presence. Disgusting. The lust poured off them. \u201cSophie,\u201d my dad spit out, still looking at my mother.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d I said under my breath, but he didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Finally, the doorbell rang and I heard the clamor of feet in the marbled foyer. Our Steward, Leith, lead the Rokul family into the library. \u201cThe Rokul family,\u201d Leith formally announced before swiftly exiting.</p><p>\u201cHenry! Harriet! Devon!\u201d My dad said jovially, hugging each like he wasn\u2019t the giant prick we all knew he really was. \u201cThis is my lovely wife, Sarah, and my daughter, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I plastered the most genuine smile I possibly could and made my way their direction, taking each hand after my mother did.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely family you have, Robert,\u201d Henry complimented.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d he told Henry, grabbing us each by the waist.</p><p>I absently recognized that that was the first physical contact I\u2019d had with my father in more than six months.</p><p>Harriet and my mother sat together on the tufted fainting couch and the men, except for Devon, observed the grounds from the window. This left poor Devon shifting near the door.</p><p>\u201cSo, I hear you attend Harvard?\u201d I approached and asked him.</p><p>He seemed to soften at my question. \u201cYes, I study business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d I asked, not realizing how rude that was until it was too late.</p><p>A soft smile reached his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that was incredibly boorish of me.\u201d I needed to patch it up before my father found out. \u201cI meant that it would only make sense you\u2019d study business seeing who your father is. An unerring sense of business must be inherited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she recovers flawlessly,\u201d he teased, making me smile genuinely.</p><p>\u201cDinner is served,\u201d Leith said, interrupting the room.</p><p>Devon offered his arm and I took it. My dad winked at me in approval and I wanted to gag. Dinner was served in the more intimate dining room, as there were only six of us. Devon pulled a chair out for me at the end of the table then sat next to me, two full seats separating us from our parents.</p><p>\u201cThank you for this,\u201d I secreted in his ear.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he flirted.</p><p>Devon was a complete gentleman throughout dinner and I found myself unbelievably attracted to him. I mean, of course, all the boys in my circle were utter gentlemen. It was a product of their breeding, but Devon seemed genuinely interested in being courteous just for the sake of being courteous.</p><p>When dinner was over, coffee and cake were to be served in the library and I followed my parents out of the dining room, but Devon pulled me away, out of range. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur parents are a drag.

Is it okay if I show him?\u201d I asked for show more than anything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Do you, Rokul?\u201d my father asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Have fun you two,\u201d Henry added.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me, Devon,\u201d I smiled sweetly, taking his arm once more.</p><p>As much as I was attracted to Devon, I knew my father would kill me if I was anything but what he thought a lady should be and I had already made plans to keep my cool with him. Not to mention I wasn\u2019t exactly in the mood after the day I\u2019d had.</p><p>It was also kind of nice for a guy to pay attention to me because he was just polite, no ulterior motive. I wasn\u2019t used to it.</p><p>The gardens were a garish feature of our home and had been since I was small, but my mother loved them with their winding boxwood geometric designs, so they stayed and were impeccably kept up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful here,\u201d Devon chimed in after a quiet turn around the main garden.</p> <p>\u201cMmm, yes,\u201d I agreed politely.</p><p>\u201cNot as beautiful as you though.\u201d</p><p>Gag.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him, trying my damnedest not to burst into tears laughing.</p><p>We rounded the boxwoods and entered the garden maze.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should return to the house...\u201d I started before Devon shoved me into the prickly bush maze behind me.</p> <p>\u201cOr we could just stay here,\u201d he roughly bit out, kissing me so harshly I wasn\u2019t able to speak.</p><p>I shoved him off me. \u201cWhat the hell, Devon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. You know you want to,\u201d he continued, handling me as if I hadn\u2019t just thrown him off.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I said, shoving him back again, but he only came back twofold.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sophie. I know you\u2019re reputation, and you could do a lot worse than me.\u201d</p><p>My chin dropped to my chest. The gall. I purposely fixed my gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but we can\u2019t do it here so close to the maze entrance, someone might hear.\u201d</p><p>He backed off me for a moment. \u201cLead the way, Miss Price.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d I flirted over my shoulder. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>I led him through the winding maze and purposely toward a dead end but near a bench so I could enjoy the show. \u201cNo one will find us here,\u201d I told him. I grabbed the front of his jacket and settled him in front of me as I sat myself on the bench, reclining on one arm. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndress, of course,\u201d I playfully teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a kinky bitch.\u201d</p><p>What a lovely compliment. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>I watched Devon shed each expensive layer of clothing until there was nothing left but the moonlight on his skin. He smiled devilishly at me. I won\u2019t go into how ironic his name suddenly became to me.</p><p>\u201cHere I am,\u201d he said, spreading his arms wide.</p><p>I stood slowly and walked seductively his direction. I bent slightly to retrieve his tie from the pile and sauntered around him. I placed the tie around his eyes and began to tie a knot.</p><p>\u201cWait, what are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust a little game I like to play,\u201d I sang into his ear before kissing his neck. This visibly relaxed him. \u201cNow, I want you to count to ten then come find me,\u201d I hurriedly said while gathering all his belongings down to his shoes.</p><p>\u201cWait, I don\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think. Feel,\u201d I teased.</p><p>He grabbed for me blindly and I sidestepped him, making a beeline for the exit of the maze I\u2019d used to visit every day as a little girl. It\u2019s where I used to hide from my nannies. What a fool. I made my way from the maze and finally let myself smile genuinely for the first time that night. I threw his clothing in the fountain in the center of the boxwoods and turned around when I heard Devon call out my name. He was quicker finding his way out than I\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d he grated as I tossed in the last shoe.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d</p><p>I climbed my way up the gravel walk and into the house not bothering to look behind me. I continued up to my room determined not to think of the consequences of what I\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cNobody messes with Sophie Price,\u201d I said out loud. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>My father burst into my room without knocking. I attempted to hide my shock at seeing him on my side of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened tonight?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>My mother came into the room and silently stood beside my father.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, leaning over my vanity, removing my makeup.</p><p>My father met me at my chair and swung me harshly by the arm away from my task.</p><p>\u201cI have put up with a lot from you, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, surprised at my own words. \u201cThe last time I checked neither you nor my mother bothered to endure anything to do with me unless absolutely necessary or if it was a publicity risk. I was raised by strangers. You have not put up with anything from me save for the occasional call to your attorney. So you can spare me the lecture. You missed the opportunity to be my father a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He slapped me across the face and I stumbled back into my vanity chair, stunned silent. My hand went to my cheek and held there.</p><p>\u201cYou spoiled, selfish little whore,\u201d he told me through gritted teeth. \u201cI pay for your life and all I\u2019ve asked in return were a very few things. Stay out of the limelight and support the image we are a healthy family in company. But apparently even that was too much to ask. You\u2019ve done irreparable damage this time, Sophie, and there\u2019s only one thing I can think to do with you.\u201d</p><p>He whipped his cell from his jacket\u2019s inside pocket, dialed and held the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cPembrook? Sorry to wake you. Yes, as we\u2019ve discussed,\u201d he said and hung up.</p><p>My parents left my room abruptly and shut the door behind them. My hand trembled from my cheek and fell into my lap. I tried not to think what the subject of conversation had been, tried not to take my dad\u2019s accusation that I was a whore to heart, regardless how true it was, tried not to think too much into the fact that my mother let him accuse me without so much as a peep from his side.</p><p>I stood and slinked out of my Chanel, letting the garment fall into a heap at my feet. I slept in my underwear and bra, uncaring of anything around me. It\u2019s easier to pretend. So much easier.</p><p>In the morning, I showered and forewent breakfast, something I did often as I rarely ate. A girl has to keep her figure. I\u2019d planned on visiting Sav, to get away from my tension-filled home, but when I approached the carriage house, my SLS was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I asked no one. I searched the entire garage, but it was nowhere. Ah, I see. He thinks to punish me.</p><p>I took out my cell and rang Sav, but it went straight to voicemail.</p><p>\u201cFine, you don\u2019t feel like answering, you piggish trout?\u201d</p><p>I dialed Spencer and he picked up the first ring.</p><p>\u201cLa f\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing right now, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you out, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read my mind,\u201d I flirted back. \u201cPick me up at my place in, say, an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and went straight to my room to pack a bag. I wouldn\u2019t need much. I planned on spending most of my time warm in Spencer\u2019s bed.</p><p>Spencer was right on time just as I expected as no one kept me waiting, ever. On my way out the door, Sav rang me.</p><p>\u201cSav,\u201d I spit out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sophie. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it, Sav. I\u2019ve no need of you. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>I hung up.</p><p>Spencer leaned casually against the passenger side door and looked incredible. Just under six foot. Spencer\u2019s wardrobe spoke trust fund but his face screamed of how handsomely rugged he was, not at all babied-looking and I appreciated that about him. His face would be screaming something else within the hour if I had anything to do with it.</p><p>I\u2019d just hit the last of the steps when he lifted his finely sculpted body and sauntered my direction.</p><p>\u201cHello, beautiful,\u201d he whispered into my ear when I reached him. He yanked me by the waist toward him and lightly kissed my ear. \u201cI was wondering when it would be my turn.\u201d</p><p>My stomach clenched at the memory of my father\u2019s words, but I stuffed them back down.</p><p>\u201cSeems you were a fine wine, Spence. You only needed aging.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my bag and opened the door for me. I settled inside, wrapping my seat belt around myself just as Spencer joined me after placing my bag in the trunk.</p><p>\u201cI have to crash for a few days,\u201d I told him, examining myself in the vanity mirror.</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d he said, smiling at me.</p><p>His teeth were white and perfectly straight. He was equally as flawless as I was.</p><p>He started the engine and it purred like a kitten, but I\u2019d heard Aston Martins did that.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, after Sav\u2019s party\u2014,\u201d I said, but there was no need to finish.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, I might have a few things in mind to pass the time,\u201d he flirted. \u201cI was going to meet Brent for lunch, but I can reschedule if you don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p><p>I definitely didn\u2019t feel like it. Anyone else and I would have agreed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Spencer. We\u2019ll be too busy to lunch with Brent,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Spencer\u2019s home was modern in architecture but equally palatial to my parents\u2019. The entire home seemed to consist of nothing but windows and never-ending levels. I almost felt sorry for his staff, almost.</p><p>We parked in his space and he killed the engine. He leaned over and placed his hand high on my thigh. A rush trilled through me at how hot his hand was. \u201cGood news. My parents left this morning for Africa on holiday.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHow clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>He got out of the car and came over to my side, opening the door for me. He kissed me suddenly and my stomach dropped in hesitation for a moment like it always does but as always, I worked through it and put up my barrier. The same barrier that allowed me to what I did with all the boys.</p><p>He broke the kiss and grabbed my hand then retrieved my bag. \u201cWho goes to Africa anymore?\u201d I asked him as we ascended the steep and sharply staired walkway.</p><p>\u201cMy parents?\u201d</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>\u201cI gave the staff the day off today,\u201d he mentioned absently when we reached the top, dropping my hand and bag to fish his keys from his pocket.</p><p>When the door opened he threw my bag over the threshold. He kissed me on the doorstep and we went toppling toward the white plastered exterior of his doorway. We hit the wall hard and my head reverberated slightly from the force. Ow. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured, but continued to kiss me. I worked through the pain and kissed him fiercely in return.</p><p>He wrapped one big arm around my waist and lifted me from my feet, continually kissing me. He walked us into the foyer and slammed the door shut with his foot. He began unbuttoning my shirt and tugging it out of my skirt, never breaking contact. He tossed it behind me. My arms felt heavy and my heart felt a mess. It\u2019s not working! Why isn\u2019t this working? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I doubled my efforts and he took this as invitation to remove my skirt, undoing my side zipper slowly. \u201cOh, God, Sophie,\u201d he exclaimed, making me want to vomit. \u201cYou taste incredible.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him and the feeling and kissed him harder. My skirt fell to my ankles and I stepped from it as we made our way to his parents\u2019 sofa. He stopped suddenly and held me at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he hissed, sucking in a breath. His gaze raked my body and stifled a shudder. I stood in front of him, in full lingerie with garters and ankle-strapped heels. He approached me deliberately, his hands running through my hair, then down my shoulders and back before palming my ass. \u201cYou\u2019re more beautiful than I could\u2019ve imagined, Price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, wishing I could just run.</p> <p>Work through it, Sophie. You\u2019re just a little off your game.</p><p>He kissed languidly up my neck to my chin and across my jaw line. \u201cYou smell like,\u201d he inhaled, \u201ccherry bark and almonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my shampoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d he told me.</p><p>He laid me on the leather sofa nearest the fireplace and the morning sun was streaming in at seemingly impossible angles. It was beautiful. Too beautiful. I felt ill at all it was revealing to me. \u201cSo much light,\u201d I whispered, not realizing I\u2019d said it out loud.</p> <p>\u201cWe can move to my bedroom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s darker in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I said, needing to remove myself from exposure. I felt desperate.</p><p>He picked me up, tucking one arm under my knees and the other around my back. He brought me back to his room and laid me on his dark sheets. The room had shutters and dark curtains that kept out every inch of light.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMuch,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p> <p>He crawled over me and kissed me feverishly, his hands roaming my body. He lay on top of me and cupped his hand around my knee, bringing it around his waist.</p><p>That was when I broke. I don\u2019t know why I did it, what I was thinking, why my usually stalwart barrier was so weak, but silent tears began to cascade down my face and Spencer pulled away.</p><p>\u201cSophie? Are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I insisted, swiping at my face in the dark, hoping he couldn\u2019t see me. How humiliating.</p><p>I\u2019d never cried in front of anyone. Ever.</p><p>\u201cOh, Soph,\u201d he soothed. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said, pushing at his shoulders to flee.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, pulling me back to his embrace. \u201cStay with me for a second.\u201d He laid back and tucked me into his side, smoothing my hair behind my ear. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this, Soph.\u201d I waited for it, but he didn\u2019t retract his words. Instead, he continued. \u201cYou forget I\u2019ve known you since we were small.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the image of a simpler time when Spencer and I used to giggle and play in the gardens at my home. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about our games.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry,\u201d I grated out again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to confess something to you,\u201d he said, ignoring me, taking a deep breath to steady himself. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you since I was old enough to discover I could want someone.\u201d My body tensed beside his, but he just held tighter. \u201cShh, stop. Listen to me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie to you. You\u2019re goddamned beautiful, Sophie, and I\u2019m so turned on right now I can\u2019t even think straight, but I won\u2019t have you, not like this. I thought you wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I began truthfully but he shushed me.</p><p>\u201cNo need, Sophie. Just lay here with me while I try to calm the hell down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>It was then I realized that Spencer was a good friend, a real friend, probably the only one I really had.</p><p>We both fell asleep and I woke to Spencer snoring softly. I peered down at myself and realized I was practically naked. Shame heated up my face and body and I slid out from under his hold to retrieve my clothing from the main living area. The room was dark as the sun had set not long before and I began gathering my skirt and blouse from the blonde wood flooring.</p><p>I\u2019d just bent to retrieve my purse when I heard the front door swing open. I froze in absolute fear as Spencer\u2019s father stood in the space just outside the threshold. I held the loose clothing against my body.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, what do we have here?\u201d he asked, strolling in at a snail\u2019s pace. He removed his keys from the lock and threw them on a nearby table. He looked more closely at me and realization struck him. \u201cAh, the Price girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I began, but he cut me off.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be sorry,\u201d he said, oozing creepiness. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He perused my body with obvious appreciation and I turned to bolt back up the stairs to Spencer\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d his father called out, grabbing my elbow. \u201cIf he\u2019s finished, I\u2019d like to have a turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re finishing up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d When I couldn't answer him he continued, \u201cMy wife flew ahead of me. I had an emergency at work and had to fly back from Atlanta. I told her I\u2019d meet up with her later. She\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with me?\u201d I asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cI can give you things my boy can\u2019t,\u201d he slimily offered with what I\u2019m sure he thought was a charming smile. All I could see were serpent\u2019s teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming Spencer\u2019s asleep because you\u2019ve worn him out.\u201d I balked at his presumption. \u201cI, uh, know of the trouble you\u2019ve recently gotten yourself into.\u201d Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you saying?\u201d</p><p>He ran a finger down my upper arm and I visibly convulsed at his touch. His eyes became hard. \u201cI\u2019m saying if you want me to keep this indiscretion quiet to your father, you\u2019d best accommodate me.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and he ripped the clothing from my hands before gripping my shoulders. I trembled, having no idea what I was going to do. I knew I could scream for Spencer, but if he walked in, he\u2019d just assume I had volunteered. After all, I had a reputation.</p><p>\u201cLet go of her!\u201d I heard behind me.</p><p>Spencer\u2019s father stiffened at the sight of his son and released my arms.</p><p>\u201cSpencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh spare me.\u201d</p><p>He descended the remaining stairs unbuttoning his shirt and throwing it over my shoulders. \u201cYou won\u2019t say a fucking word to her father, or I\u2019ll tell mother what I just witnessed.\u201d Spencer gathered up my skirt and top and he led me back to his room, closing the door behind us.</p><p>He ran the palm of his hand over his mouth. \u201cJesus, Soph, I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, but my trembling body said otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you showed up when you did. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I-I\u2019m just no good for anyone, am I?\u201d I joked.</p><p>Spencer narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cYou really feel that way, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really, truly believe that.\u201d</p><p>I offered a hesitant smile and tried to shake my head no, to play it off, but he ignored me.</p><p>\u201cSophie Price, you are a mess. Come on, get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve earned a stay at the W, love. My treat.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Sunday night, while Spencer and I were at Lucques for dinner, I received a call from Pembrook. This was not unusual if I was gone for days at a time as he would ring me to confirm I was still breathing so I denied the call, planning on calling back when dinner was over.</p><p>\u201cSo Brown, eh?\u201d I asked Spencer.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said, perusing his menu but briefly looking up to make a silly face. \u201cSo Yale, eh?\u201d he teased.</p><p>I sighed in reply.</p><p>\u201cHow do you suppose we\u2019ll withstand the weather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on racking up thousands of frequent flyer miles. I don\u2019t want to leave, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Spencer, that breaks my heart a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but Brown is my family\u2019s institution and,\u201d he dropped an octave, \u201cno son of my father\u2019s will attend anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you get supremely pissed if I tell you how much I can\u2019t stand your father and that if it were me, I\u2019d defy him just to screw him, no pun intended?\u201d</p><p>Spencer\u2019s facial expression hardened and I regretted insulting his father. That is, until he said, \u201cNo one can stand my father, including my father. He\u2019s a terrible person and I hate him.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change and I realized how deep that resentment toward his father really went.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to Brown then,\u201d I simply told him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, exhaling sharply and staring out the glass into the street.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cI need his money.\u201d</p><p>Spencer looked at me and I couldn\u2019t help but stare back. We were all in the same boat, prisoners to greed. Suddenly, my stomach dropped out from under me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like them,\u201d I candidly admitted as much to myself as to him.</p><p>Spencer leaned over and took my hand in his, squeezing my fingers in earnest.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we break the cycle?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily and sank into the plush booth, releasing my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can, Soph. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d I desperately argued. \u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d I repeated as if that could change it.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked me, furrowing his brows in frustration. \u201cWe\u2019re dependent on them, utterly. I could no more live in a studio with barely enough cash to feed myself any more than you could.\u201d A single tear fell from my face at the truth of that declaration and Spencer wiped it gingerly away. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck, Price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, try. Look at us, Soph. We party harshly at the Holes on the weekends. I think we\u2019ve all had sex with one another at least once, apart from you and I. And I\u2019d still do you if you\u2019d just admit that you like me as much as I like you.\u201d I cringed into myself a little. When I didn\u2019t respond, he continued, turning to study the nightlife outside our window again.</p><p>\u201cThe only difference between us and our parents is that we\u2019re younger, we do coke while they drink, but we\u2019ll graduate or simmer to that, depending on how you look at it, as they did. We\u2019re not married but soon we will be and to each other, but it won\u2019t matter because we\u2019ll trade partners like we do now. We\u2019re addicted to the lifestyle. I can\u2019t see a way out of that.\u201d He leaned over me. \u201cAnd need I remind you, that you rule us all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, Spence, but thank you. I\u2019m well aware my standing in our group.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unexpectedly, I wanted as far away from Spencer and my life as quickly as possible, but how could I remove myself from the toxicity when I was the main component in the vile concoction that was our lives?</p><p>On our way back to the W, I took the opportunity to ring Pembrook.</p><p>\u201cPemmy, it\u2019s Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, you\u2019ll need to be at the courthouse at seven in the morning tomorrow. Do not arrive late. Court is at eight and dress appropriately. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to remind you to keep a lid on your illegal activities this evening. Do try and be sober.\u201d</p> <p>And with that, he hung up.</p><p>My hands began to shake from their normally composed cool and I brought them to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Spencer asked.</p><p>\u201cI have court in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible? It was only Friday you were arrested.\u201d</p> <p>I stared out the window at the cars around us. \u201cMy father did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he bother?\u201d</p><p>I thought back to the image of a floating jacket in our fountain. \u201cBecause I ruined something for him and this is my punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go home, you know. I can drop you off tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet, but I have nothing appropriate for court tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sardonic expression and extended his hand toward the row of shops lining the street we were traveling.</p> <p>\u201cBuy something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, turn left here. I\u2019ll just charge the long posy dress I saw in Temperley\u2019s window last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t interpret anything you\u2019ve just said besides turn left here, thank God.\u201d</p><p>I could only playfully roll my eyes at him.</p><p>He dropped me off and found parking in the rear while I waited for him at the door. I needed his presence to keep me calm. If I were being honest with myself, I would have admitted that I was terrified at what was going to happen the next morning. If your father pulls political strings to get your criminal court date moved to the front of an already astronomically busy queue, I can\u2019t imagine what he could stand to gain from that. Except revenge. Which meant he had no intention of making my life easier. I could feel Luques beginning to surface when Spencer opened the door to Temperley\u2019s for me. I took deep breaths to calm my nerves. I was sincerely nervous for probably the very first time of my life.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d he asked, this savior in do-me clothing.</p><p>\u201cThe soft pink one hanging in the window.\u201d</p><p>He left me to browse while he took care of my purchase for me. I knew this little act just confirmed everything he\u2019d accused in our dinner conversation, but I still strove to hold on to the slightest thread of hope that I would never turn out so pathetically acquiescing as my mother or as cold-hearted as my father. But isn\u2019t that who you already are, Soph? You certainly cast your friends aside easily to screw their boyfriends, don\u2019t you? I shook my head. Build the wall, I ordered myself and just as easily, my facial expression eased and my thoughts turned an entirely different direction.</p> <p>\u201cSize, miss?\u201d I heard behind me, turning my head.</p><p>\u201cA four, please,\u201d I told the clerk and she quickly scurried off.</p><p>\u201cIt that all you\u2019ll need?\u201d Spencer asked from beside me after they\u2019d adjusted the garment for a quick tailor. \u201cI spied a shoe store nearby. I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Spence. That\u2019s fine. Shall we walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He turned his head toward the back room. \u201cWe\u2019ll just be next door as you do the alterations,\u201d he called out.</p><p>The clerk emerged and nodded discretely. \u201cGive me half an hour,\u201d she said.</p><p>Spencer led me to the shoe store next door and we perused the windows as we passed by. \u201cWhat are you going to give me for buying these for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA swift kick in the junk?\u201d</p><p>He laughed wholeheartedly. \u201cI had to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Inside, I immediately spied a pair of buttery-soft leather peek-a-boo\u2019s in the corner. \u201cThose,\u201d I told him succinctly.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you don\u2019t waste any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I want when I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can hope...\u201d he trailed off.</p><p>\u201cReally, Spence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I keep getting flashbacks of yesterday night. You were goddamn hot in nothing but your lingerie.\u201d</p><p>I sighed loudly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I know. I\u2019m just frustrated is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that,\u201d I told him sincerely.</p><p>\u201cNot as sorry as I am, but it\u2019ll do.\u201d He winked in jest. \u201cAnything else, then? Purse, scarf, a frenzied escape across the southern border?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Spencer, if I wanted to flee, I\u2019d fly. I\u2019m not a wanted felon, for chrissakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you\u2019d be so hot on the posters. Bounty hunters across the states would mortgage their homes to be the one to bring you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously starting to chafe me. I\u2019m nervous as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, kissing my temple. I could feel his chuckle against my skin. \u201cWould you like me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be humiliating enough. I don\u2019t believe your presence would be soothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize, old habits die hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but as soon as you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll call me?\u201d</p><p>I bit my bottom lip to keep it from trembling.</p><p>\u201cThe first.\u201d</p><p>Seven in the morning is made for people who deserve nothing but death. If I were a judge, I\u2019d schedule all my court dates after eleven in the morning and end them at three in the afternoon. I mean, my God, they went to school practically their entire adolescent and adult lives, probably rising before it was even light, only to graduate and begin working as a toiling law firm crony or in a political office position they\u2019d had to commit no less than fifteen years of their heart-clogging lives toward only to reach for aspirations of waking at the crack of dawn to deal with the lowliest of the low? No, thank you.</p><p>But we all really know why they did it. Prestige and power. That\u2019s why they did it. And who could blame them?</p><p>\u201cYou look incredible, Soph. Convict-less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Spencer pulled up front and I got out, nervous as hell.</p><p>He rolled down his window as I began the ascent into the courthouse. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to call me!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>I turned and nodded once before meeting Pembrook at the top of the steps.</p><p>\u201cOn time. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about my father getting the courts to agree to this has made me less than comfortable. I thought being on time would be, oh, I don\u2019t know, wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so today I get facetious Sophie. How delightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pemmy,\u201d I sighed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Follow me,\u201d he bit.</p><p>Pembrook led me through the security checkpoints and into a cavernous marble lobby to a set of elevators. I counted the floors as we passed each one. One...Surely the lesson is in the threat...Two...He wouldn\u2019t risk the publicity...Three...He\u2019s doing this because he loves me...Four...He does love me...Five...I know he does...Six...He has to...Seven...Doesn\u2019t he?</p><p>The ringing bell announcing our floor startled my anxiety-ridden body, stiff from tensing my muscles as if in anticipation of a beating. And that was what that morning would promise me. I knew it. Pemmy\u2019s short answers and minimal sarcasm told me that better than words ever could.</p><p>\u201cThrough here,\u201d I barely heard Pembrook mutter. He opened the door for me and I entered the sunken room.</p><p>The smallest sounds resonated throughout. The creak of the door, the taps of our shoes on the cold marble floor, the intake of every labored breath.</p><p>\u201cSit here,\u201d he said, pointing to a bench reminiscent of a church pew just outside of the fenced-in chamber in the public gallery.</p><p>I sat and the wood protested underneath me, warning me, begging me to act, to run. Pembrook easily threw open the swinging half doors that separated the courtroom and approached the prosecutor\u2019s table. I took in my surroundings and noted I wasn\u2019t the only defendant in the courtroom, which was confusing. A singular man sat in the corner opposite my side of the room. This was typical for most minor criminal court cases, but for some reason I thought my father wouldn\u2019t want the potential spectacle or would be willing to risk my being seen and would have arranged for a private hearing.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d a burly guard with bright red hair said pointing to the lone man. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reassigned. You should be in Courtroom C now.\u201d Of course.</p><p>\u201cOh, so sorry,\u201d the man offered. He stood and gave me a half smile.</p><p>I wanted to vomit at the butterflies that gave me. Worry. You could see it in his eyes. Thick strain seemed to bulge the walls in all its sensationalism. It crawled over my body and settled heavily on my heart.</p><p>Pembrook called me to his table and sat me in a leather swivel chair. The animal skin ground against my own, cold and stiff to touch. The cumbersome weight of unease in the room settled over me with a finality that choked.</p><p>\u201cAll rise,\u201d the bailiff said, surprising me from my thoughts. I looked up just in time to see Reinhold walk into the room. Doomed. \u201cThis court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Francis Reinhold presiding.\u201d</p><p>Judge Reinhold refused to look my direction. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the docket today, Sam?\u201d he asked the bailiff.</p><p>He meant \u201cchopping block.\u201d Reinhold knew.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor, case one this morning is Price vs. the city of Los Angeles.\u201d</p><p>Reinhold finally met my face with zero expression, but his eyes were calculating, measuring, assessing.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Reinhold asked my attorney and the prosecutor.</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Honor,\u201d Pembrook said.</p><p>The prosecutor nodded her head with a single, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The door to the courtroom groaned open in that moment and in stepped three people I would have paid not to have step through. My father and mother moved to sit on the bench I had sat just minutes earlier, giving off the impression they had somewhere else they really needed to be but the real jest, it seemed, was Officer Casey in all his youthful, handsome glory and his countenance spoke volumes of hate, lust, anger, and want.</p><p>He earned a brief glance from me and that earned myself a cruel smile in return. I kept my gaze on him, leaned imperceptibly his direction, lightly touched the tip of my tongue to the top of my teeth, smiled effortlessly and winked. This startled him and his own smile faltered, stuttered and fell off his face. I turned back to Reinhold, no one in the room the wiser but for Casey and his thundering heart.</p><p>\u201cI understand an agreement has been made?\u201d Reinhold asked the attorneys.</p><p>An agreement?</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Honor,\u201d the lawyers said in unison.</p><p>\u201cMiss Price, please stand,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I obeyed, my booming heart clamoring to stay steady, and stood from my chair.</p><p>\u201cI promised you the next time I saw you in my courtroom you would not leave as easily and yet here you are. Now, I\u2019ve agreed to this plea bargain only because I feel it can teach you the value of your life far better than any amount of incarceration, rehab or community service.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wrapped my hand around the other to keep them from visibly trembling. I didn\u2019t dare anger Reinhold\u2019s already ice thin patience by asking him what the plea actually was. I turned to stare at Pembrook who stood beside me but he didn\u2019t return the glance. I turned Reinhold\u2019s way once more.</p><p>\u201cSophie Price,\u201d he said with finality, making my stomach clench. My eyes closed tightly in preparation. \u201cYou are hereby sentenced to six months in Masego.\u201d And with that, Reinhold slammed his gavel home, sending an icy shiver through my body.</p><p>I stood standing, mouth agape at the tabletop below me as the remaining people in the room stood when Reinhold exited.</p><p>And just like that, it was over.</p> <p>When the room cleared, I turned to find my parents, but they had already begun to leave. My father barely acknowledged me with a nod. Casey loitered near the swinging doors and I turned his direction wondering what he could possibly want.</p><p>He leaned toward me. I could only blink where I stood. \u201cGood luck, princess.\u201d</p><p>He left chuckling under his breath.</p><p>Pembrook. \u201cPemmy, what\u2014,\u201d I coughed back the choking sensation that had taken up residence in my throat. \u201cWhat is \u2018Masego\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Pembrook sat in his chair and gathered all the seemingly unnecessary paperwork he\u2019d strewn about the table before the short sentencing. He busied his hands and refused to acknowledge me with his eyes. \u201cMasego is an orphanage in Uganda belonging to a very dear friend of mine I\u2019ve had since primary. I expect you to work hard, Sophie. I expect you not to embarrass me. You leave in a week. The physician will be at your parents\u2019 home tomorrow at three in the afternoon to administer the necessary inoculations. Be there, or suffer the court\u2019s wrath. Also, here is a card your father has designated for you to purchase the necessities. Buy sturdy shorts, boots and things of this nature to weather the harsh Ugandan climate.\u201d Finally, he looked up at me and took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m risking myself for you, Sophie. I wouldn\u2019t do this for anyone else. You need a hard dose of reality and Charles will be able to deliver that to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think to change me, Pemmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to change and soon, or you will be beyond salvaging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can prevent me from becoming what I already am,\u201d I proclaimed, honest with myself for the very first time.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said, setting his leather satchel on the table. \u201cBut people can change, my dear, and I know you\u2019re capable of being better than this girl you\u2019ve created for yourself. I never speak ill of your father if it can be helped, for obvious reasons, but you have been treated poorly by him and for some unfathomable reason I feel it my responsibility to fix it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you since you were small and sweet and innocent, Sophie.\u201d He breathed deeply and palmed the handles of his satchel. \u201cI cannot undo the things you\u2019ve done, but I\u2019ll be damned if your future is as bleak as your past.\u201d</p><p>Pembrook kissed my cheek lightly and took a few of the tears I\u2019d unwittingly shed with him. He abandoned me there in that cold room. I was alone.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know much more than I had that morning. The only slight additional awareness I owned was that in one week I would be on a plane to Uganda to see an old friend of Pemmy\u2019s and to help out at his orphanage. Such a simple idea with such huge consequences.</p><p>I pinched the stupid card my father had left me between my thumb and forefinger, rubbing the new foiled number. I\u2019d always considered them little plastic hugs instead of seeing them for what they truly were. To my father, they were obligations. And if my father did one thing, he always fulfilled his obligations.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>I dazily walked outside and down the steps, not really knowing where I was going.</p><p>\u201cNo call,\u201d I heard Spencer tease beside me. \u201cTypical Sophie Price.\u201d</p><p>I looked his direction and the joshing smile on his face fell when he read my expression.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it couldn\u2019t have been that bad. A few hours of community service, tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite, Spencer.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer looked visibly nervous. \u201cWhat\u2019d you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months in Africa.\u201d</p><p>Spencer laughed out loud. \u201cHilarious, Soph, a jab at my parents. Funny. Now, seriously what\u2019d you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019ve been sentenced six months working in an orphanage in Uganda.\u201d</p><p>Spencer\u2019s face fell, his brows narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not. I wish I was.\u201d</p><p>Spencer took me by the hand and we sat at a stone bench in front of the courthouse. My back laid flat against the rest and Spencer angled himself toward me, his arm strewn across the top.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUganda.\u201d</p><p>He sank back a bit. \u201cI wish I had any idea if that was dangerous or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I stoically added.</p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d he said, before clearing his throat, \u201cdo you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, squeezing my eyes shut. I opened them and turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cMake this week for me, Spence. Make it so damn fun it\u2019ll hold me over for six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>The club he\u2019d taken me to was new, so new I\u2019d never been there and that was saying something, but it was packed, sardines packed. I could tell even though we hadn\u2019t even stepped a foot inside. Spencer\u2019s Aston Martin pulled up to the curb outside the door and I could practically feel the stares of the club patrons in line, heavy and full of wonder. The impossibly sexy Spencer casually stepped from his car and handed the keys to the valet. A second valet attempted to open the door for me but Spencer waved him off and came to my side, swinging my door open softly and reaching in for my hand. I heard the cottony sighs of the girls in queue when they saw Spencer and it made me wonder why I couldn\u2019t get into him the way he was into me.</p><p>My hand gripped his as he culled me from my seat. My hair blew away from my face and I got a good glimpse of the glinted eyes of admirers for almost half a block. My heel hit pavement and the collective groans from the men in line at the sight of my leg made Spencer wink discretely. He lifted me and closed my door behind me. In the seconds it took to turn, a secret thrill blew through my chest at the envy emanating from their faces, but our expressions would have never conveyed such. No, we were trained from birth to assert disinterest. We were the ultimate snobs and realizing this, that secret thrill quickly dissipated into shame. What is wrong with me?</p><p>The doorman opened the door for us and ushered us inside and the people in line didn\u2019t question the move, assuming we were more important than they were and that made me think further into why society accepted such nonsense, but there I was, letting it happen anyway. I was turning into a massive hypocrite and all I wanted was to go back to how I was.</p><p>\u201cCan we make out a little, Spencer, and not have it turn into anything?\u201d I asked him, knowing that was such a bitch move but needing a little of my old life to come back in order for me to feel sane again.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding, Sophie Price? I thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was diplomatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being tactful. When Sophie Price asks you for a kiss, you perform. Now, if you need any other, uh, performing, I\u2019d be happy to oblige as well.\u201d</p><p>This stopped my heart. \u201cMaybe making out is a horrible idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, forget everything I just said.\u201d He hurriedly led us to our private table and whipped me toward him. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>I threw my small bag in the booth in answer, knowing security in VIP would cover it since Spence handed the guy a hundred and I let him pull me toward the floor. I took the lead and wound my way through the crowd with Spencer just behind me and found a spot two people could fit comfortably. Darkness surrounded us other than the dancing lights that touched the top of the crowd but bounced off just as quickly.</p><p>The first song was slow and sexy. Spencer laid his hands on me and I let him. They perused my body in appreciation as I used him. We swayed with the erotic tempo and his mouth found mine, answering my earlier question. The warm feel of his tongue soothed away any raw feeling of moral contradiction that had taken residence so obnoxiously in my heart. I groaned in response and his arms found my rib cage, encircling me tightly before giving me a slight squeeze and lifting me slightly from the floor.</p><p>I kissed Spencer like my life depended on it. I hoped every exhale into his mouth shed a little of my newly found struggles.</p><p>\u201cHold me tighter,\u201d I whispered against his teeth. He clutched me closer, yet not tight enough. \u201cMore,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>Spencer drew me firmer against him and I felt every ridge of his body. \u201cIs that close enough?\u201d he laughed into my throat.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I told him. I didn\u2019t feel as alone anymore.</p><p>Spencer kissed me again but softer, as if he knew I needed that. He read my body well, giving when I drew back, drawing back when I gave. All I could think was he was going to make some girl very happy one day. He ran his hands through my long curls, gripping my waist just above the hip before enfolding me against him once again.</p><p>And just as suddenly, the very heated kiss turned lighter, tapering off into a desperate embrace. I felt it in that moment as did he. It was glaringly obvious to us standing there in the middle of the crowded dance floor. I needed to be needed by him and he needed to be needed by me. We clung to one another, not sure exactly what it was we required from one another but acknowledging it all the same.</p><p>When the song ended and a more upbeat tune replaced it, Spencer pulled away.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get the fuck out of here,\u201d he told me.</p><p>We went back to my house but parked his car in the employee lot just in case my father was on the lookout, though I doubt he was. My room had been serviced since I\u2019d left it last so I tossed the covers back and tumbled inside, whipping my clothes off under the covers. Spencer tossed his jeans on the chair in the corner along with his shirt, tucking himself with me in only his boxers.</p><p>We held each other the entire night, no words spoken but the still, silent night uttered so much.</p><p>\u201cMiss Price?\u201d A voice woke me. \u201cMiss Price?\u201d the voice asked louder.</p><p>My eyes barely opened and I took in my position, sprawled over a softly snoring Spencer. Brilliant.</p><p>I turned over and peered into the eyes of Dr. Ford and his nurse Cassandra. Just splendid, I thought. He was going to report this little incident to my father. I could see it in his face.</p><p>Cassandra was too distracted by the exposed chest of Spencer to give me her usual eye roll.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Dr. Ford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfternoon,\u201d he corrected me.</p><p>I glanced at the clock and saw it was indeed three in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right on time,\u201d I sarcastically spat at him.</p><p>\u201cMiss Price,\u201d he began, ignoring me, \u201cwould you prefer it if Cassandra and I left the room for you to dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Spencer woke and stretched beside me, causing Cassandra\u2019s eyes to bulge from her round face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t most of these go in the posterior region anyway?\u201d I teased, making Dr. Ford close his eyes in disapproval. Spencer tried to hide his laugh behind a closed fist, but it wasn\u2019t fooling anyone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just use your shower, Soph.\u201d Spencer slid from beneath the covers and strode across the floor in his boxers without any sense of shame. Winking, in fact, toward Cassandra and causing her to choke on nothing.</p><p>\u201cAll the same, Miss Price, I\u2019d prefer you in at least a robe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Dr. Ford.\u201d</p> <p>Cassandra grabbed the silk number that hung at the end of my door and brought it to me. Dr. Ford turned his head and I stood, sinking my arms through the sleeves of the robe Cassandra held out for me.</p><p>\u201cYummy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I whispered low, teasing Cassandra.</p><p>Her face flushed and she narrowed her brows at me in obvious disdain. I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou smile now,\u201d she caustically bit, \u201cbut you have no idea what you\u2019re in store for today.\u201d She smiled in return and my own fell.</p><p>I swallowed hard and stared at Cassandra\u2019s mean expression, shocked at myself for being unable to show no emotion. The truth? I was scared, terrified really because I had absolutely no idea what I truly was in store for. Not concerning the shots and certainly not Masego or whatever the hell they called it.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Price,\u201d Dr. Ford said, \u201cif you\u2019ll sit down. I have several forms here for you to sign.\u201d</p><p>He handed me a stack of papers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are all these?\u201d I asked him, perusing from one form to the other.</p><p>\u201cLiability wavers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so what exactly do you need liability protection from?\u201d</p><p>Spencer walked in at that moment and sat beside me on the bed, drying his wet hair with a towel.</p> <p>Dr. Ford sighed and pulled my vanity stool closer to me. He opened his leather satchel and inside, strapped tidily within a pouch, was an ungodly amount of syringes. I sucked in a breath and Spencer tucked his hand around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAdacel,\u201d he began, reading from a list on his lap, \u201cwhich prevents tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis. Hep A and B I\u2019ve given you several months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked curiously, just now wondering why I never asked questions before.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your,\u201d Dr. Ford said, clearing his throat and glancing at Spencer, \u201cincreased activity as of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said simply. Spencer laughed and I elbowed him. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a revamp of the flu shot. Let\u2019s see,\u201d he said, glancing down at a few different sheets of paper. \u201cA meningococcal booster dose, MMR or measles, mumps and rubella. Uh, pneumococcal, very important, polio you have, rabies,\u201d he said, looking over a chart, \u201cyou\u2019ll need a refresher on. You\u2019ll need typhoid but varicella you\u2019ve had.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d I exclaimed, grasping Spencer\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cCalm yourself, Miss Price. You\u2019ll need to follow strict food and water precautions while abroad. Consume only canned or commercially bottled drinks. Avoid using ice cubes, though I doubt they\u2019ll have refrigeration where you\u2019re going, which is also why you should only eat fruits and vegetables you peel and wash yourself. Avoid cold cuts, salads, watermelon, puddings.\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Ford looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cIt goes without saying, Miss Price, but do try to avoid casual sexual contact. I cannot stress that enough.\u201d I rolled my eyes at him. \u201cNever use needles or syringes used by other people. Avoid sharing a razor or toothbrush. No tattoos or piercings while there. Remain in well-screened or air-conditioned areas when possible. Wear clothing that adequately covers your arms and legs and use DEET-containing insect repellent on both your skin and clothing. Refuse blood transfusions unless in a life or death situation and try to ensure they\u2019ve been properly screened first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if I\u2019m dying and in desperate need of blood, I\u2019ll be sure to ask if the blood\u2019s been properly screened first.\u201d Deflecting your fear through sarcasm. Nice, Soph. He\u2019s only trying to help you.</p><p>Dr. Ford\u2019s face became deadly serious. \u201cYou do not understand, Miss Price. This is no joking matter. You are visiting a highly-diseased area. The things I am trying to protect you from can be the difference between dying a painful, horrible death...or not.\u201d</p><p>Right, thanks for that visual, doc.</p><p>\u201cCassandra will be bringing by an immunization record to keep with your travel documents. Don\u2019t lose it. They may not let you back in the country if you can\u2019t prove you\u2019ve taken preventative measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me,\u201d Spencer piped in.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Dr. Ford replied, now rolling his own eyes. \u201cShall we get started?\u201d Dr. Ford asked, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cYou will be feverish and sore in the injected areas but Tylenol should help you there. Get some rest,\u201d Dr. Ford added after the shockingly painful administrations, right before closing the door behind him and Cassandra.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably take those pain meds now,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cMy mom always made me take them right before my shots as a kid so I\u2019d avoid getting ill later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in my bathroom. Shelf,\u201d I said, lying down.</p><p>Some of the shots I\u2019d gotten hurt tremendously. I\u2019m not joking. The needles were huge and the injections felt warm and invasive.</p><p>Spencer brought me a glass of water and a fever reducer. I drank it down quickly. We both laid down on the bed facing the ceiling after I turned the stereo on low.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was enlightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m frightened beyond belief, Spencer.\u201d</p><p>He sighed loudly. \u201cI know, Soph. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I haven\u2019t used my father\u2019s stupid card yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I would have gotten short shorts and tank tops had I not known I needed to wear longer sleeves and pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Soph. This is scaring the shit out of me and I\u2019m not even going. I\u2019m panicked for you.\u201d</p><p>He dragged me over to him and culled me into his body, spooning me and smoothing my hair behind my ear. It was the first time a guy had ever done anything like this with completely innocent intentions and I fought the tears burning to shed. He was so nice to me and I didn\u2019t really know why. I mean, yeah, he did want to sleep with me. What guy didn\u2019t, if I was being honest with myself, which was my own fault but Spencer wasn\u2019t asking me to do anything. He was offering himself as comfort without any expectations in return.</p><p>I turned over and wrapped my arms around him. He hugged me fiercely in return. After a few minutes, I drew back and looked into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, aren\u2019t you, Spencer?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at me. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you just aren\u2019t aware of it, but you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. I\u2019m a friggin\u2019 saint, yada, yada. Can we get you your shit before all the stores close? I want this Africa shit done and over with so we can finish out the week in total debauchery.\u201d</p><p>He made me laugh, but he wasn\u2019t fooling me. Somehow, growing up in the house he did, with the father he had, Spencer had the unbelievable potential to become a very great man. He amazed me. I suppose the choices you make really are what define you.</p><p>Why can\u2019t you get into him then?</p><p>I took my father\u2019s card and maxed it out. I bought all new sturdy canvas luggage because my soft leather designer bags weren\u2019t going to cut it, obviously. Spencer took me to the store his mother visits when she goes on safari and the clerk there was exceedingly helpful, informing me what would work best in mid-Africa and what I could get away with. I only bought a few things but still took their advice to my own favorite shops. The hell I would look like a slob if I could help it.</p><p>I bought fifteen pairs of badass jeans and a lot of formfitting button-ups as well as a few knee-length riding boots to wear over my jeans. It wouldn\u2019t define me, that fashion sense, but it would keep me safe and I had to admit I wouldn\u2019t look like a total slob. I tried on a complete outfit for Spencer and paraded around him in the store.</p><p>\u201cYou look transformed. I\u2019m not used to seeing you so casual.\u201d My shoulders slumped a little in disappointment and my signature pout came to the forefront. \u201cOh, please,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou look sexy as hell as if I needed to say it. Your ass is the sweetest I\u2019ve ever seen, especially in those jeans.\u201d</p><p>I smiled devilishly at him. \u201cThank you,\u201d I told him, sashaying off, swinging my hips from side to side. His audible groan sent that secret thrill through my stomach again, but it was short-lived by that nagging sense of guilt. What is wrong with me!?</p><p>When Spencer took me home and helped me load all my purchases into my bedroom, we came across a massive pile of things resting on top of my bed along with a letter from Pembrook.</p><p>Pemmy told me to go with the impression that I wouldn\u2019t have electricity ever, as Masego only had it sporadically and for maybe a day at that. All that translated to me when he wrote that was I wouldn\u2019t be able to fix my hair and I had nothing but cold showers in my future. He included a huge bed net to protect me from insects at night, a massive medical kit containing things I\u2019m fairly certain only a doctor should have a license to handle, various over-the-counter medicines as well as prescription antibiotics from Dr. Ford, which, by the way, looked like they were lifted directly from the pharmacist\u2019s shelf. The bottles obviously held hundreds of pills. It made me nervous just looking at them.</p><p>Pemmy closed his letter telling me that he loved me like a daughter and he wished me to be careful. I didn\u2019t know what to think of that, but I\u2019d be lying if I told you it didn\u2019t make me smile...just a little.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>I woke at three in the morning shaking. Dr. Ford had told my father about Spencer\u2019s sleepover and that had been the last night Spencer was able to stay much to my dismay. If ever I needed a warm body by my side, it was through the long nights before my departure. Nights of quiet. Nights of speeding thoughts and concocted scenarios of danger and disease.</p><p>I stood in the shower for close to half an hour, attempting to let the steam soothe my fears, but it did no good, no good at all. I stepped from the water and wrapped a towel around myself. I stood in front of the mirror and took a good hard look. I was as bare as I could make myself, no makeup with wet, stringy hair. I hated to look at myself in this state. I didn\u2019t feel real. I felt too exposed and that made me exceedingly nervous, but I made myself look that morning. I memorized that girl. That girl was the real me. Frightened. Worthless. A terrible friend. Terrible daughter. Well educated but so limited in ideas worth having. Beautiful yet repulsive...</p><p>And finally honest.</p><p>Spencer picked me up that morning for my flight at seven in the morning. He rang me from inside the house and I met him in the foyer standing next to Pembrook, no sign of my mother or father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSophie,\u201d Pembrook smiled, \u201chere are all your necessary papers. An emergency card, as well as cash. Keep these close to your body. You\u2019re flying to Germany first, then Dubai, staying the night. The hotel arrangements are in your travel documents. A car has been arranged to pick you up there. From Dubai you will fly to Nairobi, Kenya, where a small plane has been chartered to take you to Kampala, Uganda. Look for a boy named Dingane to pick you up. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of outfitting your case with a satellite phone for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmergencies?\u201d I asked, smiling back.</p><p>Pembrook\u2019s shoulders visibly relaxed and he wrapped his long, lanky arms around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo be careful, my dear,\u201d he whispered against my hair before speeding off down the hall.</p> <p>I sighed as I watched him make way for the kitchens. I turned to Spencer and smiled again.</p><p>He held his hand out to me and I took it. He squeezed it softly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he reassured, but I didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>I looked around me, at how empty the foyer was and felt a little disappointed that Sav and the rest of my friends hadn\u2019t shown up. I\u2019d texted them the night before, but I suppose there was no reason to say goodbye to someone they cared very little for.</p><p>I met Spencer\u2019s eyes once more. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come,\u201d I told him matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t,\u201d he stated.</p> <p>\u201cNo need to dwell. I\u2019ll just be a moment,\u201d I told him and headed toward my father\u2019s office.</p><p>I knocked on his door and heard a faint \u201center.\u201d I obeyed and turned the handle. Billowing cigar smoke enveloped me before dissipating behind me. The cleared smoke revealed my father, busy as usual, and on his phone.</p><p>\u201cNo! No! I never agreed to that!\u201d My father turned my direction. \u201cJust a minute, will you?\u201d he asked the receiver. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m-I\u2019m off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>And just like that he was immersed in his phone conversation and I closed the heavy wooden door behind me. On the way back to the foyer, I passed one of our maidservants Margarite carrying folded towels to one of the guest suites.</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen Mrs. Price this morning, Margarite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she has gone to town for a morning of shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see. Tell her that you saw me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, miss.\u201d Margarite\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like me to convey, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, miss,\u201d Margarite said before going about her business again.</p><p>I followed suit but could feel her eyes look back at me as if she pitied me. I cringed at the thought that my maid felt sorry for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I told Spencer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve loaded your bags already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Spence.\u201d</p><p>The ride to the airport was eerily quiet. I contemplated the almost twenty hours of flying I had in my future, not including my overnight stay in Dubai. My hands began to visibly shake and Spencer stilled them with his own. Regina Spektor\u2019s All the Rowboats began to play and I couldn\u2019t help but let the haunting melody seep into my skin. The words felt prophetic, although the subjects of her song were entirely objects, but when I really defined myself, that\u2019s what I was, a mere object and it was all by my own doing. I was those breathing objects, desperately aching to escape, to live, and suddenly a calm washed over me.</p><p>All the talk of danger, disease and devastation frightened me, but I was ready for a change, just as desperate and just as aching to escape, to live, really live, as the songs and paintings in her words.</p><p>We pulled up to the unloading zone and Spencer opened my door for me. He looked deflated.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, my very good friend.\u201d</p><p>He smiled but the grin never touched his eyes. His hands dug into his pockets. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all I\u2019ll ever be to you, I think.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders sank into the car door a bit. \u201cSpencer, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, pressing the pad of his thumb at my lips. His fingers grazed my cheek slightly when he pulled away. \u201cAbsolutely no worries, Sophie Price.\u201d He smiled in sincerity then and my heart dropped a tad for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you very much,\u201d I admitted to the only real friend I\u2019d ever really had but only very recently realized.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll miss you. I\u2019ve just discovered you\u2019re as lost as I am and now you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy court order,\u201d I jested, making his grin wider.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWe were supposed to find our way together though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be as lost when I come back. We can pick up from there, Spence.\u201d</p><p>Spencer grabbed my bags and laid them on the cart the porter had brought over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in six months,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d he said, pointing toward the pavement. \u201cWaiting.\u201d</p><p>I grazed his cheek and squeezed my eyes painfully. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me, Spencer,\u201d I whisper ordered.</p><p>Spencer pulled me from him. \u201cI\u2019ll do as I damn well please, Price. Now get.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him and followed the porter. When I turned back around for a final wave he\u2019d already gone.</p><p>Twenty hours of flight, despite a night of sleep in The Palm in Dubai still feels like twenty hours of flight. When I arrived in Africa by way of Nairobi, I didn\u2019t get a chance to absorb the continent as I only had twenty minutes to catch my Cessna, but when my little chartered plane landed, barely, and the stairs were brought out, the door opened, I looked out onto a most wonderful sight, a breathtaking sight. A sight of green lush vegetation, dirt red with iron and the expansive blue and breathtaking Lake Victoria. My breath sucked into my chest as I took it all in. It was incredibly beautiful.</p><p>I descended the stairs and was met with my luggage at my feet and a happy African young man with dark mocha face and gleaming white teeth.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Africa, miss,\u201d he greeted me with cheer. \u201cI understand this is your first visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled the largest smile I\u2019d ever seen and I wondered what had made this guy so happy. \u201cFollow me, miss.\u201d</p><p>I fished around in my pouch for a ten-dollar bill. A guy in Dubai had told me they prefer American currency so I never exchanged the hundreds Pembrook had given me. We approached the airport itself and all I could think when I looked upon it was the nineteen-seventies had died and gone to heaven on this little inlet. My skin went cold when I thought on that. Before I\u2019d left, I\u2019d read up on Uganda and discovered the very airport I\u2019d flown into was also the site of a most dangerous hostage situation involving terrorists in that same era. I shivered thinking on the details and the very close call it was. It reminded me where I was and what my real purpose for visiting entailed.</p><p>When the enthusiastic porter set my bags down inside, he beamed at me and I almost laughed at his optimism.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cYou\u2019re quite animated, and why are you so happy today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy every day, Miss. I am alive and working. I have a roof. I can feed my brothers and sisters. I am very, very happy.\u201d</p><p>My heart clenched and I dug in my pouch for another ten, thought twice, and grabbed a fifty before settling the cash in his hand. His eyes blew to impossible proportions and I shook my head at him, silencing the protest forming on his lips.</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it,\u201d I snapped and cleared my throat. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I told him and grabbed my bags hurriedly before walking with purpose down the corridor toward what I assumed was the front entrance.</p><p>I tried not to think of what fifty dollars meant to that boy and his family. I also tried not to think about the silly bracelet tied around my wrist that cost five hundred. I stopped where I was and gathered myself, remembering my notebook and sliding it out of my pack. I flipped through the pages and looked for the name Pembrook told me not to forget but did anyway because it was such an unusual name.</p><p>\u201cDingane,\u201d I repeated out loud. \u201cWhat kind of name is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Din-John-E,\u201d a deep voice interrupted and my head shot up.</p><p>Struck. Speechless.</p><p>A deep, punching sensation washed over my entire body and I almost fell to my knees at the powerful impression. My breaths became labored and I fought for a clear head. A balmy, scorching but unbelievably ecstasy-ridden awareness swam through my body. An exhilarating, pleasant haze settled over me and it...Burned. So. Good. This was a feeling of realization. I stood there, relishing the effects.</p><p>I remember Sarah Pringle telling me once about a boy she had met while on holiday in Europe. The way she painted him made me doubt her sanity.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t describe him, Sophie,\u201d she\u2019d said, her hands covering her cheeks in desperation. \u201cIt was like my body knew instantly that he was mine and that I was his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwfully primitive of you to admit that, Sarah,\u201d I\u2019d mocked, making everyone around us laugh.</p><p>But now I knew what she meant. Now I understood what she was trying to convey to me.</p><p>The boy who stood before me was on the cusp of becoming a man. All taut, lean muscle, narrow where a boy needed to be and broad where a man should always be. I\u2019d never known a person could be this drawn to another human being, especially a complete stranger. His face captivated me without the ability to speak. I felt my chest grasp for air but was unable to accommodate its feverish demand, so I stupidly sat panting there like a dog after a brisk run. He leaned over me, hands tucked into the front pockets of his jeans, pulling the fabric of his shirt stiff against the muscles of his arms and shoulders and sending me deeper into immediate obsession.</p><p>I gulped down my lack of breath and studied him. He was the complete opposite of what I\u2019d always imagined I\u2019d be the most attracted to. Straight black hair met his chin but was tucked behind his ears, cerulean blue eyes stared at me strangely, his full bottom lip separated from his upper lip in question. He was looking down a straight Roman nose at me and his square jaw was clenched.</p><p>\u201cAre you the one they call Sophie?\u201d he asked stiffly, already exasperated with me it seemed.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Dingane,\u201d his thick accent repeated.</p><p>When he spoke, my eyes involuntarily rolled to the back of my head. His deep silky voice washed over me like warm water on a cold afternoon and I willingly leaned closer to him. The proximity was like fuel to my already out of control flame. I bent away from him to gain rational thought and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re white,\u201d I stupidly blurted, making me want to crawl underneath something.</p><p>\u201cYou are incredibly astute,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was-I was just expecting an African,\u201d I stammered.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Ian. Dingane is a nickname, but I am African. My ancestors came to South Africa in the seventeen-hundreds from England,\u201d he explained although he seemed annoyed to be doing so, as if I deserved no such courtesy.</p><p>His accent sounded like a mix of formal English, Australian and Dutch. That\u2019s the only way I could describe it. I\u2019d never heard its equal. It was so incredibly beautiful and unique. Every film I\u2019d ever watched that featured the South African accent completely butchered it. Listening to him was like listening to velvet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I spit out intelligently. \u201cWhat-what does Dingane mean?\u201d I sputtered, still unable to remove my stare from his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said, apparently no longer humoring me and bending to pick up the luggage I\u2019d only just realized I\u2019d dropped.</p><p>\u201cI can get that,\u201d I said stupidly, reaching toward the floor. What is wrong with me? I\u2019m the one who strikes men dumb! Not the other way \u2019round!</p><p>\u201cI already have them. Follow me,\u201d he ordered, standing to his full height.</p> <p>I swallowed the embarrassing five-minute loss of sanity and began to follow him like a meek mouse. I didn\u2019t feel like myself, didn\u2019t feel like Sophie Price. Wake up, Sophie. I picked up my head, remembered who the hell I was and met every stride he strode. We were neck and neck and I could tell this surprised him by the way he spied me from the corner of his eye. I kept my face neutral. Eat that, Dingane.</p><p>He lead us to a white beat-up jeep and I stopped just short of visibly balking. He threw my bags with little care into the exposed back and began to strap them down.</p><p>I watched him work. \u201cAre you expecting me to open your door for you?\u201d he asked, his thick accent shocking once more.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I expect you to open my door for me?\u201d I bit back.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cThen why stand there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be presumptuous of me to just sit inside your jeep without you, don\u2019t you think? Possibly rude?\u201d</p><p>His calloused hands unexpectedly rested over the now tight straps and he looked at me for longer than I considered comfortable, studying me, but just as suddenly walked to the passenger side door as if just remembering himself and opened it for me without a word. I climbed into the jeep and watched him close the door behind me before walking the front of the vehicle and hopping in.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I asked, turning toward him after buckling in.</p><p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d he said succinctly.</p><p>He was quiet as he started the jeep and sped through the almost impossible jumble of pushy taxis waiting for passengers. I admit I white knuckled it until we met open road.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take an hour to get to the city capital,\u201d he yelled over the rumbling engine and whipping wind. \u201cKampala is a busy city, Miss Price, and I\u2019d rather not stop, but I suspect it will be our only opportunity to eat before the long journey back to Lake Nyaguo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ate just before we landed,\u201d I lied.</p><p>If I was being honest, I was afraid to eat anything other than what was prepared at Masego. Damn that Dr. Ford.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re game to go straight through then so am I.\u201d</p><p>And that was the last thing Dingane said to me almost the entire journey.</p><p>The silence afforded me astonishing views of an unbelievably attractive country. It also gave me time to come to terms with how much my life was going to change and just how dramatic that change would be.</p><p>Four hours is a very long time. Long enough to ponder my very physical reaction to my driver and what it was going to mean to live and work with him. I decided it was just a tenacious chemistry, that I was not without self-control. Oh yeah, you\u2019re the queen of restraint. I turned toward him and drank in his lean, muscular figure.</p><p>Oh. My. Word.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Lake Nyaguo,\u201d Dingane said, startling me. \u201cMasego Orphanage is just north of this lake. Charles owns the land we drive through now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much does he own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApproximately five thousand acres. He owns the land north of the lake as well as south and his property lines go east from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he buy land in Uganda?\u201d I asked, more to myself than to Dingane.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I conceded.</p><p>Dingane sighed in exasperation. \u201cThis is his life\u2019s work. He wanted the land to accomplish it. Surprisingly, land in this part of Uganda is inexpensive.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>Half an hour later, we\u2019d rounded the east side of the blue lake and were on a straight red dirt road. \u201cMasego is just five minutes up this drive,\u201d he stated.</p><p>My throat dropped to my stomach and I tried to swallow the sinking feeling away. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful. It is horrifying.\u201d</p><p>The breath I\u2019d been holding for his response rushed out all at once.</p><p>\u201cI feel I must prepare you,\u201d he continued.</p><p>I gulped. \u201cPrepare me for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the children here.\u201d An unexpected gleam came to his eyes and I could see how much he loved them just by speaking of them. \u201cSome will be deformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeformed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaimed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know nothing of our facility?\u201d he asked impatiently, briefly narrowing his eyes my direction.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing. I know only that it is an orphanage.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out slowly. \u201cWe are too close to begin explaining now. Charles or his wife, Karina, should explain it all to you when you arrive. I don\u2019t have time. I\u2019ve spent the entire day driving to fetch you and I need to catch up on a mended fence at the northeastern edge of the property line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you...for fetching me,\u201d I oozed out.</p><p>He squirmed in his seat and I could tell I\u2019d made him uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. He wanted as far away from me as he could possibly get and that confused the hell out of me. He didn\u2019t know me at all.</p><p>In the distance I spied a long, tall fence surrounding what I assumed was Masego. As we approached a very sturdy, heavy-looking gate, I recognized the word Masego on a shabby, falling sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Masego mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBlessings.\u201d</p><p>I studied him. \u201cYou\u2019re a man of few words, Dingane of South Africa.\u201d</p><p>This surprisingly made him fight a smile and it shocked me. He quickly shook it and mumbled under his breath and out of the jeep to open the gate. His muscles flexed beneath his shirt as he dragged the heavy wooden barrier and I sat up a bit in my seat to watch him. Night was quickly coming and the jeep\u2019s headlights magnified just how beautiful he was. He was surprisingly tall for an African. Six-foot one, maybe two. Then again, what the hell did I know of Africans?</p><p>He jumped back into the jeep and steered us through before getting out once more and closing the gate behind us. I cursed the setting of the sun, wishing I could stare at him unabashedly once more.</p><p>When we drove the small distance to what looked like a clustered village, droves of little children with dark faces and white teeth came bounding up before the jeep had come to a complete stop.</p><p>\u201cDingane! Dingane!\u201d they all shouted as they raced around to his side of the jeep.</p><p>My door was clear of children and I could remove myself easily, but Dingane had a tougher time of it. He began laughing, further bewildering me. When he could free himself, he began shouting in a bizarre tongue. I studied his face and saw perfectly straight, perfectly beautiful teeth shining in the most perfect smile to the crowd of children around him.</p><p>That\u2019s when I saw them, noticed what Dingane was trying to prepare me for. Children, all ages, missing arms, eyes, parts of their faces, even legs. I held back my gasp and met Dingane\u2019s eyes. They were warm and full of understanding but for the children only. He looked at me sternly and his eyes conveyed what he wanted me to do.</p><p>I looked down on them, half-smiling, trying so very hard to look sincere when all I wanted to do was run and lock myself away from their terribly shocking faces. I had never in my life thought humans could endure such physical damage and survive.</p><p>Dingane held his hand out toward me and introduced me to them, finally using a word I recognized: my name.</p><p>\u201cSophie, Sophie, Sophie,\u201d I kept hearing over and over as the children tested my name on their tongues.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I greeted them shyly.</p><p>I was overwhelmed and incredibly and most surprisingly sad for them but had no idea what to say or do. They stared at me, smiling, when finally a young boy approached me and touched my clothing. I stood still. This was an invitation to all of them to surround me like they had Dingane and they enveloped me. They pulled on my clothing speaking animatedly in a language I knew nothing about. They forced me to their height where I could fully take them in. One little girl\u2019s right arm was missing below her elbow, another little boy was missing a leg below the knee, another girl had some sort of bandage wrapped around the left side of her face. The injuries went on and on, but they didn\u2019t seem to care or remember they had no arms or legs or faces. They carried on, smoothing my clothing over with their tiny hands or running their fingers over my hair. One little girl told me in English that they all found it to be soft.</p><p>I fought tears and tried to keep in mind that if I started bawling in front of the small creatures before me that they would have no idea what it was for.</p><p>I was swallowed by children but could still hear a booming man\u2019s voice come from the direction of the largest dwelling on the complex. I say dwelling, but it was far from that. It looked like a large open run-down building made from very old wood.</p><p>\u201cDingane, where is our prisoner?\u201d the man\u2019s voice cracked across the grounds making the children scurry from my side and glue themselves to his. \u201cYes, yes, you\u2019re all very excited to see our newest member, but let\u2019s all calm ourselves.\u201d I stood. \u201cNow, where is she?\u201d</p><p>The man was tall but not as tall as Dingane and he was middle-aged. His salt-and-pepper hair laid flat against his head but was rather full for someone I pegged for being around sixty.</p><p>\u201cAh, our latest victim!\u201d he jested, yet the words still made me more nervous than I already was.</p><p>He approached me and threw his arms around me, picking me up in one motion and swinging me playfully from side to side before setting me right again. \u201cYou must be the infamous Sophie Price! I\u2019ve heard many things about you, child!\u201d he said in an accent similar to Pemmy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAll good I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not all good,\u201d he stated honestly, making me blush. I peered Dingane\u2019s direction for his reaction, but his face was stoic. \u201cBut that is neither here nor there. It has brought you to us and that is all that matters. Second chances. I\u2019m all about second chances.\u201d</p><p>I could tell Charles was the type to find the good in everything. I wasn\u2019t quite settled on whether or not I would like him. I was peculiarly leaning toward liking him and that amazed me. I looked to my left again and noticed Dingane had already started making his way toward whatever fence he claimed needed mending.</p><p>\u201cAh, she\u2019s here!\u201d a female\u2019s soft voice exclaimed.</p><p>I looked to my right and noticed a woman with burgundy, shoulder-length hair. She was also in her sixties and she was beautiful. I could tell she was the type of woman who, in her prime, would have had all the boys running around like imbeciles. A kindred spirit.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d she said, extending her hand.</p><p>I grabbed it and she tossed me into her arms for the kind of hug I\u2019d never once gotten from a woman but was so desperately in need of. It was the kind of hug a mother gave her daughter. I know, I\u2019d seen Sav\u2019s mom give her them many a time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Sophie!\u201d she sang in a lovely English accent, London if I were to have guessed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Karina.\u201d</p><p>I silently thanked the almost mute Dingane for mention of her name earlier. It would have been so embarrassing not to be able to say her name after such a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll help Din with that fence then. Let the ladies get acquainted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Karina said, shooing Charles with her hand and leading me toward a cluster of buildings just to the left of the main building. She stopped and turned to her left. \u201cKate! Kate! Please see that all the children wash before bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d a dark, beautiful African woman answered before gathering children\u2019s hands and singing them to their destination.</p><p>Kate was tall and exquisite. She looked like a supermodel, to be frank. If I had seen her in Paris, I\u2019d assumed she was there for the catwalks. It astounded me that she worked in the orphanage when there were so many outside opportunities to be had for her.</p><p>\u201cThis is to be your bedroom,\u201d Karina said pulling me from my thoughts and pointing to what I thought earlier was an outhouse. I almost blurted, \u201cyou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d but stopped myself immediately, remembering the missing arm of the little girl from minutes before. \u201cIt\u2019s actually separated into two rooms,\u201d she continued, swinging the door open to the room on the right. It was about as big as the toilet room in my bathroom back home. I peered inside and took in its contents.</p><p>Though it had a roof and floor, it didn\u2019t have much else. There was a sink basin to the right but no faucet and a simple bed, smaller than a twin, and no real floor. Essentially, it was uneven planks of wood on the floor, walls and ceiling and a makeshift door.</p> <p>Karina took in my face and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Ritz, I admit, but it is a roof, my dear,\u201d she added sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll have Samuel bring your bags in for you. If you have no net, I can provide one for you.\u201d She swung me out onto the red dirt path and pointed to the door next door. \u201cYou share a wall with Dingane, but he\u2019s rarely there. Besides, both of you will be so busy and by the end of the day you\u2019ll be so exhausted, your room will be used for sleeping and not much else. Any noise won\u2019t bother you. You\u2019ll get used to the night noises here as well. \u201d</p><p>I gulped, not really sure I could get used to any of it: rooming next to someone who obviously found me repulsive, though I found myself a magnet to, \u201cnight noises\u201d or the exhaustion part.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten dinner?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I lied again. Too many butterflies had taken residence in my stomach anyway even if I had been hungry enough to eat.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked again, eyeing me like a mother hen.</p><p>\u201cYes, Karina.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes crinkled around a smile. \u201cCome. I shall show you the showers.\u201d</p><p>Karina led me outdoors and back toward the gate where I spied two square hut-like objects. When we came upon them, I noticed they were crawling with five-inch bugs I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I shouted, grabbing onto her arm. I stared at the extreme creatures with the same horror they presented themselves to me with. A land of extremes.</p><p>Karina giggled. \u201cThey won\u2019t bother you if you don\u2019t bother them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre-are they always there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, love but don\u2019t fret. You get used to them.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God, I\u2019m going to reek like a freak. I\u2019m never going to shower.</p><p>\u201cYou must shower, Sophie,\u201d Karina chimed in, revealing psychic abilities. \u201cThis land is not kind. You must wash regularly to keep yourself free of disease.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed audibly. \u201cOf-of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, we bed early here as we hardly ever have electricity and we like to rise with the sun. I suggest getting some sleep now. I would love to tell you that the water is warm most days but it is not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I studied the showers with a blank expression. I was essentially going to camp for six months.</p><p>When Karina led me back to my room, the sun had set completely.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Karina.\u201d</p><p>I walked into my room and almost screamed. Dingane stood there dropping one of my bags to the floor.</p><p>\u201cSamuel was busy,\u201d he said to explain his presence. He wanted it known that he didn\u2019t want to be there.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, thank you, Dingane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said, squeezing through the tiny room toward the door. I sat there swimming in the scent of his soap. It made me delirious. My Lord!</p><p>He turned around and stood a foot over me, almost skin to skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to lock your doors so no animals try to get in,\u201d he said and left me to the Ugandan night with the creak of my door slamming shut.</p><p>It echoed through me and I sat on my bed, not looking before I plopped myself down right on top of something slippery and moving. Naturally, I screamed and jumped. Dingane came running back into my room. Shirtless.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d I began but couldn\u2019t finish. I could only point to the long black thing slithering its way on my mattress.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s only a millipede. Archispirostreptus gigas, to be exact. Take care if you come in contact with one, avoid touching your eyes and lips. They can be harmful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it out,\u201d I told him, eyes clenched closed. I heard the door open and shut and when I opened my eyes, Dingane stood there staring at me like I was a fool. \u201cStop judging me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was judging?\u201d he lazily drawled. Broad, calloused hands rested on his narrow, exposed waist. I tried so hard not to look.</p><p>\u201cI know when someone is judging me. I can read people with impeccable accuracy. You\u2019re thinking this spoiled brat can\u2019t even handle a simple insect. How will she handle Africa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not an insect. It\u2019s an arthropod,\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a nerd then. Great, glad we\u2019ve established that.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was thinking that you were a spoiled brat who won\u2019t last two seconds here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened at his candid response. I was taken aback. My mouth gaped open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d I threatened, but it lost steam by the last word as he stared at me harshly.</p><p>Dingane rushed me in that moment and the movement stole my breath away. He loomed over me and I fought to keep my mouth closed. \u201cGirl, you are the epitome of spoiled. I can smell it in your expensive perfume, in the quality of your ridiculous clothing, in the bracelet wrapped \u2019round that delicate wrist.\u201d He closed the gap between us and all the air sucked from the room. \u201cYou won\u2019t last out here. You\u2019ll stay blind to the environment that surrounds you. You\u2019ll live in your clean, perfect bubble and return to your posh life come six months. You are....you. I know your kind. I\u2019ve seen it all before. You will never wake up. Not really,\u201d he explained away before backing up and leaving me to my room once again.</p><p>I felt tears burn but I steeled myself. My hand clamped my bracelet-covered wrist brutally and I shoved it down my fingers and let it fall to the floor. I yanked the bag I knew contained all my bedding onto the top of the mattress and unzipped it, removing all the contents I needed.</p><p>One goose down mattress cover.</p><p>One goose down duvet.</p><p>One goose down pillow.</p><p>One high-quality netted canopy.</p><p>One thousand thread count Egyptian cotton sheet set.</p><p>I looked down at my bedding and felt the urge to sob seep out of me. I stifled it with a hand across my mouth. I shook it away and stood on the mattress, hooking my canopy net to the hook on the ceiling before shaking out the rolled up mattress cover. I placed everything as it was meant to be, threw off my clothing, put on my pajamas and got into bed. I remembered the lady at the shops telling me to tuck the net into the mattress so I did as she instructed me to. I laid back on the impossibly soft bed and closed my eyes but all I could see was the little girl with the missing arm...</p><p>And cried in earnest.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>I slept horribly. Terrible thoughts swarmed through my head and it was cold. Horribly cold. Apparently Africa hadn\u2019t gotten the memo that it was August and fifty-degree nights shouldn\u2019t be possible. I tumbled out of bed after shaking out the bugs that had died in my net over the night. I peeked out my door and it looked like the sun was only just rising. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen the sun rise before and I watched as pinks and greens, yellows and oranges danced and disappeared over the incredible landscape.</p><p>I grabbed my shower caddy and robe and headed toward the showers just to the right of my little hut. I felt so incredibly alone there. I\u2019d always felt alone. My entire life, actually, but this was a loneliness that felt unbearable. I knew I could always find solace in Karina, but I wondered if she\u2019d be too busy to be the friend I needed though I didn\u2019t really deserve one. I knew that. Dingane was right. I was a spoiled, repulsive brat, but I\u2019d never had anyone actually tell me so before to my face. It felt like a slap, but I also felt relief, strangely, something I hadn\u2019t been expecting. I\u2019d never been told the truth so brutally before and it was releasing, not that I\u2019d tell Dingane that. Regardless, he was rude to me and that pissed me off beyond belief.</p><p>No one was out then that I could see and I was grateful that I\u2019d have some time to myself before I was thrown into whatever daunting situation I would inevitably be thrown into. I showered quickly and threw on my robe just as quickly, ready to haul ass back to my hut when I suddenly took notice there wasn\u2019t a single insect or arthropod in sight. Huh, was all I could intelligently piece together in that moment.</p><p>Back in my room, I dressed in jeans, boots and a fitted button-up, ready for work. I braided my hair in two French braids down the sides of my head, leaving my straight bangs to air dry over my forehead. I tidied as best I could, tucked in my canopy net and stood by the door, my hand clenched on the handle, frozen in absolute terror.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I stood there before I heard Karina\u2019s voice singing a sweet melody. I peered through the cracks of the wood in my door and watched her stroll my direction, in her hand was the hand of the little girl with the missing arm. I studied the girl, finally able to really look at her.</p><p>She was no more than three years old with big, round, beautiful brown eyes, perfectly white, straight teeth and a smile as wide as the Nile. They were singing and laughing together, throwing their hands back and forth without a care in the world. When they got close, I backed away, my calves catching on the foot of the bed letting me know I could go no further.</p><p>Karina knocked softly. \u201cSophie, sweetheart. Are you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-yes!\u201d I called out after a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to walk you to breakfast!\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOh okay,\u201d I said through the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>I stepped in front of the small square mirror that hung loosely above the sink basin and checked myself. Simple makeup. Simple hair. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever looked so droll before. I wanted to laugh at myself. I wouldn\u2019t dare walk into public back home looking like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened the door and filed out in front of my audience of two.</p><p>Karina gasped. \u201cOh, dear Lord, Sophie. You scared me. I didn\u2019t expect you to be up and ready so early.\u201d She laughed. She eyed me and her hands came to rest on her hips. \u201cWell, don\u2019t you look a sight! My dear, you are a breathtaking girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told her, knowing she was just being kind.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d she asked, grabbing my hand without asking. She started leading us to the second largest building on the property, just to the right of the main building, the center of the large half circle of buildings. To the right of the kitchens were the bathhouses. Just to the left of the main building and to the right of the remaining staff living quarters, was Charles and Karina\u2019s house I deduced. I could tell because it was a bit more established-looking over the other residential huts, had a proper roof as opposed to the thatched roofs of the other buildings. To the left of their house was what I assumed was Kate\u2019s and the other staff\u2019s double hut and to the left of those was mine and Dingane\u2019s. In the center of the property was the largest tree I\u2019d ever seen in my entire life.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of tree is that?\u201d I asked Karina, astonished that I was just then noticing it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a baobab tree,\u201d she smiled sweetly at me.</p><p>It looked like a giant bonsai, thick trunk, easily twenty feet around the base, and reached to impossible heights before its canopy shot flat and spread out to a radius of a hundred feet easily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, patting its trunk as we passed by it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been here. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalwart, is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Karina smiled at me. \u201cYes, much like my Charles.\u201d</p><p>I returned the easy smile and felt a little of my anxiety begin to melt away.</p><p>The kitchens were small and I wondered how they fed them all with such meager operations. I looked around me and saw tables overflowing with laughing children.</p><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cFifty-nine,\u201d she said succinctly. \u201cWe\u2019re only equipped to handle twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you manage?\u201d I asked quietly, taking in the expanse of children.</p><p>\u201cWe just do. Lots of faith, my love. It always works out in the end. Somehow. Somehow we turn thirty beds into sixty. Somehow we stretch our food to impossible measures. Somehow we survive on our impossibly meager income. Somehow we love them all equally. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed away my disbelief because there was proof in this pudding. Somehow they did it.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she began brightly, \u201cbreakfast will not be what you are expecting, I\u2019m guessing, but it\u2019s food nonetheless and you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d She looked at me then.</p><p>\u201cI keep saying that, don\u2019t I?\u201d She laughed loudly. \u201cPoor dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d I told her sincerely as I watched a little boy with one hand try to steady his bowl.</p><p>Suddenly, Dingane came from out of nowhere. I hadn\u2019t been prepared to see him yet and my chest felt like it was hit with the atom bomb. My veins ran warmly all over my body and my face flushed. I watched as he placed what appeared to be a little scrap of rubber underneath the boy\u2019s bowl. It didn\u2019t budge from its place and the boy looked on Dingane with a brilliant smile. I felt an incredible urge to hug both boys, maybe Dingane a little closer than was socially acceptable. My blood ran hot in that moment. What the hell is wrong with me?</p> <p>\u201cSit, my dear,\u201d Karina said, pointing to a chair at a table near the door. \u201cThat\u2019s where the adults sit unless one of the children needs us, which is nearly all the time,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you your plate this morning. At lunch, just walk up to the window and Kate will hand you your meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Karina.\u201d</p><p>I sat at the table and the little girl with the missing arm came up to me. \u201cHi,\u201d she said sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cYou speak English?\u201d I asked her, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cKarina teach me,\u201d she answered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She touched the middle of her chest with her remaining hand and answered, \u201cMandisa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s-It\u2019s nice to meet you, Mandisa,\u201d I told the baby girl, awkwardly tripping on my words. I was so unaccustomed to talking to children, let alone an amputee.</p><p>She smiled at me and picked up the hand I had resting on my leg. I began to pull the hand back but something in her eyes told me it was okay, that she was just a human girl, and a beautiful one at that.</p><p>I tentatively squeezed her little hand and she giggled, sending a warm, tingling sensation up my arm and into my heart.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten, Mandisa?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>The smile dropped from her face and she ran off, disappearing behind the kitchen doors.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d I asked the air in front of me, stunned she\u2019d fled.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t eat,\u201d I heard a voice say from behind me. Dingane. My blood began to boil once more.</p><p>I turned toward him. \u201cWhat do you mean she doesn\u2019t eat? How does she stay alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drinks. For days after she first arrived we couldn\u2019t even get her to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked him as he sat across from me.</p><p>\u201cWe thought it was because she was recovering from the loss of her arm but later discovered it is because she misses her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her mother?\u201d I asked, exponentially afraid to hear his answer.</p><p>His eyes met mine for the first time that morning and his lips tightened, his shoulders shrugged in answer and my stomach fell to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWe supplement milk with all sorts of proteins and vitamins, but she\u2019s still not gaining weight the way we need her to.\u201d</p><p>Dingane turned from me and spotted a child who needed help. I have no idea how he saw but he did. He stood and helped a little boy who couldn\u2019t reach his chair to sit with only one leg. I watched him. He didn\u2019t put the boy in the chair like I assumed he would but helped him discover how to do it on his own.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d I asked Dingane when he sat down again.</p><p>\u201cThere is an incredibly evil man named Joseph Kony who roams south Sudan and northern Uganda in search of children to create his child army called the LRA or Lord\u2019s Resistance Army. He invades innocent villages, takes young women for obvious reasons, attempts to kidnap their children. If the children refuse to come with him, they chop off a limb to prevent them from being able to grow into a useful soldier that can oppose him later. He kills their parents and we\u2019re sent the orphans who survive, broken and damaged and all alone.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed down the lump that had grown in my throat. \u201cWhy does he do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he even knows. He claims to fight for peace and security in Uganda as well as for the impoverished. These are his proclamations, but he just works for the devil, in my opinion. He is the ultimate in evil.\u201d</p><p>I examined the tiny faces that surrounded me and felt so incredibly sad for them and their fates. I wanted to respond to everything Dingane had revealed to me, but I couldn\u2019t. There was nothing to say.</p><p>After breakfast, Dingane told me I needed to follow him.</p><p>\u201cThe children usually retrieve their school things right now. Karina, Kate and I teach them from eight to two in the afternoon while Charles and occasionally I make repairs or preparations for the day\u2019s activities. Wednesdays, I\u2019m in charge of doing some sort of outdoor activity with them during school hours. Unfortunately, you\u2019ve been assigned to me at Karina\u2019s insistence, so you\u2019ll be accompanying me all day every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so unfortunate,\u201d I spit back sarcastically.</p><p>Dingane stopped short between the baobab tree and our huts. \u201cI don\u2019t like you. Is this such a surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, yes, it is,\u201d I told him candidly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you see, I do. I know you quite well. I know you\u2019re here because you were caught with cocaine twice. I recognized immediately the type of person you were before you even arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was caught with cocaine. I admit it, freely. I\u2019m not proud of it, God knows, but I also knew coming in here everyone would be aware of why I was forced to be here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced,\u201d he repeated, stopping me midsentence and closing in narrowly.</p><p>\u201cAnother reason why I\u2019d be just as satisfied if you hopped right back on that plane. Every single soul here is present because they want to be. You\u2019re only serving a sentence.\u201d</p><p>My breath rushed in and out of me in heady anger. \u201cAll the same,\u201d I gritted. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you got off your self-righteous pedestal and came back down to earth. I\u2019m here to work. So let\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the moment I realized that my attitude about feeling like being sent to Masego was the most unfair punishment in the world had disappeared the second I\u2019d laid eyes on Mandisa. It surprised me, shocked me, to be honest, but that didn\u2019t mean I was going to enjoy my work at Masego. It only meant that while I was there, I wouldn\u2019t feel as if a gross injustice had been performed against me. All I had to do was remind myself of Mandisa\u2019s story.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d a pissed-off Dingane ordered. He led me to his side of the hut and I followed him inside.</p><p>His bed looked plain and barely able to contain him, but his walls were covered in an eclectic assortment of belongings from pictures the children had drawn him to an acoustic guitar.</p><p>He slid a large tub out from underneath his bed and grabbed a stack of papers I\u2019d seen in the back of the jeep when he\u2019d picked me up from the airport.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWorksheets. Any time I\u2019m in town, I try to get as many as possible.\u201d</p><p>We walked to the classrooms and my heart started to beat erratically. I was nervous, really nervous. I wondered if the kids would see right through me, if they knew what a fraud I really was, that I had no business helping them, as I was the worst person I knew.</p><p>The door opened and I saw twenty smiling faces, happy and giggling. They fell quiet as soon as Dingane and I entered the room. I gulped. Audibly.</p><p>\u201cStudents, you\u2019ve met Miss Price\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cThey can call me Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Dingane narrowed his eyes at me for interrupting but continued, \u201cYou may call her Miss Price. Should we try to speak English today? To make her more comfortable?\u201d he asked them kindly.</p><p>Oh, I see, I thought. They get Dr. Jekyll and I get Mr. Hyde.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Aberdeen!\u201d they all chimed in wildly.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve brought the new worksheets from town and I\u2019d like to start on these first. Oliver?\u201d he asked a little boy in the front row.</p><p>The boy got up quickly and began passing the worksheets around.</p><p>Dingane closed the distance between us and I couldn\u2019t help how much more nervous his proximity made me. Tried as I did, I could not get over how attractive I found him. \u201cThink you can handle math?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d I sneered.</p><p>\u201cAre you capable?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but I attended the most elite prep school in my area and I graduated with honors, not that that\u2019s any of your business. So, yes, I believe I am capable of handling third-grade math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. All I want you to do is circle the desks and make sure they\u2019re grasping the lesson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try, your majesty.\u201d And that earned me an eye roll that simultaneously made me want to slap him and kiss him.</p><p>\u201cToday we\u2019ll continue with equations and variables.\u201d I turned, expecting them all to groan and whine the way my classrooms back home would, but I looked at the little faces and saw nothing but excited anticipation.</p><p>They like learning.</p><p>I listened as Dingane taught them how to solve for \u201cx\u201d in a simple variable and tried so hard not to let myself get distracted by his hands as they moved fluidly over the chalkboard. When the lesson was over, he and I both awkwardly danced around the other in attempt to avoid being near each other as we circled the desks. I\u2019d barely avoided him when I noticed a little girl twirling her pencil in her hand and blankly staring at her desk.</p><p>I bent and sat on my heels next to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked too harshly. I cleared my throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked as sweetly as I could.</p> <p>\u201cI do not understand,\u201d she stated clearly, no emotion in her voice.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said leaning over her a little, \u201clet\u2019s try together then.\u201d</p><p>She scooted nearer to her paper and readied her pencil. \u201cOkay,\u201d I continued, \u201cthe equation reads, solve for \u2018r\u2019 when three times \u2018r\u2019 is twenty-four. Let\u2019s imagine \u2018r\u2019 is a number. What number multiplied by three will get you twenty-four?\u201d</p><p>I could hear her saying her times tables under her breath and when she got to her answer, she blurted, \u201cEight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d I told her. \u201cI wanted this to be simple for you to understand. Do you understand what they were trying to get from you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sophie,\u201d she said, making my heart race at the mention of my name.</p> <p>\u201cO-Okay,\u201d I stumbled out, swallowing hard. \u201cNow that we know what they were trying to get from us, let\u2019s apply Dingane\u2019s method. Shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we know that three multiplied by eight yields us twenty-four, then twenty-four divided by three gets us eight or twenty-four divided by eight gets us three, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if three multiplied by \u2018r\u2019 is twenty-four, then we can take three from this side of the equation and divide twenty-four by it and that will yield us \u2018r.\u2019 What would we do if there was a division sign on this side of the equation?\u201d I asked, pointing to the left side of the equation.</p><p>\u201cWe would multiply the number by the answer to get our variable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my word, you\u2019re a genius!\u201d I told her, squeezing her hand.</p><p>She beamed at me. \u201cI understand now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d I told her and I was. Happy. Truly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Namono.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Namono.\u201d</p><p>She surprised me by throwing her arms around my neck. A swelling sensation invaded my heart and I\u2019d no idea what it was but it was a good hurt, a hurt that felt worthwhile. I smiled at myself before looking up. Dingane stood at the far corner of the classroom, peering my direction, but I couldn\u2019t read his expression. My face flamed a bright red and I turned slightly into Namono to hide my reaction. Although I could no longer see him, his eyes still felt heavy on my head and shoulders. What I wouldn\u2019t have given to read his thoughts in that moment.</p><p>The rest of the morning was full of math, math and more math. At lunch, I waited in line a few children down from Dingane. Namono held my hand while the other children bombarded me with questions.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d a little boy asked.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia. Do you know where that is?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, squinting his eyes as if he could imagine it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll show you when we return to the classroom.\u201d He was satisfied with that answer.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a mother and father?\u201d another little boy asked.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I looked up and noticed Dingane had tilted his head, listening in.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they like?\u201d he continued, while the others\u2019 eyes were rapt with attention.</p><p>\u201cThey are nice,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cAre you married?\u201d a little girl chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDingane is not married either,\u201d she added for good measure.</p><p>I almost fell over in laughter when Dingane\u2019s shoulders tensed.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Dingane stopped breathing altogether and I stifled the snort threatening to escape.</p><p>\u201cHe says he will never marry,\u201d one little girl answered.</p><p>\u201cNever marry. How interesting. Do you think it is because no girl will have him?\u201d I teased.</p><p>He turned around then and shot me a look to kill, but I just shrugged my shoulders in question.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered, \u201che is handsome enough.\u201d No kidding, kid. \u201cI think it is because he doesn\u2019t think he deserves to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s enough!\u201d Dingane said, parting through the line of children before us like he was Moses and they were the Red Sea. \u201cI have to talk to Miss Price. Excuse us.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cHe likes Sophie,\u201d the little boy who had asked where I was from proclaimed, making me want to squeal in happiness at Dingane\u2019s obvious want to squirm.</p><p>I looked up at him as he led me away, but he refused to acknowledge me.</p><p>\u201cHe does? I do not think so,\u201d Namono added.</p><p>\u201cYes, he stared at her in class all morning.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped open at Dingane and he closed his eyes tightly before focusing them on me.</p><p>\u201cI did not stare at you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said I thought her the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen, I asked if he agreed and he nodded his head yes,\u201d the little boy added for confirmation.</p><p>Dingane led me to the front of the line. \u201cTwo, Katie,\u201d he asked and she handed over two plates of rice and beans. I took one and he forced me to a table by the door.</p><p>We sat down and I just stared at him as he began to eat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I told him, digging in myself.</p><p>\u201cI was not staring at you,\u201d he told his plate.</p><p>I leaned over. \u201cDid you hear that, Dingane\u2019s lunch? He was not staring at you.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me crossly. \u201cI was not staring at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was merely explaining that Henry was exaggerating. I did not stare at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I stated, implying in my tone that he had done just that.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I-I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI may have looked at you a few times to make sure you were doing your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I certainly wasn\u2019t staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve established that you were not staring.\u201d</p><p>He breathed deeply a few times, his eyes burning into mine. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d definitely been staring. The butterflies in my stomach fluttered and flew.</p><p>When lunch was over, I circled the children\u2019s desks while Dingane taught penmanship, which was both in English and what I\u2019d learned was Bantu. He then taught geography, where I got a chance to show Henry and all the children where California was, science, and we ended the day with an hour of reading then discussing what they\u2019d read.</p><p>All in all, I was impressed with the day\u2019s activities and knew those kids were actually learning valuable lessons they could take and create lives with. After school was out, all the kids congregated in the courtyard under the baobab tree and played football with a ball that had almost completely deflated. My heart hurt a little when I saw that. I saw a flock of girls building little dolls out of straw. They had obviously zero interest in playing soccer and that made me laugh.</p><p>Dingane caught my attention and pointed away from the children. \u201cKate, Joseph and Ruth will watch them before dinner. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur day has only begun,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cWho are the others I saw this morning around Masego?\u201d I asked as Dingane took me outside the fenced property.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Kate. Joseph does maintenance and guards at night occasionally when it\u2019s needed. Ruth heads the kitchen and she and Mercy, who only works part-time, care for the laundry, which is quite a task. Ruth is married to Solomon, who does maintenance and helps guard as well. They have two kids, Sharon and Isaac. They have their own home just off property.\u201d</p><p>Dingane stopped and cupped his hand over his eyes to see farther toward a grove of trees. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll have to get my jeep,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I followed him to his jeep and hopped in. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got a call yesterday that there were men loitering around that grove of trees,\u201d he said pointing off into the distance, \u201cnear our swimming hole. We\u2019re going to see if the rumors are true, to check for tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re Lord\u2019s Resistance Army soldiers, they could be scoping us out, or they could have been men just looking for shade and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe LRA wear boots that most here cannot afford. It\u2019s a good indicator.\u201d</p><p>We stumbled along uneven terrain and I had to keep myself from sliding into Dingane\u2019s hip several times. Finally, we came to a stop just inside the canopy of trees. Dingane reached over my lap and my blood began to boil before running ice cold when the gun he\u2019d pulled from his glove compartment came into view.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese men, if they\u2019re still here, could be armed, Sophie. I can\u2019t take any chances.\u201d He checked to see if the gun was loaded and an audible clicking sound resounded around my head when it clicked back into place.</p><p>I gulped and got out, not too subtly siding closely to Dingane as we started to examine the outer perimeter.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said quietly five minutes later. Adrenaline shot through me at an astronomical rate and I grabbed his arm, pressing myself into his side.</p><p>\u201cWh-where?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to a small cluster of plant life near the ground and a mud outline of a large boot print shone between.</p><p>\u201cJesus! What does this mean?\u201d I asked him, my nails accidentally digging into his arm. He looked down at my hand but didn\u2019t say a word. I lightened my hold.</p><p>\u201cIt means they were most likely LRA.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe men will have to take shifts over the next few days to watch for them. Hopefully they were just passing through and have no business with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what if they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray they don\u2019t,\u201d was all he replied.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything?\u201d Charles asked as we exited the jeep.</p> <p>Karina came to my side smiling and opened the door for me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boot prints,\u201d Dingane explained.</p><p>Karina\u2019s smile fell but quickly picked back up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to set watch times then,\u201d Charles said, walking off with Dingane toward his house.</p><p>Karina slid her arm through mine.</p> <p>\u201cKate and the others will be watching the children at dinner tonight. I thought we\u2019d do something special for your arrival. I\u2019ve made dinner for you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Karina,\u201d I said, but kept an eye on Charles and Dingane talking animatedly on the front porch. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Karina brought me up her little porch and the men stopped talking. The tension was palpable but Karina forced me through it and we entered the door.</p><p>Karina\u2019s little house was beyond charming. It was fairly bare, but the few things she did have, you could tell, meant a lot to her. Lots of old quilts, an entire living room set that looked like it came out of the fifties but was in good shape, well maintained. She had at least a million pictures of beautiful, smiling faces. I studied them one by one.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d I asked her when I came upon one of a small boy with Charles and Karina who looked to be in their twenties. I was right, of course, she was unbelievably gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s Isaac. He was our first boy here.\u201d She started laughing and shook her head. \u201cHe was so mischievous and we had absolutely no idea what we were doing.\u201d She picked the frame up and studied it. \u201cHe\u2019s like a son to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cAmerica. We helped him, or rather Harrison helped him, get there. He educated himself and now he sends us a monthly stipend that helps feeds the children here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered more to myself than to Karina.</p><p>\u201cHe is a very good boy. Married now, though I\u2019ve never met his wife. They have a little girl themselves. It\u2019s all very lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds it,\u201d I told her honestly. I thought on something. \u201cDoes Pembrook often help you get children over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot count the number of times Harrison has either helped adopt them out or helped them emigrate.\u201d</p><p>I wondered why Pembrook had never talked about that before. I wondered if he thought me too selfish to bring the subject up at all. That thought sent me down a shame spiral I needed to sit from so I plopped myself on one of Karina\u2019s chairs.</p><p>Charles and Karina\u2019s house was essentially one giant room. The living area was at the door. The little dining area and kitchen were at the back and shared a space with the living. The only rooms I could see not part of the main room were the bedroom and bathroom and I assumed those were off to the side through the only doors I could recognize besides the front door. All in all, the entire house looked to be a thousand square feet, about the size of my parent\u2019s pantry back home and yet they were the most happy people I\u2019d ever had the pleasure of meeting.</p> <p>I watched Karina, Charles and Dingane spill into the tiny dining area set next to the miniscule kitchen, smelled the wonderful aroma of whatever garlic-infused dish Karina was cooking and pondered over their simple yet incredibly complicated lives. One thing I could say for certain was they were infinitely more content than I\u2019d ever felt my entire life.</p><p>Dingane, laughing boisterously, broke me from my revelry.</p><p>\u201cCome join us, Sophie,\u201d Karina said, patting the chair beside her and opposite Dingane.</p><p>I hoisted myself up and stumbled to the chair feeling the day\u2019s work in my back and legs. I smiled at them as I sat.</p><p>\u201cWe were laughing at a very old story,\u201d Charles offered to bring me into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYes, old but very sweet,\u201d Karina chimed in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the story of how they met,\u201d Dingane said, surprising me. My head whipped his direction and I watched his eyes light up as he looked on the two of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Charles smiled at his wife. \u201cKarina was desperately in love with me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie!\u201d Karina exclaimed, giggling like a schoolgirl. \u201cYou always make me out to be this silly creature and I wasn\u2019t.\u201d She turned my direction and sobered. \u201cCharles exaggerates. I was not in love with him. In fact, it was quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit it without hesitation. I was most decidedly in love with Karina Smith from the second I laid eyes on her,\u201d Charles added.</p><p>\u201cSmith?\u201d Dingane asked. \u201cWas that your maiden name, Karina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I was a grade lower than Charles. He and I met at a church function for teens and he politely introduced himself. I had no idea he attended school with me, I just figured he was a local boy, but when he informed me we had chemistry together I was wracking my brain trying to remember him. I told him finally, \u2018You\u2019re not in my chemistry class.\u2019 To which he replied dryly, \u2018I beg to differ.\u2019\u201d</p><p>So Charles was witty.</p><p>\u201cI pretended to be offended,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut secretly was dying to swoon on the inside. Every day he would meet me at the front doors of school, but I would diligently ignore him, even going so far as to take alternate routes, but he always found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was relentless,\u201d Charles added.</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Karina sighed. \u201cI may have been attracted to Charles, but there was nothing I could do about it. I wasn\u2019t allowed to date. My father would have killed me, but Charles was so dogged in his insistence that one day I agreed to meet him at a nearby ice cream shop. I had planned to tell him that he was very kind, that I found him to be a sweet boy, but I could not date so he might as well fixate his obsession on another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo which he refused and probably pursued you with even more fervor,\u201d I stated.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you eventually gave in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. Look at him. Who could refuse?\u201d she asked, smoothing Charles\u2019 cheek over with her thumb.</p><p>I watched Dingane smile at the older couple and wondered about his own parents. Mine would never be as sweet or as loving as Charles and Karina and I decided right then and there that I would be gobbling them up as long as I had the opportunity. I would learn from them. I would study them. I would endeavor to be like them.</p><p>Dinner tasted amazing and I hadn\u2019t realized just how hungry I\u2019d been. I ate more than my fair share and then immediately felt guilty thinking about Mandisa. The conversation was lively between myself, Charles and Karina or between Dingane, Charles and Karina but the conversation between Dingane and myself was practically nonexistent. A \u201cpass the blank\u201d here or a \u201chand me that\u201d there.</p><p>Karina cleared the plates and a hormonal rage built in my stomach as I watched Dingane fold his napkin on the table over and over and over, creasing each fold tightly with nimble fingers. I wanted to rip it out of his hands, clear the table and attack him with my mouth. How can someone bug the shit out of you so much yet simultaneously cause you to want to know them intimately with your tongue? He was driving me crazy.</p><p>We all said our goodbyes on the porch and Karina kissed my cheek after I thanked her for dinner.</p><p>As soon as my head hit my pillow, I dreamt of Dingane\u2019s ridiculous hands.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>I woke to someone shaking me.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d I heard someone whisper. \u201cGet up,\u201d they said, shaking me more harshly.</p><p>I whimpered as I turned around. \u201cDingane?\u201d I asked, sitting up and smoothing the hair from my face.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain in the truck. We don\u2019t have time. Get dressed and meet me outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I asked, throwing back my net.</p><p>\u201cJust past midnight.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he left me to myself, my creaky door swinging shut behind him.</p><p>I stood and immediately began brushing my teeth while I dressed, spit, rinsed and tied my hair in a ponytail. It was the fastest I\u2019d ever gotten ready, not a stitch of makeup or even a brush through my tangled locks.</p><p>I rushed through my door, tucking my shirt into my belted jeans. I reached Charles, Karina and Dingane and bent to tie my boots.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t,\u201d Karina said, wringing her hands.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Charles said, soothing his wife. \u201cWe\u2019ll need you here to prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I demanded, standing up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been an attack on a village two and a half hours from here and there are children who need rescuing still. We\u2019re afraid the LRA will come back for them,\u201d Dingane said.</p><p>\u201cThen we go to them,\u201d I said without thinking, surprising myself.</p><p>\u201cI cannot send you out to that, Sophie,\u201d Karina added quickly.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to stay here, Sophie,\u201d Charles explained. \u201cTo prepare a small medical ward. We\u2019ve heard it\u2019s many more children than we\u2019re handled to equip on a moment\u2019s whim. She\u2019s the only other one of us trained medically beside myself, but we need at least four in the truck and one of those should be trained. Kate and Ruth are needed here and Mercy cannot be fetched for some time. I\u2019m asking for your help. Can you handle it?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d I said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled then,\u201d Dingane said after examining me for a moment and headed toward the truck after picking up a large container setting at his feet.</p><p>Charles rushed off to fetch something and Karina stuck to my side, taking my hands in hers. \u201cThe men will not prepare you for this, Sophie, so I feel I must. What you\u2019re about to encounter will revolt you. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I want you to steel yourself. Put all emotion toward the back of your mind. Get in there, get them out and come back in one piece. I\u2019m relying on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I told her, swallowing the knot that had formed so rigidly in my throat.</p><p>Karina ran toward the schoolhouse, shouting at everyone who had begun to run around in preparation to receive the children I would be helping bring back. I ran to the truck and Dingane had opened my door for me, allowing me to slide in without a moment to lose. Charles and Solomon jumped in the back, armed to the nines and I almost burst out sobbing. Fear, real fear crept through my body at an alarming rate.</p><p>Dingane\u2019s engine rumbled into the otherwise quiet night. and I jumped inside my skin, burying my hands in my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I asked as we tumbled through the large gates. I turned around and saw them close behind me.</p><p>\u201cThey were attacked in the night, unprepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many survivors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not really sure. We\u2019ve been told only to hurry and that there may be more than nearby aid may be able to handle.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed audibly, turning toward Dingane. His eyes met mine briefly and they were alive, full of anxiety and fear. \u201cI will never be able to forget what I am about to see, am I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said quietly, turning toward me again.</p><p>The remaining two-and-a-half-hour drive was met with silence. Thoughts circled my head and I tried so hard to imagine, to prepare myself for what I was about to witness but nothing could have readied me.</p><p>I smelled the burnt straw of the village homes before I actually saw them and it enveloped the cab, making me cough violently. Dingane threw a t-shirt at me to cover my face so I did. Finally, after rounding the bush that the little village must have tucked itself into in attempt to camouflage themselves, little piles of remaining flames flickered and twisted throughout the open field before us. I saw no one but heard faint screams and wails tear throughout the night. My gut tightened and my hands gripped the dash in front of me, my knuckles white with strain.</p><p>Dingane stopped the truck abruptly and ran into the center of the village. I jumped out and followed suit behind Charles and Solomon but stopped short at the terrifying sight before me.</p> <p>Groups of small children sporadically spread throughout the camp, bent and weeping, cried into the night over the corpses of their burning parents. I immediately fell to my knees in want to vomit but could only dry heave at the sheer horror. The smell of burning flesh seared into my own and I had to cover my mouth in terror.</p><p>\u201cSophie!\u201d someone screamed harshly beside me. I looked up toward the voice and Dingane stood above me. He grabbed my arms, picking me up and brought me close to his face. \u201cCan you do this?\u201d he asked but his eyes were sympathetic. He brushed a tear away with his thumb but one more fell in its place.</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d I sputtered, pushing all emotion away, thinking on Karina\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d he yelled over the blazing fires and bawling children.</p><p>\u201cBut they need help,\u201d I hiccupped, pointing to the boys and girls sprawled in panic around us.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we will get to them, but we must tend to the hurt now. They\u2019re priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I told him, racing beside him toward what looked like a felled little girl around seven.</p><p>We passed Charles pumping a woman\u2019s chest up and down to get her to breathe again and I quickly inhaled a sharp breath. Dingane and I both fell to our knees beside the little girl; her tunic was covered in splatters of blood across her chest.</p><p>Dingane pulled it back and exposed the wound. Small holes peppered her torso and they appeared to go deeper than anything considered superficial.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease, tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bandage her tightly. Here, press this gauze here,\u201d he told me and turned toward the kit I\u2019d seen him carry earlier.</p> <p>As he rummaged through it, I pressed the gauze tightly against her bleeding wounds and bent over her tiny head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I soothed, knowing damn well it would never be for her again, even if she lived.</p><p>My free hand ran across her baby cheeks. Sticky tears mixed with red dirt stained that innocent part of her. Dingane added more gauze to the wound and I sat opposite him, trading the wrap and covering the girl\u2019s torso carefully. I know we had hurt her every time we had to lift her small frame to allow the bandage to wrap around completely but not a single whimper was heard from her lips and all I wanted was to gather her in my arms because of it.</p><p>Dingane picked her up carefully and brought her to the back of the truck, laying her down across a blanket then covered her up with another. He spoke to her in Bantu and I guessed he\u2019d assured her we\u2019d return because she nodded once.</p><p>We ran back toward the village and found two more children in dire need of attention. We wrapped them, transported them to the truck and went back over and over. We\u2019d tended to six wounded children within half an hour.</p><p>Dingane pointed toward a cluster of children nearest us and we ran toward them, calling them toward us and encouraging them to get into the truck quickly. Most obeyed save for one who refused to leave his father\u2019s side. Dingane pulled the small child off his dead father and wrapped his arms around the young boy, speaking into his ear as tears streamed down his tiny face. I couldn\u2019t help the tears that fell quickly on my own as we gathered more and more motherless children. I counted twenty-three orphans in all, not including the ones who had died during the ambush.</p><p>I looked around for the woman Charles had attempted to save, but she was nowhere in the truck and I filed that away under \u201cnever think about again.\u201d Not a single adult had survived, the LRA had made sure of that.</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave!\u201d Charles yelled over the crying children.</p> <p>He and Solomon hopped onto the bumper of the truck and held on tightly.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to hold on the entire two hours like that!\u201d I yelled at Dingane.</p><p>His tired face found mine over the grouped children. \u201cThey will. We\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p><p>And it hit me.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. These attacks happened frequently, always targeting innocent families, always leaving children in an already impoverished nation without anyone to care for them.</p><p>\u201cGet in, Sophie!\u201d he yelled and I obeyed. He laid a small boy in my lap and I cradled him as best I could, trying to decide which way would be best to hold him that would afford him the least amount of pain.</p><p>Dingane shoved two more dazed children between us and got in, starting his truck and tearing away from the scene with decided purpose.</p><p>\u201cThe LRA is coming back?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey usually do. They use the leftover children as bait. They know we come in search of them.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head toward the window and let the tears fall freely, the most I\u2019d ever allowed, and the absolutely only time I\u2019d ever cried and had a genuine right to.</p><p>Because I wasn\u2019t crying for myself. I was crying for the innocents.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>The gates opened as if in anticipation of our arrival around four forty-five in the morning, the sun had yet to rise and I found myself begging its return. The night I once found unbelievably peaceful and beautiful now felt unbearably dark, as if a decided lack of hope had enveloped us. As we passed, Kate and Mercy were on the other side, closing us in and running our direction. Dingane tore through and stopped abruptly, close to the schoolhouse, his headlights lighting up the baobab tree as we passed.</p><p>He ran to my side and took the little boy from my arms, running him inside. I gathered one of the girls, who\u2019d grown unconscious during the ride back to Masego, and carried her behind him. He passed me again after dropping off the boy and gathered the remaining girl in the front.</p><p>Charles and Solomon were carrying those who could not walk on their own and within a minute we were all inside, hovering over children.</p><p>\u201cSophie, grab that bag for me!\u201d Karina ordered, pointing to a bag on the creaky wood floor.</p><p>I brought it to her and opened it up. She was working on the first girl Dingane and I had helped, the one riddled with holes in the chest. She was unconscious. Karina stood quickly and ran to a drawer of a metal cabinet she had rolled into the room. Makeshift cots dotted the entire room and each bed was filled with a bleeding child.</p><p>She returned, ripping open a paper and plastic envelope carrying an IV.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your help removing the shrapnel,\u201d Karina said dryly.</p><p>I looked behind me to see who she was talking to but there was no one there, everyone else was busy over the beds of one of the children. I looked back and saw her eyes trained on me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWash your hands with Hibiclens. There\u2019s a station set up there,\u201d she said, gesturing to a corner of the room.</p><p>The room was awash in candlelight since there wasn\u2019t any electricity and I could barely see a thing. They need a generator for these situations!</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t Charles help you with this? He\u2019s trained!\u201d I was panicking.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with another child, Sophie. It will be fine. Trust me. She\u2019s bleeding out as we speak though.\u201d</p><p>I ran to the corner and washed my hands, one of the older orphans there stood next to me, ready to rinse for me into the awaiting bowl. She handed me a box of older-looking latex gloves and I took two, putting them on as I walked back to Karina\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpread this wound open for me. I can\u2019t seem to reach the metal inside.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. Oh my God.</p><p>I leaned over the girl and reluctantly pulled the wound as wide as I could. Karina\u2019s tweezers were ready and dove in without hesitation, digging back and forth, making me cringe. She pulled out a large piece of sharp metal and it clinked into a porcelain bowl on a small table beside the bed. One by one she removed the metal embedded in the girl\u2019s tiny chest.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more.\u201d She pointed to another deep wound near the heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s too deep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpread the wound.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed and almost had to avert my eyes at the blood gushing but held my ground. After what seemed like forever, Karina fished out a small but substantial piece of metal and it clinked audibly next to the other shrapnel.</p><p>Karina worked steadily, stitching each wound, as I cut strips of clean gauze and readied the iodine solution. She poured the solution over the stitches, covered them all with an antibacterial ointment and we placed the gauze over each one, finally wrapping the girl\u2019s frame similarly to how Dingane and I had at the village.</p><p>When we were done, Karina gave her a renewed dose of sleeping meds through her IV and I stood, removed my bloody gloves, tossed them in a bin and walked into the night air. The sun wouldn\u2019t show its face for at least another hour. I begged for it to rise, to renew the day, to erase the night. The screams would live in my subconscious for the rest of my life.</p><p>Sweat poured from my face and neck and drenched my shirt; it clung to my body. The panicked adrenaline was leaving in droves and my hands were shaking with the release.</p><p>I heard footsteps on the wood creak behind me. I turned to find Dingane, his white linen shirt had three buttons unbuttoned near his collar instead of his standard two and his usual carefully rolled sleeves were in disarray.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked about our little girl.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d I paused. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. I didn\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>Dingane leaned against one of the wood posts holding up the aluminum awning and nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow often does this happen?\u201d I asked him, staring at the dark outline of the baobab tree.</p><p>\u201cToo often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can they not be stopped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are illusive and they get protection from Northern Sudan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows. They\u2019re evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d I looked behind me into the schoolhouse. \u201cHow are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe there will be no more death tonight,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>I exhaled the breath I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been holding and quiet tears began to fall. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for them.\u201d</p><p>Before the last word had even escaped my lips, the orphans in their beds above the kitchen, the original fifty-nine, began chanting their beautiful traditional songs and this made the tears fall even harder. I had no idea what they were singing, but their innocent voices rang throughout the camp and I couldn\u2019t help but take solace in them. I listened for quite some time while the tears streamed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d be asleep by now. It\u2019s close to six in the morning,\u201d I said, turning to Dingane.</p><p>\u201cThey couldn\u2019t sleep I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d I said, looking back up at their windows.</p><p>After a few minutes of beautiful song backed by a symphony of singing insects and night animals, I turned back to Dingane. \u201cWhy do they do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it brings them joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is there to be joyful about?\u201d I asked honestly, thinking on the images of dead children curled into themselves at the village. Another burst of silent tears streamed down.</p><p>\u201cLife, Sophie. They still live. They breathe, they love each other, they find joy in the world around them for no other reason than because they are children. They are resilient. They will always rise above. Always. It is a curious facet of the innocent young.</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t seen it before with my own eyes, I never would have believed it. Cynicism comes with the harshness of the world and only as you get older. I\u2019d give anything to have their inherent happiness.\u201d</p><p>Dingane turned toward me and I toward him, leaning on the post beside him. We stared at one another for a moment and a sense of understanding passed between us. I didn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d ever like me, but after the night we\u2019d experienced, I did believe he would be more tolerant of me.</p> <p>\u201cYou two should get some sleep,\u201d Charles said, breaking the trance between Dingane and me.</p><p>\u201cYou and Karina should sleep. I can stay with them. They\u2019ll sleep as well,\u201d Dingane told him.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d I added and Dingane whipped his head toward mine, nodding slightly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cancel classes tomorrow,\u201d Charles said when Karina met his side. \u201cSophie and Dingane will watch them for a few hours. We can have Ruth and Solomon relieve them after breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Karina nodded and both slumped toward their cabin. Dingane sat in the doorway and I followed his example, sitting against the pole opposite him, both our legs spread out before us. I crossed mine at the ankles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check them every few minutes,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Karina had sedatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the last of our supply. I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019ll be able to replenish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a regular supplier?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dingane smiled softly sending butterflies in my stomach fluttering, the basic attraction I held for him not being able to be denied despite our current situation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that, though I wish we did.\u201d</p><p>I just couldn\u2019t imagine that this very desperate place couldn\u2019t get aid from western civilization.</p><p>\u201cUganda is a forgotten place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUganda, South Sudan, Kenya, Africa, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cTwo reasons. People think this, our predicament, is an exaggeration or they\u2019re in total denial. Pretending it doesn\u2019t exist allows for a light conscience.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed at that in disbelief but then thought on it. I\u2019d never really heard of these places save for the occasional TV ad asking/imploring people for aid. I never thought twice about it. Ashamed, I turned my head.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other?\u201d I asked him directly after gathering my guilt.</p><p>\u201cThey assume someone will take care of it, their governments really, but all they need to do is take the problem into their own hands. Governments are unreliable, corrupt entities. It will only be solved by the hands of many. Thousands of small pebbles, giant splash and all that.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a moment and the night air was filled with those singing insects again.</p><p>\u201cOnce, I took this social studies class,\u201d I told him. \u201cIn it, we read this story about this woman attacked in an alleyway in New York City.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the particulars. Anyway, the gist of it was that many people watched the attack from their windows and assumed someone else called the police and the woman died there, waiting for help.\u201d</p><p>Dingane lifted his shoulders in acknowledgement, his beautiful, tanned hands lifted as if in explanation.</p><p>I remembered the visions of dead children again and turned my head to avoid the humiliation of Dingane seeing the tears fall. I twisted back when he nudged my foot with his.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a weakness,\u201d he stated simply, his arms folded tightly against his torso.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d I blubbered, wiping my face with dirty hands.</p><p>\u201cFear, sadness. They\u2019re not weaknesses. They are overpowering, defining emotions. They make you human, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are signs of defect,\u201d I told him, reverting back to curt Sophie.</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I \u2014 because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Because you are not proud of yourself? Because you despise who you are? Because, if you show these emotions, they acknowledge those thoughts?\u201d</p><p>I was deadly silent for five minutes at least. \u201cYes,\u201d I stated, breaking the absence of sound.</p><p>\u201cDo something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do. I\u2019m lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You don\u2019t really believe that. You want to stick with what\u2019s easy for you. You foresee the amount of work it would take to transform yourself and you\u2019re too frightened to embrace the challenge. Now, that, Sophie Price, is a real weakness.\u201d</p><p>Dingane stood and I watched him check each bed, traveling stealthily from one to the other and I hated how right he was.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Dingane and I were relieved by Ruth and Solomon around eight in the morning after breakfast, as promised. I was so exhausted, but the idea of sleeping on my sheets after being covered in blood and dirt gave me the chills. I wanted, no needed, to wash away the previous night.</p><p>\u201cI have to shower,\u201d I told Dingane.</p><p>His eyes bugged slightly. \u201cOh, all right. I was going to as well. Would you like to go first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him, \u201cyou go ahead. I\u2019ll gather all my things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll knock on your door when it\u2019s free.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Dingane knocked and I answered.</p><p>He popped in his head and his hair was still wet and clung to his neck. I could smell his soap and I inhaled it.</p><p>\u201cAll yours,\u201d he said, moving to leave before stopping short. \u201cUh, sleep well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, smiling slightly.</p><p>I approached the shower with hesitation knowing there would be bugs this time but was surprised again to see it was entirely clear. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d I said out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s odd?\u201d someone asked me. Karina was passing by.</p><p>\u201cOh, there aren\u2019t any insects here.\u201d</p><p>Karina studied the shower. \u201cThat is curious.\u201d She smiled before scurrying off toward the schoolhouse.</p><p>I showered quickly, cleansing the night away as best I could and dressed simply. My feet and eyes were so heavy by the end I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be able to make it to my small hut but somehow I did, tossing my things to the side and practically diving into my bed, burying my net as best I could into the mattress. I was asleep before my eyes could even hit the pillow.</p><p>I woke of my own accord which felt strange, but it was still light out and that surprised me knowing how tired I\u2019d been. I shook the insects from my net and emerged, brushing my teeth and fixing my hair into two braids as I\u2019d done that first day. It was to be my standard style, I\u2019d decided. It was easy and stayed out of my way. Two things I would have paid money I never would\u2019ve associated with the way I wanted to present myself. I wore my standard blue jeans, boots and button-up.</p><p>Outside, I could hear the giggling voices of the girls and hearty laughs of the boys, no doubt enjoying their free day of play. When I left my hut, my view was exactly as I\u2019d expected except for one little beautiful hiccup. The girls sat under the baobab tree, dancing and playing, the boys were several hours into a soccer match it seemed.</p><p>My eyes spanned across the players, all matching in height except for one. Dingane played alongside the boys, laughing with them, dribbling the ball around them and teasing them for not being able to catch up, which made them laugh all the more. Two boys had fallen down they were laughing so hard. When he spotted me, his smile didn\u2019t fade and that bolstered me. He passed the ball to the nearest boy and they continued to play.</p><p>Dingane jogged toward me, out of breath when he finally reached me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve put up the food, but Kate saved you a plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll have to thank her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you where she stored it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever been in the kitchen before,\u201d he said, walking backward.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d I admitted when he turned back around. \u201cHow are the village children?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He dropped to match my pace. \u201cMuch better. Many of their wounds were more superficial than we originally thought. The first girl we\u2019d wrapped, Olivia, is the worst off but conscious now and asking questions. We have high hopes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they handling it? The loss?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><p>\u201cAs expected. They need time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they need their parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the very definition of stolen, Sophie. Nobody ever asks permission.\u201d</p><p>When we arrived in the kitchen, we heard the patter of bare feet on the tile floor but saw no one. I went through the swinging door into the eating hall and looked around but saw no one until I turned around and noticed Mandisa, the one who refused to eat, hiding beneath the serving line.</p><p>\u201cMandisa?\u201d I called to her, but she was trembling, too afraid to come out so I went to her instead. \u201cMandisa, sweetheart,\u201d I said, testing out the word. I\u2019d never genuinely called anyone \u201csweetheart\u201d before, not without condescension. \u201cCome to me.\u201d</p><p>I held out my arms and could feel Dingane steadily approaching me from behind. I lifted my hand to stay him and felt him stop.</p><p>Mandisa shook her head and back and forth and squeezed her eyes shut. I took the opportunity to join her underneath the line and Dingane crouched beside us, boxing us in. When Mandisa opened her eyes, they were full of tears, so I did the only thing I could think to do. I grabbed her. I lifted her into my lap and squeezed her to my chest. I rubbed small circles into her back and whispered in her ear. It negated every instinct I owned, but I did it anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working. What should I do?\u201d I asked Dingane.</p><p>\u201cKeep holding her,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d I told him and tried to push her on him, but Dingane placed her back in my arms so I squeezed her again.</p><p>He placed his hand on my shoulder and held fast. \u201cShe needs affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it right,\u201d I told him, beyond panicked then.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he reassured me.</p><p>Dingane sat beside me against the aluminum partition and an instant calming sensation washed over me. I knew I could do it. I knew if Dingane was there to help me that I could help Mandisa. So we stayed silent for what seemed like hours and all I could wonder was if I had it in me to calm a toddler who\u2019d just lost her mother, who refused to eat and was a complete stranger. I wondered if her life would always be teeming with the strife she so obviously struggled with. I wondered if she would continue to starve herself with grief, or if we\u2019d be able to feed her through a tube. I wondered if she would ever be a normal child again. I wondered if she would even make it to adulthood, or if she would forever be lost to the cruel world she had already been subjected to at such a young age. I wondered about the practical and impractical and while I pondered her young life, she calmed down. She stopped crying and held on to me tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turned toward Dingane and felt his relief as well. We were a silly lot, the three of us, burrowed underneath that aluminum serving line, but despite what it appeared to the outside world, we had just conquered a mountain.</p><p>Dingane shimmied out of our cozy spot, but I was hindered by toddler so he dragged me out by my hips and practically lifted the two of us off the ground in one fell swoop, sending shivers down my spine.</p><p>\u201cThat was impressive,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d was all he replied, making me smile.</p> <p>I followed Dingane into the kitchen and he removed my food, dumping it into a pot to reheat it for me. I tried to hop onto the counter with Mandisa in my arms but failed miserably.</p><p>Dingane rolled his eyes and easily lifted Mandisa and me easily onto the counter. My cheeks flamed when he touched my waist, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice, too engrossed in stirring it seemed. I watched him in that moment and was overcome with attraction. It felt so wrong to focus on the boy before me when I held a very needy girl in my arms, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I turned my face away from him and brought Mandisa closer to me, laying my cheek on her head the way I\u2019d seen Sav\u2019s mom do it a thousand times before.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cMercy\u2019s back today,\u201d Dingane told Karina at lunch.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when she\u2019d be back,\u201d I stated.</p> <p>It\u2019d been over a week since we\u2019d seen Mercy, and Dingane and I\u2019d taken over the laundry duties while she\u2019d been gone. I wasn\u2019t wondering, really, I was dying for her to come home. Teaching all day and doing laundry all night was becoming unbearable, even Dingane was complaining and he never complained, ever.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSouth Sudan. She\u2019s family there. She was checking on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that rather dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dingane answered shortly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I sang.</p> <p>\u201cHe tried to convince her not to leave, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. Her aunt\u2019s been sick for months,\u201d Karina explained.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><p>Mercy chose that moment to walk through the eating hall and waved at me. I waved enthusiastically, unsure if I was happy to see her because I wouldn\u2019t have any more laundry to do, or if it was because she was back safe and sound. I frowned into my plate. When she approached I found myself jumping up and hugging her. Huh, guess I sincerely missed her.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, Dingane and I had intermittently examined those parts where we suspected the soldiers had stalked us from. We hadn\u2019t seen any sign of boot prints since that first day, but Dingane refused to relax.</p><p>\u201cCan you not calm down for a few moments?\u201d I\u2019d asked him at the time.</p><p>\u201cDo you not remember the village?\u201d he asked me in answer.</p><p>That was the end of that.</p><p>Dingane and I had come to an understanding of sorts. I kept as quiet as possible, did my work and he would tolerate me. But after those first few weeks, I\u2019d grown tired of submission so I showed him what I was capable of. I showed him I had enough initiative, enough industry, to strike out. I was also, simultaneously, recognizing something in myself I didn\u2019t know could exist.</p> <p>I was worth more than the sex I\u2019d defined myself with.</p><p>Yet Dingane still treated me with latent disdain.</p><p>The child survivors of the village were adjusting swimmingly apart from a few minor hiccups here and there, but nothing we couldn\u2019t handle. Charles, Karina, the rest of the staff and I were becoming great friends. I was truly falling in love with them and my purpose for being there, which I discovered was more than just serving a sentence.</p><p>I was learning Bantu, not enough to hold a conversation but enough to ask the younger ones if they needed to use the restroom, if they were hungry, etc.</p><p>Mandisa had started eating again thanks to Dingane and me. After our powerful breakthrough in the kitchen, she\u2019d warmed up to me though I hadn\u2019t any idea why at the time, but Karina helped me see that Mandisa chose who she thought could help her the best and she felt that was me. Who was I to argue? If I could help, I was going to. She\u2019d gained almost seven pounds in two weeks. Mandisa had even taken to occasionally sneaking into my hut late at night and sleeping with me. I wouldn\u2019t have admitted this to anyone but she was my favorite.</p><p>A week after Mercy came back, Dingane and I had to make another patrol near the watering hole. After classes, we got into his truck and headed that way.</p><p>\u201cOliver\u2019s driving me nuts,\u201d I told the window.</p><p>\u201cHe drives us all nuts.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s too smart for our lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t we alter his curriculum accordingly?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fine idea,\u201d he conceded too easily.</p><p>I sat up a bit and stared at him in shock. \u201cWhat? No argument?\u201d</p><p>He only rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. No argument? No telling me \u2018you\u2019ve got this\u2019 or dismissing me? I must confess, I suspect I\u2019m living in an alternate universe.\u201d I pretended to check out the window. \u201cNope, pigs aren\u2019t flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar, har.\u201d He sighed, parking the truck.</p><p>He leaned over and removed his pistol from the glove compartment. I got out, not wanting to be anywhere near it. I had a healthy respect for guns. Very healthy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared of it,\u201d he proclaimed to the wind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said, moving to the other side of him, the side without the gun.</p><p>\u201cAfter we check things out, you\u2019re going to shoot it.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open to my chest. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d</p><p>He stopped short and grinned at me. \u201cYou absolutely are. I can\u2019t have you frightened of it. What if there\u2019s occasion to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never have need to hold it, much less use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be naive, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a \u2018just in case\u2019 kind of situation. Once I teach you how to aim and shoot it, I won\u2019t ever ask you to use it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I gritted, continuing on without him.</p><p>I could hear him snicker below his breath behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d I sang.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ. This is going to be delightful for me.\u201d</p><p>I deliberately walked faster.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said, catching up. \u201cI\u2019ll stop teasing. Just stay near me.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed but didn\u2019t acknowledge him. We searched the entire watering hole and found no evidence that anyone was there. We rounded the entire bit of land and were nearing the truck. I made a mad dash toward it, hoping he\u2019d have somehow miraculously forgotten our lesson, but there was no such luck.</p><p>\u201cWrong way, Sophie,\u201d I heard him say. I stopped, disrupting the dirt beneath my feet and turned around, slightly winded.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deadly serious. Now, follow me.\u201d</p><p>He led me toward a covered area and found a thick rotting stump, picking it up as if it weighed nothing and setting it against a still-standing tree.</p><p>\u201cThis is your target,\u201d he said, checking the barrel and unloading the gun of all bullets.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you removing the bullets if this is a shooting lesson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there are a few rules you need to recognize first, and I think you\u2019d be more comfortable holding an unloaded gun.\u201d</p><p>He was right.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he continued, \u201cfirst rule\u2019s you always handle a gun as if it\u2019s loaded, even if you know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He handed me the gun and I reached for it with a shaking fist. I took it and held it in my palm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat next?\u201d I asked, staring at the cold piece of metal laying flat in my hand.</p><p>He fixed my grip and pointed the gun down. His hands were warm and my breath caught a little. \u201cNext rule,\u201d he said, \u201calways keep a firearm pointed in a safe direction,\u201d he explained softly. \u201cIf you accidentally fired it, we\u2019d want the bullet to avoid others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I wheezed.</p><p>He removed his hand from mine and I found I could breathe more easily.</p><p>\u201cNext. Always keep your finger off the trigger and outside the trigger guard,\u201d he said, pointing to the section of metal that protected the trigger. \u201cUntil you\u2019ve made a conscious decision to shoot, keep that finger off the trigger.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and gulped. His finger barely touched mine, but the world seemed to have disappeared around us. His breaths matched mine, but I was positive he was only nervous about teaching me how to shoot.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d I asked, breaking the trance.</p><p>Dingane shook his head and stuck his hands in his pocket. \u201cYeah, uh, where was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, next rule is to always be aware of your target, backstop and beyond. Make sure with one hundred percent certainty that your line of fire is clear of people and property. Don\u2019t take anyone\u2019s word for it. You\u2019re the only one responsible if something should happen, so make sure it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I exclaimed, realizing what he meant.</p><p>I handed him the gun and circled my target, recognizing that nothing laid beyond my line of fire for miles besides grass and the occasional tree. I returned to Dingane\u2019s side. He handed me the weapon once more and I pointed it toward the ground carefully and made sure my fingers were nowhere near the trigger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Dingane physically twisted my body toward my target stump then stood beside me.</p><p>\u201cSince this is your first time shooting, I\u2019d recommend you hold the gun with both hands.\u201d</p><p>I positioned my hands the way I thought I\u2019d seen guys on TV held it. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, uh, like this,\u201d he said, grabbing both my hands and positioning them properly. \u201cYou should always grip high on the backstrap. This\u2019ll allow you leverage when the gun fires and it\u2019ll prevent it from recoiling into your body.\u201d My hands started to shake a little and he steadied them with his. \u201cYour other hand should rest on top of this hand, right under the trigger guard and cup the back of your trigger hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to stand with your feet and hips at shoulder width,\u201d he explained, moving close behind me, flush with the back of my body, sending electric shocks careening through to my toes.</p><p>I spread my feet apart and stood still, staring at my target. Dingane didn\u2019t say a word but slowly used his feet to spread my own a little farther apart. My breath hitched in my throat.</p><p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>I swallowed. No. \u201cUm, yes.\u201d</p><p>Dingane stepped from behind me and the breath I\u2019d been holding whooshed from my lips.</p><p>\u201cLet me have the gun,\u201d he said and I handed it to him.</p><p>He started loading it and my already rapid pulse beat with unknown intensity.</p><p>\u201cMake a circle with your thumb and forefinger, pick an object around you, hold it out at arm\u2019s length and find that object within the circle.\u201d He paused. \u201cGot it?\u201d he asked, still loading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I chose his face.</p><p>\u201cKeeping that object within sight, bring the circle toward your face. The circle should naturally gravitate to one eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy left,\u201d I told him and he looked up.</p> <p>\u201cMine too,\u201d he whispered. I dropped my hands to my side. \u201cThat\u2019s your dominant eye. You\u2019ll use that one to align your sights.\u201d He handed me the gun and stood behind me closely, gripping the gun with me. \u201cThis is very loaded.\u201d</p><p>You can say that again, I thought.</p><p>\u201cAcknowledge me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s loaded,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>Dingane fixed himself hard against my back and my eyes slid closed at his warmth and the feel of his solid muscles. He fixed my stance once more with his feet and I could feel the blood rush to my belly. His mouth rested against my ear and I could hear every breath he took, slow and steady.</p> <p>\u201cAlign your sights,\u201d he spoke against my ear.</p><p>I nodded, my target within sight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t press yet,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I barely rushed out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull. Never pull. Whenever you\u2019re ready, squeeze the trigger until you feel resistance, but let it surprise you. Don\u2019t prepare yourself for the bullet, concentrate on applying pressure directly and let it show you exactly what it feels like the second it releases from the gun.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and took several steadying breaths, keeping my target within sight. Time seemed to slow to a turtle\u2019s pace. The world swirled quietly around me; the only significant sound was the deep rise and fall of Dingane\u2019s chest.</p> <p>My finger left its reclined position and rested on top of the trigger. My body tensed and I could feel his body cull itself tightly around mine in preparation. Two deep breaths and my lungs held still as my finger squeezed the trigger.</p><p>The world held still as the bullet rushed from the barrel toward the awaiting stump. The seconds to follow will forever brand themselves in my mind. The bullet struck home, shredding small parts of the stump outward in a halo of splinters, falling and settling onto the bed of dead undergrowth below. The bullet leaving the gun thrust my body against Dingane\u2019s, but he seemed prepared for it, holding me still against him.</p><p>When it was all done, the world rushed back to reality around me, the sights and sounds loud against my eyes and ears. I began to breathe deeply and Dingane slowly turned me toward him. I pointed the gun at the earth and faced him, staring directly in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou did well, Soph,\u201d he began softly. He\u2019d never called me Soph before. \u201cFeel all right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>He kept eye contact but removed the gun from my hand, holstering it and returning that hand to my shoulder. He watched me intently and a deluge of emotions washed over his face. His eyebrows pinched together as if he was trying to fight something. Finally, his face relaxed then both his palms rounded my back and up my shoulders, fisting both my braids.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re falling out,\u201d I finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cThey always do at the end of the day,\u201d he added, never breaking his stare, inches from my face.</p> <p>My eyes closed when he pulled the bands holding both braids and they slipped off into his hands. His fingers deftly freed both plaits painfully slowly all the way to the top of my head. Finally, I felt his fingers sift through the length to the ends.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the favorite part of my day.\u201d</p><p>My eyes opened lazily. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhen you undo them and run your hands throughout the waves. That\u2019s my favorite part of the day.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled slowly through my nose to keep from falling over at that revelation.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>He opened his mouth to answer, but we were startled from our proximity when the hand radio in the truck starting blaring incessantly.</p><p>\u201cDingane! Dingane!\u201d we heard over and over.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said, squeezing his eyes closed. \u201cI forgot to tell them we\u2019d be shooting off the gun.\u201d</p><p>He ran toward the truck, leaving me there astounded by what just transpired between us.</p><p>The ride back to Masego was unbearably quiet, both content, it seemed, to revel in our own thoughts. My own were inundated with sifting through what had just happened. My eyes kept flitting between us and I found myself wishing we could finish what had barely gotten started.</p><p>\u201cKarina\u2019s pissed,\u201d he said, startling me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI should have told her we\u2019d be shooting off the gun. We scared her half to death.\u201d</p><p>Guilt overwhelmed me. \u201cI\u2019ll have to apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I shot off the gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do all the apologizing. It was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think...\u201d I began but was cut short by the sight of Karina standing just outside the fence, two fists settled stiffly against her hips. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>Dingane sighed loudly.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he said, exiting the truck and slamming the door. I followed suit.</p><p>\u201cYou two!\u201d she said, storming over. I almost laughed out loud but stopped myself when I saw the expression on her face. Fear and sadness bathed it completely, sobering me. She grasped at her chest before reaching him and embraced Dingane with the fiercest hug imaginable. She waved me over and wrapped her arm around my neck. Both Dingane and I laid our hands on her back and stared at one another. We both felt so guilty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d we said in unison then broke into laughter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so sorry,\u201d I told Karina.</p><p>She distanced herself a little and wiped at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was preparing myself for the worst.\u201d She audibly sighed. \u201cI think Charles lost five years off his life. The whole family\u2019s in an uproar.\u201d</p><p>Guilt washed over us again. There was nothing to say.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, wrapping an arm around each of us. \u201cLet\u2019s go reassure everyone.\u201d</p><p>When we opened the gate we were engulfed by children, all worried.</p><p>\u201cHow do you say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 in Bantu?\u201d I screamed over their chatter.</p><p>\u201cMost understand English, Soph.\u201d Dingane laughed and started touching their heads. After a few minutes of reassuring them, tiny heads bounced off to play before the sun set all except for one. Mandisa. I picked her up and rested her bony little behind on my hip. I didn\u2019t say anything, just hugged her and walked with Dingane toward the baobab tree. We three stood there watching the boys play soccer and the girls congregating or singing or jumping rope.</p><p>When the sun disappeared over the horizon, leaving the sky pink and orange, Kate, Ruth and Karina called them in for baths and to brush their teeth. It all felt so normal, so gloriously wonderful. It was too bad their lives were tainted with bouts of inexplicable violence. It made me that much more aware of why I was grateful Dingane taught me how to shoot.</p><p>I set Mandisa down to join the other children. She kissed my cheek and I almost cried.</p><p>I stood. \u201cThank you,\u201d I told Dingane, staring at the colorful sky.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he whispered toward the same sky.</p><p>\u201cFor teaching me. Seeing them reminded me why I wanted to be able to defend them. They\u2019re defenseless. If it\u2019s ever up to me to guard their lives, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat. I couldn\u2019t possibly hesitate.\u201d</p><p>Dingane turned toward me and I faced him almost afraid of what he\u2019d say, or more truthfully, what he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he stated simply, disappointing me.</p><p>But then his gaze raked my face with such powerful intensity, I could feel it melt into my throat and shoulders, sending chills through me.</p><p>He closed the distance between us. \u201cWill you be showering tonight?\u201d he asked, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why do you keep asking when I\u2019m about to shower? Do you watch me or something?\u201d I teased.</p><p>His face turned bright red. \u201cOf course not!\u201d he exclaimed loudly, which made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Soph,\u201d he said grinning, using that nickname again and heading toward his hut, which just so happened to be happily situated right next to mine.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Ian,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He turned around and fought a smile, biting it away with his teeth.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t tired so I thought I\u2019d help the women bathe all the girls. The chattering females made me smile as I approached the communal bathrooms. Seven stalls lined the walls as well as seven showerheads with poor plastic coverage. They always bathed the babies first and any girl who could properly wash herself was told to do so. The women just supervised. I joined Karina\u2019s and Kate\u2019s side. They were laughing about something when I approached them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d Karina explained. \u201cSo you learned how to shoot a gun, did you?\u201d she asked wryly.</p><p>I bent my face toward the tile floor. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>My head whipped up. \u201cYes, I am glad. Every adult here should be able to. Though I wished I\u2019d been informed,\u201d she chastised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Karina,\u201d I began, but she cut me off, wrapping her arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cStop. I know you\u2019re sorry. That\u2019s the last you\u2019ll hear of it from me.\u201d She kissed my temple and I felt so incredibly loved.</p><p>\u201cKarina?\u201d I asked after a few minutes of silence.</p><p>\u201cHmm? Just a moment. Christine! No, dear,\u201d she said, stopping Christine from splashing Kate, whose back was to her. Christine frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just curious about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d she asked, distracted by Christine again.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Dingane so interested when I shower? I thought maybe you might know.\u201d</p><p>Her answer shocked me speechless. \u201cHe sweeps all the bugs out for you. He heard you say how you hated them,\u201d she absently remarked. \u201cExcuse me, dear,\u201d she continued, heading for Christine.</p><p>I walked away in a daze, not believing it. But he hates me. He may be attracted to me, that\u2019s obvious, but he doesn\u2019t care for me.</p><p>I hit the dirt outside and made a beeline for the showers, the small outside light illuminating it in the middle of our makeshift village. When I rounded the corner, I shone the flashlight I carried with me into one of the rudimentary stalls. Insects. Everywhere. The wood walls were covered with them. I almost couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Every inch seemed infested. I accidentally dropped my light and bent to pick it up. That means he\u2019s been waking up extra early every morning and sweeping them out. Why would he do this?</p><p>\u201cHe likes you, dumbass,\u201d I said out loud.</p><p>My lips twitched at the corners and I stood. I practically sprinted to our huts but just stopped myself from banging my fist on Ian\u2019s barely-there door. My hand fell to my side. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to confront him with the evidence. If he\u2019d wanted me to know he was doing it, he\u2019d have let me know. My teeth couldn\u2019t fight the smile plastered on my face. It was time for bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>It was the best night\u2019s sleep I\u2019d had since I arrived. I awoke early, grabbed my shower bucket and I ran across the cool morning air to the wood stalls and stared inside.</p><p>Clear.</p><p>I searched the grounds and spotted Ian\u2019s back on the other side of the baobab tree. His head raised as if he felt my stare and turned around, scouring the landscape around him. His eyes caught mine and the morning sun glinted off his bright blue eyes, making them even more vibrant. I inclined my head toward him and he nodded subtly in return. Butterflies drowned my empty stomach in flutters.</p> <p>I showered, not even recognizing how cold the water was that morning like I did every other morning. When I dressed in my room and began plaiting my hair, my hands felt clumsy and nervous. I was so flabbergasted at myself. I couldn\u2019t believe I was acting the way I was. Me, the queen of control. The queen of attraction. La F\u00e9e Verte. The old name crept into my conscious and I dropped my hands, studying myself in the mirror. The prior giddy feeling I was so happy to enjoy a moment before felt terrible now. I realized I didn\u2019t deserve Ian. Recollecting all the terrible things I did back home made the wonderful butterflies die and nausea take their place. I steeled my hands, fighting back the feeling I was being swallowed by a black hole and finished my hair.</p><p>Karina\u2019s knocking at my door reminded me I was there to do a job.</p><p>\u201cSophie, my love, are you dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, opening the door for her. Her face was white as a sheet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, my stomach dropping to the floor.</p><p>\u201cMercy has measles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeasles? How? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nurse confirmed it late last night. She will live, I\u2019m certain, but the young ones, none of them are vaccinated and two of the children have fevers,\u201d Karina explained, wringing her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you vaccinate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe lack the resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, what does this mean? What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe call Pembrook.\u201d</p> <p>This surprised me.</p><p>\u201cWhat can he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few options, but we have little time. He\u2019d have to work with short notice.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my satellite phone and checked the battery. It was nearly nonexistent. I dialed anyway and sat at the edge of my bed while Karina paced back and forth on my creaky floor.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d a shaky Pembrook\u2019s voice sounded.</p><p>I took a deep breath. It was so good to hear a familiar voice. \u201cPembrook!\u201d I screamed into the bad connection.</p><p>\u201cSophie? Is that you?\u201d The connection broke. \u201c...are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed that last bit, Pemmy. I\u2019m fine, if you asked. Listen, I need a favor. I\u2019m running on low battery here and I need you to arrange for a shipment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat...for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeasles has broken out here at Masego and none of the children are vaccinated. Karina says there are several options available to us. Can you get in touch with Ford and arrange something?\u201d</p><p>Several seconds of silence followed and I feared we lost him. \u201c...I\u2019ll contact you tonight. Charge....if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pemmy!\u201d I yelled before the connection broke.</p><p>Karina sat next to me. We were silent for a few minutes letting everything sink in.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he can\u2019t get anything?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>Karina wrung her hands continuously. \u201cWe quarantine. We treat fevers. We hydrate.\u201d</p><p>I sighed loudly. \u201cJesus, Karina. When does it stop?\u201d I turned toward her.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop, love,\u201d she said, stopping and resting a hand on my shoulder, a wan smile gracing her beautiful face. \u201cWe do the best we can when we can and have faith it will all work out.\u201d I nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat and discuss what we need to do with Charles and Din.\u201d</p><p>We sat at the tables, my satellite phone resting in the center of our group.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dying,\u201d I admitted, pointing to the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe really need a generator,\u201d Ian said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford it, Din,\u201d Charles added.</p><p>\u201cNo one will have electricity nearby,\u201d Karina put in.</p><p>\u201cAnd the closest city?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe closest city with guaranteed electricity?\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJinja?\u201d he asked Charles.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo and a half hours. Approximately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPemmy could have called by then,\u201d I told them.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but it\u2019s our only other option,\u201d Charles said.</p><p>Mandisa came to my side and I slid her onto my lap without thinking, resting my cheek on her head. \u201cWhat if I turned it off, waited a few hours then rang Pemmy myself later. That way we could guarantee ourselves the information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough juice to boot it back up,\u201d Ian observed, \u201cbut nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought. It was brilliant.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was being sincere,\u201d he said, offended</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said sheepishly.</p><p>I turned toward the table once more and spotted Karina eyeing me with interest. I shrugged my shoulders in question, but she just grinned and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen we go to Jinja,\u201d I conceded, slumping a little in my chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take over your classes,\u201d Karina said.</p><p>One of Mandisa\u2019s friends passed by and Mandisa scurried from my lap toward them.</p><p>\u201cSilly girl,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fond of you,\u201d Ian said, when the others got up to get plates for themselves.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you.\u201d</p><p>I whipped my eyes toward him. \u201cYou think so?\u201d I asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d</p><p>This bolstered me like nothing ever could. If a child chose to love me even though I was so undeserving, did that mean I could earn Ian\u2019s love? Could I become worthy? I studied his beautiful pale face, framed with messy black hair and piercing blue eyes. God, he was so fascinating to look upon.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, running his hands through his hair. \u201cDo I have something on my face?\u201d He smoothed his hands down his expression.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d I answered, standing up to grab a plate.</p><p>Ian got up and stood close behind me a few seconds later and I could feel the smile on my face grow to impossible lengths.</p><p>\u201cWill Pembrook come through?\u201d he asked the back of my head.</p><p>Now, I knew boys. Well. He knew Pemmy would try his best. He just wanted to talk to me and that brought the butterflies back.</p><p>\u201cHe will try his damnedest.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cHave-have you been vaccinated?\u201d I asked reticently, afraid of his answer.</p><p>\u201cI was the last time I visited home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said, relieved, lining the linoleum with the toe of my boot.</p><p>\u201cJinja\u2019s a dangerous drive,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this surprise me?\u201d I added sarcastically. \u201cWhat is it about this bloody place? It\u2019s the land of every extreme possible.\u201d</p><p>Ian grabbed my arm unexpectedly, the heat from his hand warming me to an impossible temperature, and turned me toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re right but with extreme suffering, there is extreme happiness. With extreme earth there is extreme beauty.\u201d</p><p>I thought on what he\u2019d said and remembered the view from my plane when I arrived. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Lake Victoria was one of the most beautiful sights I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children here are extremely loveable,\u201d I declared.</p><p>\u201cGood one,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThat they are.\u201d</p><p>Four giggling girls walked by us arm in arm singing a traditional song, making my heart swell.</p><p>After breakfast, we grabbed the satellite phone and hopped in Ian\u2019s truck. I took note of the rifle strapped behind the seats and my blood began to pump, adrenaline flooding my body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Ian assured me.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked when he revved the engine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>My heart began to slow and my breathing steadied...because I believed him.</p><p>The truck was too loud to hold any kind of conversation and that disappointed me. I was dying to talk about whatever that thing was that happened between us at the watering hole. I was determined to get to the bottom of it as the sat phone charged.</p><p>The two-and-a-half-hour drive was ridiculous to me considering all we really wanted it for was electricity. Jinja was surprisingly well developed since all I\u2019d ever seen from Kampala to Masego was undeveloped land excluding a random petrol station here and there. Ian told me it was the second largest city in Uganda. I had to keep myself from laughing while looking on it knowing those statistics. The main roads were paved, which was a rare sight, but they were poorly maintained and buckled in many spots. The establishments were plentiful but mostly one story. The roads were filled to the brim with bicyclists. Our truck seemed to be the only one among a handful in the entire city.</p><p>\u201cThe source of the Nile is here,\u201d Ian explained after parking in front of a promising-looking restaurant.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d I exclaimed, genuinely surprised.</p><p>He opened the door for me and I stepped inside. We were the only ones. An Indian woman called us over.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Ian said, \u201cI wonder if you wouldn\u2019t mind if we trespassed on your kindness for a little while. My friend\u2019s phone is almost out of battery and we need to charge it. What would it cost us to use your electricity for, say, eight hours?\u201d</p><p>She held up her hands to stay us and went behind a door, emerging with a pen and piece of scrap paper. She wrote down a number and I bent over to examine what she\u2019d written. It read \u201c2 American dollar.\u201d I nodded at the figure and handed her two dollars from the small stash I\u2019d brought. We set the phone up to charge and sat at a nearby table.</p><p>Suddenly things became uncomfortable between us. We both knew it was the only privacy we\u2019d be afforded for some time and neither of us was bold enough to speak our minds. This is so unlike me. I stared out the dirty window before me, watching the men in dress pants and button-ups cycle along the streets. The woman interrupted the awkward quiet by setting a pot of tea and two cups at our table.</p><p>Ian thanked her and poured the tea over a sifter to catch the leaves, handing me a cup. Our hands touched and a spark of literal electricity shocked our hands apart.</p><p>\u201cStatic,\u201d I whispered. We stared at one another, our hands inches apart on the table. I brought my gaze down and inspected them. \u201cTalk,\u201d I ordered finally, taking in his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cThe lesson.\u201d A breath whistled through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his hair falling a little into his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Soph. I never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why treat me like a pariah?\u201d</p><p>He sat back but kept his hands flat on the table, his eyes searched me deeply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d I nodded in acknowledgement. \u201cIn a few short months, you\u2019ll be gone, back to your life in America. I didn\u2019t want to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>I sighed loudly. \u201cSo that whole bit about knowing who I was, what kind of person I was. Was that bull?\u201d</p><p>His eyes cast down. \u201cNo, I, uh, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d His eyes met mine again. \u201cI\u2019m just-I was quick to judge. I was wrong when I thought you couldn\u2019t change. So few can do it.\u201d</p><p>I brought my hands down and wedged them between my crossed legs.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he offered as if in explanation, his brows pulled tightly across his forehead.</p><p>Tears sprang silently and cascaded down my face.</p><p>\u201cSoph,\u201d he said quietly, reaching for me, but I refused to budge. \u201cYou\u2019ve been transformed for a while.\u201d</p><p>I choked back a sob. It meant so much to me to hear those words.</p> <p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. You\u2019re leaving. I feel like an idiot admitting to this but I confess, I don\u2019t do well when people leave. I promise myself I won\u2019t get attached. It\u2019s a defense mechanism in my line of work,\u201d he admitted with a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I would be honored to call you friend,\u201d he said succinctly, with an odd finality, as if he meant this as more a fact than an opinion.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized how much I\u2019d wanted to be his friend. I\u2019d never been respected by a man before, not truly.</p><p>Click.</p> <p>And this was my new epiphany. Men wanted me. They all did, however briefly, but none of them wanted to keep me. That\u2019s what I needed. I needed to be owned, loved. But not by a man. I knew then that I never needed to be kept by a man. What I needed was to love myself, to want to keep myself around. And in that revelation, I knew that if I wanted to keep myself, that a man wanting to keep me would just be a by-product. Who wouldn\u2019t want to keep someone who respected himself or herself?</p><p>\u201cAnd I would be honored for you to call me friend,\u201d I finally told him once I\u2019d collected myself.</p><p>His expression softened and he grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is startlingly beautiful, Sophie,\u201d he stated after a brief moment of fixed gazes.</p><p>My breath sucked into my chest at an alarming rate. There was no mention of my face, my legs, my ass, my breasts, my hair, my clothing, the way I carried myself, what I wore or how I wore it. There was no mention of me other than the part no one could even see. I\u2019d been called beautiful so many times. It gratified me, validated me, but it was all empty, a facade. This was the first time someone had called me beautiful and it actually meant something to me. The praise slammed into my skin and permeated my body, leaving me flushed and overwhelmed.</p><p>My hands clenched on the table. I wanted so badly to rush him in that moment, to run my hands through his straight, silky, black hair and memorize his mouth with mine but something stopped me. I ignored the instinct, told myself that Ian was different. I decided I\u2019d let him take the reins because I had never let anyone do that before. I was going to let him set the pace, let him discover me on his own. Giving him control gave me more power than I imagined I could own. Letting him worry about the next move was incredibly liberating and I knew with absolute certainty that the ride was going to be the best of my entire life.</p><p>Sophie Price had just learned self-control.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him softly, \u201cvery much. That has to be the best compliment I\u2019ve ever gotten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSurely not,\u201d he said, puzzling over my quietude.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurious,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>He leaned forward and rested his forearms farther up on the table, closer to my hands, gripping the edge. I removed one hand and picked up my cup, taking a small sip. The tea was surprisingly good. \u201cTell me what your life back home is like,\u201d he asked.</p><p>I sighed loudly. Adrenaline shot through me. Be honest, I told myself. \u201cI lied to the children,\u201d I began.</p><p>His brows pinched. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat day, when Oliver asked me about my parents, I said they were nice.\u201d I gave him a small smile. \u201cThey most definitely are not.\u201d</p><p>Ian studied me carefully. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>I braced myself. I knew I was about to unload on this guy. This perfect, unselfish boy who would probably want nothing to do with me after what I was about to reveal to him, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was my past. I couldn\u2019t just brush it under the table. \u201cMy parents are the epitome of self-involved. They are beyond wealthy, uninhibited, unwise, shallow, every combination of terrible you can think of.</p><p>\u201cSince I was an infant, I was raised by a nanny. I was indulged to impossible levels and to my own detriment, I can admit now. At fourteen, I fired the nanny and my parents decided I could raise myself, so I did.\u201d I hesitated and Ian squeezed my hand. I was mesmerized for a moment as his fingers rubbed the tops of mine. Butterflies took over and my breathing became labored. I looked up at him and lost control of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>I was startled back to the present. \u201cAnd I gave myself no boundaries. If I wanted to sleep with a boy, I did. If I wanted to try a drug, I did. If I wanted to drink to the point of excess,\u201d I began and trailed off.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy goal in life was to rule my tiny, elite world, so I did. I manipulated, used, disrespected and took advantage of every person I called friend. Don\u2019t get me wrong, none of us were saints by any means, but I led them all. I influenced them all. I pulled and played with their puppet strings. I was the ultimate puppeteer. I was cruel and unrelenting. I was no better than my parents.\u201d</p><p>I continued on with details of past indiscretions, ending with the day Jerrick died, the day I was caught with cocaine, my interaction with Officer Casey and even Spencer and his father. I confessed it all, spilled it at his feet and the sum of all my actions surprised even me. Humiliation filled my cheeks and I tucked my chin into my chest when I was done.</p><p>Ian sat back against his chair and his hands released mine, leaving them bereft of the boiling heat I was becoming so addicted to. The air left his chest in one whoosh and shame inundated me. My eyes burned. I steeled myself for rejection, for a reaction of disgust, pinching my eyes closed and turning my face toward the window of passersby, but it never came.</p><p>Eventually my gaze returned to him and he was staring at me, hard. \u201cMy parents are high-ranking political officials in Cape Town,\u201d he began, astonishing me. \u201cI was raised by boarding schools during the school year and nannies in the summers. My parents only had time for their professions, so my brother and I found solace in many vices.\u201d</p><p>I was taken aback at this admission.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d I asked, suddenly and outrageously curious to know everything about Ian\u2019s life.</p><p>He half-smiled. \u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I said, borrowing his phrase.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was seventeen, at a party, we were all drunk and I was caught in a compromising situation with another official\u2019s daughter. Smartphones were involved. Needless to say, lots of pictures were also involved. And the media had a field day with it. The girl was labeled a whore, I was labeled Cape Town\u2019s bad boy. My parents were not amused.</p><p>\u201cI lived an utterly selfish existence up until that point, but when I saw Mel, the girl involved, when I saw her name in the headlines and the stigma it ended up attaching to her, I was thoroughly ashamed of myself. It had been my fault. I should have been looking after her.</p><p>\u201cPoor Mel had to transfer to America to finish university. She\u2019s still there, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>I was shocked silent by his confession. I never, in my wildest dreams, thought Ian could have been defined as anything else but perfection, anything other than infallible. He was human after all.</p><p>\u201cSo how did you end up at Masego?\u201d I asked him when he seemed to have trailed off into his own thoughts.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cMy parents kicked me out. I was done with school. They\u2019d done their part, or so they said they did. They cut me off after too many follies and I was shoved out. I had a friend named Kelly who worked with a gorilla rescue in the Congo. I joined her and one day we were called to Uganda, near Lake Victoria. Turned out, the police had confiscated three baby gorillas from poachers and they needed rescuing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been with Kelly for six months and really enjoyed what I was doing. I felt like I was accomplishing some good, and I was, but while I was in Uganda, on our way to get the babies, the strangest thing happened.\u201d I was riveted and found myself leaning toward him. \u201cWe stumbled upon a little girl, no more than seven years old, walking by herself on the side of the road around two in the morning. We stopped to inquire if she needed help but she waved us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly was ready to keep going, but I insisted we help the little girl. I got out of the truck and approached her. She was obviously dehydrated and starving. I could see her ribs through her skin and my stomach wretched for her. I picked her up and put her in the cab with us. I asked her questions, but she was despondent, too distraught, too hungry, too unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cWe took her to Kampala with us, about an hour from where we\u2019d found her, and where we were expected to retrieve the gorillas. While Kelly readied the truck to transport the animals, I took the little girl to get something to eat, to get her to drink and even paid some women at a nearby restaurant to bathe her while I fetched her something decent to wear. Her clothes were threadbare.</p><p>\u201cWhen everything was done, the little girl looked brand new, happier. She finally spoke to me and told me her name was Esther. She told me her parents had died and her grandmother was only able to take care of one of one child, so the girl chose to have her grandmother look after her three-year-old brother.\u201d</p><p>Tears I\u2019d been collecting fell in unison at the proclamation and Ian took my hand. \u201cIt has a happy ending,\u201d he said, smiling and I smiled back.</p><p>\u201cWe had stumbled upon her trying to walk to Kampala for help. I took the little girl and found out through the locals Charles\u2019 and Karina\u2019s names and number. I called them and they came to pick her up without hesitation. I never went back to the Congo with Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I balked. \u201cI mean, yeah, they\u2019re amazing, but I was talking about you, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, anyone would have done what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t have, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He playfully rolled his eyes and shrugged off my compliment.</p><p>\u201cWhy Ian?\u201d he asked after a few minutes of silence.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I offered without further explanation.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d he said, staring out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dingane\u2019 makes my heart ache to hear it.\u201d</p><p>I sat up a bit at that. \u201cWhy let them call you that then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means something to me every time they say it. It reminds me of who I am and who I never want to become again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does it translate to?\u201d</p><p>He sat up with me and peered hard into my eyes. \u201cExile,\u201d he said succinctly.</p><p>I fell back then turned to realize that the sat phone was fully charged.</p><p>We\u2019re not done, Ian Aberdeen, I told him silently.</p> <p>And he knew it. I could feel it in the intoxicating charge in the air. He knew it.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>I tossed an extra two dollars on the counter as we left the restaurant and the woman waved at us emphatically in appreciation. Ian and I walked silently toward his jeep, both pondering, I guessed, about the bombshells we\u2019d just laid on one another. It was the first time we had ever been vulnerable to one another and it felt overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p>As we walked, I suddenly felt a whoosh of air as Ian pulled me toward him violently just in time for me to avoid the bicyclist who\u2019d lost control and was barreling toward us. Ian grabbed me by the waist, swinging me away and rushing me back onto the sidewalk and against the outer facade of the restaurant we\u2019d just been inside of. As he pressed me against him, that same flush-inducing heat creeped up my neck and face and one of his hands traveled to the back of my neck while the other rested on my hip. My heart beat into my throat but not from the narrowly missed collision. I was losing control of my reaction and that had never happened to me. I was always methodically in command of the way I let a boy affect me and had their reactions to me checked as well. Always in control. Proximity to Ian Aberdeen was my kryptonite.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>Far from it, I wanted to say, gazing into his breathtaking face. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d I said quietly instead, afraid of blemishing the moment.</p><p>We were walking a razor\u2019s edge and my blood pulsed dangerously in my veins, pooling at the skin where his hands rested, heating me up from the inside. He backed away slowly, but the muscles in his arms bunched as he forced his hands to leave my body. I felt alone too quickly, but there was nothing I could do. In my past life, I would have dragged him back to me, but I was no longer that Sophie so I followed his very delicate lead.</p><p>We hurried to the jeep and he opened the door for me before rounding the front and settling in himself. He started the engine, but I grabbed his arm before he could put it in gear.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked, breathing unusually hard and whipping his head my direction.</p><p>\u201cI should call Pemmy for an update.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he began before clearing his throat and facing the windshield, \u201cof course.\u201d</p><p>My heart beat rapidly at his obvious disappointment. I watched him for a second as I pretended to dial Pemmy\u2019s number. Kiss me then, I kept ordering him silently, but he never obeyed. Instead, he gripped the steering wheel with such ferocity I believed he might bend it. I dialed Pembrook in earnest and got him on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cSophie!?\u201d I heard on the other line.</p><p>\u201cPemmy! Yes, it\u2019s Sophie! We charged the phone, so it\u2019s got a full battery. If I use it sparingly, I think it could last a few days. Do you have any news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood...hear...the doctor...I\u2019ve arranged a plane,\u201d he said, breaking in clearly. \u201cThey should be in Kampala in forty-eight hours with everything you need. I could only get clearance for medical supplies, Sophie, so let Karina know I couldn\u2019t include food or clothing this drop. I\u2019ve arranged for armed escorts...delivery to Masego.\u201d</p><p>He broke out at this point and we lost connection. I tried again with no luck. I turned the sat phone off and tucked it into its canvas carrying bag before looking Dingane\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cForty-eight hours,\u201d he spoke solemnly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to quarantine in three sections. Confirmed cases, suspected cases and children showing no signs of illness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are the odds we can keep most of them clean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d Ian turned to me. \u201cIt\u2019ll be you and me with the sickest children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if any of them will be ill, Ian.\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cSophie, that\u2019s an inevitability.\u201d</p><p>Ian put the jeep in gear and we sped off in the direction of Masego and into a pinkening sky. The sun would be leaving us soon, making me nervous for some reason I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>An hour after we\u2019d left Jinja, the tension in the truck was palpable. So many emotions swirled around us and I wanted so badly for Ian to pull over and cut that tension with his mouth. I stared out my window, my elbow resting outside the window. I felt strands of hair whipping against my face. My braids had started to fall out. I checked the mirror to see if it needed to be let down or if I could just tuck in the strays. It was a mess.</p><p>I swallowed knowing the simple act of releasing my braids was more intimate a moment than I\u2019d experienced in even my most vulnerable moments with other men. I looked over at him and brought my hand slowly to my left braid sliding the tie off painfully slowly. I wanted him to notice.</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes flitted my direction, his breathing grew deeper and deeper, and I could feel the heat of his gaze pool in the pit of my stomach. I dropped the band in the seat next to me before lifting my hand to release the braid but Ian\u2019s warm, callused hand stopped mine. He slowed the truck a bit before threading his fingers over the top of my belt and sliding me closer to him. My eyes lidded and my breath rushed out of me. He turned me to face him and with his free hand, he undid each plait much like he\u2019d done during the lesson. When he was done, he slowly lifted his fingers and cupped the side of my face, before turning his head toward me. I couldn\u2019t stop myself from placing my hand on his forearm and closing my eyes, reveling in his scorching touch. I took three steadying breaths and tried desperately not to melt into him.</p><p>I opened my eyes to look on him, but he glanced back to the road, narrowing his eyes slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered as a body of light unexpectedly shone brightly into the cab. He whipped my body down and covered my head with his chest.</p><p>I was beyond shaken as he veered the jeep into a sharp turn, coming to an abrupt stop perpendicular to the road we were traveling.</p><p>Before I had a chance to react, he was shoving me out the passenger side door ordering me to keep my head down. Adrenaline leaked into my limbs and I obeyed without hesitation. With stealth-like speed I didn\u2019t think human, Ian slid out, tossing open the glove box and removing his revolver, cocking it and handing it to me without so much as a word before settling next to me. He sidled over to the back seat door and threw it open, leaning in to retrieve his AK just as the first bullet came whizzing over the top of the jeep. My heart froze in my throat and I ducked farther down, tucking myself against the side of my door. Ian shimmied out and slammed the door shut.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I heard him say as he steadily unfolded the stock and clicked the magazine in place. \u201cKeep your head down, Soph,\u201d he said, sliding to my other side and bracing his gun on the hood of the jeep.</p><p>Immediately, gunfire rang throughout the quiet night and my own revolver shook in my hands. Ian returned fire. After a minute, but what felt like an hour, I calmed myself down enough to grip my gun without trembling. I adjusted my body to set next to Ian\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Ian said coolly to the night in front of him before sending a spray of bullets our assailer\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI have to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you only fire their direction if they\u2019re upon us, Soph.\u201d</p><p>Another round of bullets screamed our direction, shattering the only closed back passenger window and hurtling above our heads. Ian crouched down long enough to meet my eyes and a million promises transferred in that brief moment. He tore his gaze from mine and raised himself abruptly, repositioning his gun before firing their direction.</p><p>\u201cHand me one of those magazines?\u201d</p><p>It was dark but the headlights of our attackers\u2019 vehicle lit through the underbelly of our jeep and I spotted one of the magazines he asked for. I picked it up and handed it to him. He dropped the hot, used magazine to the ground and replaced it so quickly I barely registered it. He fired back within seconds.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThieves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith automatic weapons?\u201d I asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ian unleashed an ungodly amount of bullets their way and they answered in kind. I covered my ears as best I could and tried so very hard to keep the tea down. Despite every attempt, I could not stop my body from trembling.</p><p>And just as quickly as it had started, it seemed to end. I heard doors slamming and their engine roaring to life, then their headlights disappeared. Ian hesitantly stood and I followed suit, sidling next to him and gripping his shirt in one of my hands. He tucked me behind him as we watched the attackers turn away from our jeep and go the other direction.</p><p>I could feel my blood returning to my extremities and they felt heavy, but it was short-lived when the men turned suddenly and came barreling our direction, firing bullets all the way.</p><p>Ian turned us into the side of the jeep and pushed us to the back before landing on top of me and burying my head into his chest. I could hear the attackers shattering the windshield with bullets before speeding off into the night. We laid like that for several minutes before he would let me raise my head. As soon as I raised it, he hugged me like we were dying. I gripped his back, desperate to be as close to him as possible, burying my face in his neck. It took a good fifteen minutes for our breathing to steady, but he still held me more tightly than I\u2019d ever been held in my life.</p><p>He suddenly remembered himself and jumped up into a sitting position, searching my face and body, running his hands where his eyes roamed, checking for injuries and warming me up from the inside.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>I sat up and took in his own body. \u201cI\u2019m fine. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a scratch,\u201d he said with a slightly shaky smirk, making my eyes burn in relief.</p><p>He grabbed me and hugged me to him again. \u201cGod, Soph,\u201d he breathed into my hair. \u201cI was so worried.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I noticed his body had finally accepted it was over and he began to shiver against mine as the adrenaline left him. He pulled me away and ran his hands across my face and through my hair, down my neck and rested them on my shoulders a moment before bringing my face back into his neck. We sat there in the dirt, holding each other, molding our bodies together as closely as we could get them, fear draining from every pore.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe how incredible he had been during the attack. I had never seen a man move like Ian, nor had I seen one so quick on his feet and easy to protect. It was the sexiest thing I\u2019d ever seen in my entire life. It all came so naturally to him, I doubt he even thought twice about each action. He was calculated and aware and amazingly hot.</p><p>My hands laid flat against the hard muscles in his back, still strained and warm from the danger we\u2019d just endured. His t-shirt clung to him and I found myself running my hands up the ridges of muscles to his shoulders just to feel them before wrapping my arms around his neck.</p><p>He held me tighter when I encircled my arms. \u201cThe windshield is done,\u201d he breathed into my throat, bringing me back to reality. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled my face back and ran my hands across his face. \u201cWill we be able to drive?\u201d</p><p>He followed my lead and ran his hands through my hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to cover our faces the best we can, the dirt will be overwhelming, but, yeah, we\u2019re only about an hour away from Masego.\u201d</p><p>A small tear fell down my face. \u201cWe almost died, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around my frame and brought my head to his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh,\u201d he spoke into my hair, \u201cI told you I\u2019d protect you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d I confirmed into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI would never let anything happen to you, Soph.\u201d</p><p>Clarity came to me in that second because I believed him.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered, bringing my face near his. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, but I have to say it. Thank you for saving my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my absolute pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I giggled despite myself. \u201cSo polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Soph, I am trying really hard to be polite right now.\u201d</p><p>My brows furrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re, uh, you\u2019re sitting on my lap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I blushed. Actually blushed! Sophie Price, who hadn\u2019t blushed since she was a schoolgirl, felt embarrassed!</p><p>I scurried off his lap and he stood, offering his hand to help me up. He reached into his glove compartment again and pulled out a flashlight, lighting up our small area with a click. We examined the damage. Since most of the windows were down except one of the back passenger windows, none shattered but that one and the windshield. There were bullet holes riddling the sides of the jeep but when Ian lifted the hood, the engine appeared to be unscathed.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Ian rounded the side of the jeep and picked up his guns, placing them back in the glove box and the back of the vehicle. He grabbed an old t-shirt in the backseat and effortlessly ripped it in two.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing me one half of the shirt, \u201ctie this \u2019round your mouth and nose.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed it and nodded. Following his lead, I wrapped it around my face and cinched it as tightly as I could behind my head.</p><p>\u201cWe look like we\u2019re about to rob a bank,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>He chuckled and the corners of his eyes creased with the smile I so rarely earned. It was a shame I couldn\u2019t see it for myself. He sighed loudly and opened my door for me. I hopped up and buckled myself in.</p><p>The drive to Masego was terrible, dirt flew in so badly it created a thick coating on our skin and clothing but we could breathe at least, despite how difficult it made it to see. It took twice the amount of time to get home because Ian had to drive slowly enough that rocks and debris couldn\u2019t harm us too badly.</p><p>It was after eleven when we got home, so no one was there to let us in. I got out with Ian this time and helped him open and close the gates.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare Karina with the sight of this truck, so I\u2019m going to park it where it\u2019s semi-hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to see it anyway,\u201d I mused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but hopefully she\u2019ll see me first and it\u2019ll give me a chance to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see. Should we go ahead and wake them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the point. The plane won\u2019t be here for another two days. Let them sleep.\u201d</p><p>The grounds seemed peaceful and that made my heart and soul quiet down a bit from the night\u2019s near catastrophe. Ian brought the truck behind our hut, out of view from Karina and Charles\u2019 cabin and we got out. He removed his half of the now filthy t-shirt. I struggled with mine so he came around and helped work through the knots.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, Soph, how did you do this? Your hair is caught in it.\u201d He laughed again.</p><p>\u201cNote to self,\u201d I said out loud, \u201cIan is happiest when in dangerous situations.\u201d</p><p>He whipped my body around and his mouth gaped open, but it still couldn\u2019t hide his grin. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve laughed twice tonight. That\u2019s the most I\u2019ve seen you laugh, especially if none of the kids are involved with their daily shenanigans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you watch me then?\u201d he flirted, edging closer.</p><p>\u201cAbout as much as you watch me,\u201d I flirted back.</p><p>\u201cI-I, uh-,\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cAre you to grab a shower?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I am not to grab a shower. I was hoping to swim in this filth all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarcasm noted.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and it was the most glorious thing I\u2019d ever seen. I fought the urge to grab him and run my tongue along his teeth.</p><p>\u201cGrab your stuff,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He startled me, but I didn\u2019t let it show. I hurried to my half of the hut and tossed my shampoo, body scrub, etc. into my bucket before grabbing my robe. I practically ran to the showers and caught Ian mid-sweep.</p><p>\u201cI knew you did this, by the way,\u201d I told his back, stunning him still.</p><p>His shoulders sagged and he turned around and smirked. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t about to rat Karina out. \u201cIt\u2019s shockingly free of creepy crawlies every day, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that seems a bit lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him quietly.</p><p>\u201cAt first I did it because I didn\u2019t want to hear you complain.\u201d</p><p>I approached him and blocked him into the stall. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed but looked me dead in the eye. \u201cBecause I want to.\u201d The intimacy of his stare shocked me silent, my mouth gaped. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I stepped aside, against the edge of the wood stall, to make room for him but his massive body still slowly grazed mine, stealing my breath away. I locked myself in and undressed, tossing my clothing over the side and setting my bucket on the stone beneath my feet.</p><p>I turned on the water and immediately began rinsing off my face. The water was cool but not cold. I welcomed it as I could feel the dirt leaving my body. It trailed down my legs and pooled near the drain in an orange haze. I closed my eyes and let the water rinse away the night. I turned my face from the stream and began to wet my hair. When I opened my eyes, Ian was in the stall across from mine astonishing me yet again for the umpteenth time that evening.</p><p>He was staring at me, the water slicing down his head and down his shoulders. The stalls were too high to expose anything more. He could only see my face and top of my head but just knowing we were both naked and within ten feet of one another was enough to make me flush from head to toe. He was breathtaking. Breathtakingly sexy. Breathtakingly beautiful. Breathtakingly real. Just breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I choked out.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, flirtatiously smiling.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at him anymore, so I bent to grab my shampoo. After pouring a handful, I stood and purposely avoided his eyes, though the heat of his gaze was enough to make the water boil. I worked the soap through my hair from root to tip twice before almost losing it or worse, giggling uncontrollably. I ducked under the running water to rinse and caught his stare again.</p><p>I smiled the largest smile I owned because I just couldn\u2019t help it anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to wash your hair for you,\u201d he said suddenly, rocking me to my core and wiping that silly grin right off my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything for you to do just that,\u201d I told him candidly. This time he smiled and grabbed his own shampoo bottle.</p><p>He shampooed his hair and I bit my bottom lip to keep from saying something stupid like, \u201cLet me help you\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s conserve some of this water we\u2019re wasting.\u201d I blushed once more and he noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, turning to my bucket and grabbing my face soap.</p><p>I scrubbed my face much more thoroughly than I suppose was necessary, but I just couldn\u2019t look at him anymore. He was torturing me just by existing. I rinsed the soap from my face and grabbed my conditioner, applying a generous amount and letting it set in my hair while I used the loofah on the rest of my body. My smile just kept getting bigger and bigger and embarrassingly bigger. I tried to avoid looking at him but his laughing did nothing to help matters much.</p><p>Finally, when I\u2019d rinsed every last drop of soap from my body, I stood underneath the shower and began to rinse the conditioner. I looked his direction and it was obvious he was done but he was sticking around for the free show.</p><p>\u201cStill here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIf the situation were reversed?\u201d he countered.</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI\u2019d still be here,\u201d I told him, smiling again.</p><p>When I opened my eyes again, he\u2019d rested his forearms on the top of the edge of the stall, the water still cascading down his incredible skin. We kept up eye contact until the conditioner was long gone, no trace of it whatsoever anymore, but I continued longer than I should because it was Ian Aberdeen and his royal hotness was just as enthralled with me as I was with him. Eventually, I turned the water off and he followed my lead. I began to towel dry my hair and he wrapped his around his waist. I slipped on my robe and flip-flops.</p><p>We both stood there waiting for the other to get out. Neither of us wanting the incredibly frustrating but totally exhilarating past few minutes to end. Finally, Ian made a move, unlocking his stall door. I followed his lead and met him in the center of the stone walkway between our stalls.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, peering down at me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have?\u201d he asked, distracted.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, my eyes riveted by his lips.</p><p>He breathed heavily out his nose. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your side of the hut now.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to escort you.\u201d He paused, staring at my face. \u201cAny second now.\u201d Another pregnant pause as his eyes guided down my neck. \u201cJust as soon as I can uproot my feet from this stone, I\u2019m going to walk with you.\u201d He smiled taking in my face again.</p><p>I fought a smile of my own when he grabbed the lantern hanging on the hook above us, his broad chest expanding right in front of my face. We stood still for a minute.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I told him, walking away first.</p><p>He quickly caught up with me and held the lantern ahead of us. We didn\u2019t say a word on the short hike to our hut. We didn\u2019t even glance each other\u2019s direction. I walked right to my side and went inside, turning to say goodnight but he\u2019d already gone into his side, leaving me disappointed and just a teeny bit pissed.</p><p>I lit the small candle on my washstand and dressed in yoga pants with a long-sleeve fitted tee. I draped my wet towel at the foot of my bed and tossed my robe on its hook. I kept my flip-flops on because it was Uganda and you never took your shoes off ever. I\u2019d just finished brushing my teeth and hair when I heard a faint knock on my door.</p><p>My heart leapt into my throat. \u201cYes?\u201d I barely choked out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Ian said quietly. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glanced around my room a little bit frantic. I backed up a bit and stood beside my bed. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Ian tore through the door, the rush of wind snuffing out the candle, and stood looming over me in my small side of the hut. The door swung behind him and shut with a crack, startling me.</p><p>And just like that, Ian Aberdeen rushed me.</p><p>He grabbed my face and neck with his rough hands and brought me to him, practically lifting me to his lips. He devoured my mouth with his and I moaned into his mouth, spurring him on. His tongue found mine and it was warm and tasted of cinnamon.</p> <p>A rush of adrenaline spiked through my body and pooled in my belly. I wrapped my arms around his neck and he brought me closer to him, threading his fingers through my hair, rooting his fists at the back of my head, pulling lightly as if it was taking all his control not to throw me down on the bed. This made my eyes roll into the back of my head and I tightened my already closed lids.</p><p>He tore his lips from mine and we stood panting, the stars barely shining through the cracks in the door but enough to light up his face. I recognized his painfully strained expression. He didn\u2019t know if what he\u2019d done was okay with me, and I found myself so attracted to him for being so considerate. To reassure him, I ran my hands across his forehead to smooth out the lines.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I whispered before he attacked me again, hushing me on the \u201cn.\u201d</p><p>I gripped his shoulders as he harshly kissed my lips then followed my jaw line down my neck, making my head fell back. \u201cSophie,\u201d he sighed between each kiss, making my toes tingle. His mouth found mine again and I kissed him back hard, breathing him in as best I could. My hands found his hair and I pushed them through the length until they met his neck then climbed back up, entangling my fingers in the damp mass. It felt like I couldn\u2019t get close enough to him. I wrapped one leg around his calf and he groaned into my tongue, vibrating the back of my throat. I shivered.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I breathed into his mouth.</p> <p>He smiled against my teeth and it was the sexiest thing I\u2019d ever felt. \u201cYou taste like cherries,\u201d he told me. His voice shivered against my skin, making me smile back.</p><p>He rested his forehead against mine. \u201cYou taste like cinnamon,\u201d I countered.</p><p>He pulled himself away and immediately I hated it. \u201cGoodnight, Sophie Price.\u201d</p><p>He backed away from me slowly, never breaking his stare or his smile. He opened the door and let it fall shut again. \u201cSleep well,\u201d I heard through the cracks.</p><p>I brought my fingers to my smiling lips and ran them across the swollen skin. \u201cYou too,\u201d I answered so softly I barely heard it myself.</p><p>I\u2019d been kissed before, many times, but never like that.</p> <p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>I woke up in the middle of the night and felt like I\u2019d fallen asleep next to a blasting heater. In a sleep-induced haze, I figured it was just the warming temperatures outside. As strange as it seemed for Uganda\u2019s summer to be during America\u2019s winter, I was expecting it but I realized with a start that the unusual warmth was just a bit too hot.</p><p>I lazily opened my eyes and they were met with a dull pair of brown ones. I shot up.</p><p>\u201cMandisa!\u201d She wasn\u2019t responding to me and my heart leapt in my throat. \u201cMandisa, baby.\u201d I pushed her growing hair out of her eyes and tried to get her to look at me, but it did no good. I jumped to my feet and pushed my door open. It was still dark out. \u201cIan!\u201d I yelled, panicked.</p><p>Immediately, a disheveled Ian appeared next to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Tears began to spill. \u201cIt\u2019s Mandisa,\u201d I explained, pointing to my bed.</p><p>He ran to her side and felt her head and neck. \u201cShe\u2019s burning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen!\u201d I said, thinking of the nearest running water source.</p> <p>Ian scooped tiny Mandisa in his arms and he practically swallowed her small frame.</p><p>We ran around the baobab tree to the kitchen and I started running the cool water, plugging the drain. The stainless steel tub was large enough to submerge her.</p><p>I tossed a bunch of kitchen towels in the sink to cushion her and Ian rested her in the water. The cool water was shocking enough she should have protested but not a peep came from her tiny lips and I found myself taking my panic to the next level.</p><p>We frantically doused her to get her temperature down.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d I asked her after a few minutes but she didn\u2019t respond. \u201cGod, Ian,\u201d I breathed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Karina,\u201d he said and ran off toward hers and Charles\u2019 cabin.</p><p>I continuously covered her in the cool running water and prayed like I\u2019d never prayed before. I begged her under my breath to respond to me, but she just stared blankly ahead and my heart sank into my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d a sleepy Karina said.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d I heard Ian explain.</p><p>Karina came to my side quickly and brushed the hair from my shoulder with her hand, assuring me the way a mother would. \u201cIan,\u201d she said, looking down on Mandisa. \u201cGrab my kit, please?\u201d</p><p>Ian ran from the room and returned with Karina\u2019s big bag of remedies she kept handy at all times.</p><p>She pulled out a needle and looked over at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just an acetaminophen injection because she won\u2019t chew medicine.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as if my approval was even needed, but Karina gave me that respect anyway. She filled the needle and Ian helped me lift her shoulders. Karina dried and swabbed the little fleshy part of Mandisa\u2019s arm with alcohol then injected the medicine. I felt an almost immediate sense of relief knowing we were tending to the outside and Karina was tending to the inside.</p><p>Karina felt the water in the basin and asked Ian to drain it as Mandisa\u2019s body temperature was making it warm. He did as she asked then plugged the drain once more. \u201cKeep pouring that water over her head, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Ian and I worked methodically, pouring and draining, draining and pouring. Twenty minutes passed and Mandisa was noticeably cooler but still unresponsive.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she getting better?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe medicine will make her sleepy,\u201d Karina explained before grabbing my shoulder and turning me toward her. \u201cShe\u2019s also very sick, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Karina took her temperature and it was within a safer range so Ian grabbed a large towel and wrapped her little body up. I grabbed a clean smock from the laundry that looked like it would fit her and helped Karina change Mandisa into it. When she was all dry, I made Ian take her to my hut to sleep while we figured out where we were going to put everyone.</p><p>Karina left to check on all the children in their dorms to make sure no one else had fevers.</p><p>\u201cMy heart is in my throat,\u201d I said quietly after Ian tucked Mandisa in my bed.</p><p>He covered her loosely in my sheet and we silently watched her. He wrapped his arm around my shoulder and the flood of memories from the night before surfaced, reminding me that I was allowed to hug him. I grabbed him and buried my face in his chest, so grateful for his comfort. He ran his hands down my hair and kissed the top of my head, making me sigh.</p><p>A low knock sounded at the door and we pulled apart abruptly. It was apparent when our eyes caught that we didn\u2019t want to reveal ourselves to Karina, or anyone for that matter, until we had actually figured out what we were to each other.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I said, and Karina entered.</p><p>\u201cThree more,\u201d she explained, all life drained from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSophie and I will take care of the ill, Karina. We\u2019ve been vaccinated. We talked to Pembrook yesterday and he\u2019s arranged for a plane that should be here in within thirty-six hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered, grasping her heart. \u201cWe\u2019ll set all the ill in our cabin then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose unaffected should stay in the dorm, but those we suspect may be getting ill need to be sectioned off as well,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cSolomon and Ruth\u2019s, maybe?\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cWhere will they stay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve left with their children to Ruth\u2019s sister\u2019s house,\u201d Karina told us.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d Ian offered in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWhen she wakes,\u201d Karina said, pointing to Mandisa, \u201cmove her to our house.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded and Karina was gone.</p><p>We looked at each other and so many emotions flitted between us. In Ian\u2019s eyes I read the gravity of the storm that was brewing on our doorstep, selfish disappointment that we couldn\u2019t explore what was going on between us and obvious shame in that he thought of himself when he shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t blame him because I was thinking the same thing. I grabbed his hand to reassure him that it would happen, that we\u2019d get our day. He smiled softly and that was all the time we allowed to acknowledge that disappointment. We had bigger fish to fry.</p><p>The next day and a half was pure chaos. Mercy was the only adult who seemed to be affected unless the virus was still incubating, but that was okay with us just as long as the vaccines came soon. Ian and I spent the next night repeatedly up and down, caring for very ill children, reducing fevers, treating symptoms and working our fingers to the bone in a futile attempt to disinfect.</p><p>Every few hours we\u2019d get a new kid. We were running out of fever reducers and saline bags. Our only hope was the shipment and that was arriving later that second evening. We got hold of Pemmy once more and he informed us that I, personally, would have to sign for the shipment at seven.</p><p>Karina agreed to help us get the infected children in the best possible place before we left and she would sit with them until Ian and I could get back. In total, we had seven ill children, and four we suspected would eventually become ill. The remaining, we kept as far away as possible.</p><p>When we were as prepared as we could possibly get, we made our way to Charles\u2019 truck. Karina had yet to see Ian\u2019s jeep and we wanted to keep it that way. Charles was nervous the news of our attack would send his wife over the edge, so we repaired it as much as we could with what little we had and kept it hidden.</p><p>When he started the engine, it was quieter than Ian\u2019s rumbling jeep. I rested the back of my head against the seat and closed my eyes, yawning. When I opened them and peered back at Ian, he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sherlock.\u201d</p><p>He laughed louder, making my heart sputter. \u201cIrritable when you\u2019re tired, are we?\u201d</p><p>I smiled across the seat at him. \u201cIrritable, are we?\u201d I mocked, pathetically attempting his Sith Ifrican accent, which made him laugh even harder.</p><p>\u201cJust a bundle of laughs today,\u201d I teased, drawing out my words from sleepiness.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a bit delirious with the only,\u201d he pitched his brows toward the roof of the jeep, \u201cseven hours of sleep I got in the past two days.\u201d</p><p>I yawned loudly at the mere mention of sleep. I leaned my head against the window. \u201cClasses are cancelled for two days after the kids recover. I\u2019m making an executive decision and I\u2019m going to sleep for both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I get to sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes bugged from my head. \u201cPardon?\u201d I asked in disbelief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian stared at me, eyes wide. \u201cI-I just meant...I meant that, uh, that I also wanted to sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cI mean, not with you but sleep in my own bed during the time in which you also sleep...in your bed. We\u2019d be asleep in two separate beds. You in yours and me in mine.\u201d One of his hands left the steering wheel and ran the length of his face. \u201cGod, I\u2019m deprived.\u201d A quick glance my way. \u201cOf sleep! Deprived of sleep!\u201d His hand slapped the wheel. \u201cGod, shut up, Din.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him softly. \u201cI got you, Ian.\u201d Boy, do I ever.</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising I slept most of the way to Kampala. We arrived shortly before the plane was scheduled to land and rushed into the airport.</p><p>\u201cDoes this bring back memories?\u201d I asked Ian.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt certainly does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely did not hate you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, just admit it. You kind of did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were worth Masego\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. I guess I kind of deserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I made a rash judgment. It also didn\u2019t help you were so goddamn beautiful.\u201d</p><p>My breath sucked into my lungs and I couldn't think to respond, so I let him grab my hand and lead me through to the tarmac just as our plane descended. I felt a weight lift from my shoulders when the tires touched down. Our hands broke and we rushed the cargo plane. I didn\u2019t want to think what it cost to arrange for that. When the hatch lowered and the deck collapsed, tears spilled down my face.</p><p>Pembrook, dressed in the most ridiculously hilarious outfit I\u2019d ever seen him in, jeans and a flipping t-shirt, struck ground. The same ground I stood on, Pembrook stood upon and I felt like a little piece of home had followed him. I may not have had the best home life, but it was all I had ever known before Uganda. I was well-traveled, yes, but they aren\u2019t lying when they say home is where the heart is.</p> <p>My cheeks flushed as I turned toward Ian who approached Pembrook as I stood mute a few feet behind. He was my new home. Ian was home. Butterflies rushed throughout my entire body and my hands clenched the shirt that lay at my stomach. Oh my God.</p><p>Pembrook waved my direction and approached me. I met him halfway and yelled over the deafening engines. \u201cPemmy! I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I, but I thought I\u2019d take a few days off and check on you. Report back to your father that you\u2019re still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pemmy, but we both know my father doesn\u2019t care how I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not....\u201d he began, but I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still glad you came.\u201d</p><p>He smiled warmly and hugged me hello. I realized then that Pembrook was my family. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Sophie,\u201d he said, patting my back. He pulled me from his arms and examined me. \u201cYou look...well, not dead.\u201d</p><p>Ian and I both laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been up caring for ill children, Pembrook, cut me some slack, will ya?\u201d I teased. He watched me for a moment as if he wasn\u2019t sure if it was me or not and that made me laugh harder.</p> <p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYes, yes. It\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Follow me,\u201d he ordered and marched up the hatch into the hull of the plane. \u201cI took the liberty of getting as much as I could think to replenish what supplies you\u2019ve already used as well as for future use.\u201d</p><p>My eyes took in the boxes and boxes of saline, different meds, needles, sterile gloves, etc. and I almost cried. I lovingly ran my hand across the top of the saline boxes. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? You asked. You\u2019re my, ahem, employer and I complied.\u201d</p><p>I turned and rolled my eyes at him. \u201cThank you anyway, employee Pembrook. You went above and beyond the job requirement.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can get permission to bring Charles\u2019 truck around. Be right back,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>I watched Ian walk away and continued to watch him until I could no longer see him.</p><p>Pemmy cleared his throat, snapping me away from my stare. I turned to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d he asked simply.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I answered without hesitation, startling even myself with how easy it was to admit it.</p><p>Suddenly an idea took hold. Christmas. It was only six weeks away. It was going to be my first warm Christmas. My family had always flown to Switzerland for the holiday for no other reason other than my mother\u2019s friends vacationed there together.</p><p>\u201cListen, before Ian returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d he asked, amused.</p><p>I waved him off. \u201cDingane, whatever.\u201d But paused, an overwhelming need to defend him bubbled forth. \u201cHis name is Ian, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d he asked, stupefied.</p><p>I felt my face warm. \u201cYes, anyway, before he comes back, I need to arrange to have a plane return here in a few weeks time. Can we make that happen? You\u2019re a signer on my account. You can use my private funds if my dad won\u2019t let you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said, bemused. \u201cYour father has given me carte blanche to give you whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sophie. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cA generator, first and foremost. For God\u2019s sake, a flipping generator big enough to run an orphanage for weeks at a time. Something substantial as well as the necessary hands to install it.\u201d I ticked hundreds of things off my mental list, a list I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d been keeping mindful of. Huh. I snapped my fingers. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019d also like you to arrange for a construction company to rebuild the main house with an up-to-date kitchen, big enough to prepare meals for at least a hundred children, bring the supplies as well as the hands from America.\u201d</p><p>My imagination was running wild. Pembrook had filled pages of the little pad he\u2019d been writing my demands in. He occasionally shook his hand out, but I kept going, afraid I\u2019d forget it once it slipped from my tongue. I imagined a much better Masego by the time I would have to leave.</p><p>Have to leave.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten. I was going to be leaving Masego in a few short weeks. I had two months left. That was all. A feeling of dread filled me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d like boxes of shoes,\u201d I mentioned frantically, \u201cmore than they\u2019ll need, enough to fill a room with, including clothing, smocks for the girls, uniforms for the boys, varying sizes. Call TOMS Shoes in Dallas, let him know what you\u2019re doing, they\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>I chewed my thumbnail, something I never did. I would tell Pembrook all the time how it ruined a girl\u2019s nails and only trash did it. I noticed him regard me and I pulled it from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs-is that all?\u201d he asked, obviously stunned.</p><p>\u201cToys. Wrapped. For some reason, the only thing the girls here like to play is house. So lots of that crap. The boys can think of nothing but soccer. Make sure we get them before Christmas. Is two weeks prior sufficient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It got silent as I continued to pace the width of the plane. I looked up and noticed Pembrook\u2019s mouth gaping.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, examining his lengthy list, but I knew him well enough to recognize I\u2019d astonished him. I felt a slight pang in my chest that I could have possibly made him proud.</p><p>I heard Charles\u2019 truck rumble near the hatch of the plane and I turned to Pembrook. \u201cNot a word, cool?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in acknowledgement.</p><p>Ian and I helped the crew load everything Pembrook had brought and when it was as full I\u2019d ever seen it, Pembrook hugged me tightly. \u201cGive Charles and Karina my love?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, afraid if I said anything I\u2019d cry. Pembrook shook Ian\u2019s hand and we watched him disappear behind the rising hatch. \u201cHe loves you,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>A tear slipped free. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>Apparently, four more children had gotten ill during the nine hours we\u2019d been away when we arrived around five in the morning. When all I had been thinking about was sleep, Karina approached us both with two giant cups of coffee. I selfishly cringed but quickly scolded myself. We all unloaded the supplies and readied to inoculate all the children.</p><p>We administered vaccines to all the adults then sent them on their way to set up stations at all three quarantines. I secreted one off to Mandisa and stuck her as soon as I possibly could. I wanted her to get better immediately. Selfish, I know, to put her before any of the other children, but I felt like Mandisa was mine. I can honestly say I didn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>After each child received their shot, we replaced empty saline bags and treated fevers just as the sun was rising.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s almost twenty-four hours straight without sleep,\u201d Ian sleepily said, stumbling toward me in Charles and Karina\u2019s cabin. He fumbled across the sofa I was strewn across and laid next to me, his eyes closing quickly.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Aberdeen,\u201d I lazily drawled, a secret smile gracing my lips.</p><p>He grinned, his lids still seemingly fused. He knew exactly what I\u2019d meant. \u201cI will,\u201d he promised around gleamingly white teeth, throwing an arm over my shoulders. The smile slowly slipped from his lips and his breathing deepened and steadied. Then it was my turn, though I\u2019m sure my smiled stayed.</p><p>Around two in the afternoon, I woke to children\u2019s laughter and a heavy arm laid across my back. I peeled open one lid and faced the back of the couch. I quickly shut them, my nose scrunched together in an effort to keep them closed, and listened for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d I heard Mandisa ask someone.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sleeping, Mandisa, leave them be,\u201d Karina answered. Her voice was lighter and I breathed a sigh of relief. I could tell the vaccines were working because Mandisa was lucid. My heart soared.</p><p>\u201cHe will bury her,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cHe will not,\u201d Karina said, giggling. She was in the kitchen, stirring something in a metal pot. I could hear the gentle rhythm of the spoon scrape the bottom back and forth.</p><p>\u201cHe will. He is too big. He is going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandisa,\u201d Karina playfully admonished.</p><p>\u201cWe get him off her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandisa, come over here and sit on this chair,\u201d Karina ordered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave. I have to watch he does not cut off her air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have crayons,\u201d Karina tempted.</p><p>I heard hesitant little feet walk to the table. She began coloring and I could hear each individual stroke against the wood tabletop.</p><p>\u201cThey are married?\u201d Mandisa asked after a few minutes. I was forced to bite my lip to keep from bursting out in laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Karina answered.</p><p>\u201cBut his hand is on her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was an accident, Mandisa. He wasn\u2019t trying to be disrespectful to her. They were probably very, very tired from caring for you and your brothers and sisters last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is okay this time then,\u201d Mandisa concluded.</p><p>\u201cYes, because it was an accident,\u201d Karina said, though a bit too loudly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My shoulders shook with silent giggles until Ian\u2019s fingers bit down slightly on the skin of my shoulder, sending tingles down my arms and sobering me quickly from the flush the touch his hand gave me. His face was buried in my left side and I felt the slightest brushed kiss against my shirt there. It was warm and sweet and sent my eyes rolling into the back of my head. I stifled a shudder and awaited his next move. His thumb stroked small circles against the shoulder bone there, so softly the movement didn\u2019t even register with my eagle-eyed babysitter. It sent me into an internal frenzy. I wanted so badly for him to tuck me into his side tightly and kiss my neck until I fell to pieces.</p><p>I sighed softly, inaudibly, and felt Ian grin into my shoulder. He was so unbelievably sexy and I didn\u2019t think he was even trying. I stilled my body in preparation for whatever he had planned and I thought I was ready for anything. Anything except what he did next.</p><p>I felt his warm breath, concentrated on it, reveled in it even, right before he softly bit through my shirt and caught a bit of skin gently. My breath caught in my throat and I swallowed hard. He caught the movement and I felt his chest inhale quickly against my back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he whispered so softly I barely heard him.</p> <p>My body felt cemented in place next to his, as if his mere suggestion dictated law and I was powerless but to obey. It sent a thrilling buzz permeating throughout my abdomen and chest, tingling right through to my toes.</p><p>\u201cFeel this,\u201d he told me before letting his fingertips flow like water over the curves of my hand laying flat on the sofa, out of sight.</p><p>I closed my eyes and let the drugging, lazy sensations of his touch drag through my limb, sedating it to the point of numbness. It was such a heady, provocative feeling. I felt my cheeks blush bright pink. My body flushed with warmth every single time the tip of his finger found the curve of my thumb and again when he reached the pad of my ring finger. He chased that warmth so slowly, seemingly stretching time, and traced it like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world...except for me.</p><p>My chest swelled with something I couldn\u2019t quite peg but I let it saturate my soul and heart anyway because it was the best feeling I\u2019d ever felt and I would have paid any amount of money for it to continue.</p><p>We were suddenly startled when we heard the cough of one of the kids in Karina\u2019s bedroom and we both bolted upright, ready to aid them.</p> <p>Karina looked on us softly and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve got it. Lay back down,\u201d she said kindly.</p><p>When she left the room, Mandisa followed. Ian sat in front of me but moved to face me and I looked on him differently than I had the night before. My hand moved to his face and my fingers sketched his solid chin around to his high cheekbone and up to his temple. I dragged my thumb down the bridge of his nose and over the tops of his lips. His bottom lip caught a bit and it briefly exposed his perfect teeth. I pressed both hands to his cheeks and stared into his eyes when he lifted his own arms and dragged his fingers through the hair at my temple, fisting it into the length at the sides of my head. He held them there, staring back.</p><p>We heard Karina move toward the door and I could tell we were both loath to stop touching one another. Skin to skin felt so right, so, so, right. Our hands gently fell away and the pull to put them back was overwhelming. We both stood for a moment, intensely staring, then Ian walked past me without a word toward Karina\u2019s room, greeting her at her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Din,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cGood morning, Karina.\u201d He walked past her into her bedroom, probably to check on whoever was coughing and Karina approached me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my love,\u201d she said, embracing me tightly.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about Din\u2019s jeep,\u201d she spoke into my hair.</p><p>My stomach fell to the floor. \u201cOh, uh, about that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, brushing my hair back. \u201cI\u2019m grateful you decided to wait to tell me. I don\u2019t think I could have handled it all at once.\u201d She smiled sweetly and I kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHow are the children?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMiraculously improved,\u201d she stated with a wink.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop the smile blasting across my face, not that I wanted to. \u201cWhat a relief,\u201d I sighed, sagging back onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful,\u201d she said, her eyes glassing over.</p> <p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I told her, patting her weathered hand relaxed on the armrest. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful,\u201d I said quietly, but the phrase meant so much more than it implied.</p><p>Over the next few days, life returned to normal at Masego, our inventory was restocked, children gained energy and classes resumed. Ian and I didn\u2019t get to sleep for two days, but we did get back into some sort of routine and that made it easier to stay rested. We would check daily for footprints encompassing the fresh water source and the small wooded area near the property where Ian taught me how to handle a gun. We were lucky in that we found nothing. We were more certain every day that whoever had come previously was just passing through.</p><p>Ian and I flirted quietly every opportunity we got, careful not to bring any attention to ourselves, and it was effortless. I discovered over those few days that my heart felt fuller and I was falling in love with him.</p><p>Every time I approached a door, he would speed ahead and make sure he was there to open it for me. Every time I made the slightest mention I was hot, he was there with shade. If I was cold, his arms circled around me. If I was tired, he was there for me to lean on. He was sweet and attentive yet didn\u2019t overwhelm me. He was subtle.</p><p>He once told me how strong he found me and how he thought I could do anything, how the only reason he helped me was because he wanted to, because he was purely selfish, he said. It was incredibly flattering. He proved it constantly by letting me decide when and where I needed him. I was learning the language and it got easier every day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday!\u201d Karina yelled over the din of chattering children at breakfast one morning and they all cheered in response.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re adorable,\u201d I told Ian and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a special surprise for you!\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ian asked me, nudging his shoulder with mine.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting warm again!\u201d Cheering. \u201cSo we\u2019re going swimming at our favorite spot.\u201d Louder cheering.</p><p>Ian clapped his hands once and rubbed them together. His brow raised slightly and he leaned into me. \u201cPrice, get your suit.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s all he said before skipping out and heading toward our huts.</p><p>Kids started eating quickly and taking their bowls to Kate before running off to their rooms to get whatever swimming gear they had. I wondered what they had before a thought occurred to me. I\u2019d only brought a bikini, never thinking I\u2019d actually use it. I knew this wouldn\u2019t fly with Karina because Ugandan girls weren\u2019t even allowed to wear pants let alone expose their stomachs. I couldn\u2019t imagine Karina would approve.</p><p>I stood up and made my way to her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can swim, K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t actually bring a decent suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, do you have a t-shirt? Shorts?\u201d I nodded. \u201cYou can wear those over whatever suit you did bring. The kids will think nothing of it since you wear jeans every day anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think so,\u201d I told her and made my way to my half of the hut.</p><p>I could hear Ian scrambling around in his room and I smiled. I changed into my suit and felt practically naked. It wasn\u2019t considered outrageous back home. It wasn\u2019t a string, just a standard bikini, but it was definitely not Ugandan appropriate.</p><p>I considered myself in the mirror for a moment. I\u2019d lost any remotely fleshy part of my body to the hard work Masego had put me through. My fingers ran down my stomach and across each raised muscle. My parents had graciously paid Raul, my personal trainer, tens of thousands of dollars to try to get me to look like this because I was determined to have it, but he could never accomplish it, not like that anyway. I wanted to burst out laughing thinking how all I\u2019d needed to do was volunteer at an orphanage in Uganda to earn it and now I didn\u2019t even care that it existed. Suddenly, my caring about what I looked like was trumped by the health of little kids instead. Irony, I suppose.</p><p>I let my hair fall free for once and smiled secretly to myself at how it would drive Ian crazy. I pulled a band around my wrist for later, tossed on a tank and a pair of cut-off denim shorts that cost three hundred dollars back home. I remembered thinking how I\u2019d gotten such a great deal on them, which made me roll my eyes at myself. I forwent the boots for once and put on my old running shoes, the ones I\u2019d brought with no intention of bringing back because they were \u201clast season.\u201d I grabbed a drawstring bag and put a t-shirt to swim in, a bottle of sunblock, and my small radio. I tore open a new package of new batteries for it, agreeing with myself that this occasion warranted it. This was a time for celebration. P.S. I\u2019m going to throw an absolutely mind-blowing fact your way. I\u2019m not kidding, either. The country of Uganda is obsessed with Celine Dion. They dedicate entire days to broadcasting her music. They love her that much. Five words. My. Heart. Will. Go. On. Yeah.</p><p>I heard a soft knock at the door and opened it to Ian. I got to see his legs for the first time since I\u2019d met him and couldn\u2019t believe a man\u2019s calves could be that developed. I stood gape mouthed like a buffoon staring at them.</p><p>When I finally caught myself, my gaze raised to Ian\u2019s face and I was shocked to find he was equally as engrossed as I was. My laugh startled him and he shook his head.</p><p>His mouth worked a bit and he swallowed. \u201cYou-you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Karina took Charles\u2019 truck and we took the jeep and filled them both with the smaller children. The older kids would walk the quarter mile to the swimming hole with Katie and Charles. Mandisa moved to sit on my lap immediately, and I let her, kissing the top of her head as Ian started the engine.</p><p>When we unloaded the last of the jeep and truck and the kids started running for the water, I impulsively raised my face and hands, palms up and let the rays of the sun wash over me. It was bright and warm and felt so good against my skin. I sighed. There was just something about the sun. I drank its heat deep and breathed easily, closing my eyes and wondering to myself why I never really saw it for what it was before I'd come to Uganda.</p><p>I'd discovered that the sun equated happiness. Its bright and lovely existence was hope incarnate. It exposed the dark, brought forth the light and showed you that no matter how strong or oppressive the night was, that it was infinitely stronger, exponentially more substantial and just because you couldn't see it with your eyes, didn't mean it wasn't still with you, that you couldn't feel it or that it wouldn't come back for you. It was stalwart and constant. It was infinite.</p><p>I followed the sound of boisterous laughter to the water\u2019s edge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep the smaller ones here on the shallower edge,\u201d Ian told me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>He raised his left hand and placed his palm on the back of my neck, sending a tight heat barreling through my body only for it to settle in my belly. I smiled at him. He flirtatiously smiled back and I bit my bottom lip to keep from laughing. He squeezed a little bit and dropped his hand. I felt a little sad for the brief moment his skin had touched mine. It never seemed long enough. It was incredible to me that I felt that way.</p><p>Every time I\u2019d ever let a boy touch my body felt suddenly wrong, suddenly heavy on the heart and soul and I found myself regretting my past life. I\u2019d never really felt that before. I steeled myself against the guilt though, knowing how sorry I was for it. I stood taller, lighter, knowing that although the grief of regret laid heavily on my heart, it didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t move forward, that God wouldn\u2019t forgive me. It also meant that I could forgive myself, especially since I then knew exactly what it meant to be treated with respect. And that was a heady, heavy feeling of euphoria.</p><p>A few minutes passed and the older children joined in the raucous. I\u2019d never seen such purely happy people in my entire life. They screamed with joy, jumped and dived, splashed and played with one another. They had this moment and they were ecstatic. They had this simple joy and it was free. Another something I never thought possible. To me, the only time I\u2019d ever convinced myself I was happy was when I could whip out my credit card and charge it.</p> <p>I\u2019d come to Uganda to fulfill a mandatory sentence but was being fulfilled in a completely unexpected manner and happily, with my full consent. I\u2019d come to help teach these children but instead they were teaching me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Ian asked me, his eyes roaming the water\u2019s edge and his mouth silently counting heads.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an untruth,\u201d he teased, glancing my direction and prodding his shoulder with mine.</p><p>\u201cFine, if you have to know,\u201d I happily pushed back, glad for the brief contact. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m very happy I came to this place.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened briefly and he studied me intently. \u201cWhat brought on this revelation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem,\u201d I said, pointing to the boisterous laughing orphans sloshing about.</p><p>\u201cAnd why, Sophie Price, have they made you so happy, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are funny little representatives of simplicity, of awareness. No one is more aware of themselves as these children are. They have nothing, have no one but us, have seemingly no reason to be hopeful...yet they are. They choose to be happy even though the obviously easier choice would be to be frightened or sad and they have real reason to be those things as well. But they have life and faith and hope and love and they choose those things. Their innocence is addicting, their hope is catching and I\u2019m happy to be surrounded by them.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t even acknowledge what I\u2019d told him. Instead, he looked at me. Really looked at me. It was a deep, penetrating stare, one that a few months before would have left me quaking in my metaphorical boots but not then. Then, I found myself opening the window further for him. I leaned over the ledge and reached my hands out to him to bring him even closer. I was inviting him to see me as I was because I was no longer ashamed. I\u2019d tossed the heavy, bleak curtains, removed the grime coating the view and opened myself up.</p><p>His tense shoulders relaxed and finally he nodded but only once. We both turned back toward the water and did our jobs.</p> <p>Three hours later and the kids were exhausted and starving. We loaded everyone up again, half of our jeep was already full of sleeping children and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little at how adorable I found that. Ian and I jumped into the front seats and started the engine but Charles unexpectedly ran up to Ian\u2019s window.</p><p>\u201cKarina and I thought you two may want an afternoon break?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could drive the jeep back and you two could stay and swim for a while, as long as you\u2019re okay with walking back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked Charles.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised, Sophie. You and Din have done a lot the past few days. Everyone needs a little break now and then.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>We watched the dust from the trucks settle as the jeeps bumbled through the dusty field and toward Masego. My heart leapt in my chest instantly knowing Ian and I were alone for, really, the first time. There would be no children ready to jump out from corners or Masego adults with their watchful eyes, memorizing our every move.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone,\u201d Ian whispered, startling me.</p><p>I turned toward him, my lids feeling a bit too heavy from the heat of the sun. Or was it the heat of his stare?</p> <p>\u201cVery,\u201d was all I could muster.</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes traveled from my face down my neck and over my shoulder, the searing fiery gaze branded as it trickled over my skin and soon his hand found that very neck, shoulder and arm until it wrapped itself around my own hand. He brought me closer to him and whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d he said quietly before a slow-burning grin split him from ear to ear.</p><p>My heart leapt into my throat when I took in the sparkle in his eyes. He winked once, as if in slow motion, and that was my cue. I took off running toward the water, my lungs pumping air in and out of my chest as I hurdled plant life and rock. The only sounds I could hear were the rhythmic pounding of blood in my eardrums on beat with each drop of Ian\u2019s boots behind me. Adrenaline raced through me knowing he was so near. He seemed to be getting closer and I couldn\u2019t fight the grin spreading slowly across my face in anticipation.</p><p>A slight giggle escaped my lips imagining the prospect of what was to come. I caught the sound of Ian\u2019s breath hitching before I felt him move even faster, his heat giving away just how nearby he was.</p><p>A burst of laughter fell from me when his hands scooped me up around the waist, dragging me to him. His arms enveloped my entire body when he knew he had me, his hands wrapped my shoulders and we tumbled to the ground just short of the water. We were both laughing hysterically despite the fact we were sides deep in mud.</p><p>\u201cYou almost made it,\u201d he teased in my neck.</p><p>\u201cI slowed on purpose,\u201d I lied.</p><p>He laughed loudly.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>My wide smile met his.</p><p>He stood and dragged me up with him. \u201cCare to join me?\u201d he asked, toeing his shoes off.</p><p>I gulped.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>He stopped mid-bend to remove his shoe and studied me. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I only had this bikini thing I\u2019d brought from home and I-uh-I\u2019m not exactly decent, but I don\u2019t want to get this t-shirt wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeadly,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYou do know this water is fairly clear, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that clear, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He did that thing boys do where they pull their shirts over their heads with one swoop. I felt drunk with too much eye consumption. My stare roamed his incredibly chest and stomach and my mouth gaped. I tucked my tongue back into my mouth and bit my lip to keep it from falling back out. He winked and I laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d I told him, setting up my little iPod station and turning up the volume to American Daydream by Electric Guest.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, Ian. Go ahead and put your fine self in that water.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed my cheek before diving in quickly. His head bobbed up, water sluicing down his neck and shoulders, his wet hair dark as night. Butterflies swarmed.</p><p>\u201cStay facing that way, \u201c I told him.</p><p>He visibly sighed but kept his back toward me. I bent to remove my shoes and shimmied from my shorts and t-shirt. My arms instinctively covered my stomach knowing what Karina would say if she saw me in that moment.</p><p>\u201cHurry up!\u201d Ian yelled.</p><p>\u201cI am! I am!\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I toed the water and hissed at how cold it was. I hated that part. I edged my way in, cringing with every step until my body became accustomed to the temperature just as Agnes Obel\u2019s Avenue began to play.</p><p>When I was shoulder deep, I called out to him. \u201cOkay, you can turn now.\u201d</p><p>He turned and smiled. \u201cIt was a futile effort, you know?\u201d he said, stalking me slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d I asked, backing up as he edged my direction.</p><p>\u201cMaking me turn. It was a pointless effort,\u201d he said, closing in.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, gulping down a giddy giggle.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said, rushing me playfully and wrapping his hands around my waist. My hands rested on his wet shoulders. \u201cTsk, tsk, Miss Price, skin to skin. What would Karina say?\u201d</p><p>I pushed at his chest. \u201cIan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only playing.\u201d He ran his hands up my back and settled them on my neck. \u201cThere. Comfortable?\u201d</p><p>I jokingly pushed him a little in answer.</p><p>It got quiet for a moment. He reached both hands up and ran them over the top of my head and gathered the rest of my hair, twisting it in a fist at the back of my neck. \u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d he told my brow.</p><p>My heart dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, suddenly confused, my stomach mixing space with my heart.</p><p>\u201cMy brother Simon wrote me last week asking if I\u2019d come home for a two-day visit. It seems he has something to tell me and he\u2019d prefer to do it in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I-I-I mean, that\u2019s-that\u2019s great, Ian. When do you leave?\u201d I asked, swallowing back my uneasiness.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him to go. I realized in that moment that I equated Ian with security. The idea of him gone made my chest press and feel tight.</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow,\u201d he told me, running his thumbs across my forehead and down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cSo-so soon?\u201d I gulped.</p><p>\u201cI realize it\u2019s short notice and all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was wondering if, maybe, you might be interested in going with?\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot open. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSeriously. It\u2019s only two days. Karina already said yes. She\u2019ll keep that out of the report she is sending back with you for court,\u201d he winked.</p><p>My heart started pounding but this time in excitement. \u201cOh my word, yes.\u201d</p><p>He picked me up and swung me around in the water. \u201cGood,\u201d he simply stated.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Simon wants?\u201d I asked when he set me back down.</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cNo earthly idea, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll be meeting my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou-you are?\u201d I asked, stunned. No one had ever willingly wanted me to meet their parents before.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ian explained, looking at me like I was making no sense. \u201cSimon especially will adore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Simon older or younger?\u201d I asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s older, twenty-five, the charming one. My parents adore him. He\u2019s also the one who always gets the girls.\u201d</p><p>I balked at that. \u201cMy God, he\u2019s the one who gets the girls? What? Is he made of chocolate or something? I can\u2019t imagine anyone would be interested in anyone else but you, no matter who you\u2019re pitted against.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian tugged me closer and kissed my neck. \u201cNo need to flatter me, Miss Price. I believe your bait worked. I\u2019m hooked. Line and sinker.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him, one brow raised. \u201cI keep reeling you in, Ian Aberdeen, but you\u2019re proving a difficult catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Utter crap. You snap your finger and I jump from water to boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m still flopping at your feet, like a pathetic fool, awaiting your next move and severely out of breath.\u201d</p><p>I inched closer, resting my forehead against his. \u201cHow about I put you out of your misery then, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Ian narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cIt\u2019s such a delicious agony though.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>Karina took us to the airport where we hopped on a plane for a short twelve-hour adventure from Uganda to Cape Town, South Africa, with layovers in Nairobi and Johannesburg. It hardly seemed worth the two-day stay, but I quickly reminded myself that it was totally worth seeing Ian outside our daily lives at Masego.</p> <p>I was so relieved to touch down in Cape Town that I didn\u2019t take in the startling differences between classes on the fifteen-minute drive into town right away. Five minutes in and my view on the right and left side of the highway was a stark contrast to say the least.</p><p>\u201cMy God, look at that,\u201d I sighed through the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ian asked, scooting up in his seat next to me, leaning over me to see what I was looking at.</p><p>On our right were decent, clean homes, well maintained and obviously inhabited by more affluent owners. On our left was what I could only describe as a slum. Homes, if you could call them that, made of tin roofs, dirt floors, a makeshift town really. It looked like a haven for disease and I was willing to bet lots of crime.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I said, gesturing to both sides of the road with my hands.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he acknowledged, sliding back into his seat, obviously accustomed to the sights.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cVery sad,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a stunning contrast in living conditions it feels like a punch to the gut.\u201d I studied row after row of slapdash homes.</p><p>\u201cAs an American, I can definitely identify that my country has little to no idea what poverty really is. The worst living conditions I\u2019d ever been exposed to back home pale in comparison. It\u2019s literally embarrassing that we complain at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just don\u2019t know, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just stay ignorant, Ian,\u201d I answered in kind to which he could only smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was probably the most dense of all of them,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He slid his hand over mine and squeezed softly.</p> <p>\u201cNo longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo longer,\u201d I repeated, squeezing back. I took a deep breath. \u201cWhy don\u2019t those in charge do something about this?\u201d</p><p>To this Ian laughed suddenly and hysterically.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Sophie Price, you\u2019ll get the opportunity. Just wait,\u201d he told me, still laughing.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m missing something,\u201d I smiled back.</p><p>\u201cMy mother is the executive mayor of Cape Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was familiar with your politics, I\u2019d probably know how grave that declaration was, but I\u2019m not, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe executive mayor of Cape Town is essentially the big dog on the block. She\u2019s the equivalent of the governor of an American state or the mayor of New York City.\u201d</p><p>My mouth went dry and I desperately tried to swallow something that wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cThe executive mayor. Why the hell didn\u2019t you explain this to me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I told you they were in politics down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured they were council people or something equally mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoph,\u201d he said, brows furrowed, \u201cwhy would the son of a councilman have top billing in the newspapers here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured news was a little slow here.\u201d</p><p>Ian laughed again. \u201cCape Town is one of the biggest towns in Africa, let alone South Africa.\u201d He sobered. \u201cI can relate to you more than you could possibly know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d I told him, thinking of the gossip rags back in L.A. and how they all bit at the opportunity to expose the Price \u201cdarling, trust fund baby\u201d as a whorish coke head when Jerrick died and how they\u2019d followed me for months, tripping over themselves to catch me falter again.</p><p>They relished in the drama, in the darkness that was their profession. They were little slithering snakes, their forked tongues extended to catch the slightest bit of gos-sss-ip. I shuddered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Ian said, breaking me from my revelry, \u201cthey know you\u2019re coming and more than likely have done their research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I told him in return, \u201cmy father\u2019s aware they\u2019ve done their research by now and has probably already figured out an opportunity to milk the acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him in mock sympathy. \u201cIan Aberdeen, you\u2019ve no idea what he\u2019s capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019ll be in good company then,\u201d he said, wrapping his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re starting to scare me,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Ian\u2019s parents\u2019 home was found in Clifton Beach, an area so wealthy in Cape Town even I\u2019d heard of it, despite my not being familiar with much of anything concerning South Africa.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wealthy,\u201d I stated as fact, watching the security guards check several cars as they attempted to pass the entry gates.</p><p>\u201cNo, my parents are wealthy.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this change your opinion of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d I told him, hoping he\u2019d never get the opportunity to absorb the cold monstrosity that was my own parents\u2019 estate.</p><p>The house was massive considering how tightly situated the neighborhood was. Crowded but extremely luxurious homes threaded up the side of Table Mountain, winding and conforming to the mountainside. Ian\u2019s home was a modern multilevel home that adapted to the rock face it set itself within.</p><p>When our little car pulled into the drive, Ian had to get out to open the cedar sliding gate. I watched as we wound up a dark rock drive all the way to the towering house that settled so ominously within the cliff face.</p><p>\u201cHome sweet home,\u201d Ian deadpanned.</p><p>He grabbed my bag as well as his and we climbed the steep walkway to a wide cedar door. Adrenaline inundated me. I glanced down at myself and felt suddenly nervous. My father would not approve of my choice of outfit. In fact, there would be serious consequences if he ever found out I met the executive mayor of Cape Town, South Africa, in anything other than Chanel.</p><p>I could just imagine him. \u201cSophie, this is unacceptable. I require so little of you. Keep up appearances, Sophie Price. Keep up appearances. Keep up appearances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ian asked, dropping his bag and using his free hand to caress the side of my arm.</p><p>I plastered a fake smile on my face. \u201cOf course, just nervous, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>He smiled genuinely in return. \u201cNo worries, love. My brother will love you at least and that\u2019s the only one we need to care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow encouraging,\u201d I joshed.</p><p>He dropped his bag next to mine and held both my shoulders in his wide hands. \u201cTrust me, Soph, even if my parents end up loving you, it should mean very little to you. They\u2019re impressed only with what others can do for them. They run their campaigns on serving the poor here, just as so many before them, but the slums are still here. You saw them. They almost encourage government reliance. It\u2019s sickening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re politicians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding when you said they\u2019d get on well with my dad then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really wasn\u2019t.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside. They\u2019re probably watching us on the cameras,\u201d he said, waving sarcastically at the discrete camera tucked behind a crevice.</p><p>He pushed open the heavy door and revealed the interior. Seventy-five hundred square feet of modern art and it could only be described as dark. Dark slate, cool brushed nickel railings surrounding the entire five-level, tiered property. The floor plan encouraged lots of open outdoor living and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Living spaces opened up to the outside by way of glass accordion doors. The architecture was a nod to classic mid-century modern and the furniture was no different. It was cold and perfect and everything had a place. It made my stomach turn.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d Ian called out, startling me.</p><p>He dropped our bags just inside and walked with purpose through the picturesque living room to the glass wall. He slid one panel into another until they met the sidewall and exposed us to the rich sea air. The salt blasted my skin and I reveled in the tangible feeling. The ebb and flow of the incredible ocean at the base of the mountain settled my nerves almost immediately. It was then I knew Ian had done this on purpose.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only thing that worked for me growing up here.\u201d</p><p>I hugged his side as we looked over our surroundings.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss it?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot even one iota.\u201d</p><p>The tranquil-looking pool below us boasted an iridescent black tile floor and I found myself almost frightened of it. I imagined it would swallow me whole and I would sink into its dark abyss if I ever dared place a toe in that grim water.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d I heard behind us.</p><p>We both turned and I took in an older, slightly taller version of Ian. He was more tan than my Ian with shorter, more clean-cut hair, though I think that was only because Ian didn\u2019t have a barber at his disposal as readily as Simon did. He sported impeccable clothing with a European flair. All in all, Simon was gorgeous, but he lacked a fire in his eyes that Ian possessed. Yes, Ian was infinitely more beautiful. Girls could keep Simon Aberdeen. I had Ian.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d Ian shouted.</p><p>Simon scooped up Ian and tossed him around playfully. He greeted him in, what I assumed was, Afrikaans. They exchanged greetings and I stood awkwardly against the railing wishing to everything holy I could have understood them. I perked up only when Simon eyed me before gesturing and asking Ian another question in Afrikaans.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, Soph. Excuse me,\u201d he said, meeting me and wrapping my hand in his then pulling me over to meet his brother.</p><p>\u201cSimon, this is Miss Sophie Price. Sophie, this is my brother, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure to meet you,\u201d I said, extending my hand.</p><p>Simon bent and grabbed it with a wink my direction and kissed my palm cheekily. \u201cA pleasure, Miss Price, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He righted himself. \u201cIan\u2019s told me so much about you. I feel like I know you already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has, has he? What were these things?\u201d I teased back.</p><p>\u201cNot necessary!\u201d Ian practically yelled. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside, shall we? Mom and Dad are here?\u201d he asked, practically pushing me back into the living room.</p><p>\u201cNah, shortly though.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped a little. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s at a press conference. Dad\u2019s at a meeting. They said they\u2019ll be home by four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this news I had to travel half a day to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would sort of be anti-climatic, don\u2019t you think, if I just blurted it out there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad don\u2019t know then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll all find out together.\u201d</p><p>Ian eyed him curiously. \u201cWhere are we eating?\u201d</p> <p>Simon cleared his throat and looked at the ceiling. \u201cAubergine\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord, this is serious,\u201d Ian stated.</p><p>Simon sighed, running his hands through his dark hair. He sat at the kitchen bar and sank his head into his palms.</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cI had to. It\u2019s her favorite place and I need her to be receptive tonight.\u201d</p><p>I gazed from one brother to the other. \u201cAnd what is Aubergine\u2019s?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAubergine\u2019s is my mother\u2019s favorite restaurant,\u201d Ian explained. \u201cThe rest of us hate it. They serve ungodly things like trio of quail or abalone with spiced cauliflower mouse. Essentially, disgusting food.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, I see,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWe only go there when we really need mom to see our side of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wait like the rest of them,\u201d Simon told me. He looked at me like he\u2019d only just really noticed me. \u201cWait a second. You\u2019re a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstute, this one,\u201d I told Ian, gesturing toward Simon.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I mean, I knew you were a girl. You\u2019d be hard-pressed not to notice with a figure like that,\u201d he said and I rolled my eyes, \u201cbut that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Simon,\u201d Ian gritted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first girl Ian\u2019s ever brought here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSurely not,\u201d I balked Ian\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are the very first. Once, in high school he had a party and naturally girls came but he has never brought a singular girl here...ever. This-this is good. You\u2019ll take some of the heat off me.\u201d</p><p>Ian ran a hand down his face and blew out a breath. \u201cSimon, must you always humiliate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, little brother,\u201d he said, standing and hooking his arm around Ian\u2019s neck.</p><p>Ian shook him off but smiled. It was the first time I\u2019d ever seen Ian really vulnerable, almost child-like, and I liked it. I supposed Masego was a \u201cforced to act mature\u201d kind of place. I was glad to see him young, to see that creased brow relax, even if it was just for a small amount of time. Ian so obviously carried around Masego\u2019s worries on his strong twenty-year-old shoulders and they were more than capable of handling the weight, but everyone needs a break now and then.</p><p>Just then the front door handle began to turn and we all faced the door. I couldn't help but notice Simon and Ian exchange a glance before it opened, but I couldn\u2019t fully read it. All I caught was anxiety, but there was a very good chance that was all me.</p><p>I was so overwhelmed in that moment. I wanted to run and jump off the balcony and sink into that abyss then. Anything sounded better to me than meeting Ian\u2019s parents. I didn\u2019t know how much they knew of me, or what to expect of them. I wanted to kick myself for not preparing as my father had taught me to do.</p><p>\u201cAlways be aware, Sophie. Never let anyone take you by surprise,\u201d he would say.</p><p>I shook the thoughts away.</p><p>Ian came next to me and wrapped his hand in mine. \u201cNo worries, Soph,\u201d he whispered in my ear, soothing me almost immediately.</p><p>The door opened and two imposing figures emerged, talking shop, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Henrik,\u201d the woman, who could only be Ian\u2019s mother, said.</p><p>She was tall, very. Dark black hair and fair skin just like Ian\u2019s. Her hair was stylishly short and met just below her ears. She was lean and striking and unbelievably intimidating. She was exquisite and I could see where Ian had learned \u201cimposing\u201d from. She invented it with the way she carried herself.</p><p>She\u2019d stopped talking and stood staring at us. She\u2019d mastered an expressionless face and she was wearing it then. It was no matter to me, because in that moment I remembered my breeding and immediately exuded my own brand of imposition.</p><p>The invisible projection hit her like the atom bomb and you could tell she was taken aback.</p><p>She and Ian\u2019s dad, Henrik, laid their bags down on the rich, brown velveteen sofa sectional before approaching.</p><p>\u201cSimon,\u201d her velvety voice purred. \u201cWhat have I told you about rolling up the sleeves of your dress shirts. You\u2019ll crease. You\u2019ll have to change before dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d Simon said, smiling at her, \u201cbut I\u2019ve made reservations at Aubergine\u2019s, so I figure you\u2019ll forgive me?\u201d He oozed charm and I could suddenly see why all the girls gravitated toward him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, a tight knowing smile gracing her lips.</p><p>Simon kissed his mother\u2019s cheek before collapsing on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d his mother breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Ian said dryly, kissing her cheek as Simon had before turning. \u201cDad!\u201d he exclaimed with more feeling and slapped his dad on the back. \u201cSo good to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to see you, my son,\u201d Henrik said, kissing his son and bear hugging him.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this vision?\u201d Henrik asked, motioning toward me.</p><p>\u201cDad, this is Sophie Price. Sophie, this is my father, Henrik.\u201d He turned toward his mother. \u201cMom, Sophie Price. Soph, this is my mother, Abri.\u201d He pronounced it Ay-Bree.</p><p>I stuck my hand out and shook Henrik\u2019s. He shook it vigorously in return and with warmth. I turned toward Abri and extended my hand as well. She took it and something passed between us.</p><p>She knew.</p><p>She knew who I was and who my father was and, for whatever reason, she wanted me to know it.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d she said, her perfectly coifed hair sliding forward slightly as she dipped her head in a thoroughly practiced gesture.</p><p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d I told her in my most uninterested voice.</p><p>She may have had a few inches on me, but it was obvious to everyone in that room that I was the bigger presence. It felt good. I turned toward Ian, glancing Simon\u2019s way as I did, and caught their bewildered stares.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Abri interrupted the thick moment, \u201cSophie, Ian\u2019s told me you work with him at Masego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I also understand that you were caught with narcotics back home and that was what earned you that privilege?\u201d</p><p>This lady wasn\u2019t pulling any punches.</p><p>\u201cMoeder!\u201d Mother. Ian shouted in Afrikaans, coming to my side. \u201cOngevraag!\u201d Uncalled for.</p><p>I coolly leaned into the countertop behind me, briefly examining my nails as I did so.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ian.\u201d I met her gaze fully. \u201cYes, Abri, unfortunately I was, but it\u2019s of no matter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rather cheeky,\u201d she added, looking on the verge of laughter. She thought she\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d I answered. \u201cIf my bad decision led me to a place like Masego and exposed me to what life was really about, I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way. Occasionally, some have to hit rock bottom to understand themselves fully, don\u2019t you think? I plan on using mine to launch myself further than I ever could have had I never known Masego...or your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell said,\u201d Henrik told the quiet room, nodding toward me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him directly with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cSome know themselves without having to hit rock bottom,\u201d Abri said, desperate for the last word.</p><p>I let her have it with a nod. She was right after all, but she was also was transparent to everyone in the room and her small statement only helped my cause.</p><p>\u201cShall we dress for dinner?\u201d Simon asked everyone, attempting to break the tension.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d Abri said, her brows pinched as she examined me.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>I\u2019d had the foresight to pack a little Monique Lhuillier tulle cocktail dress in champagne back home but didn\u2019t feel it practical to pack heels so I\u2019d stuffed in an odd pocket of my bag a simple pair of black Fendi ballet flats with a ribbon that wrapped the ankle. I was so grateful I\u2019d done all that but forgot that it took days for tulle to \u201cde-wrinkle\u201d for lack of a better word. I had little under an hour and I was freaking out a little.</p><p>Abri had set her sights on me the minute she\u2019d walked in the door and it made me, to say the least, a little uneasy. The last thing I wanted was to look unkempt when being scrutinized so closely. I wasn\u2019t sure her motive but I knew without a doubt that Abri Aberdeen did not trust me. I didn\u2019t think I could blame her, though her interrogation style left a little to be desired, because, well, she was the executive mayor of Cape Town and I do believe she\u2019d set her sights on loftier political positions. I was a potential liability.</p><p>I unpacked my dress and hung it in the bathroom, took a steaming hot shower courtesy of their guest quarters and kept the room warm and humid by keeping the door shut while blowing my hair out and curling it with the wand oddly kept in a drawer next to the dryer. It was thoughtful of Abri to keep the instruments available to her guests but also felt like two points were added next to a dash by her name when I\u2019d used them.</p><p>By the time my makeup and hair were done, the room had cooled. The wrinkles had disappeared significantly but not entirely. I thought about running the shower again but knew the water hadn\u2019t yet reheated. I\u2019d just started to panic when I heard a knock on my door. I threw on the silk short robe conveniently hanging from the hook on the back of the bathroom door, one more point for Abri, and answered.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, my brow wrinkled in curiosity. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he told me, \u201cI wanted to say, while I have the opportunity in other words, while my mother\u2019s not around, you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re in with us already. The guys took a vote and you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my dad and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked me up and down. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dressed? We\u2019re leaving in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>The way he was so comfortable with me, I supposed I really was \u201cin,\u201d as he called it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a bind. The wrinkles in my dress won\u2019t fall out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. Check the closet in your room. You should find a hand-held steamer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit! Two more points,\u201d I gritted, my fist slapping an open palm.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Thanks. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door behind him.</p><p>The steamer was where he\u2019d said it would be and it worked beautifully. The dress looked like I\u2019d just picked it up from the store, maybe even better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDarn you, Abri Aberdeen, and your thoughtfulness,\u201d I whispered to the steamer.</p><p>When I was done, I unplugged the steamer and returned it to its rightful place in the closet. I slipped on my dress and shoes, and spritzed myself with one of Abri\u2019s assorted choices of flowery perfumes. I brought my wrist to my nose and inhaled. Apple, peach and tuberose filled my senses. It smelled beautiful and my lips quirked. I spritzed a little more behind my ears. I owed her big already, what was one more point?</p><p>I stood at the full-length mirror a little shocked at my own appearance. I hadn\u2019t taken this much time getting myself ready in months and it was, needless to say, slightly disconcerting. I wasn\u2019t sure if I liked what I saw in the mirror. My reflection looked a little too much like my old self and that made me uneasy.</p><p>I looked closer.</p> <p>There are differences. My skin was tanner, my muscles even more toned, but the biggest difference was in my eyes. Before when I saw myself, they revealed nothing but hollow. They were empty. But now, now, they were full of life, full of understanding. Suddenly, I didn\u2019t mind my own scrutiny. Suddenly, I saw a completely different person standing before me. Suddenly, I reflected love, hope and patience.</p><p>A knock on the door once again startled me. I grabbed my tiny pocketbook, checked my lip gloss one last time and swung it open to a breathtaking Ian.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sophie Price,\u201d he told me at once, raking his eyes from the top of my head to the tip of my toes and back again.</p><p>He entered the room and closed the door behind him. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d he told me, edging closer.</p><p>The toe of his shoes almost met mine and I wanted, no, needed him to swallow me whole. He was incredibly delectable, everything about him. I could feel his breath fan across my face as he examined me, could smell the spicy, clean scent of his soap, could practically count the hairs on his head. I searched his eyes and waited for it, waited for the declaration, but it never came. Say it, I silently begged.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have time to be disappointed though because his hands found my bare shoulders instantly. They bit into my skin and pushed me a little away from him so he could soak up another look.</p><p>\u201cSophie Price, you are devastatingly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. So are you,\u201d I told him honestly.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard me though. \u201cI-I\u2019m just-I knew you were beautiful, knew it so very well, but it\u2019s like I just woke up to the idea. There\u2019s something about you now, Soph. You exude something and I can\u2019t quite place my finger on it. You practically glow with it. You devastate me,\u201d he said, clutching at his heart.</p><p>I inched closer to him and rested my hand over his. \u201cThank you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, smiling at me.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand, I\u2019m not thanking you for the compliment, Ian. I\u2019m thanking you for giving me the beauty you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take credit for that, Soph.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him and we stood quietly, our hands on one another as if we were both awakening to whatever it was that was surrounding us both then. It was written all over us. There was something practically tangible there, like a ray of sun, warming us through to our souls. You could see it, you could feel it, but you couldn\u2019t quite capture it in your hands. That didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there though. Oh, it was there and it weighed a thousand delicious pounds.</p><p>I let that pressure inundate me, let it tether me to him.</p><p>Understanding. I was in love with Ian Aberdeen. So deeply, so incredibly. And it was true and it was sublime and it was mine.</p><p>Nothing could take that away from me and that was absolutely freeing to me. I owned that love. I chose it. I owed no one for it because it couldn\u2019t have been purchased. It belonged to me free and clear. I had never felt more empowered.</p><p>Ian\u2019s breathing deepened as he frantically searched my face. Say it. He had to have known. He had to have felt it as I did...but no words came.</p><p>A rap at the door came just as he\u2019d begun to open his mouth and the moment died at our feet, never to resuscitate. It was gone and my heart tumbled beside it. I knew my expression was one of pain, of disappointment, because he furrowed his brows and slid his hands to my face, trying to force it to right. I was no longer going to mask myself. I was a different person from then on. Vulnerability was acceptable to me because it was real. He shook his head as another knock resounded.</p> <p>He cleared his throat. \u201cCo-Coming,\u201d he spoke, still attempting to smooth my skin.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be down at the cars,\u201d Simon said and we heard his footsteps fade away.</p><p>Ian turned his head away from me and toward the door. \u201cWe can take my car, for privacy.\u201d</p><p>I was hurt and no longer capable of hiding how I felt, so I turned toward the bathroom, feigning I needed something. \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d an unfamiliar broken voice sounded from my lips.</p><p>I picked up the pocketbook I\u2019d set down on the bed at some point and made my way toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSoph,\u201d Ian whispered, grabbing at my arm. I let him stop me, but I refused to face him.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d I said, trying to sound lighthearted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he begged.</p><p>I looked his way but still refused to turn. \u201cDon\u2019t, what?\u201d I asked, a fake, polite smile plastered across my lips.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>I ignored that. \u201cWe should probably leave, Ian. I don\u2019t want your mother hating me any more than she already does.\u201d</p><p>I slipped my arm from his grip and opened the door, following the short corridor out into the living room and through the front door. I could feel Ian\u2019s heavy presence right behind me, close yet so very far away. I wanted to run to him and away from him all at the same time. I was so confused. I loved him. I swore he loved me back, but he\u2019d just stood there.</p><p>I descended down the winding pebble-paved drive and found my way to the cars. Standing beside them all was Ian\u2019s family. I smiled at them despite my heavy heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vision, Sophie,\u201d Simon said, reaching for my hand and kissing my cheek.</p><p>\u201cVery lovely,\u201d Henrik added with a jovial smile.</p><p>I looked on Abri in her sleek black dress and met her gaze. \u201cVery beautiful, Abri,\u201d I told her sincerely. She simply nodded.</p><p>No one, from what I could tell, knew what had transpired between Ian and me in that room. No one, except for Abri. She studied me closely, then her son, and back to me. Her eyes narrowed on us both.</p><p>Henrik opened the passenger door of a silver Audi for Abri and she got in, her gaze still plastered on Ian and me. Simon let himself into the back of the sedan and Henrik walked to the driver\u2019s side. I watched all of them before Ian\u2019s hand found my lower back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here,\u201d he whispered in my ear, sending shivers down my spine despite what had transpired.</p><p>He led me to a black Mercedes G-Class. \u201cThis is yours?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot really. It\u2019s just the car I used when I lived here. My parents bought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He opened my door for me and I slid in. I reached for my belt but he beat me to it, wrapping me with it and buckling me in. He kissed my neck unexpectedly, perplexing me, and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked him when he got in on his side.</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d he asked, buckling himself in.</p><p>\u201cThe belt? The kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to do it, wanted to be close to you then, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders as if that explained it and started the engine, bracing his hand on my headrest as he backed out of the driveway. We followed his parents to Aubergine\u2019s in silence. He never took his hand off the headrest and the warmth from his hand kept permanent butterflies fluttering. It felt bittersweet though because, at the same time, my heart pounded in hurt.</p><p>Just because he didn\u2019t say he loved you doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care, Sophie.</p><p>I was being a little bit pyscho. I knew it. It\u2019s just, the whole love thing was new to me. I\u2019d never loved anyone like I\u2019d loved Ian before.</p><p>Cut yourself some slack then, but move on. Own your feelings but don\u2019t expect reciprocation. Let that come if it comes.</p><p>I let the bitterness melt off my chest and slither to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say it,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>My head whipped his direction. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I told him, resting my cheek against his hand.</p><p>He looked at me briefly and I tried to convey to him that there was no pressure. He turned back toward the road.</p><p>\u201cNo, you really, really don\u2019t.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m so deep in love with you, I can\u2019t see straight. The truth is, I\u2019ve been afraid to admit it to myself, let alone you. The truth is, I\u2019m terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Am I really so frightening?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me. \u201cShockingly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you do to me. I\u2019ve felt things for you these past few months that don\u2019t seem healthy. I\u2019ve wanted you so desperately I\u2019m afraid it may not be natural. You consume my thoughts, Sophie,\u201d he confessed, seemingly forgetting I was there. He spoke to the windshield, a sort of haze drifting over him. \u201cYou\u2019ve arrested my senses and I can\u2019t seem to get enough of you. That\u2019s what scares me. I\u2019m so deep there\u2019s no getting out for me. You own me, you know?\u201d</p><p>I fixed myself so I faced him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t, Ian. Embellish for me. Pretend I\u2019m one of your students and I don\u2019t comprehend the lesson. Go into great detail...painstaking detail,\u201d I flirted, my heart pounding in my chest at his proclamation.</p><p>He fought a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I opened this floodgate. I\u2019m tired, that\u2019s why, and you look so damn bewitching right now.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAt Masego, the way you roll the sleeves up your forearms, highlighting your beautiful skin with the perfect wrists that meet those incredible hands. I\u2019ve imagined those hands on me so many times,\u201d he continued, shocking me and drifting further into his own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat might be when I first became aware. Possibly it\u2019s the way your jeans hug your thighs every time you take a single step though. All I can think of when you\u2019re around me are those damn legs, how they\u2019d feel in my palms, how they\u2019d feel wrapped around my waist.\u201d He lightly tapped a fist against the wheel and I sat up a bit. \u201cThey\u2019re distracting. Or maybe it\u2019s when your hair is loose and wild and down your back. I\u2019d give anything to see it across your bare shoulders,\u201d he swallowed, \u201cor coiled around my fists,\u201d he declared. He shook his head back and forth slowly, eyes still trained on the road ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s actually all those things,\u201d he said suddenly, \u201cbut mostly I think it\u2019s your face.\u201d</p><p>I squirmed quietly in my seat, praying to God I didn\u2019t break his seemingly unaware trance. My pulse beat erratically at the confession. I felt my throat dry, my stomach drop and it was everything I\u2019d never experienced before but knew was exactly as it should have always felt. My hands gripped the leather beneath my fingers to keep from throwing themselves at him and wrapping themselves around his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSophie Price, you are the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he stated before turning my direction and staring me dead in the eyes. \u201cYou are so gosh damn beautiful in here,\u201d he said, tapping my chest, \u201cthat what\u2019s here,\u201d he spoke, running the side of his hand down my face, \u201cis magnified tenfold and that is a sight to behold.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped open. I was at a complete loss for words, all rational thought had left, so I did the only thing I could think to do. I leaped across the seat and pulled the collar of his shirt toward me. The next second, I felt the SUV pull over and slam to a stop before being dragged onto Ian\u2019s lap and he was exploring me with his mouth like no one ever had.</p><p>His hands found my neck and mine threaded through his hair. \u201cSoph,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I asked, a smile tugging the corners of my mouth.</p> <p>We kissed for God knows how long before he answered.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he asked, plucking my earlier plea right out of thin air.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he said, moving to my neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he asked, pulling my face away from him.</p><p>I looked at him, winded and twitterpated. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Ian Aberdeen.\u201d</p><p>He attacked my lips with an unparalleled ferocity, swallowed my breath and tasted my tongue with his. I wrapped the crook of my arm around his neck to bring him closer, furiously melting my mouth with his and confusing where I started and he began.</p><p>\u201cMercy,\u201d I said, briefly breaking contact before marrying my lips with his once more.</p><p>Suddenly his cell began to ring and we both groaned.</p><p>\u201cYour parents,\u201d I spoke into his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cMan, do you know how to spur a guy on or what?\u201d</p><p>I laughed against his swollen lips. \u201cShut up. That\u2019s them, has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, his hand searching the cupholder beside him for the phone. \u201cUnless it\u2019s Simon.\u201d</p><p>We both turned to see it was, indeed, Simon.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he answered, smiling up at me. \u201cYeah, we got separated. We\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>He pressed end and I sank back into my seat.</p><p>\u201cTo be continued,\u201d he said, kissing my temple.</p><p>Aubergine felt like a continuation of Abri Aberdeen\u2019s home. It screamed elegance and contemporary and there wasn\u2019t a moment it didn\u2019t make you painfully aware of yourself, of where you placed your hands, where you looked, what you said and even how you felt. If Aubergine was a person, it would be Abri Aberdeen.</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to Aubergine. Name?\u201d a clearly uninterested young woman asked us. When she glanced up, though, her tune changed a little. She smiled at Ian.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here with another party,\u201d Ian told him. \u201cAberdeen?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew round as saucers. \u201cOf course, pardon me for not recognizing you. This way,\u201d she said, scurrying in front of us. \u201cAgain,\u201d she said over her shoulder, \u201cforgive me. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a big deal,\u201d Ian told her, shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>The young girl led us up a flight of stairs that stemmed from the main dining room to the mezzanine. Ian\u2019s family was the only seated there. The perks of being the executive mayor, I supposed.</p><p>An unexpected surprise awaited us when we finally met the table. Instead of the three Aberdeens, a fourth patron had joined the dinner. A young, exquisitely beautiful girl with butterscotch hair and bright blue eyes. She looked stunned and wide-eyed. Already, I\u2019d decided to like her.</p><p>\u201cIf I were to guess,\u201d I whispered Ian\u2019s direction, \u201cI believe this may be Simon\u2019s topic of discussion.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cStrap yourself in, Sophie Price. I believe things are about to get unpredictable \u2019round here,\u201d he said, his accent thicker than I\u2019d heard it in a while.</p><p>Simon and Henrik stood when we approached the table. Ian held my chair out for me and I sat. The boys followed suit. We all sat quietly and awkwardly, awaiting something, anything to happen. Rather, we all stared at Abri on edge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being rude, Simon,\u201d Abri finally spoke. \u201cIntroduce your friend to Ian and Miss Price.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Not looking good.</p><p>Simon sighed audibly and pressed his lids closed for a moment before leaning into his date toward us. \u201cIan, Sophie, this is Imogen. Imogen, this is Ian and Miss Sophie Price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d I smiled and offered my hand.</p><p>Imogen\u2019s tense shoulders relaxed an infinitesimal amount and she took my extended hand, shaking it. \u201cNice to meet you as well.\u201d</p><p>Simon presented his own hand and did the same.</p><p>Formalities over with, we all eyed Abri, but she gave no indication it was okay to speak. I astonished myself. I couldn't believe I was bending to this ridiculous woman and her outrageous intimidation. I decided to ignore her. She already felt insane disdain toward me, what further damage could I possibly do?</p><p>I turned Imogen\u2019s direction. \u201cYou\u2019re English,\u201d I stated with a smile. \u201cWhat part do you hail from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cManchester,\u201d she said, smiling back, her shoulders relaxing another inch. \u201cHave you ever been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI actually stayed in Chester,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s very charming there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I said, taking a sip of my water.</p><p>I took the opportunity to study the table and noticed an almost too well put together Abri staring our direction. I smiled softly as if I was unaware she was secretly seething inside before turning back Imogen\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to Cape Town?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cSimon does,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cWe attended graduate school at Oxford together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, leaning her direction more, her shoulders relaxed another inch. \u201cHow did you meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our Stochastic Analysis class,\u201d she said before looking at Simon.</p><p>\u201cGoddard!\u201d they said in unison before breaking into laughter.</p><p>It died quickly when Abri cleared her throat before taking a sip of her own water.</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d I said, turning toward Ian. \u201cYou never told me Simon went to Oxford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon went to Oxford, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. The table seemed to be getting more comfortable by the moment. Imogen\u2019s shoulders were almost completely at ease and Ian placed his arm on the back of my chair. Henrik and the four of us continued with our conversation until the waiter took our drink orders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have four glasses of your best red,\u201d Abri ordered.</p><p>\u201cOh, just bring the bottle,\u201d Henrik said.</p><p>Abri\u2019s hand rested on her husband\u2019s. \u201cHenrik,\u201d she said, tossing her eyes my direction.</p><p>Imogen looked at me, but I just rolled my eyes and shook my head. She nodded in understanding.</p><p>Henrik narrowed his gaze at his wife then back at the waiter. \u201cBring the bottle,\u201d he said, handing him the wine menu.</p><p>When the waiter walked away, Abri sat up in her chair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come out with it, Simon?\u201d</p><p>The entire table got quiet.</p><p>Simon cleared his throat and took Imogen\u2019s hand underneath the table. \u201cAll right. Mom? Dad? Imogen and I are going to be wed.\u201d</p><p>I knew it! This news made me giddy inside. I narrowly escaped my own beheading though when Ian stayed me with a hand to my shoulder, preventing me from shouting the congratulations balanced at the tip of my tongue.</p><p>Abri quietly lifted her napkin from her lap and laid it across her plate. I guessed correctly that was a bad sign.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought bringing me here would be the perfect venue for such an announcement?\u201d</p><p>Simon sank in his chair, running a hand over his face. \u201cThis is hardly the end of the world, Mother. Most people rejoice when their children announce their engagement.\u201d</p><p>Abri leaned in closer toward him, balancing herself over the table. \u201cWe are not most people,\u201d she gritted between teeth.</p><p>\u201cLovely impression you\u2019re giving our Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I subtly shook my head at him. A silent Don\u2019t bring me into this!</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d I said, when Abri\u2019s chilling stare sank through me.</p><p>I made an attempt to get up, but she locked me in place with a single look.</p><p>\u201cNo, it would be blasted all over the papers tomorrow if you left our table before we\u2019d even gotten our wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be under a mistaken impression. Look around you, Miss Price. There are two paparazzi waiting by the valet as well as a Cape Times journalist in the main dining hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said, not looking to rock the boat. I sat back in my chair, placing my napkin in my lap once more.</p><p>\u201cYes, so even though I\u2019m loathe to have you privy to my family\u2019s discussion, one that, I might add, could be extremely damaging if leaked,\u201d she drilled me with another disparaging look, \u201cyou stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying. Got it,\u201d I said, sinking into my chair.</p><p>Abri faced Simon once more. \u201cWhy now?\u201d she asked, narrowing her eyes. \u201cYour half a term away from graduating. Why now?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love her and I don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d he stated as fact.</p><p>I barely bit my \u201caww\u201d back.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s amiss,\u201d she said, her nails tapping at the stem of her water glass, the only sign she wasn\u2019t completely in check of her emotions.</p><p>Imogen fidgeted in her chair, glancing down at her lap, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Simon\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cI know what you\u2019re implying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Abri asked, considering an obviously nervous Imogen.</p><p>\u201cNot that one has anything to do with the other but, yes, Imogen is expecting,\u201d Simon said, dropping the bombshell like he was announcing it would rain on Tuesday. \u201cThe only influence that had on my decision was when we would marry, not if.\u201d</p><p>Yowza. And aww.</p><p>This time even Henrik lost his ever-present \u201cIt\u2019s all good\u201d facial expression.</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d Abri said, falling into the back of her chair.</p><p>I turned toward Ian and his face was devoid of color. I placed my hand within his, reminding him I was there. He squeezed my fingers.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only six weeks right now, Mom,\u201d Simon continued. \u201cWe can marry at an undisclosed location and soon. We were thinking somewhere tropical, give the impression we\u2019ve been planning a secret wedding for months. No one will think differently since Imogen has been a fixture in my life for more than two years. In fact, they\u2019ll be expecting it. And in a couple of months, we announce her pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve thought it all out, haven\u2019t you, son? It\u2019s all nice and tidy, isn\u2019t it? Except you forgot one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRe-elections are this month and it would need to be immediate. No one would believe we were planning a wedding this close to the end of my campaign.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus, Mom. You know what? You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s wait. Yes, we\u2019ll wait and announce it when Imogen is showing and then you\u2019ll really have a scandal on your hands. Listen, we\u2019re only doing this for you because we don\u2019t want to compromise your career. If it were up to us, we\u2019d wait until school was done and the baby was born, then wed in London at the church Imogen grew up in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you expect me to be grateful?\u201d Abri whisper-yelled, startling Imogen. \u201cGod, this is Ian all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbri,\u201d Henrik said, \u201cenough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s,\u201d she began, but Henrik silenced her with a hand on hers.</p> <p>\u201cI said, enough, Abri.\u201d</p><p>Abri looked appropriately chagrined and it made me have a little more respect for Henrik. He wasn\u2019t quite the easy pushover I\u2019d first thought he was. The table got quiet once more when the waiter brought our drinks and took our entree orders.</p><p>The meals had arrived and still not a word had been spoken. Surprisingly, none of us were that hungry and we all pushed our food around our plates.</p><p>I cleared my throat, inciting the potential ire of Abri, but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cMy father\u2019s company owns an island,\u201d I announced to the table. \u201cI can offer you discretion.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p> <p>Long Street in Cape Town was busier than the French Quarter at Mardi Gras. The street seemed littered with people, a sea of heads donning every inch. Cape Town reminded me so much of America it was scary. The only real difference were the accents and occasionally someone would throw out a vibe that was typically Afrikan but other than that, if I\u2019d captured the scene when I\u2019d first arrived and pitted it next to a picture of Fat Tuesday, NOLA style, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference. Even the Long Street architecture was reminiscent of New Orleans.</p><p>I was unexpectedly hit with a wave of homesickness in the moment and sidled closer to Ian as we meandered our way through the crowds. I didn\u2019t know how you could miss a place that utterly defined a horrific life but there you had it. I was overwhelmed with a need to sleep in my bed, amongst my down pillows and Frette sheets. To have Margarite bring me my breakfast in bed. To have Katy, Peter and Gillian over for massage, hair, nails and makeup.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss Mandisa?\u201d Ian asked me, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, shame heating my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou looked sad for a minute there. Do you miss her?\u201d</p><p>I thought about the baby back at Masego and felt a crushing desire to hold her. Home, comfort, quickly seeped from my conscious and my mind made a beeline toward Mandisa.</p> <p>\u201cI miss her like mad. She\u2019s my miniature sun.\u201d</p><p>Ian wrapped his arm around my shoulder and kissed my neck.</p><p>\u201cStay within these arms all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t pry me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe street can get a little wild though. Hold tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat really won\u2019t be a issue,\u201d I toyed.</p><p>Ian ushered me like a bodyguard down the street until we arrived at the entrance of a building labeled with an imposing vertical sign that read Goes the Boom.</p><p>\u201cThis is where my old friends and I would go on Saturday nights. This was pure, unadulterated fun for me. I loved to dance.\u201d</p> <p>I arched a teasing smiled his direction and wrapped both my hands around the back of his neck. \u201cI have a feeling I\u2019m in for lots of surprises tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ian twisted his hands through the hair at the top of my head and stayed them there. \u201cPrepare yourself, Price, \u2018cause I\u2019m about to rock your world.\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Goes the Boom wasn\u2019t your typical dance club. It was fit within a beautiful two story Victorian with refurbished interiors of recycled dark wood and brick walls but contemporary concrete floors. And the bass was positively bumping, something you\u2019d never expect in the low lit ambience of the sophistication it exuded but it was inviting. I found myself drawn like a magnet to the dance floor but Ian dragged me toward the bar instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I searched the bar and spotted what I wanted. A bottle of Glenlivet, single malt, aged twenty-one years. \u201cWhisky, neat,\u201d I told him, \u201cthat bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Ian told the bartender. \u201cDamn, Sophie,\u201d he said, turning toward me, \u201cI had no idea you drank like a fifty year old man.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cYou're sixteen,\u201d I told him, painting the picture, \u201cyour parents lock up their liquor cabinet, the kitchen is manned by people at all times, the only available liquor you can find is hidden away in a drawer in your father\u2019s desk and it\u2019s single malt whisky. What do you think you\u2019d develop a taste for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoca-cola?\u201d</p><p>I laughed again. \u201cNot if your name was Sophie Price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said as the bartender set down our drinks.</p><p>We both picked ours up, took a slight sip, then downed the entire contents, slamming down our empty glasses, an unconventional approach to finely aged whisky. We stood there, silently daring one another to cough. My eyes began to water. Eventually, I had to clear my throat, had to, it burned so badly. Ian only coolly stared at me, seemingly unaffected. I shook my head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Hoss,\u201d I finally relented.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, his voice faintly gruff from the whisky.</p><p>My hand reached for my glass and I turned it upside down, spinning the concave bottom around with my fingers. He edged in closer to me, The Fear began to spill from the speakers and we stood in silence, examining the other, until the bass line hit, subtle and resonating through our chests. His hand found mine, stopping the glass mid-spin. The heat of his fingers sent tingles up my arm.</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I answered softly.</p><p>Ian watched me, running a hand down my cheek, continued down my neck to my shoulder and my side until it rested on the bone of my hip. \u201cCome with me then,\u201d he said, tucking me into his side and leading me to the dance floor.</p><p>The song changed to Common\u2019s Drivin\u2019 Me Wild.</p><p>At the edge of the floor, he pressed me so close I could count each individual hard plane of his body. My breathing labored, nearly hyperventilating at the proximity. He grabbed my neck with one hand and tucked his face near my ear, swaying my body against his. I took advantage of the nearness and took a deep breath, inhaling his incredible scent of woods and water and my eyes rolled into the back of my head. I pressed my lids closed, desperately trying to stay upright.</p><p>As if he knew I was struggling, the hand wrapped around my waist pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cSoph,\u201d he breathed in my ear, sending me toward an edge.</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath as his mouth found mine. He tasted sweet and earthy like the whisky. I moaned into his teeth and he kissed me even harder. His hands slid to the back of my dress and fisted the fabric there. This sent the butterflies flitting around my stomach into overdrive.</p><p>My arms tightened around his neck and my right leg wrapped around his calf. He bent me slightly as if he could bring us any closer and I pushed myself further against him. The kiss was frantic, borderline shocking even. I had never been kissed with such want before. We wanted so badly. We needed.</p><p>\u201cGod, Soph,\u201d he breathed into my smile. \u201cYou taste incredible.\u201d</p><p>I corded my fingers with his hair and brought his head up. I needed to look in his eyes. \u201cWhen we leave tomorrow night,\u201d I told him, suddenly afraid, \u201cnothing changes?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me genuinely. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>The song changed again to something with a faster beat and as we sang the lyrics to one another and practically lost our breath dancing, I realized that Ian Aberdeen was the most fun I\u2019d ever had or ever would have.</p><p>We didn\u2019t leave until close to three in the morning. I\u2019d removed my shoes by that time and Ian carried them for me, the ankle ribbons draped over one of his broad shoulders and me on his back. We sang the music being pumped into the streets and belly-laughed all the way to his car despite the fact that the only thing we\u2019d had to drink all night was the single shot of whisky, burned off hours before.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d I said, remembering myself. \u201cI need your phone,\u201d I told him, when he set me down near his car.</p><p>He removed it from the back pocket of his jeans and handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cCan I call out of country?\u201d I asked, when he opened the door for me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have an International plan for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I said, sitting as I slid the unlock button. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s fifteen missed calls from my sat phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Must be Karina. Should we call them back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s probably no big deal though. Go ahead and ring Pembrook first. Get that out of the way so Simon doesn\u2019t bombard me incessantly tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really love your brother, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded seriously. \u201cLike-like a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. To both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d I said as I dialed Pemmy. I did the math quickly in my head and nearly wiped the sweat from my brow when I realized it was a decent hour in L.A.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Pembrook answered.</p><p>\u201cPemmy!\u201d I squealed.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I cleared my throat, my skin flushing at my unusual outburst. \u201cSorry, uh, I have a favor to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? Are you okay?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. In fact, I\u2019m in Cape Town,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat! Sophie, you were under court orders not to leave Uganda!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, Pemmy. Karina and Charles approved it. It\u2019s only for two days. I\u2019m going back to Masego tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>He was breathing deeply on the other end, obviously trying to keep himself under control. \u201cIf the courts get a whiff of this, you\u2019re done, girl.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped a little at his declaration but I insisted to him that everything would be fine.</p><p>\u201cAnd what was your purpose in calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Right! I need to let Ian\u2019s family borrow dad\u2019s island in Belize. Can you let me know what dates it\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>I heard papers shuffling in the background. \u201cI\u2019m very busy, Soph. Are you planning on escaping through Cape Town.\u201d</p><p>I immediately felt offended but knew Pembrook was only looking out for me. \u201cNo, I assure you. It\u2019s all very innocent. Is it doable or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine. The island is completely open this entire month. Feel free to offer it. Just let me know the date and I\u2019ll arrange the staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Pemmy. I appreciate it.\u201d Silence descended over the line and I was afraid I\u2019d lost him. \u201cPembrook? Are you there? I think I lost him,\u201d I told Ian\u2019s questioning face.</p><p>\u201cNo-no, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here. You\u2019ve just never said that to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat you appreciate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d I told him sincerely, \u201cbecause I do. I always have. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Sophie. Thank you,\u201d he said but I could tell his heart was the tinsiest bit lighter.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ring you when we figure out a date. Thanks again, Pemmy.\u201d</p> <p>And with that, we hung up.</p><p>\u201cSimon and Imogen have their pick of dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d he said, kissing my temple and starting his engine.</p><p>Ian dropped me off at the guest suite door with a gentleman's kiss. Okay, maybe not a gentleman's kiss but I did eventually shut the door with him on the other side. It counts!</p><p>I hung my dress up and hopped in the shower, desperate to get the smell of smoke and outside off my skin and out of my hair. Humming Drivin\u2019 Me Wild under my breath, I rinsed the conditioner and turned off the water. My hand shot out for the towel rack to grab my towel but it wasn\u2019t there. I felt around the metal for it but figured it must have fallen to the ground.</p> <p>I rolled the door back a few inches and stuck my head out to find it but was met with a hand holding it instead.</p><p>\u201cAgh! Oh my God!\u201d I panted. \u201cAbri, what are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>My hand whipped out for the towel, wrapping it around myself before stepping out of the shower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for a chat,\u201d she said, weirding me out.</p><p>\u201cThis couldn\u2019t wait?\u201d I asked, gesturing toward the room.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, exiting the door and settling herself casually across my bed.</p> <p>I thanked God I had the sense to lay out my pajamas before I\u2019d showered. I gathered them and went back into the bathroom to dress.</p><p>When I came back out, Abri was still there, proving it wasn\u2019t a bad dream. I awkwardly rested against the guest wardrobe and towel dried my hair.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Pembrook, my father\u2019s lawyer, and he let me know your family could have any day this month on Ribbon Caye.\u201d I thought this would help the clumsy silence that lay between us but it didn\u2019t. \u201cDinner was nice,\u201d I added, so desperate at that point I was reaching.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave back to America?\u201d she asked, stunning me.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you return? To America? When is your sentence over?\u201d</p><p>I was taken off guard. \u201cUm, January thirtieth, a month after Christmas. I leave February first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother six weeks then,\u201d she said, studying her feet briefly before making eye contact again.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, drawing out the word.</p><p>Without another word, she left the room, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked no one.</p><p>I stood there, waiting, for something but Abri never returned.</p><p>I settled into my covers and laid my head down before getting up and locking the door.</p><p>I woke to Ian yelling in Afrikaans.</p><p>\u201cFine! Miskien sal ek kom nie terug ooit weer hier!\u201d Fine! Maybe I won\u2019t be coming back here ever again!</p><p>\u201cS\u00ea nie dat,\u201d Henrik pleaded. Don\u2019t say that.</p><p>\u201cEk is jammer, pa, maar sy is buite onredelik!\u201d I\u2019m sorry, dad, but she\u2019s beyond unreasonable!</p><p>Loud footsteps resounded through the living.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d Ian said. There was no response. His cell phone. \u201cCan you come pick up Sophie and I in half an hour? Yes. Thanks, bro.\u201d</p><p>The footsteps inched nearer my door. I threw off my covers and ran to open it.</p><p>On the other side, Ian was in mid-knock and out of breath from frustration.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCan you be ready to leave in half an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said.</p><p>He came into the room and sat at the edge of the bed, in the exact same spot his mother did earlier that morning. I decided that information would only anger him more and I would keep it to myself. I knew Abri had pissed him off, I just didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>I opened the wardrobe up and removed my bag, settling it on the bed. I set aside what I wanted to wear on the plane ride that evening and put the rest inside. I was packed in less than five minutes. Ian laid across the bed next to my case not saying a word and buried his head in my pillow.</p><p>I brushed my teeth, dressed and put on my makeup before plaiting my hair in a messy fishtail, laying it across my shoulder. I came out, put the traveling stragglers back in the case and zipped it shut.</p><p>\u201cThis pillow smells like you,\u201d Ian said absentmindedly.</p><p>He flipped over, tucking a hand behind his head, straining his shirt against the muscles in his bicep.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d I asked him again.</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d he said when I crawled next to him, my head laying on his shoulder. He brought his arm around and held me close. \u201cI called Charles back this morning,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat did he need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve confirmed the presence of Resistance soldiers at the swimming hole and this time it seems a bit more dangerous.\u201d</p><p>My heart thundered in my chest. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found several bullets left by accident near their footprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet home.\u201d</p><p>My hand followed a messy trail of bedspread and met his fingers. They inched their way up my palm until they met my forearm and held there, his thumb rubbing the skin there back and forth, back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m torn between wanting to keep you here with Simon and taking you with me so I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you think for one second that I\u2019m going to abandon you or Masego now, when they need as much help as possible, you are out of your mind,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He eased to a sitting position, his grip still on my forearm and leaned into my face. He kissed me softly. \u201cI must be the most selfish person on this planet because I\u2019m not going to fight you on that. I want you near me. Always.\u201d He kissed me once more, this time much harder before pulling away.</p><p>Knock. Knock.</p><p>I climbed off the bed and answered it. It was Simon.</p><p>\u201cReady when you are, princess,\u201d he teased, tugging once on my braid. He nodded at his brother before leaving.</p><p>Ian stood and grabbed my bag for me. I supposed lunch with his parents was out of the question.</p><p>When we reached the front door, we noticed both Ian\u2019s parents were standing at the bottom of the walkway, talking to Simon. They seemed to be in deep discussion but eased up when we neared.</p><p>\u201cIt was such a pleasure meeting you,\u201d Henrik told me, hugging me and kissing my cheek. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not our last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not either,\u201d I told him, smiling. I kissed his cheek in return and turned to Abri.</p><p>\u201cThank you for having me, Abri.\u201d</p><p>She waved my comment away as if it were a gnat circling her head and avoided eye contact. I was willing to bet that\u2019s what she equated me with. I wasn\u2019t going to bust my ass to prove anything to her. I\u2019d just let time do that.</p><p>Ian placed our bags in the back of Simon\u2019s little sports car. I lingered by them when Ian went back to say goodbye to his parents. He\u2019d hugged his father but not his mother. He opened the passenger door and attempted to get in the small back seat but I stopped him and pushed my way through.</p><p>\u201cNot about to make your tall ass shimmy in there. I got this,\u201d I told him but was swung back playfully instead and pushed aside.</p><p>\u201cNot about to make your bony ass shimmy in there. I got this,\u201d he teased, squeezing his impossibly large frame in the tiniest little back seat I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYou are crazy,\u201d I goaded, settling in beside Simon.</p><p>We went to lunch with Simon before our flight and Imogen met us there. She was impossibly adorable and we exchanged emails before we\u2019d said goodbye. We\u2019d also solidified that they wanted Ribbon Caye on January twenty-sixth so they could have more time to prepare and give their guests at least a month to make arrangements. I\u2019d called Pemmy, that time at not such a decent hour, oops, and he\u2019d confirmed they could have an entire week there and that my father, surprisingly, didn\u2019t care, probably because of who Simon\u2019s parents were.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Masego was at we\u2019d left it yet completely different to me then, at that moment. Its gates represented something I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be home,\u201d Ian told Charles, sighing.</p><p>...And like a lightbulb, Ian had flipped a switch. Masego felt like home to me. Everyone I had grown to love so dearly resided there. Ian, Mandisa, Karina, Charles, Kate, Mercy, the children, and the rest of the staff. I suddenly knew I would do anything to protect them, anything to keep them safe.</p><p>When Pembrook arrived with the construction crew, I knew I\u2019d get him to arrange for protection, for some type of security. That was instantly my number one priority.</p><p>When the gates opened, they revealed a smiling Karina and the Baobab tree, as stalwart as always. I remembered once Karina explained that as long as the tree was at Masego that she would always be and that made me warm inside.</p><p>We\u2019d arrived too late for the children to greet us but Kate and Mercy had stayed up with Karina to see us home. Once we\u2019d parked, I jumped from the jeep and tackled Karina in the biggest hug.</p><p>She giggled out loud. \u201cStop, you silly girl,\u201d she said, but hung on to me just as tightly.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, K,\u201d I said, smacking her cheek with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She pulled me from her hold and inspected me over.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, breathless from laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou look...I\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said, cocking her head to the side. \u201cYou look ecstatically happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if I am?\u201d I teased, bumping my hip with hers.</p><p>Her eyes blew bright, reflecting the stars above. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good look on you, my love.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed me by the waist and we made our way toward Ian, Charles, Kate and Mercy so she could say hi to Ian as well. He grabbed her and spun her around and she squealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world has gotten into you two?\u201d she asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d we both answered simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cIf you think this is bad,\u201d Charles said, \u201cyou should have seen how they acted when they saw me.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flushed red and I was never more grateful for the night sky.</p><p>\u201cCome to the kitchens,\u201d Karina said, smiling and waving us her direction. \u201cI\u2019ve made you a homecoming bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d Ian asked, wrapping his large arm around her tiny little shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBanana, of course. What other fruit do we get around here?\u201d she laughed.</p><p>We entered the small kitchen together and all pitched in, getting plates, cups, etc. for our miniature party. Karina uncovered a pan of nice, thick banana bread and my mouth began to water.</p><p>We all sat and began eating in silence.</p><p>Homecoming, yes. But also a discussion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Ian asked Charles.</p><p>Charles swallowed. \u201cHonestly?\u201d His face was devoid color. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start. They\u2019ve never come this far south before. They\u2019ve undoubtedly been scouting us for several months. There\u2019s no mistake about it, it\u2019s a ticking time bomb now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate burst into tears, getting up and retreating to her rooms. \u201cKate!\u201d Karina called, standing to chase after her but Kate shook her head and Karina sat back down.</p><p>\u201cWe need action then,\u201d Ian said, taking charge and making me incredibly proud of him. \u201cWe arm ourselves. Get the locals to help us take shifts.\u201d The table got quiet. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, tension rolling off of him in waves..</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already asked them,\u201d Karina said, her eyes never leaving her bread.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve refused?\u201d Ian asked in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really blame them,\u201d Karina tried to explain.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t!\u201d Ian exclaimed. \u201cWe would do it for them. We have done it for them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have families, Din. They can\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s neck and ears grew red with frustration. \u201cThen we leave,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Mercy asked.</p> <p>\u201cAnywhere,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWe have no where to put the children, Din,\u201d Karina said, looking as exasperated as her voice conveyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d Ian asked, his brows furrowed.</p><p>\u201cThat we stay right where we are and keep watch. Charles seems to think we can do it on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles,\u201d Ian said, turning toward him, \u201cyou know that is foolhardy. We can\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we go?\u201d he asked in return.</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere. Anywhere but here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far south does the property line go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cJust south of Lake Nyaguo,\u201d Charles answered, \u201cbut it\u2019s of no importance because we have no way of building camps, no way of caring for the children once we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>I breathed deeply. Here we go. \u201cI-I need to tell you all something,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Karina asked, tucking a loose strand of hair from my braid behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cI had planned on surprising you all next week but I\u2019ve arranged for a group in America to come here and build you a new kitchen house, install a new generator, do the odd repair and create a concrete court for the children to play on as well as a play area. It was supposed to be for Christmas but I can see it\u2019s a blessing in disguise. What say you, if we have them build the new construction on the south side of Nyaguo instead? Nyaguo would be north of us and it would provide protection, we\u2019d only have to worry about our East, West, and South borders.\u201d</p><p>The table stayed quiet, too quiet, and I wondered if I\u2019d overstepped my boundaries. My face burned in embarrassment and I was close to explaining it all away, apologizing and offering to call it off but Karina was first to break the silence instead.</p><p>\u201cOur borders,\u201d she said, her eyes glassy with unshed tears. \u201cOur borders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur borders,\u201d Ian said, repeating her and smiling my direction.</p><p>\u201cOur borders,\u201d Charles said, his hand landing on mine.</p><p>Realization dawned on me. \u201cYes, our borders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Sophie,\u201d Karina said, covering my only uncovered hand with her own. \u201cYou\u2019ve given our hopeless situation hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thanking me?\u201d I asked, flabbergasted. \u201cNo,\u201d I told them all, choking back a sob. \u201cI need to thank you. You saved me.\u201d I smiled at each of them in return. \u201cIt was just my turn to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>Ian kissed at my door that night sweetly. We all had a plan and there was hope. The next day, we all decided we would begin preparations to move the children. I\u2019d called Pembrook and told him our new plan and he promised to get the men together earlier with new plans of creating an entirely new compound.</p><p>We all decided that when the unexpected came, sometimes new arrangements could become that much more extraordinary.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>But with the new extraordinary you still had the unexpected...</p><p>That morning, we all woke anew, with a mission. We informed the children of their Christmas present, a new place to live. Many felt uneasy about the potential move but we assuaged any fears, letting them know it would be safer and that they would have a playground and that seemed to liven them up enough to get them excited.</p><p>With that, we went about packing rooms in preparation. Our plan was to set up temporary camps within the new territory. Pembrook had somehow arranged for military CHU\u2019s or Container Housing Units to be dropped off within three days which would allow us to house and care for the children during the weeks of new construction. I didn\u2019t want to know how much that was costing my father and I hoped he didn\u2019t either.</p><p>By the time the CHU\u2019s had arrived, we were prepared to transport. Most of the children\u2019s things were packed and ready to go as well. There had been no additional sign that the LRA was near or nearing. We were confident and happy.</p><p>The night before we were set to transfer everyone and everything, Ian and I were making our way to the CHU\u2019s, twenty minutes south of the then current Masego. We just needed to make a quick pit stop a mile outside the gates to gather one of the missing cattle and mend a broken fence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a stubborn jerk,\u201d I said, pushing the cow toward the damaged fence.</p><p>Finally, the old girl hopped it and moved as quickly as a heifer could move toward her meandering comrades.</p><p>Ian and I dropped to the ground right next to the fence and laughed, out of breath from pushing the cantankerous bovine. The lights from our jeep lit us from behind, bathing us in an ethereal glow. He leaned into me, wrapping his hand around the nape of my neck and tugging me toward him, kissing me softly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat a Christmas,\u201d he told me, gazing at me and brushing his thumb across my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he professed, running his fingers through my hair before meeting my nape once more.</p><p>Earlier he had undone my braids for me and I never thought I had ever experienced anything as sexy as the way his eyes danced when it fell across my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told him, my hand coming to rest on his forearm at my neck.</p><p>His face became serious and I searched his eyes, his furrowed brow.</p><p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d he whispered, the hand that had been resting on my hip moved to meet the other side of my neck.</p><p>I swallowed, forcing my gaze downward. I\u2019d had no idea how I was going to answer that because it was a forbidden topic, a forbidden thought. I was scared.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d I told him truthfully.</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll stay. Give it all up, Soph. You have nothing really to go back to, you told me so yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? I have plenty to go back to,\u201d I said, affronted.</p><p>\u201cYes, but none of it means anything.\u201d</p><p>He was right, of course, but I didn\u2019t like how he dismissed my old life so readily. Yeah, I was different since Masego but I could still have a righteous future in the States. But can you leave Ian? Really leave him? How about Mandisa?</p><p>I shook my head of the thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou do. Choose me, Soph.\u201d</p><p>But with Ian comes responsibility. Could I choose a Masego life for myself? For the rest of my life? Could I commit to it?</p><p>I hedged. \u201cI\u2019m due back in court at the completion of my sentence, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll come with you and we\u2019ll come back together,\u201d he said, hugging me to his chest tightly. \u201cIt would probably be good to have a Masego rep there anyway.\u201d</p><p>I pushed at him slightly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to decide now,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He widened the distanced I\u2019d created. \u201cWhy are you being so difficult about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really heavy decision, Ian. I want to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to decide?\u201d he asked, incensed. \u201cIf the situation were reversed, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t! You already live here!\u201d</p><p>His hands fell to his side and my skin felt bereft of his warmth. I missed his touch almost immediately. I just stopped myself from grabbing those hands and placing them back. My chest ached from our fight and I didn\u2019t know how to go forward with him. This was such a huge thing. I just wanted him to understand that it was such a huge decision, I needed time to come to terms with it.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, dejected.</p><p>He stood and made his way to the back of the truck to grab his tools. I stood and hesitated reaching for him like my gut was screaming at me to do. Don\u2019t lose him! it nagged. I followed him to the back to help but he had already gotten what he needed and was making his way back to the fence.</p><p>I stood next to him holding up the loose plank and the quiet was a heady thing. It weighed on my shoulders like nothing else before, a million pounds of unrequested pressure. Whenever I\u2019d ever been faced with a difficult decision, I ran. Always. I ran as fast as I could and never looked back, constantly distracting myself from making any kind of decision that would alter my life one way or another.</p><p>But Ian didn\u2019t deserve that. He was in love with me and was sad that he might lose me. How could I possibly get mad at that? How could I possibly tell him no? Masego made me happier than I\u2019d ever been. Ian was the love of my life, I was certain, despite my young age. He was it.</p><p>\u201cIan, I-\u201d I\u2019d begun but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cDo you smell that?\u201d he asked, distracted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s burning,\u201d he said, standing rigidly straight and peering Masego\u2019s direction.</p><p>It was too far away to see it and if there was smoke we couldn\u2019t see it in the dark of the night.</p><p>\u201cI smell it, too,\u201d I said, worried we might be caught in an approaching grass fire. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, shots rang out from the direction of Masego. I jumped, grasping Ian\u2019s arm. My heart dropped and a lump formed in my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked Ian.</p><p>\u201cGet in the jeep, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Ian dropped his tools where they lay and hopped in the driver\u2019s seat so quickly I\u2019d barely had time to register his command. I quickly obeyed, goosebumps rising on my skin when five consecutive shots rang out again. An unchecked sob came bursting from my throat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled as Ian started the jeep and peeling backwards from the fence. We raced, the lights from the jeep showing a seemingly endless sea of stark grass. The only sounds the blades slapping against the sides and our breaths as we blundered the length of the fence to get to the entrance.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged out loud, my knuckles white against the dash.</p><p>I glanced at Ian and panic was written over every line of his face. My stomach plummeted further at his expression. Six more consecutive shots spilled from Masego and Ian punched the gas further, grabbing me by the arm and wrenching me into his side.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he said steadily, before charging through the fence to get to Masego faster. When the truck righted, he said, \u201cThe guns, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his assault rifle hung at the back of our bench seat and rested the butt against the floor near his leg then opened the glove box and removed the handgun. Instinctively, as Ian had taught me, I removed the magazine and checked the bullets before replacing it. I placed the gun in my lap. My hands shook as I wrenched my hair back into a ponytail. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Masego came into view and my heart clenched in the worst pain I could possibly imagine. She was on fire. It seemed not an inch of her went unscathed. More and more gunfire rang out and the adrenaline took over. I was ready.</p><p>Ready to defend her.</p><p>Ready to save others, if I could.</p><p>Ready to die for them...especially Ian.</p> <p>It felt like we couldn\u2019t get close enough, fast enough. The inches dragged.</p><p>Ten feet within its barriers, though, we could see obvious LRA soldiers opening fire on anything that moved, running toward buildings in attempt to get people, children, out.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t make out of this alive, Sophie Price, I want you to know that I\u2019ve never loved anyone as much as I love you. You\u2019re it for me,\u201d Ian said, stealing my breath and my words from earlier.</p><p>Tears streamed my face. He kissed me hard and quickly.</p><p>\u201cStay down,\u201d he said, shoving my head toward the seat.</p> <p>He exited the vehicle before I\u2019d had a chance to say anything to him. He created distance between himself and the jeep, probably to keep the bullets from straying toward me, before opening fire himself.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled a million times, tears plummeting. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to tell you!\u201dI cried. \u201cYou were supposed to let me tell you!\u201d I choked in pain. \u201cNo,\u201d I said again, when bullets seemed to fly toward the direction I thought he\u2019d gone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t think twice. I flew up from my crouched position, crawled over and opened the driver\u2019s side door, fixing myself behind it as a makeshift shield. I placed my hands on the window\u2019s edge and assessed the grounds.</p><p>\u201cTwo soldiers at the back of our huts, three at the kitchen\u2019s door.\u201d My eyes followed back across. \u201cSeven on Karina\u2019s and Charles\u2019 porch. Two at the children\u2019s house door. Five at Kate\u2019s.\u201d All the buildings were on fire except for Karina\u2019s and Charles\u2019 cabin and Ian\u2019s and my huts.</p><p>Ian was nowhere to be seen which comforted me. He wasn\u2019t lying in the common area and that was one more check toward keeping my sanity. I scanned the area once more and drank in the sight of our stalwart Baobab tree, its entirety had erupted in flames. Unease began to settle through me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hear any of the children. \u201cPlease, God. Just, please. Please.\u201d</p> <p>Do something, Sophie. My feet seemed rooted where they stood though. Save them.</p><p>Motivation is a funny thing. It can come from out of nowhere. For instance, a child\u2019s scream. From my hut.</p><p>I sprung into action, edging the courtyard fence unseen and approaching mine and Ian\u2019s huts. I raised my weapon and crept around the side, edging my way toward the two soldiers near the back, their weapons raised, ready to fire.</p><p>Slowly, very slowly, I angled myself for a good enough view. They were within range and weren\u2019t aware of me. I took three deep breaths, readying myself to kill two men I didn\u2019t know. Two men who were so ready to take part in the slaughtering of my adopted family.</p><p>For them.</p><p>I checked the safety, placed my finger on the trigger and aimed it at the first one\u2019s head. My finger was ready to squeeze but out of nowhere the men fell to the ground without the aid of my own bullets. I plastered myself back into the side of my hut.</p><p>Suddenly, a hand came around my mouth. The hand spun me toward them. A finger on his own lips. Ian.</p><p>\u201cI told you to stay in the jeep, Sophie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I blurted, frantic and a little rattled from the deaths of the soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of love I never thought I would have, never thought I deserved but it\u2019s forever, Ian. Forever.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once in acknowledgement. All business.</p><p>\u201cThe kids are safe. They\u2019re hidden on the east side of the property. Kate got them out somehow.\u201d I breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he ordered, then stopped. \u201cClosely.\u201d</p><p>We ran to the front of our huts, first inspecting Ian\u2019s then mine for the child who had screamed. A pair of wide eyes met mine underneath the bed.</p><p>\u201cShh, Mandisa,\u201d Ian whispered with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s us. Stay right here, okay?\u201d She started to cry in protest. \u201cMandisa,\u201d Ian said sternly. \u201cStay here, stay hidden, stay quiet. No one will come near this hut, you understand? Stay hidden, baby.\u201d</p><p>We stuffed my heavy down comforter with her, hoping it would stifle any noise she heard. I kissed her and ran outside with Ian. We followed the line of buildings and Ian stealthily took out the seven on Karina\u2019s and Charles\u2019 porch without blinking an eye.</p><p>\u201cCover me, Soph,\u201d Ian said, sliding open a shallow window of the children\u2019s house.</p><p>I aimed my gun inside as he entered, my ears peeled for the slightest noise. Ian pulled me through the window as if I weighed a trifle. I bit back my surprise. He stuffed me behind him once more and we scaled the walls, listening before we entered each room with a flourish of raised weapons. Each room was empty, the soldiers loitering outside the front door were gone, probably fled.</p><p>We exited the same window we entered and approached the kitchen and cafeteria quietly. Ian peered through a low window at the back of the building.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cThat same pair from the children\u2019s house have a handful of children being held hostage at the front of the building. Karina\u2019s with them.\u201d</p><p>I glanced through the same window to see for myself. Sure enough, five children and Karina stood huddled together. You could tell Karina was assuring them, attempting to calm them. My stomach tumbled the remaining length of my body to my feet.</p><p>\u201cHow do we get them out?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he told me, standing.</p><p>\u201cWait. Wait. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, no. Let\u2019s think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while we think, they could be killed. There\u2019s no time. Stay here or I swear to God, Soph...\u201d</p><p>He molded himself to the wall, edging slowly and disappearing from my view. I raised myself just enough to see through the window to the other side in time to see Karina notice him. My breath stilled as the soldiers spoke to one another unaware of his approach.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hear anything but saw Karina suddenly tuck the children into themselves, shielding them.</p><p>I waited for the gunfire but none came.</p><p>The breath I\u2019d been holding rushed from me and the released adrenaline made my body shake. The soldiers laid down their weapons at their feet before kneeling with their hands above their heads and Karina pulled their guns out of reach.</p><p>I ran around the building to help and noticed Mercy had been among the huddled. She was so small we thought she was a child. Two children ran and hugged me, crying.</p><p>I sank down to my knees. \u201cShh,\u201d I told them as they wrapped their arms around my neck and waist.</p><p>Mercy grabbed theone wrapped around Karina and took the one already with her as well as mine. She ran with them to join the others who had already escaped and Ian escorted them. Karina took one of the soldier\u2019s guns and held them at gunpoint. I raised my own gun to assure them they weren\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>While we waited, I drank the two men in. They were practically boys, seventeen at the most with bodies only on the verge of becoming men, really. Their faces still exuded innocence. They were a walking dichotomy. Baby faced assassins.</p><p>Back home, these boys would have been peers, with lives of their own. Lives unstolen by a psychopath and I almost found myself feeling sorry for them. Almost.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone hurt, Karina?\u201d I asked her, feeling out of breath.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. Somehow, by the grace of God, the children came out of this unscathed. They\u2019d opened fire on them almost immediately.\u201d</p><p>I released a shuddered breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry we weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were doing your jobs, Sophie. We all were. We were just a day too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, though,\u201d I told her. \u201cWe can leave tonight. Thank God the CHU\u2019s are there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>After a few minutes, Karina approached one of the boys.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked her, nervous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking to see if he has any other weapons hidden.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, lowering my gun closer to their heads.</p><p>Karina patted the length of the first boy\u2019s legs and lifted the back of his shirt to reveal any weapons. She made him turn over on his back and did the same thing to his front side.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, relaxing a bit. \u201cYou,\u201d she told the other one, \u201cMove onto...\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t get a chance to finish her sentence because the second boy lunged for the assault rifle around her shoulder, yanking it over her head. I raised my own to shoot him but the first boy pitched forward for me. I didn\u2019t hesitate, shooting him in the head once and dropping him where he stood.</p><p>I turned to defend Karina, my friend, practically a surrogate mother to me, a surrogate mother to all the children there and someone I had grown to love so dearly...but it was too late.</p><p>The second boy had already shoved her to the ground, his rifle pointed at her chest and fired a single shot.</p><p>It was the only shot he would get because I raised my weapon and shot him twice in the head. I fell at her side, screaming but noticed she was still conscious. Absently, I heard stifled screaming voices come from the east.</p><p>\u201cKarina?\u201d I asked, more afraid than I\u2019d ever been. \u201cHold on for me, okay?\u201d I removed my button up and pressed it into her chest to slow the bleeding but within seconds it was soaked.</p><p>My shaking hands fluttered over her. I had no idea what I was supposed to do. Karina\u2019s bloodied hands stopped mine as she cradled them in her own. She looked at me and smiled softly, shaking her head for me to stop and closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d I kept muttering under my breath, tears streaming down my face, waiting for Charles to find us. \u201cCharles will find us. Charles will fix this.\u201d</p><p>I cradled her beautiful head in my lap, held onto her tightly, as if I could tether her to my earthly world. The heat from her burning baobab tree warmed our bodies with such heat that the tears felt cool against my cheeks and chest. \u201cOh, my lovely, lovely, Karina,\u201d I cooed, running my hands over her silky hair. \u201cOh, Karina.\u201d A sob burst from my chest at her name.</p><p>Her eyes drifted open lazily and her face reflected her age for the first time since I\u2019d known her. \u201cDon\u2019t cry for me, my love,\u201d she whispered, raising her tender hand and wiping my face. She smiled softly, and it relaxed me instantly, even at that obvious hour of her death. \u201cI\u2019ve lived the most extraordinary life and I can genuinely say that I would wish this life on anyone. Even now. Even as I lay here staining the ground beneath us...\u201d she coughed, and I held her tighter \u201c...because it wasn\u2019t what I had decided for myself.</p><p>\u201cIt was better. Better than anything I could have conjured on my own. So I\u2019m telling you, my beautiful Sophie Price, don\u2019t cry for me.\u201d She coughed again and this time blood accompanied it.</p><p>\u201cKarina, don\u2019t leave,\u201d I begged her.</p><p>\u201cPromise me one thing,\u201d she requested. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll give it all to God and let Him decide it for you. He\u2019ll gift you no regrets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I told her, brushing her hair back when she inhaled and choked on air. \u201cSave your breath, Karina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have misery,\u201d she continued, ignoring my plea, \u201cyou may lose hope in the sorrow of an unplanned life but as long as you have faith and trust in adoration, in affection, in love, that sorrow will turn to happiness. And that is a constant, dear.\u201d She breathed deeply and steadily for a moment, seemingly catching her breath.</p><p>\u201cNo one can know sincere happiness, Sophie, without first having known sorrow. One can never appreciate the enormity and rareness of such a fiery bliss without seeing misery, however unfair that may be.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will know honest happiness. Of that I am certain. Certain because it\u2019s why you are here and also because here is your inevitability.\u201d</p> <p>I hugged her, crying into her shoulder and silently begging God to save her, silently screaming out for Charles to be there. I worried for him.</p><p>Her breaths sounded wet and labored and I stole a moment away from the embrace to look at her. I shook my head at how pale she\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cTell him he was my greatest adventure. Tell him I love him,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>I nodded. She sputtered her last breath and died in my arms.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed at her. \u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>A noise approached and I raised a trembling gun at it, bawling openly. It was Ian. The gun forgotten.</p><p>He stopped short at the sight, shaking his head back and forth in disbelief. His eyes reflected glassy in the light of the fire. He ran to us, sliding before us. He raised his hands before me, words escaping him. I couldn\u2019t explain. I\u2019d lost my voice as well. I could only offer him tears in explanation. I watched his unsteady hand smooth Karina\u2019s hair from her face and a sob broke from between his lips.</p><p>\u201cKarina?\u201d we heard come near us. \u201cKarina?\u201d Charles desperately inquired and my heart already ached severely for him. \u201cKarina!\u201d he exclaimed, finding her bloodied in both Ian\u2019s and my arms. \u201cKarina!\u201d he bellowed, hysterically grabbing for his wife. Ian and I gave her to him and he held her closely. \u201cOh my God! My God!\u201d He clutched her to him fiercely. \u201cKarina, my love. Karina. Karina. Karina.\u201d He could only repeat her name over and over.</p><p>We could hear children\u2019s voices approaching and I ran over to stop them from getting any closer. I kept them at the fence, preventing them from seeing anything. I looked upon each of their unsure faces and was close to bursting. How are we going to tell them?</p><p>I checked on Ian and Charles and noticed Charles had begun to carry his wife to his cabin, struggling in his older age to take all her weight. When Ian attempted to help, Charles refused, lifting her up the porch steps and closing the door behind them.</p><p>Ian watched the door for a moment before turning my direction. The sun was beginning to rise, the buildings were but smoldering, charred remains and the gray morning cast a murky pall over Masego.</p> <p>I studied the hopeless state within its walls, my eyes falling upon the still burning tree, no longer the imposing, comforting soldier I\u2019d come to rely so heavily on.</p><p>As long as the baobab tree is here, I will be...</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>We buried Karina at the new property within twenty-four hours because there was no way to preserve her body. It was just as well, none of us would have grieved her properly even if we had been able to keep her for a few more days.</p><p>That night we took the children to the CHU\u2019s, pairing the older kids with the younger kids so they had someone to watch over them as well. None of them took the news of her death well but a handful of children were beside themselves and it took days to get them to feel they were out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>Charles fell into a deep depression, tending to keep to his CHU a lot. We would take him trays of food but they only sat near the edge of his cot. It seemed we were going in just to replace the old untouched food but I was diligent. Eventually, he would need to eat and I wanted it to be available to him when the time came. Poor Charles, every time I\u2019d knock and enter, he\u2019d be still on his cot but would always roll over to smile at me, pat my hand and tell me I was good girl. I would keep a brave face for him but the second that CHU door fell closed, I\u2019d have to stifle a sob.</p><p>Pembrook arrived two days before he was originally scheduled which helped a lot. The second their plane touched down in the field next to the new community he\u2019d asked where Charles\u2019 room was. They\u2019d disappeared inside and I\u2019d only gotten to see him when I took them both dinner that night.</p><p>Pemmy hugged me tightly and I returned the hug, a little piece of security fitting back into place. I knew it would take awhile for it ever to go back to rights and I wasn\u2019t even sure if it ever would completely. My whole world had been knocked off its axis. When I thought I could find solace in Ian\u2019s arms, I\u2019d discovered that he was entirely too busy, too exhausted and too frayed for me to expect anything out of him fairly. In fact, I worked tirelessly to appease any burden I possibly could for him. Selfishly, I admit it also made me feel closer to him. He was so closed off he felt unattainable.</p> <p>He was running Masego by himself, while overseeing construction, arranging for meal preparations, and so on and so on and so on. He was stretched thin, very, very, very thin.</p><p>Which is why I hadn\u2019t mentioned his mom ringing me a few days after we\u2019d buried Karina...</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I asked, not recognizing the number on my sat phone.</p><p>\u201cMiss Price, this is Abri Aberdeen.\u201d</p><p>I was perplexed. \u201cHello, Miss Aberdeen. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much since you\u2019ve rang my sat phone. It must be fairly important for you to be calling now,\u201d I nettled, \u201cseeming as we just buried Karina. Did Ian let you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she flippantly acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry and all that but...\u201d And all that? \u201cI needed to speak with you.\u201d My blood boiled in my veins.</p><p>\u201cI can see that it must be urgent then. Is there something the matter?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI, well, I need to be blunt with you, Miss Price.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d What? Do you need an invitation? Or are you hesitating because you know you\u2019re about to do irreparable damage?</p><p>A lazy, curling unease settle throughout my entire body and I tensed, preparing myself.</p><p>\u201cI need to know the extent of your relationship with my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I guffawed.</p><p>\u201cAre you with him? Together?\u201d</p><p>I choked on my own words. \u201cWhy would you need the clarification? What is it any business of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d she exclaimed, all politeness evaporated. \u201cDo you know who I am? Know my political aspirations? If the media caught wind that you, of all people, were with him, they would have a field day with it! I can\u2019t afford this right now. I need all media outlets in my corner. I\u2019m the leading candidate right now!\u201d</p><p>I barely smothered the scream ready to erupt from my throat. \u201cAbri,\u201d I said in the most collected voice I could conjure, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this right now. We just buried Karina. Do you know how much she meant to your son? And we're relocating the entire orphanage, Abri. Excuse me if I\u2019m not able to see how important this election is to you. Truly, I hope the best for you but the fish in my fry pot are so big, the oil is spilling over, burning everything in its path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I could fix it for you?\u201d she asked, her voice tinged with desperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you possibly do?\u201d I asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cI have political ties in L.A. I can arrange for you to come home early. Would that be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. You must be.\u201d I laughed. \u201cAbri, I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t need nor do I want your \u201chelp\u201d. I would stay here regardless if you got me a reduced sentenced. I need to go. Have a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, then,\u201d Abri said, her voice seething. \u201cLeave Ian be or I will cut him off. He will never again see a dime from me.\u201d Then she hung up.</p><p>I\u2019d hung the sat phone up, shaking from how angry she\u2019d made me. Bribery! Threats! I\u2019d hung up with her that evening trying very hard not to feel the restlessness our conversation had given me. I wasn\u2019t joking with her, I had about a million things on my plate.</p><p>Little did I know, her unreal request would be the loose thread that would unravel my entire world.</p><p>The day before Christmas Eve, things felt to be steadying out and looking hopeful again. We would surprise each child with a new outfit, new shoes and two toys Christmas Day, the construction was moving forward seamlessly, and even Charles had come up for air to help every once in awhile. Yes, I, we, had every reason to be hopeful.</p><p>I woke that morning to a knock on my CHU.</p><p>\u201cPembrook? What\u2019s up?\u201d I asked, smiling.</p><p>He looked visibly put out. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, swinging open my door for him. He sat at the little chair at the little built-in desk and I sat across from him on my cot.</p><p>\u201cJust spit it out,\u201d I said, burying my head in my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything you say could make our situations any worse.\u201d He shook his head in answer and my stomach dropped. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow the courts became aware of your unscheduled trip to Cape Town. A warrant for your arrest has been issued and you have until January second to turn yourself in.\u201d</p><p>I stood, my hands going to my head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d I said, beginning to pace. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAbri Aberdeen. Ian\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called a few days back and essentially threatened me to leave her son alone. She felt the match imprudent considering both our background stories, felt it would be detrimental to her current political goals. She wanted me to promise to leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Pembrook exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d admitted to having political ties in L.A. There\u2019s no other person I could think of who would do this. Would my father have done this?\u201d I asked Pemmy.</p><p>\u201cNo, he knew of the trip, was ecstatic about the potential connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cSo that leaves Abri. I just can\u2019t believe she would do this. What should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no choice, Sophie. You\u2019ll return home and face Reinhold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave them now, Pemmy. I just can\u2019t,\u201d I said, straining not to break down. \u201cIt would make things so much worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t face Reinhold now, your legal troubles will compound. It would be wiser for you to appease them now.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Pemmy. \u201cHe\u2019ll throw me in jail.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders in reply.</p><p>I smiled at him in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m paying for my past sins, Pembrook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, taking my hand, \u201cI believe you\u2019ve already paid for them tenfold, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you tell, Ian?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian! \u201cI can\u2019t tell him. Not now, Pemmy. News that his mother did this would send him over the edge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to know you\u2019re gone, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I think I\u2019ll try slipping out with you tonight when your plane arrives.\u201d I\u2019m a coward.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even entertain the idea of letting him know his mother did this?\u201d</p> <p>And risk her cutting him off too? Never!</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t, it would kill him, Pembrook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll let him believe you betrayed him? Is that really a better fate?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sure revealing the blackmail tactic would only hurt. \u201cBetrayed by someone he\u2019s barely known six months or his mother?\u201d Not to mention her little threat.</p><p>\u201cBut why be the fall guy? Why allow her to escape this intact?\u201d he asked, suspicious.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I love him, more than you could possibly imagine,\u201d I confessed truthfully. Let him take that however he wishes.</p><p>Pembrook smiled at me but his expression was sad. \u201cHow unselfish,\u201d he told me, wrapping me in a hug. \u201cWho would have thought such an unselfish act would, in turn, cause you so much pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d I confessed candidly.</p><p>Pembrook left my CHU and I looked around me, certain I didn\u2019t need to take back a single thing. I discreetly gave away all my things, leaving Mandisa my comforter. I would return home with only a single pair of jeans, shirt, boots and toothbrush.</p><p>Which is why Ian hadn\u2019t thought it anything weird when we went to say goodbye to Pembrook together.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Ian asked as he passed by my CHU.</p> <p>I nodded, a queasy feeling residing in the pit of my belly.</p><p>I followed closely, listening to him fill Pembrook in on whatever they would need soon. Pemmy dutifully dictated it all on his pad. I had no doubt Pembrook wouldn\u2019t hesitate in accommodating them. I would ensure it was my money that paid for it all though.</p><p>I watched Ian\u2019s hands as he gestured when he spoke and even they looked tired. Calluses on his palms and fingers screamed out they needed tending to but I knew him well enough he would ignore the plea. His own needs never came before Masego and that was unfortunate because Masego would always be needy.</p><p>I looked on him knowing I would be saying goodbye to him soon and that familiar hollowness began to creep within, making me feel cold and alone already. My gut twisted at the thought of how he\u2019d react, how he\u2019d interpret my leaving. I was determined though. I wouldn\u2019t be responsible for his mother making his life miserable not when she so callously and easily made my current life a living hell.</p><p>When we reached the plane, I yelled at him to stay back with me. He obeyed without thinking much of it, hugging Pembrook goodbye. Charles, whom I\u2019d tearfully said goodbye to earlier, waited for Pemmy below the hatch and they spoke to one another briefly before Pemmy boarded the plane.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said softly, fighting tears.</p><p>He turned toward me, his concerned expression wounding my already wounded heart. Something in his eyes lit in understanding.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Soph,\u201d he said. A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cI swear to God, Sophie Price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, the unshed tears giving way.</p><p>He edged closer but I stepped back, unable to handle his touch without breaking down completely. He recognized this and grabbed me by the upper arms, bringing me close to him. \u201cYou owe me,\u201d he gritted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I\u2019ve been given an opportunity to go home and I decided it was for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he said, shaking me a little in his frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. I know you and you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>I avoided eye contact, focusing in on the tips of my worn boots. The same boots that worked tirelessly with me day after day caring for Masego. The same boots I wore while falling in love with him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, damn it!\u201d</p><p>I raised my gaze toward him.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI- I told you already. My answer won\u2019t change. I think it\u2019s for the best,\u201d I lied.</p><p>He shook his head back and forth.\u201cYou can\u2019t go,\u201d he begged, hugging me to him like he could hold me there forever.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whispered in his ear.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my lids and kissed his tanned cheek. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d I confessed...and walked away.</p><p>\u201cSoph,\u201d I heard behind me.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he pleaded, softer.</p><p>\u201cSoph,\u201d he barely whispered.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t answer. I just kept on walking, the tears cascading forth in a sea of excruciating pain.</p><p>\u201cSophie Price,\u201d he yelled, agony and animosity lacing each word. I turned to face him. \u201cYou leave me like this, alone here, and I\u2019ll never be able to forgive you. Don\u2019t bother trying to come back. You get on that plane and I\u2019m done with you!\u201d</p><p>My breath hitched in my throat, warm tears spilling anew. I nodded, choking back another sob, and stealed myself. For him. For him. For him, I kept chanting. A large bellowing roar rumbled behind me, shattering my heart into a million pieces. I gulped back my own cry, placing one heavy foot in front of the other, refusing to turn back around. I knew if I saw him, took even a second to gaze on him, I\u2019d forego all threats and ruin any future he may have had if he ever left Masego.</p><p>For him, I breathed internally, shutting the hatch behind me.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>My cell phone buzzed and woke me.</p><p>Disoriented, I surveyed my surroundings. My room. In L.A. It was quiet and cold. Quiet, cold and empty. No sweet, baby voices woke me. I would never wake to the sight of Mandisa\u2019s angelic face or the stalwart baobab tree, never eat the odd dinner with Charles or Karina again. My heart thudded harder in pain.</p><p>Karina.</p><p>The sing-song voice of my gorgeous Karina would never greet my ears again. I would never stand in line at lunch with Ian and talk to our students, teasing or playing with them.</p><p>Ian. Ian. Ian.</p><p>My heart sputtered with exceptional misery. I\u2019d never known such sorrow before, never would be able to convey fully just how badly I was willing to be stretched and torn into pieces if it meant it would stop the heart ache, just keep me from never knowing the pangs of missing Ian again.</p><p>I rolled onto my side and my cell buzzed once more. My hand stretched before me and I picked it up.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d my voice cracked.</p><p>\u201cSophie fucking Price!\u201d a male voice howled over the phone. Spencer.</p><p>\u201cHi, Spence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Spence? Hi, Spence? That\u2019s all I get?\u201d he teased. \u201cI think I at least deserve an Oh, Spencer!, he crooned in mock falsetto. \u201cCome on! I haven\u2019t seen or heard from you in five months, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, wiping the sleep from my eyes. \u201cOh, Spencer,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>He laughed heartily and breathed deeply. \u201cGod it\u2019s good to hear your voice, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I evaded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fantastic now that you\u2019re home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in your drive, actually. Come to pick your beautiful ass up. I\u2019m taking you to lunch, baby. A celebration of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really up for it,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cSophie, I\u2019m not taking no for an answer. If you\u2019d like, I can honk my horn until your dad calls the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I relented. \u201cGive me five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, five minutes please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t I just wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie Price only needs five minutes to get ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Spence. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>I lay there for a minute just to spite him then sluggishly brushed my teeth, threw on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, and some black Converse. I grabbed a hoodie out of my closet after putting on a little bit of makeup. I ran a brush through my bone-straight hair. My eyes burned thinking of the waves Ian liked to run his hands through when it would dry after being plaited. I spritzed a little perfume and didn\u2019t glance twice at my reflection.</p><p>I exited my front door and followed the dramatic path down to his car. I stifled an eye roll at Spencer\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>My hands rose to my hips. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know what you\u2019ve done with sex goddess Sophie Price?\u201d</p><p>The title made my stomach roil. \u201cI\u2019m not that girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>He studied me intently, his head cocked to one side. \u201cApparently,\u201d he stated and I wasn\u2019t sure how to interpret his reaction until he\u2019d scooped me up into his arms and spun me around. \u201cI like this Sophie. You look relaxed and able to have fun. You\u2019re still as beautiful as ever but add carefree to the mix and that\u2019s the new Sophie. I like it. It\u2019s a good look on you.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He opened his door for me and I got in. \u201cHow\u2019d you get off early?\u201d Spencer asked, sliding into the sleek driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna\u2019 know.\u201d I sat up a bit in my seat. \u201cHow did you find out I was home anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPembrook texted me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to be more stunned at. The fact that Pemmy contacted Spencer or the fact that he\u2019d done it by text. I smiled knowing he\u2019d done it because he knew I needed a friend.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been paying attention to where we were going until he pulled into The Ivy.</p><p>\u201cOh no, no, no. Not here,\u201d I told him, sitting rigidly. My fingers worried my lips, desperate to leave.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to see anyone we know here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>Sav knocked on my window, startling me. I turned Spencer\u2019s direction and gave him the dirtiest look. Sorry, he mouthed.</p><p>I got out and she eyed me with obvious disdain at my appearance. \u201cSophie?\u201d she asked, obnoxiously raising her sunglasses as if that would change what I\u2019d worn. A snicker left her lips before she checked herself. \u201cUm, how are you?\u201d she asked, letting her glasses fall back down on her plastic nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. How are you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been better,\u201d she said, not disguising the obvious pleasure she got out of seeing her mighty queen fall so hard. Little did she know how much I could care less what she or any of the others thought of me. I just didn\u2019t want to be kicked while I was already down.</p><p>Savannah led us into the restaurant and Spencer fell in beside me. \u201cIf I had any idea, I never would have done this, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arm within his to reassure him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Spencer. I\u2019ll survive,\u201d I told him, offering a smile.</p><p>His eyes blew wide for a moment before he checked them. \u201cI\u2019m still very sorry.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his arm to reassure him it was okay.</p><p>We sat at two tables pushed together. Two by two they all came flitting in, dramatically announcing themselves with flourish by flaunting their ridiculous material. Everywhere I looked, an Herm\u00e8s scarf, a Fendi bag, a Patek Phillipe watch would flash in my face. Before, all I could think of when I saw these things was that I wanted or needed to have them as well but after Masego? All I could think of was if I pawned these items, I could buy them food for a year, purchase a new generator or even a new building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was met by all of them with disbelieving eyes and snobbish contempt. I wanted to scream in their faces, \u201cIt\u2019s your parents\u2019 money! Not yours!\u201d but it would have done no good. To my right sat Graham, Sav and Brock, apparently reunited, sat to his, then Spencer, and Victoria. They\u2019d kept to conversation within themselves, excluding me on purpose. The icing on the cake was when Ali arrived with Brent.</p><p>My face flamed bright red when Brent nodded at me instead of speaking his hello. Ali wrapped her arm through Brent\u2019s in a palpable attempt to show ownership. I wished to God everyone would disappear except for them so I could have apologized. Glancing around the table, I realized I\u2019d wronged every single one of my lunch patrons. Suddenly, the urge to flee was discernible.</p><p>I sat quiet, praying it would end quickly for me. The waitress came and took everyone\u2019s orders skipping over me by accident. Spencer had to call her back. I felt like I\u2019d been punched in the gut when they all sneered under their breath at me, hiding their laughs behind manicured hands.</p><p>But then I reminded myself that I deserved it even from a group as selfish and unaware as that one because I\u2019d created them. I\u2019d never really regretted anything I\u2019d done before Masego but I certainly regretted many after.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Africa?\u201d Victoria asked, her valley girl accent laughingly pronouncing it Africaw.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told their riveted stares, hoping one word answers would suffice.</p><p>\u201cDid, you, like, see lions and shit?\u201d Graham asked.</p><p>\u201cOccasionally,\u201d I told them.</p><p>\u201cWhich one, lions or shit?\u201d he added as if he was clever.</p> <p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that, like, why you look like you do right now?\u201d Sav asked, making the table erupt in laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Comfortable? Or without a nauseatingly noticeable amount of couture on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your dad lose all his money?\u201d Sav needled, ignoring my own questions.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d I stated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in serious need of a makeover,\u201d Victoria added, her fingernails outlining a box around my face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had one,\u201d I implied, referring to my heart and soul.</p><p>They each looked amongst themselves and pretentiously and silently acknowledged with single looks exactly what they now thought of me, except for Spencer. Spencer seemed blissfully unaware what jackasses they all were but he was clearly aware of how uncomfortable I was.</p><p>\u201cSophie and I have to go, guys.\u201d</p><p>He stood abruptly laying a few bills on the table and escorted me from my seat. As we left, a burst of repugnant laughter resounded from the table all at once. My shoulders sank into themselves but Spencer wrapped his arm around me and righted me.</p><p>\u201cYou broke the cycle,\u201d he whispered in disbelief, his eyes bright with admiration.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>I\u2019d been home two days and I had yet to see my parents. I couldn\u2019t tell if it\u2019d been because I was practically living in my bed, more depressed than I could have ever imagined missing Ian, or because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to come by and see me even though I\u2019d been gone for months.</p><p>My heartfelt heavy the morning of the second, knowing I would have to appear in court, in front of Reinhold. I woke, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, not giving a crap. I knew I would be thrown in jail that day. This was the moment Reinhold had been waiting for.</p> <p>The courtroom was exactly as I remembered it. Cold and desolate and devoid of hope. It felt as if my breath was sucked from my chest the second I placed a foot inside. I met Pembrook as his table and sat.</p><p>\u201cThis is a simple hearing,\u201d he told me, arranging his satchel on the table. He poured me a glass of water and set it down in front of me. \u201cThe judge will state what you\u2019re accused of and you will enter a plea, which, of course, will be a \u201cnot guilty\u201d. I advise you not to say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPembrook,\u201d I told him, taking in his stark appearance, \u201cfor once, can you not act as my \u201cattorney\u201d here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently. \u201cStay quiet, love. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>This made my heart ache but I nodded my consent. Take care of everything. Everything but the everything I want back.</p><p>Reinhold stepped into the room, his robes billowing out from behind him. Immediately, I wanted to vomit.</p><p>\u201cAll rise,\u201d the bailiff said, \u201cThis court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Francis Reinhold presiding.\u201d</p><p>Reinhold sat and we followed suit. He began to filter through paper documents behind his bench and the quiet was deafening. My hands began to shake so I tucked them into my sides and stared at my feet. I glimpsed behind me when the doors opened and Spencer walked in, waving and sitting on a bench directly behind me. He was the only presence there but it was comforting enough that it allowed my body to calm a bit. I was still shaking but the nausea was gone.</p><p>\u201cSophie Price,\u201d Reinhold\u2019s voice boomed. He looked right at me and pierced me with a penetrating gaze, \u201cYou\u2019re accused of violating the terms of your sentence. How do you plea?\u201d</p><p>Pembrook and I stood. \u201cMy client pleads not guilty,\u201d Pembrook announced.</p><p>\u201cI see. What say you, Prosecution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Honor,\u201d the prosecutor said, addressing the court, \u201cwe move to dismiss Miss Price as time served.\u201d</p><p>My breath whooshed from my lungs all at once I began to choke. Pembrook comically slapped at my back to get me to breathe, shrugging toward Reinhold. Reinhold pinned me with a look that screamed check yourself! I coughed back my choking and pinned my lips together.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to explain?\u201d he asked the prosecutor.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019d like to call a witness to the stand, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you aware of this?\u201d he asked Pemmy.</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you object?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the prosecution moves to dismiss then my client and I are comfortable with their witness.\u201d</p><p>Reinhold was quiet for a moment, contemplating whether he would allow the witness and I held my breath.</p><p>\u201cProceed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may sit, Defense.\u201d</p><p>Pembrook and I sat.</p><p>\u201cPemmy, who is it?\u201d I asked under my breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve honestly no idea,\u201d he said</p><p>Just then, the doors opened and I thought my eyes were deceiving me. I blinked slowly before wiping my eyes. When I reopened them, I discovered what I\u2019d only thought was an illusion.</p><p>Ian.</p><p>I\u2019d stood and begun to run toward him but Pemmy stayed me with an arm. He shook his head back and forth and I was forced to sit. Seeing him for the first time since I\u2019d left felt incredible yet overwhelming. I needed his touch but simultaneously, I was so afraid he still meant what he\u2019d said. I didn\u2019t want to know but I was desperate to know at the same time.</p><p>He moved toward the witness stand with only a brief glance my direction, spearing me in the gut. When he approached the witness stand, the bailiff approached him, bible in hand.</p><p>\u201cPlace your right hand on the bible,\u201d the bailiff ordered and Ian complied. \u201cState your name,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIan Aberdeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I gulped audibly.</p><p>\u201cMister Aberdeen,\u201d the prosector began, \u201cwhat is your position at the Ugandan orphanage Masego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m technically a teacher there but I suppose you could also consider me a jack of all trades. I mend fences, birth the occasional calf, assist in medical emergencies, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you present at Masego for the lenght of Miss Price\u2019s stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are you an authorized representative of Masego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the court then, Mister Aberdeen, your experience with Miss Price during her stay at Masego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day Sophie came to Uganda,\u201d he began...</p><p>For the next hour and a half, Ian told our entire story to the court leaving out the part where we fell madly for one another. It was an incredible story to hear all at once and I found myself crying at the tale. I peered around me and noticed there didn\u2019t seem to be a dry eye in the room. But he never once made eye contact throughout the entire thing and that wounded my already bleeding heart. He was going to help me, yes, but he wanted nothing to do with me beyond saving my hide.</p><p>When he was done, the prosecution dismissed him and he sat on the opposite side of the courtroom to await Judge Reinhold\u2019s decision. I looked on him, begging him to glance my direction but his stare at the front of the courtroom was unmoving.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d I heard.</p><p>I turned to Reinhold. \u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry, did you say something?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Reinhold breathed deeply. With a brief tap of his gavel, \u201cI dismiss your case as time served. You\u2019re free to go, Miss Price.\u201d Reinhold stood and the rest of the courtroom followed suit. He made a move to go but stopped himself. \u201cBefore I leave, Miss Price\u201d he said, turning toward me, \u201cknow this, yours is the most satisfying punishment I\u2019ve ever given.\u201d He inclined his head out of respect and I nodded once in return.</p><p>When Reinhold was gone, I turned, ready to run Ian\u2019s direction. I sprinted around the table, pushing chairs out of my way, my heart jumping into my throat without ever taking my stare off his heavenly face.</p><p>Everyone rushed me at once, congratulating me and attempting to hug me. Spencer bombarded me, kissing my cheek, and picking me up. I struggled to get down, still staring Ian\u2019s direction. Finally, he made brief eye contact before walking through the double doors and out of my eyesight.</p><p>I broke free and ran for him.</p><p>\u201cIan! Ian!\u201d I kept shouting before a passing officer ordered me quiet.</p><p>I ran the length of the corridor but he was nowhere to be found. I pressed the elevator button for the first floor but was too impatient watching it slowly ascend for me so I ripped open the fire exit door and ran the four flights to the ground floor. I was panting when I burst from the door on that floor. My eyes searched for him throughout the marble lobby. He wasn\u2019t there. I rushed to the wide, wood entrance doors and out onto the descending steps. I discovered him just as he entered a taxi. I sprinted down the steps calling out his name and waving my arms over my head but he was gone. My disappointment was crushing. I fell hard to the bottom of the steps and sobbed into my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy did he just take off like that?\u201d Spencer asked coolly beside me, looking the direction he\u2019d fled. I peered up at him. His hands rested in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cBecause he thought I betrayed him,\u201d I said.</p><p>He tore his gaze away from the street and observed me below him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I-I was blackmailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScandalous,\u201d he said, bending to sit beside me. He leaned back on his elbows. He looked back out toward the street, avoiding eye contact. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him,\u201d he stated as fact.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Spencer sighed, turning toward me. \u201cThen what the hell are you doing here, Sophie Price?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s staying,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd when has something as small as that ever stopped a whirlwind force like you, girl?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I told him truthfully. His smile faltered a bit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Spence.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t, babe,\u201d he said, winking. \u201cThey\u2019re all lined up. They\u2019re waiting for me as we speak,\u201d he said, extending his arm.</p><p>He teased but the sadness there troubled me. I loved Spence so much but knew I couldn't say as much, that it would be cruel. So I just smiled at him, shoving my shoulder into his.</p><p>He picked himself up and dusted the back of his pants off. I stood and threw my arms around him. \u201cSophie Price, you\u2019ll be the one that got away, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he spoke into my ear. He pulled away. \u201cYou know how to solve that problem?\u201d he joshed. I shook my head no. \u201cWith bigger problems.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my cheek and stalked off, twirling his keys in his hand and whistling as he made his way to his car.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p> <p>I knocked twice but there was no answer.</p><p>Impatient, I headed back down to Ian\u2019s lobby.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I told the concierge, \u201cbut can you check to see if a guest named Ian Aberdeen is still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, miss.\u201d His fingers cracked the keys of his keyboard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but Mister Aberdeen has checked out.\u201d</p><p>My heart raced. \u201cThank you,\u201d I told him before hauling back out to my car, hopping in and racing toward home.</p><p>I dialed my cell.</p> <p>\u201cPemmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear? Fantastic job today in court,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just telling your father so.\u201d</p><p>A lump formed in my throat. \u201cI-Pemmy, listen, I need you to do me a favor.\u201d I weaved between two semis, almost clipping one. No wonder you aren\u2019t supposed to talk or text while driving. \u201cCan you find out if Ian is flying back out tonight?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cCome home first, your father needs to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPemmy!\u201d I yelled, exasperated. \u201cPlease, Pemmy, can you just check for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home, love. I\u2019ll see what I can find out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I said, pressing end and tossing the phone on the passenger seat.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, I whipped my car into my parents\u2019 drive and pulled into my garage space. I turned off the ignition, attempted to get out but realized I\u2019d left my phone. I bent back in to retrieve it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wealthy,\u201d I heard behind me, staying me in place.</p><p>My mouth instantly went dry, my hands trembled, my breathing labored. I climbed out of my car and shut the door, leaning against the frame.</p><p>\u201cNo, my parents are wealthy,\u201d I told him, mimicking what he\u2019d told me outside his own home in Cape Town.</p><p>He smiled at me. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this change your opinion of me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d he told me, a rogue smile playing on a mischievous face.</p><p>We stood there staring at one another.</p><p>\u201cMy mom told me everything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. For what she said. For what I said. I\u2019m just...sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did for me in court. That was...incredible. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have done it again and again if it meant freeing you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. We stood, staring again.</p><p>\u201cWho was that guy at the courthouse?\u201d he asked, his fists unwittingly tightening at his sides.</p><p>\u201cThat was Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpencer. The Spencer who took you dancing that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with you, ya\u2019 know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. I could see it,\u201d he coolly replied, inching closer, \u201cbut that means nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I asked, one brow raised in question.</p><p>\u201cYes, because you belong to me, Price.\u201d I opened my mouth to confirm what just that but he cut me off. \u201cAnd before you argue with me,\u201d he continued, grabbing me quickly and clutching me closely to his chest, sucking the very breath from mine.</p><p>He brought both hands up to my neck. I could feel the thumping of his heart against my own. \u201cWould you like to know how I know this?\u201d</p><p>I simply nodded, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said before slamming his mouth on mine.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Ian tumbled atop me on the mattress, languidly kissing my shoulders and collarbone and then, as if he couldn\u2019t wait, his lips trailed up my neck at a furious pace to my mouth . I smiled into his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt works better when the dress is off,\u201d I teased him.</p><p>He sat up before dragging me off the bed and standing me in front of the mirror. \u201cYou know, I usually hate weddings but this one...,\u201d he said, trailing off, brushing my hair to the side and over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so shabby,\u201d I completed the thought. \u201cPlus, Ribbon Caye is beautiful this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm, hmm,\u201d a distracted Ian replied, unzipping me from behind. \u201cIt was nice of your dad to donate it to Masego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really come around,\u201d I said, thinking on how my father had changed.</p><p>He\u2019d donated Ribbon Caye to us and it had become a way to provide a steady source of income as we rented it out regularly. He also agreed to a one-hundred-thousand dollar annual stipend. It allowed us to bring children into a safer environment as well as help us afford twenty-four hour armed guards, something he insisted upon, which surprised us. Within six months, my father had also completely rebuilt Masego. It was the finest home for children we\u2019d ever encountered in Uganda, in Africa, really and could house more than two hundred children at once.</p><p>When I\u2019d told my father my plans to move to Uganda permanently, he didn\u2019t fight it as I had anticipated at first. Instead, he said he only had two requests. The first was that I let him support my cause however he saw fit. He had an incessant need for control. But if he was the one being generous, I wasn\u2019t going to begrudge him that. The second was that he and I would start over, that I would help him become a good father because, and I quote, I\u2019d \u201cturned into a magnificent daughter and magnificent daughters deserved good fathers\u201d.</p><p>Ian tossed my white silk gown to the side and gazed at my reflection. He ran his hands down my shoulders, sides and rested them on my hips, smiling wickedly.</p><p>Suddenly, I was swept up and tossed back onto the bed, making me laugh. My hair fanned around his face. The moment quickly faded from amusement to something urgent.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sophie Aberdeen.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his lips softly. \u201cI love you too, other half.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at this then rolled us both over once. He reached over and turned up Between Two Points by The Glitch Mob playing on our iPod.</p><p>He kissed me deeply, our tongues intertwined and said my name, bringing my ear to his mouth. He bit my earlobe and whispered, \u201cThe shortest distance between two points is the line from me to you.\u201d</p><p>He was good on his word. </p> </body></html>"]
