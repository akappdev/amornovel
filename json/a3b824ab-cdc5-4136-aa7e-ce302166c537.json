Take it all the way to the back of your throat.\u201d</p><p>The slurping noise from the woman on her knees a few feet from me makes me clench my jaw. The smell of cigars and sex coats the air, making me wish I didn\u2019t have to breathe in the stench.</p> <p>\u201cOh, right there. Swallow it all,\u201d Nick mumbles as the slurping noise grows louder, and he grunts his release.</p><p>Fucking hell, this is why I like to work alone. Being in the back of a seedy strip club after hours is making my skin crawl.</p><p>One last job. I keep reminding myself why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m going to have to scrub my body with sandpaper when I leave this place. I\u2019ll need a scalding hot shower and might even burn my clothes. God knows what\u2019s happened in the very seat I\u2019m sitting in.</p><p>\u201cYou want her next? Maybe she can pull that stick out of your ass.\u201d Nick laughs at his own joke as the woman pulls herself to her feet. She stumbles as she gets up, almost falling over in her heels. Who knows what she\u2019s on. From how rail thin she is and the glazed look in her sunken eyes, I\u2019m guessing something heavy.</p><p>She steps towards me like my silence is an invitation, but I stop her in her tracks with a stare. I\u2019d rather cut my fucking dick off than let her anywhere near it.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, man. Loosen the fuck up,\u201d Nick says as he adjusts himself and grabs a beer from the table next to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving in five.\u201d I clip my words, making them hard. This meeting was supposed to start twenty minutes ago, and I have shit to do. Okay, maybe not shit to do, but I have somewhere else I want to be.</p><p>Stuck in the back of a strip club, waiting for the boss to show up, is not my idea of a good time. I took this job for one reason: a diversion. I need these guys, and I\u2019m on a time crunch. Time that is ticking away and being wasted at this very moment. I normally like to work alone, but this job is paying me enough that I can finally retire. I\u2019ll be set for life if everything goes according to plan. If being the operative word.</p><p>These guys think we\u2019re just robbing a bank, which we are, but I\u2019m after something else. A bank job isn\u2019t enough to have me hanging up my gun, but my real reason for breaking into the bank will give me the good life. There\u2019s a very important deposit box inside that vault, and that\u2019s my moneymaker. That box is the real reason I\u2019ve hooked up with these clowns, and they\u2019re the only way I can get into it with the time I\u2019ve got left.</p><p>No one needs to know I was ever in there, which is why I need a robbery to go down. I need chaos to help create a diversion while I get what I\u2019m really after.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay until Heavy gets here,\u201d Nick says, like he can make me stay.</p> <p>\u201cYou forget who asked who to do this job.\u201d I start to rise from my chair, like I don\u2019t give a shit about the job one way or another. They asked me for my help, but only because I\u2019d planted seeds for them to do so. I don\u2019t want them to know how much this job means to me. It\u2019s better if they think I don\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Just then, Heavy walks in.</p><p>\u201cOut!\u201d he snaps, and the girls who have been roaming around scurry from the room.</p><p>Lazily, I drop back down into my chair and wait. Heavy pours himself a drink before making his way over to where Nick and I are sitting, a few more of his crew coming in behind him and joining us.</p><p>Heavy is anything but heavy. He\u2019s barely five foot, balding, and wears the most God-awful suits I\u2019ve ever seen. The only reason he\u2019s got himself this little makeshift gang is because it used to be his father\u2019s until he passed a few years back.</p><p>What was once a decent crew turned into a bunch of lazy fucks who clearly aren\u2019t making ends meet. Seeing as they all latched on to the stupid idea of robbing a Federal bank, these idiots are dumber than I thought.</p><p>Or maybe Heavy\u2019s as crazy as I\u2019ve heard he is, and he just doesn\u2019t care. Crazy is dangerous and makes for sloppy work. Crazy is hard to understand and not easy to predict. I feel like I\u2019ve bitten off more than I can chew with this crew, and I\u2019m starting to have second thoughts. My doubts are bubbling to the surface, and I think maybe it\u2019s time to call this whole operation off.</p><p>Right until Heavy drops a stack of pictures and papers on to the table, making my heart jump into my throat.</p> <p>I sit perfectly still, trying to appear completely unfazed by what I see. The real reason I want to call off the job. I don\u2019t make a single move to indicate I know who the woman is. Her pictures are scattered across the table for all these men to leer at, and I\u2019m cool and calm on the outside. On the inside, though, I\u2019m losing my shit.</p><p>I\u2019ve always been known for my control, and for the first time in my life, I feel a crack split in my facade. The mask I so carefully wear starts to slip, and I have to rein myself in.</p><p>\u201cTessa Morgan.\u201d Heavy says her name like he bought himself a winning lottery ticket. I should have seen this coming, and maybe I did but I ignored it. I don\u2019t even like her name on his lips. She\u2019s too sweet and pure for a man like Heavy to even say her name.</p><p>When I knew what bank was my target weeks ago, I started digging up every piece of information I could get my hands on. Tessa stood out to me right away but probably not for the same reasons she stood out to Heavy.</p><p>I hate her name on his lips; it makes my stomach clench. I\u2019ve been watching her for weeks already, and I told myself it\u2019s because she\u2019s a part of the job. That\u2019s a lie, because I haven\u2019t watched anyone else at the bank. Just her. I want to watch her now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Each day my little obsession for her seems to grow. Now I\u2019m so deep there\u2019s no turning back. I have to have her, and I will, by any means necessary.</p><p>She\u2019s the reason I keep picking up my phone every ten minutes. I\u2019ve been checking her location. Checking on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d I manage to ask the question with as much indifference I can muster, but my blood feels like it's ice, moving through my veins as everyone in the room stares down at the pictures of her. She looks like a fucking angel. My angel. That\u2019s what I thought the first time I\u2019d laid eyes on her, and I still think it every time I see her.</p><p>Her reddish-brown hair falls in waves around her face down to the middle of her back. She has honey-colored eyes like I\u2019ve never seen before. I didn\u2019t even know eyes could look like liquid gold. When I first saw her, I was sure they were contacts. After I planted the camera in her apartment, I learned it was her true color. Those gorgeous eyes hypnotize me.</p> <p>She\u2019s curvy, almost plump, and her short stature makes her seem compact. It\u2019s like I could carry her soft little body around with me, and she\u2019d mold against me perfectly. But what drives me wild about her are the little freckles that pepper her cheeks and her little button nose. It makes her look sexy and innocent, all rolled into this fucking package I can\u2019t get off my mind.</p><p>It started with how she looked, but as the days went on, the more I watched her, it became so much more. She truly was a sweet little angel. Not a mean bone in her body. Always has a smile for everyone, but a lot of the time the smile doesn't reach her eyes. I want to make that smile reach her eyes. Have it directed at me.</p><p>Now all these fucks are standing around, staring at her, and I\u2019m trying not to lose my shit.</p><p>I know what Heavy\u2019s going to suggest, because I\u2019d thought it myself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to use her to glean information on the bank and get our hands on her access keys. She looks easy enough to seduce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not into chubby chasing,\u201d Nick says, picking up one of the pictures of my angel. I feel my fingers twitch, wanting to grab the blade at my side and slam it through his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do what you\u2019re told,\u201d Heavy reminds him, but no way could Nick seduce her. He isn\u2019t charming enough. She\u2019d run from his sleazy advances the first time he tried to come on to her. He\u2019s used to paying women to fuck him.</p><p>Heavy\u2019s eyes are on me, but I don\u2019t want to seem eager. If I try to jump in, the situation could blow up in my face and ruin everything.</p><p>\u201cSparrow should do it. The ladies always seem to be after him.\u201d I have no clue what Heavy means by that. Maybe it\u2019s because the whores in his club are always trying to latch on to me, but that\u2019s probably because I don\u2019t look like I\u2019d beat the shit out of them. Like his whole fucking crew does.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to make sure the cops don\u2019t show up. I\u2019m cutting the lines and hacking the systems. Those are my skills sets,\u201d I remind him, as if I want no business seducing the girl. I\u2019ll be the one to do it if it\u2019s something he\u2019s going to push. \u201cWe don\u2019t need her. I got you the floor plans, schedules, and I can take their system down easy. We don\u2019t need to drag a woman into this, one who can end up identifying us when it\u2019s all finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, she won\u2019t be identifying anyone when we\u2019re done with her.\u201d Heavy\u2019s intent is clear. But that\u2019s something I would never allow to happen. \u201cI just want to make sure everyone is on the same page. Let\u2019s not forget she has keys, too. Access to the main vault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what if shit goes wrong? She could ID me if she slips through our fingers,\u201d I try again, going at him from another angle.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care? I hear this is your last job anyways.\u201d</p><p>I regret giving him that piece of information, but I had to give him something. I was known for working alone, doing random jobs for crews. Normally, when I did pick up a job with another crew, I still did those jobs alone. Got them what they needed, then stepped out. I had to have a reason why this time I was willing to go in with a whole group, and I used this being my final score as that reason. I told Heavy I wanted to walk away with a lot of money so I could be done. But I have a feeling with all this talk about the girl not walking away and wanting me to get close to her that Heavy doesn\u2019t plan on me walking away either.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Sean</p><p>Silently, I scream inside, knowing that if I seem too eager, Heavy will sense something is up. But now if I don\u2019t agree to go along with his idea, it would draw just as much attention.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re running the show. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d I concede to what he wants, knowing that it could be her life if I refuse and someone else takes over. Not that I would have ever let that happen. No one is getting close to my Tessa but me.</p><p>\u201cGood. Get it done. We\u2019ve got to tighten up everything before next week. Monday morning, it all goes down.\u201d</p> <p>Heavy scoops up the envelope containing Tessa\u2019s pics and tosses it to me. I pick it up and check inside to make sure I\u2019ve got all of them. I slide it into the inside pocket of my leather jacket, wanting to keep it close.</p><p>\u201cWe done here?\u201d I look at Heavy, waiting for him to say anything else I might need to know. I\u2019ve got to get out of this shit hole; the stench is starting to make me sick.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Sparrow, we\u2019re all good. You just make sure everything\u2019s in place when the times comes.\u201d He pops a toothpick in his mouth and leans back in his chair. I feel the need to kick his teeth in, but instead I stand up and turn to walk out the back door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as I take a step, I hear Nick over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with Tessa.\u201d</p><p>I stop and turn back to see him taking a seat in the chair I just got up from. The way he said her name, like he was tasting it in his mouth, has me on alert. Do they know something already? Have I not been careful about how much I watch her? I don\u2019t have time to think on it right now. I file it away.</p><p>Lifting my chin in acknowledgment, I turn back around and make my way out of the club and to my ride. Once I\u2019m outside, I take a deep breath of fresh air, cleansing my lungs from the stink of that place. Goddamn seedy-ass club has my skin crawling.</p> <p>Hopping into my black 1970 Chevy Chevelle, I crank up the engine and put it in gear. It\u2019s a cool night in downtown Chicago, so I\u2019ve got the hardtop on. I drive away from the club and make my way out of downtown and west to a small suburb. It\u2019s about a twenty-five-minute train ride, but it\u2019s a lot less by car.</p><p>My Tessa.</p><p>I\u2019ve been waiting all night to able to go check on her, even though I know it\u2019s late. Although I know she\u2019ll be in her room sleeping, I\u2019m still going to go by and check. If I don\u2019t I know, I\u2019ll just crawl out of bed in a few hours and do it anyways. There\u2019s no fighting this pull she seems to have on me. How could someone own me and not even know I exist?</p><p>Tessa rents a small two-bedroom apartment just outside the city. She\u2019s lived there, from what I can tell, most of her life. She lived there with her grandmother up until about six months ago when her grandmother Alma passed away. She lived alone for about three months after Alma passed away, then her co-worker moved in with her.</p><p>It\u2019s really amazing what you can find in a few internet searches. For example, I looked up the apartment lease and her grandmother\u2019s death certificate on business and county tax documents. Only a little more searching revealed her co-worker Harper has some loose lips, blasting her personal business on her unblocked social media accounts. She\u2019s got a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and too many more to name.</p> <p>Harper likes to take an unnecessary amount of selfies with the hashtag #HarpersWorld. She also loves to talk shit on her roommate, who doesn\u2019t have any kind of social media to see what she posts. Harper is a typical bitch who tries not to be one, and I get annoyed just looking at her. I\u2019m even more annoyed by how nice my Tessa is to her, but that\u2019s also one of the reasons I can\u2019t seem to keep away from her. She knows her roommate is a bitch but still always tries to see the best in her, giving her chance and chance again. Let\u2019s hope she\u2019ll be able to do the same with me when all the dust settles.</p><p>Pulling onto Trent Street, I drive down two blocks, then park. I get out of my car and walk in the direction of the train station, which happens to pass right in front of Tessa\u2019s building.</p><p>I take a quick look around, seeing no one out at this hour, and sneak in the shadows to the alley beside her apartment. I walk around and spot a stray cat. I smile to myself. My Tessa likes to feed him in the mornings, dropping off her sandwich crusts to him on the way to the train. Harper is usually shouting at her to hurry up and stop feeding the rats, but I think it\u2019s sweet she takes the time to love something that\u2019s been abandoned. It gives me hope that she could want me. I\u2019m not above using whatever I have to to have her.</p><p>Once I get around back, I reach behind the dumpster and pull out the metal pole I left there. I walk over to the fire escape, reach up with the pole, and pull down the ladder. Once it\u2019s down, I walk back over to the dumpster and put the pole back. I like keeping it there in case I need to get to her.</p><p>I make my way back over to the ladder and climb up the four flights until I get to her story. I\u2019m quiet as a church mouse as I move onto her fire escape and peek inside her windows.</p><p>There\u2019s a light on in the living room, and I look in there first and see Harper laid out asleep on the couch. The television is on, and she\u2019s got a carton of melted ice cream in one hand and her cell phone in the other. She\u2019s snoring so loudly I can hear it through the glass, and I roll my eyes.</p> <p>I move over a little to the next window, and there she is. My Tessa. Her bed is on the other side of the room, this window letting in a little of the moonlight. I can\u2019t see her as much as I\u2019d like between her curtains blocking my view and it being after midnight.</p><p>The room she\u2019s in looks tight and cramped. The whole apartment is less than a thousand square feet, but I\u2019ve seen the blueprints, and the other bedroom is much bigger with an attached bathroom. I can\u2019t ever figure out why Tessa wouldn\u2019t take the bigger room if this was her place first.</p><p>I touch the tips of my fingers to the glass, wishing I could trail them down her soft skin. I\u2019ve never been close enough to her to touch her, but I bet it would be like touching a dandelion. Soft, delicate, and can be broken by the slightest puff of breath.</p><p>She\u2019s lying on her side, and the curve of her hip sticks up under the sheets. I want to run my hands over that curve to her waist and wrap my arm around her. I want her thick curves molded against me as I spoon her body into mine. I want my hand overflowing with her big, full breasts as I pinch and pluck her nipples. I need her big, sexy ass cushioning my hard cock as I rest it there, ready to fuck her.</p><p>Her lips, a lush cupid\u2019s bow, are parted slightly, and her eyes are closed sweetly as she dreams. Her auburn hair is spread out messily on her pillow, and all I can think about is fisting it in my hand as I thrust into her.</p><p>Shaking my head, I try to stop the desire that\u2019s rushing through me. Now is not the time to lose my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lean in closer to the glass, gently pressing my lips against the cool surface, kissing her goodnight from a distance. I take one final look at my angel and move away from the window. Glancing into the living room one last time, I see Harper still in the same position. There has got to be a good reason she\u2019d want to live with Tessa. The only conclusion I can draw from what I\u2019ve seen is that she\u2019s there out of sheer desperation.</p><p>I make my way down the fire escape. When I get to the bottom, I grab the ladder and push it back up. We wouldn\u2019t want any creeps trying to sneak a peek now, would we?</p><p>I feel a wicked smile on my face as I turn from the building and make my way back to my car.</p><p>I\u2019m living on the other side of downtown at the moment, in a warehouse. I like to move around a lot to keep hidden from any enemies who might try to find me. The people who need me for jobs know exactly how to get in touch with me.</p> <p>There\u2019s an old bar on the East Side. An old guy named Sal works behind the bar. If you go in with my name and a piece of paper, he\u2019ll get it to me. I used to run jobs for Sal back in the day, and he\u2019s about the only person I can trust. I think back to my childhood on the streets and shake my head. No time to dwell on the past.</p><p>Getting behind the wheel of my Chevelle, I think of my Tessa. I\u2019ve got to go home and get a few hours of sleep. I plan on introducing myself to my love tomorrow. Her fate has been set. She\u2019s mine now.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Tessa</p><p>\u201cAre you going to eat that?\u201d The breakfast burrito pauses halfway to my mouth as I glance at Harper across the counter in the kitchen. She\u2019s got her eyes trained on her phone as she hurriedly types away at a speed that seems almost impossible. If only she could work that fast on the computer at work, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to help her out so much. Who she could possibly be texting this early on a Thursday morning, I have no idea, but as always that thing is glued to her hand.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d I look down at my breakfast burrito. It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it will hit the spot. I popped it in the microwave, and it will mostly keep me full until lunch. I tend to get grumpy when I go without food, and being in customer service, grumpy doesn't bode well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fattening.\u201d I look past her to the container of melted ice cream that she went at last night and which is still sitting on the coffee table. The thing is, Harper can eat and eat and eat and she\u2019s still rail thin. I wasn\u2019t blessed with the same gene, but I\u2019d long ago given up caring what I ate. No diet on earth seemed to work, and I didn\u2019t have the energy to worry about it anymore. Not like I was dating. No one was going to be seeing me naked, so I might as well enjoy the burrito. It would probably be the most orgasmic thing I\u2019d experience today.</p><p>I go to take my first bite, and Harper makes a disgusted noise. I clench my jaw, and embarrassment hits my cheeks. I can feel the blood rush to my face, making my fair skin light up. I\u2019m not great at hiding my feelings. Everything\u2019s always on display for everyone to see. I might not want to diet, but it still hurts when someone calls you out on your weight. With her one sound, my appetite is gone. Maybe that\u2019s the key to a successful diet. Always try to eat with Harper in the room. You\u2019ll be stick thin in a month.</p><p>I drop the burrito onto the counter and move past her towards my bedroom to get ready for work. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready in a second,\u201d I mumble, upset she got the better of me. I thought I got over those silly things like my weight a long time ago, but it seems to be rearing its ugly head lately. This might have something to do with Harper, but my grandma always told me when someone pokes at you, it\u2019s usually their own insecurities showing. That makes me feel bad for Harper. I think a lot of her comments have more to do with her than me.</p><p>Why did I ever agree to let her move in here? Rent, I remind myself. Also I\u2019m a sucker for a sob story, and I\u2019ve been lonely since my grandma passed. I thought at least having someone around would help push those feelings away, but now three months of living with Harper and I\u2019m not so sure. Harper isn\u2019t the best for conversation. Oh, she can ramble on and on, but she seems to have this way of making me feel like shit about myself.</p><p>When she came to me about needing a place to stay, saying that her boyfriend was kicking her out, I felt bad for her. I knew what it was like to feel alone, and I didn\u2019t want anyone else to have that feeling. Little did I know she\u2019s never alone, what with the trail of men always following her. Lately, though, I\u2019ve noticed many don\u2019t stay for long, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because she\u2019s asking them to leave.</p> <p>Her sob story got to me, and plus, I needed the help with rent. I\u2019ve lived in this apartment for as long as I can remember. My grandma raised me here, and I never knew my parents. Over the years, I finally got the story of my parents out of my grandma. She said she had no idea who my father was, and my mother just kind of dropped me off one day and never came back. It stung a little to hear that, but I\u2019m thankful enough to be happy that at least my mother had the decency to give me to someone who cared.</p><p>When Grandma got sick my last year of high school, we knew it wasn\u2019t a battle she was going to win. She fought hard, but cancer took her from me six months ago after her body finally gave out. I\u2019d put off going to college to be by her side, wanting to have every moment I could with her before the last piece of family I\u2019d ever had slipped through my fingers.</p><p>As she grew sicker and sicker I seemed to become more disconnected with the outside world. I went from work to home, home to work. Nothing in between. One by one, my friends started to trickle off. After she passed away, I looked around and it was then I saw how alone I really was. I wouldn\u2019t change the choices I made, though. I\u2019ll cherish every moment I spent with my grandma. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m catching a ride, so I\u2019ll just meet you there.\u201d I turn to look at Harper, but she still has her eyes on her phone. We always take the train into work together since she moved in as neither of us has a car. I had my grandma\u2019s, but I sold it to help cover the funeral cost. It wasn\u2019t a fancy funeral, but I did the best I could with what we had. It was small, but I bet she\u2019s cursing me for having it to begin with. She probably would have rather I saved the money, but I needed it. It helped give me some of the closure I needed.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d I turn to go back to my room, Harper never once looking up at me. I have no problem taking the train; it\u2019s just a little rude for her to have a ride to work and not offer to take me. I always go out of my way for her if I think something might be helpful, so it\u2019d be nice if she would do the same from time to time. Leading by example doesn\u2019t seem to being paying off with her. But I find Harper to be a little self-centered. Sometimes I wonder if she even knows how she\u2019s acting.</p><p>There are times she can be sweet. Like inviting me out tonight to hang out. I don\u2019t have many friends. I had actually hoped when Harper moved in we would get to know each other, and that maybe I\u2019d discover that underneath some of her snottiness there might actually be someone nice under there. That has yet to be seen.</p><p>I pull off my pajamas, put on a bra, and slip on a halter dress with a long-sleeved cardigan. I pull on some funky leggings to match and opt for simple boots to go with. I spend most of my day on my feet. I have a small office, but we\u2019ve been short staffed, and I\u2019ve been working the front counter most days. I need shoes that won't kill me by the end of the day when I\u2019m making my way back home on the train.</p> <p>I trudge to the bathroom and put on a little make-up and pull my hair up into a ponytail, not wanting to mess with it.</p><p>When I walk back into the kitchen, Harper is still standing in the same place, staring at her phone, but I know she\u2019s moved because her clothes have changed. Her skirt looks a little short for appropriate work attire, but I keep my mouth closed. I learned the lesson of commenting on her clothes before. She might be quick to give criticism, but she isn\u2019t great at taking it, and her responses tend to come back with a slap to my own ego.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m heading out,\u201d I tell her, grabbing my purse and jacket from the stand by the front door.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll walk down with you. Nick should be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d I\u2019ve never heard her mention this name before. I\u2019m pretty sure it was a Ted the last time we talked about who she was dating. I think it was Ted whose ass I got to meet last week when I walked in to find them going at it right on the sofa. I haven\u2019t sat on the thing since.</p> <p>This explains why she\u2019s done up more than normal this morning. Her make-up seems to have an extra layer to it.</p><p>\u201cLike my dress?\u201d She gives a little wiggle, and I can\u2019t find it in me to give her a backhanded response like she would me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty,\u201d I reply, because it\u2019s true. It is pretty, just a little showy for my taste. It would look better at a club than at work.</p><p>\u201cYou should really let me dress you tonight when we go out. Maybe you could finally snag a man.\u201d</p><p>She opens the door and I follow her out, locking it behind us.</p><p>\u201cSure. Sounds like fun.\u201d This is all a first for me. I was shocked she even invited me out to begin with, but now she wants to dress me up. Maybe there is something underneath her hard snotty exterior, and it\u2019s starting to finally show. It may just be that she has walls around her that need help coming down.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never seen Harper with other girlfriends, and it\u2019s been so long since I had any of my own. It\u2019s worth another chance with her. What do I really have to lose? It couldn\u2019t get any worse than what we have going right now. I\u2019m living with her, and it might make things a whole lot easier if we could be friends. And I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t need a friend. I need someone. The loneliness seems to be growing each day. While a lot of the grief of losing my grandma has started to fade, the loneliness seems only to be strengthening.</p><p>When we reach the bottom of the stairs and exit the apartment complex, I see a man leaning up against a red, fancy-looking sports car. He looks a little rough around the edges, and I have the urge to step further to my left so we can avoid him. I go to take a step as Harper darts right towards him, practically jumping into his arms.</p><p>His dark eyes turn to me, and a chill runs down my spine. Harper attacks his mouth, but as he kisses her back, his eyes are trained on me. I pull my eyes from him, the creepy feeling settling deep inside me. I swear she picks the strangest guys. It\u2019s clear to me from the snake tattoo running up the guy\u2019s arm that he can\u2019t be the kind of guy one would want to tangle with.</p><p>Don\u2019t be so judgy, Tessa, I scold myself. Maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have any friends. But in all fairness, he\u2019s what I picture when I think of a gang member, and I hope Harper doesn\u2019t try to bring this one back to our place. Hopefully, he\u2019ll be gone as fast as the other guys who run in and out of her life.</p><p>When she finally pulls her mouth from his, she introduces us.</p><p>\u201cTessa, this is Nick, my boyfriend.\u201d Her eyes beam at me like she\u2019s won some grand prize. Nick doesn\u2019t seem to like that Harper just used the word \u2018boyfriend,\u2019 because I catch the tic in his jaw when she says it. But he doesn\u2019t correct her, so maybe he doesn\u2019t mind too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reaches out to shake my hand. The snake covering his arm creeps me out, but the politeness my grandma branded into me has me reaching out to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d The way he says it makes me think Harper has been talking about me to him. Like he knows more about me than he should. That creepy feeling settles deeper inside me as his hand takes mine. When our hands meet, one of his fingers slides across my wrist, and I jerk out of his hold. He smirks at me, not the least bit fazed by my behavior.</p><p>It\u2019s like he knows he\u2019s making me uneasy, and he likes it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get going.\u201d I point towards the train station, making my intention clear.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you. Dropping Harper off anyways,\u201d Nick offers. It wasn\u2019t moments ago that I was ticked Harper didn\u2019t offer me a ride, but now the train sounds so much better than being trapped in a car with this creepy guy.</p><p>\u201cBut I wanted to be alone with you.\u201d Harper pouts up at Nick, rubbing her hand across his chest. It seems to have no effect on him as he actually bats her hand away like she\u2019s a fly getting on his nerves.</p><p>\u201cThe train is fine,\u201d I insist, and start to make my way in the direction of the station, but Nick grabs me by the arm in a tight hold. He must have realized he grabbed me too hard, because he immediately loosens his grip. The whole thing has my heart beating out of my chest, and I can feel a tension rise within me like someone\u2019s eyes are on me. Not just Nick\u2019s and Harper\u2019s, but like everyone is watching us. I glance around. No one else is on the street.</p><p>\u201cI insist. I want to get to know my girl\u2019s roommate. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of each other.\u201d I look over at Harper, whose face beams at his words. Lovely. So he plans on being around.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I give in, hating myself a little for not having a bit more of a backbone. Why couldn\u2019t I be one of those badass chicks who said and did what she wanted? My grandma always said I didn't have it in me to be mean. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good or a bad thing. Today I\u2019m going with bad, and I want to kick my own manners in the ass.</p> <p>He releases my arm, and I make my way over to the passenger door before slipping into the back seat and pulling my purse close.</p><p>When everyone is settled in, Nick pulls away from the curb, heading towards the bank</p><p>\u201cSo you worked at the bank long?\u201d I hear him ask, and I pull my eyes from my lap. I thought he was talking to Harper, but his dark cold eyes are trained on me in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cAbout three years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been there five?\u201d He looks over at Harper.</p><p>\u201cYeah. A little over five years now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s your boss,\u201d he says.</p><p>Ouch. I am her boss to a certain degree. I\u2019m the teller supervisor, so it\u2019s my job to watch over all the tellers. Harper can be a little slow at work, and she talks a little too much, but I\u2019ve never had to reprimand her. I actually like that she\u2019s chatty with the customers; they like that. As long as she isn\u2019t trying to date them, I\u2019m okay with it.</p><p>A lot of our customers seem to like her. She\u2019s actually better at being personable than I am. It\u2019s one of the ways I wish I could be more like her. I had secretly hoped when she moved in that she could rub off on me a little, make me come out of my shell a little more. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t like talking to people, I just usually find myself at a loss for words. I think I\u2019m not great at the social cues in a conversation. It\u2019s hard for me to make the dialogue bounce back and forth.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she mumbles sadly, not in her normal upbeat manner.</p><p>I don\u2019t care for the tone of Harper's voice when she utters the word. She might be a giant bitch at times\u2014and actually inspires me to use the same tone from time to time like with the breakfast burrito incident this morning\u2014but I know how that feels, and I don\u2019t want her to feel that way. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel that way.</p><p>\u201cHarper is great. You should see her handle the customers. I wish I could handle them like her. She\u2019s a real pro.\u201d She turns to look at me like she can\u2019t believe what I just said.</p><p>My eyes flash back to the mirror, and Nick\u2019s eyes are on me again. This time I can\u2019t read them, but luckily he pulls them away and back on to the road.</p><p>We ride the rest of the way in awkward silence, and when we finally pull up to the bank, I realize I\u2019ve never been so happy to be at work.</p> <p>\u201cYou open this place?\u201d Nick asks, turning to look at me as we start to get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cToday I do,\u201d I answer as I pull myself from the car, wanting out as quickly as possible. \u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d I throw over my shoulder, making my way towards the bank, leaving Harper behind with him. She\u2019ll probably want to slobber all over his face. Seeing it the first time was more than enough for me.</p><p>I open the bank four times a week, and today is one of my days. Sam and I switch it up. I\u2019m opening today, which means I\u2019ll get out early, and he\u2019ll be closing up. I get a rare Saturday off this weekend, and I plan to spend it lying around in bed. My only plans include going out with Harper tonight.</p><p>It\u2019s actually something I\u2019ve never done. Twenty-two and I\u2019ve never even seen the inside of a club. I have a feeling it won\u2019t really be my thing, but I\u2019m excited to do it anyways. Just to see. Stepping out of my normal routine and opening myself up to the possibility of new things.</p><p>I slip my key into the lock and enter the bank. I enter the codes to deactivate the alarms and get started on opening. Harper joins me about ten minutes later with a happy smile plastered across her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he hot?\u201d She wiggles her eyebrows before she starts freshening up her lipstick.

I can\u2019t imagine anyone in their life called that Nick guy cute.</p><p>Harper laughs at my choice of words, and I can\u2019t help but join her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming with us tonight.

Don\u2019t be such a prude,\u201d she shouts back, cutting off my words.</p><p>\u201cI can find a guy on my own.\u201d Maybe. I keep the last word to myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you with a guy, like, ever. Do you even date?\u201d She eyes me up and down before her blue eyes get big. \u201cAre you a fucking virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d I snap, my face turning red once again.</p> <p>\u201cCalm down! It\u2019s just us right now. No one\u2019s even here yet.\u201d</p><p>Still, I feel embarrassed about the fact that I\u2019m still a virgin at my age. Life\u2019s been busy, and dating and men just haven\u2019t been on my radar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure we can find someone to pop that thing.\u201d She says it like I\u2019m some kind of charity case.</p><p>Great. The prospect of tonight just keeps getting better and better.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Sean</p> <p>I wait around the corner, parked in my Chevelle, watching as Nick pulls out of the bank parking lot. He sees me in the shadows and raises his chin in an indication to follow him. I put the car in drive and follow him a few blocks up before he pulls over. As soon as my wheels stop, I\u2019m out of the car and at his door.</p><p>He\u2019s standing when I reach him, and I shove him against his Eurotrash Audi.</p><p>\u201cMind telling me what the fuck that was about?\u201d I push his shoulder, and he falls back against his car, raising his hands up.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Sparrow. I thought we were on the same team. No need to get your panties in a wad.\u201d He\u2019s got a stupid grin on his face, like he has no clue why I\u2019m mad. He knows I was watching him earlier, and that\u2019s why he loosened his grip on Tessa.</p><p>It takes everything in me to keep from beating the shit out of this asshole. \u201cI thought Heavy said she was my target.\u201d I need to play it cool, but after seeing him put his hands on my sweet angel, I\u2019m holding on by a thin thread. No part of him should ever touch her. I hated that they were even close enough to breathe the same air. Too much darkness is seeping in on her, and I feel like I\u2019m losing control. This isn't how this was supposed to go. \u201cYou trying to fuck that up by scaring off the mark? You saw how she reacted to you,\u201d I press, wanting him to stay the fuck away from her.</p><p>\u201cCalm down. I wasn\u2019t scaring anyone. For your information, I\u2019ve seen her roommate Harper down at Coco\u2019s a few times. She\u2019s been trying to climb my dick for a while, so I let her. Clingy bitch, though. I had to let her suck me off before I left the parking lot.\u201d He reaches down, rubbing his crotch, and I make a mental note to leave some STD brochures where Harper can find them. \u201cWhen I found out who she was living with, I thought we could kill two birds with one stone.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a cocky smile, like he\u2019s somehow coming in to save the day instead of fucking everything up. And I sure as fuck don\u2019t believe in his little coincidence. \u201cYou\u2019re close to screwing us all on this deal, not just the blonde. Do us all a fucking favor and stick to your side of the plan, while I stick to mine. Stay clear of Tessa. She\u2019s not your concern.\u201d</p><p>He adjusts his shirt and goes to open his car door. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Sparrow, I think we should all stick to what we\u2019re good at. You do your thing with the fat chick, and I\u2019ll take care of the roommate. I don\u2019t mind getting some easy pussy while I wait out these last few days.\u201d</p> <p>He gets into his car, but before I can walk away, he rolls his window down.</p><p>\u201cJust remember, Sparrow. You\u2019re not the only one who likes to watch.\u201d With that, he pulls away from the curb, leaving me standing there in the street.</p><p>Clenching my fists, I stomp back to my car and get behind the wheel. I punch the steering wheel and try to get out some of my frustrations, attempting to calm my rage at seeing Nick with Tessa.</p><p>Putting the Chevelle in gear, I take off. I need to drive and clear my head before I go and see Tessa. I\u2019m getting in too deep with this shit, and I need some space.</p><p>Taking a right, I drive a few blocks up to Sal\u2019s. Pulling in at the back of the building, I park and go in the back alley entrance. The place is dark, and nobody is here yet because it\u2019s before noon.</p><p>I walk down the hallway and make my way to the bar. Sal is standing there with his back to me, removing the upside down barstools from the bar top and setting them down.</p><p>He\u2019s a big bastard at almost seven feet with dark black skin and even darker eyes. He doesn\u2019t turn around when I approach, but nothing ever takes him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think my bird would come see me so soon today.\u201d His words are thick with his Cajun accent, a remnant of his Louisiana upbringing.</p><p>\u201cI needed to clear my head.\u201d</p><p>He turns around at my voice, opening his big arms and taking me in for a hug. He\u2019s like a father to me, and though I don\u2019t get to see him like I should, he always welcomes me home.</p><p>Letting me go, he moves over to one of the stools, taking a seat and patting the other one for me to join him. \u201cWho is she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile is infectious, and it\u2019s enough to shake off my dark mood. I smile right along with him and take the seat next to him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know it yet?\u201d He raises an eyebrow, and I\u2019m always amazed at what he sees. He knows things before I say them, and he makes me feel like he can read minds.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But there are some complications.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere always are. You need help?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head a little and tell him what\u2019s going on. I tell him about the job and what\u2019s going to happen afterwards, knowing that I\u2019ll need his help when it comes time to leave. After I\u2019ve finished telling him everything, he gets up and squeezes my shoulder as he walks away.</p><p>Saying goodbye won\u2019t be easy.</p><p>Looking down at my phone, I see the tracker hasn\u2019t moved, still showing Tessa at work. I put my car in gear and make my way back to her bank, feeling a little calmer now. My plans may not be what I had wanted them to be, but they will work. They have to. It\u2019s far too late to pull back now that Heavy has locked on to the bank, then on to Tessa. There\u2019s no going back, and I will do anything to make sure nothing blows back on her.</p><p>It\u2019s before lunchtime but a little while after they\u2019ve opened, so it shouldn\u2019t be too crowded. I got the tracker in Tessa\u2019s phone after the first time I followed her. I got the call about doing the job, and I started checking out the bank right away. When I saw her at the teller line, I stopped in my tracks and got out of there as fast as I could without drawing attention. She captivated me right away, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019d never had a reaction to anyone like that before. I felt my heart pounding and need ran through me. It was unexplainable, and I didn't even try to fight it. It was like I was looking for something and didn't even know it until it was right in front of me.</p> <p>Waiting for her after work that first time was pure hell. I counted the seconds until she left, and then I was careful to hang back as she got on the train. I rode it with her all the way to her apartment, getting off at the same time as her. She was completely oblivious the whole time I stalked her back to her home, and I watched as she went up to her apartment.</p><p>That first time I waited until the middle of the night and snuck up the fire escape\u2014like I\u2019ve been doing every night since then\u2014but that night I opened the window in the living room and went inside. I placed the tracker on her phone and made myself leave before I did anything stupid. Like stand over her bed and watch her sleep.</p><p>Tessa works at Trust Bank, which is located in the heart of downtown Chicago. It\u2019s not very big, but it just so happens to have contracts with the city and takes in close to a million dollars in cash each day from the surrounding municipalities. What makes Monday so special is that it\u2019s their monthly reserve shipment, when they empty the vault of their normal shipment, plus any excess funds the branch deems unnecessary. Armored trucks will show up Monday afternoon to take it to the Federal Reserve, leaving them with a limited amount of cash until the next day\u2019s deposits are made.</p><p>This equates to about fifteen million dollars bagged up and ready for processing bright and early Monday morning. It\u2019s nothing to shake a stick at, but by the time Heavy takes his cut and divides what\u2019s left between his people, I\u2019ll only be looking at one or two million. That\u2019s not worth a life sentence in a Federal prison.</p><p>No, what I\u2019m walking out of that bank with will set me up for life. I\u2019ve already got a nice little nest egg going, but I want to do this last job and get out. And the man who hired me for this job is willing to pay any price for what\u2019s inside that box.</p><p>After I park my car, I get out and walk inside. I don\u2019t have a bank account here, but from what I know about my Tessa, she\u2019s a sucker for someone in need. Her big heart can\u2019t seem to help itself\u2014one of the things I love about her.</p> <p>I walk up to the teller line and wait behind a couple of people. Looking around, I see Tessa on the end, smiling shyly at a male customer she\u2019s helping.</p><p>Suddenly, I find myself angry that she\u2019s giving her smiles to someone else. It\u2019s insane because she doesn\u2019t know who I am, but her smiles are mine. I don\u2019t want those precious glances directed at anyone but me.</p><p>I clench my fists and try to control myself as I take a step forward, waiting for my turn. Looking down the teller line, I see there are four more people besides my Tessa working up front, all of whom I\u2019ve researched and know almost everything about.</p><p>\u201cI can help you right here, sir.\u201d I look over to see Harper smiling brightly at me, raising her eyebrows in invitation. I\u2019m sure to anyone else she looks friendly, but I see the way she\u2019s leering at me. I don\u2019t want any part of it.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m waiting on her.\u201d I point down to Tessa, who\u2019s finishing up with a customer.</p><p>Harper looks at Tessa, and her eyes bug out like she can\u2019t believe who I\u2019m talking about. Turning back to me, she flashes her fake smile and tries again. \u201cAre you sure, honey? I\u2019d be more than happy to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>This time she leans down a little, showing me some of her cleavage, and I find it hard not to laugh. Instead I just shake my head and watch Tessa as I wait.</p><p>I can see she overheard our conversation as her cheeks turn a beautiful shade of pink. She\u2019s embarrassed by my wanting her, but I can\u2019t imagine why. Her body is thick and curvy and made to take a man in every way. I\u2019d roll over if she showed me her cleavage.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman behind me in line steps around me to go to Harper. Much to Harper\u2019s dismay.</p><p>Finally, Tessa\u2019s customer is finished and walks away. Taking a step forward, I\u2019m ready to finally talk to my angel.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Sean</p><p>\u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d</p><p>In those five words, I\u2019m gone. She\u2019s not even looking at me with those liquid gold eyes, and I\u2019m already under her spell. She fidgets with a piece of paper, looking anywhere but at me, her creamy pale cheeks burning with shyness, making the light freckles on her cheeks and nose stand out even more. I never knew freckles could turn a man on but hers do.</p><p>My cock is harder than it\u2019s ever been in my life, and I haven\u2019t even touched her. I want to throw myself across the counter and bury my face in her neck while I rub my body against hers. It\u2019s some kind of animal instinct inside me that needs to get inside her body and make her mine.</p><p>\u201cYes, I saw you were the teller supervisor, so I thought maybe I should come directly to you, Tessa.\u201d I indicate to her name and title on the nameplate sitting next to her.</p><p>Her eyes slide up to mine, and she nods her head slightly. If she doesn't feel this intense pull between us, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do. I assume everyone within a ten-mile radius is getting the heat from this sexual tension.</p><p>I lick my lips a little, and her eyes go to my mouth, watching my tongue come out and run along the edge of my teeth. I want her to see my tongue and think about it between her thighs, licking her cunt and fucking her with it. I want her pussy to dampen right now because of what she sees me doing, because I want her needy and wet when she\u2019s around me. Just like I\u2019m hard as a goddamn steel rod right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like some information about opening a safety deposit box and wanted to know if you could show me what you have to offer.\u201d</p><p>I feel my teeth biting down on my bottom lip, thinking about just exactly what she could offer me. My eyes trail down her delicate neck, down to her big tits straining against her dress. She\u2019s not showing much cleavage\u2014she always dresses appropriately for work. I like that about her. That I\u2019m the only one who will get to see her body. That it\u2019s for my eyes only. That she keeps it tucked away just for me. But her body can\u2019t be denied, and her sexy curves are still coming through.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I can help you with that, Mr....?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSparrow. Sean Sparrow. Please call me Sean.\u201d</p><p>She smiles shyly at me as she clicks on her computer to pull up some information. I can see her cheeks continue to burn as she tries to sneak glances at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a new bank as well. Perhaps you can give me some information on that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to.\u201d She hands me a pamphlet and goes over the safety deposit box information.</p><p>She\u2019s very thorough and professional, but I couldn\u2019t tell you a single word she said. I\u2019m completely entranced by her mouth and the fact that she\u2019s giving me her undivided attention. I\u2019m a selfish asshole who wants her focus to only be on me, and I\u2019m not apologizing for it. Her body moves as she talks and she makes hand gestures to punctuate her speech. It makes me smile as I think about tying her hands to my headboard and making her beg me to fuck her. I\u2019d sink deep inside her sweet cunt, giving her what she wants and taking all her pleasure for myself. Mine alone.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Tessa says, blinking up at me.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I agree, having no idea what she said. But I\u2019ll do it. Whatever she asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Let me show you to our vault, so you can pick the size you want and possibly determine the location from what we have available.\u201d</p><p>I blink a couple of times, completely captivated by her golden eyes as I try to come back to reality.</p><p>I watch as Tessa takes her keys for the vault and walks to the end of the teller line. I walk in the same direction she\u2019s headed, not wanting to separate us. I want her as close to me as possible at all times.</p> <p>She comes out from behind the little door and looks down at her feet as she walks past me across the lobby to the vault. I stand close to her as she fiddles with her keys, trying to find the right one to open the gate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always the one you least suspect,\u201d I whisper, leaning in even closer to her. I see a shiver roll down her spine as chill bumps break out across her neck. She\u2019s affected by me, and I want to take advantage of it. \u201cThe keys, I mean. It\u2019s never the one you think it\u2019s going to be.\u201d My voice is deep and laced with all the dirty fantasies playing out in my head.</p><p>She looks over her shoulder at me, her eyes locking with mine. I can almost hear her heartbeat as she looks at me, the sexual tension between us thick like caramel. So sweet and sticky, and what I\u2019m willing to bet the inside of her panties would taste like right now.</p><p>Licking her lips, she leans in a little to me, and I want nothing more than to take her right here, right now.</p><p>\u201cTessa, you need some help?\u201d Harper\u2019s shrill voice echoes through the lobby, breaking the spell. Tessa blinks and takes a step back.</p><p>I watch as she grabs the right key, opens the door, and walks through. I follow behind her, entering the first part of the vault as she closes and locks the gate behind us.</p><p>This vault has a room for customers to walk in and access their safety deposit boxes, then another room beyond this one which holds all the cash. That room is accessed by another key, and then the cash is locked in smaller vaults that require key and combinations. The inner vault isn\u2019t my concern. Just getting into this room is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walks over to a drawer and removes another set of keys. These are to help open the safety deposit boxes. Theoretically, if you\u2019re an average everyday customer, you have your own personal key to your box, and the bank has another one to help you open it. So when you need to access your box, not only do you need your key, but you need theirs, too.</p><p>The reason my client can\u2019t access this box is because he isn\u2019t allowed back in the country, and the box is registered to a woman. He doesn\u2019t trust this job to anyone but me, and I\u2019d have a hard time passing as anything close to a female.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here we are.\u201d Tessa indicates around the room, showing me the boxes. \u201cWhat size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig.\u201d</p> <p>Her cheeks flush again, and I can\u2019t help my wicked grin.</p><p>She turns, giving me her back as she fiddles with the keys again. I step closer to her until we are only inches apart.</p><p>\u201cHow big?\u201d she whispers, not looking up and not turning around.</p><p>\u201cVery big,\u201d I say, my breath against her gorgeous auburn locks. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have something that can hold me, though. Right?\u201d</p><p>She nods her head just slightly, and I can hear the hitch in her breath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you have for me, Tessa?\u201d I press against her, feeling her heat through my clothes. I want to grab her arms and grind my aching cock against her, but people could walk by and see. Her pleasure is for my eyes only, and I won\u2019t have her wanton and willing in public. But I will let her know that I want her, and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer. One way or another, she will be mine; she\u2019ll know how much I want her.</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d She looks up at the boxes in front of her, the keys jingling in her shaking hand. \u201cI...have several, um, spaces available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you do, beautiful girl. Have dinner with me.\u201d She turns around suddenly, backing up against the boxes. I take a step forward, following her retreat, not wanting that space between us. This is the first time I\u2019ve been this close to her, and I don\u2019t want to break that contact so soon.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She looks around, her golden eyes searching for an excuse, but I\u2019m not having it. I know she\u2019s shy and I\u2019ll have to push a little.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d I\u2019m within a half an inch of her body, looking down on her as she tries to think of a lie.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t allowed to do that with customers.\u201d She says it like it\u2019s the lifeline she\u2019s been seeking. But I can see a little disappointment in her eyes, too.</p> <p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m not a customer. Give me your number.\u201d I pull out my phone and wait as she looks up at me with her liquid-gold eyes. They shoot through me and straight down to my cock. I\u2019m having a hard time containing it, being this close to her, but I keep telling it to be patient.</p><p>After another minute of hesitation, she takes a breath and rattles off her number. I have it programmed already, but I make a show of entering it in anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo, dinner?\u201d I lean in, close enough feel her breath against my mouth as her chest rises and falls rapidly. Being this close, I can see the freckles across her nose even better, despite her trying to hide them with make-up. I want to wipe it off her face so that I can see every single one of them.</p><p>\u201cTessa, we need you for a change order!\u201d Harper shouts across the lobby, once again breaking our spell.</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d The word is breathy as it escapes her mouth, and I wonder how true that is.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But soon,\u201d I whisper, and reluctantly move out of her way.</p><p>She walks on shaky legs, putting the box keys back in the drawer and unlocking the gate. I hold it open as I exit, and she follows me, closing and locking the gate behind her.</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s frazzled by our encounter, and it makes me smile. I can only imagine what she\u2019s going to be like after I fuck her for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>She blushes brightly again, looking down at her boots.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>She nods and scurries away from me as if she\u2019s running for her life. Maybe she should, but I won\u2019t let her.</p><p>Walking out of the bank, I get behind the wheel of my Chevelle and send her a text. No need to play hard to get. I want her, and I want her now.</p><p>Me: So, where am I picking you up?</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Tessa</p><p>I can\u2019t believe that just happened. I can still feel the burn on my cheeks from the blush I sported the entire time I was talking to him. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still there for everyone to see. My heart\u2019s beating so loudly, I\u2019m sure Harper can hear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asks, her eyes on Sean\u2019s back as he exits the bank. I can\u2019t seem to pull my eyes away either.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I\u2019m not sure what to tell her. It\u2019s against the rules to date someone who banks with us, but he doesn\u2019t. Not yet, anyways.</p><p>\u201cTotal player written all over him.\u201d She says it like she\u2019s disgusted. At least he doesn\u2019t look like he might randomly stab someone like her new guy, Nick, and he also didn\u2019t give me the creeps, that\u2019s for sure. He gave me a feeling I\u2019ve never felt before. Something I\u2019ve only read about in books.</p><p>Lust.</p><p>It rushed through my body like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before. I could barely speak with all of the heat boiling up inside me.</p><p>But sadly, I had the same feelings about him being a player. He came on so strong, but still I relished in it. No one ever hits on me. They always go straight for Harper. He might be a player, but I still liked the attention, and I\u2019m not sure what that says about me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d I want to know why she got that vibe, too. He was just so freaking perfect. When I first saw him, I could hardly even look at him. He has this whole mix of sweet guy/bad boy going on, and I\u2019m not sure if those two things can mix together. Either way, he pulled it off.</p><p>His tattoos ran up both arms in a mix of dark blues, reds, and black. Some were even poking out of the top of the white T-shirt he was wearing. The material stretched tight across his broad chest, making him look like the epitome of a bad boy, but his face was far from that. When my eyes finally took in his features, he looked kind. His dark beard was just long enough to make me want to feel how soft it was. His brown eyes were swirled with dark green, and the way they looked at me was like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before. His hair was a little long on top, and he looked like he just rolled out of bed, but in a sexy-as-hell kind of way. There was just something about him, even with his hulk-like size. I felt the need to snuggle into him. It was as if everything I felt was in contrast to what I should be feeling. Instead of his size and forward behavior intimidating me, I felt as if I would be safe with him.</p><p>When he pressed into my back, he made me feel feminine against him. His big body engulfed mine, making me feel small\u2014something I didn\u2019t feel very often. It was intoxicating. During the whole experience, I felt like I was under some kind of spell, and I want that feeling again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound like a bitch...but...\u201d She bites her lip, like she never says bitchy stuff, which is laughable. \u201cHe kind of targeted you. Like you were easy pickings.\u201d She looks almost sorry that she had to deliver the news, but I can see the jealousy in her eyes. She\u2019s pissed he didn\u2019t go for her.</p> <p>I feel my nose burn at her words. Maybe I looked like I was an easy target, but why did I find that I was still happy that he picked me over her? Even if he was just looking for sex.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d She squeezes my shoulder, like she is trying to reassure me, before she walks back to her spot at the front counter.</p><p>I\u2019m standing back at my computer when I look down and see my phone light up. My heart actually jumps. He wouldn\u2019t be texting me already, would he? I thought you were supposed to wait, like, a day or two. It\u2019s a written dating rule or something, right? When I see it\u2019s from an unknown number, I bite my lip to stop from smiling. Looking over, I make sure Harper isn\u2019t watching at me, because I don\u2019t want her to know what I\u2019m doing. She already gave me her two cents, and I don\u2019t think I could take another two.</p><p>I pick up my phone, secretly checking it so no one can see. I don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m so nervous yet excited at the same time.</p><p>Sean: So, where am I picking you up?</p> <p>Me: I\u2019m not sure this is a good idea.</p><p>Sean: Am I going to have to come back in there and prove to you otherwise?</p><p>Me: I don\u2019t even know you. I can\u2019t just go out with you.</p><p>Sean: Isn\u2019t that what dating is for?</p><p>He\u2019s right, but I\u2019ve never done this before, and I don\u2019t want him to know that. I probably already seem like a freaking prude. I mull over my response, but he comes back faster.</p><p>Sean: Give me one dinner.</p> <p>Maybe I should just give it to him straight. If it scares him away, then it\u2019s for the best.</p><p>Me: I\u2019ve never done this before.</p><p>I hold my breath, waiting for his response.</p><p>Sean: Had dinner? I find that hard to believe.</p><p>I put the phone back down on the counter. I know he probably didn\u2019t mean it the way I\u2019m thinking. Had dinner? I find that hard to believe. I\u2019m undoubtedly being sensitive, but it still burns. I\u2019m clearly not up for dating if something so simple can make me feel like shit. This man has barely said three words to me and I\u2019m already feeling heartbreak.</p><p>He could shatter me.</p><p>Me: I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>I send the text and just stare at my phone. Minutes tick by, each one seeming heavier than the last, with no response.</p> <p>I guess that was that. No fight to make me change my mind. I need to get some air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lunch,\u201d I mutter to Harper, who\u2019s playing on the computer. The bank has been pretty dead today. Maybe when I get back I can get caught up on some paperwork and get my mind off this Sean guy. How I got so wrapped up so fast, I\u2019ll never understand.</p><p>I try to tell myself it\u2019s better this way. I just dodged a major bullet.</p><p>\u201cK. I\u2019ll go when you get back.\u201d</p><p>I go into my office, grabbing my purse from the drawer inside my desk before checking in with a few other people. I slip out the door. I don\u2019t make it two blocks in the direction of my favorite bakery, Muffin Tops, before I\u2019m pushed up against the side of a building.</p><p>Sean.</p><p>His mouth is on mine before I can even take in what\u2019s happening. His hands grip my hips in a firm hold, making me gasp, and he steals the opportunity to push his tongue into my mouth. I thought the kiss would be rough and fast with the way he pressed me against the wall, but it\u2019s sweet and soft.</p><p>He\u2019s taking his time, giving me slow lazy strokes of his tongue. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s savoring my taste, and I let him. I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019m really kissing him back. I\u2019m just enjoying the warmth of his lips on mine as I come alive inside. I've never felt such need in my life.</p><p>When he nibbles my bottom lip, desire shoots through my whole body, making me want more. I press myself into him, wanting to make the kiss deeper, but just as I do, he pulls away, resting his forehead against mine. His chest rises and falls, and I feel his warm breath against my lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me what I did that scared you off so I don\u2019t do it again.\u201d His eyes are squeezed shut, like he\u2019s trying to get himself under control. His words catch me off guard because I\u2019m still riding the high of my first kiss, and I can barely make out what he\u2019s asking.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gasp breathlessly. His eyes pop open, looking into mine. This time they seem more green than brown.</p><p>\u201cFuck. You look good like this.\u201d He moves his body, shielding me more, like he doesn\u2019t want anyone to see me. I have to strain to look up at him. It\u2019s easy for him to cover me with his broad body. I totally forgot we\u2019re on a busy Chicago street in the middle of the day. \u201cWhy\u2019d you back off from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I\u2019m against a wall. I can\u2019t move.\u201d Wait. Did he say I looked good?</p> <p>\u201cI mean when I was texting you. My little fox is already trying to give me the slip? You\u2019ll have to be quicker than that.\u201d He smirks at me, showing me his perfectly white teeth. How does he do that? Look all badass with his tattooed arms and big freaking body caging me in, but then his eyes go all soft and he flashes that smile, making him look so...I don\u2019t even have a word for it.</p><p>\u201cYou going to answer me, babe, or you going to keep staring at my mouth? Because if it\u2019s the mouth, we\u2019ve got to get out of here. I\u2019m not having everyone look at you when I get my hands back on you.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. I don\u2019t know what to say to that. I\u2019m in way over my head, and I know it. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ve not melted into a pile of goo at this point, but I know my face is cherry red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not little.\u201d He looks at me like he doesn\u2019t get what I\u2019m saying. \u201cYou called me a little fox. I\u2019m not little, and of course I\u2019ve had dinner before.\u201d I indicate to my body, letting him get my meaning.</p><p>One of his hands comes up to my cheek, his thumb brushing along my skin. \u201cYou look little to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything is probably little to you,\u201d I snap, something I don\u2019t normally do. I don\u2019t lash out at people, and I immediately feel like a jerkface for saying it.</p><p>\u201cEven when you\u2019re feisty, you\u2019re still cute as a fucking button.\u201d He lets out a chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019ve even got me saying shit like \u2018cute as a button.\u2019\u201d He seems to like that, because he\u2019s full-on smiling now, and I can\u2019t help but return one.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019ll go to dinner with me, or I\u2019ll drop down to my knees right here on the busy street and beg. You\u2019ve already got me wrapped around your finger. No need to rub it in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d No way he would. I can\u2019t see a man like him on his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou fail to see what I wouldn\u2019t do for you, little fox. Might as well show you.\u201d He goes to drop to his knees, but I grab him to stop his movements. My face is already flushed, and I would probably burst with embarrassment if he really did it.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 7</p><p>Sean</p><p>I ended up walking with Tessa to the place she was headed to for lunch. She could hardly look at me the whole way, but I did make her hold my hand. I could feel her nervous twitches as we walked, but I didn\u2019t let go. I wanted anyone watching to know she was mine. I\u2019m sure we looked a little odd together. Me with my tattoos and rough facial hair and her looking like a prim and proper angel. I didn\u2019t want anyone thinking she isn\u2019t taken. Because she is.</p><p>When we went to order at the counter I could see her blush again but I didn\u2019t understand why. I ordered four times what she did. I even made sure she got a chocolate chip cookie when she said she didn\u2019t want it. Who doesn\u2019t want a chocolate chip cookie?</p><p>After we got our orders, I walked her back to work. She said she needed to get some work done and would just eat there. I made sure to tell her that our quick lunch didn\u2019t count as a date, and that got me a genuine smile from her, which went all the way to her eyes.</p><p>Standing just inches from her, I touched her bottom lip with my thumb, thinking about how sweet her kiss was and what it did to me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been so consumed by someone before. I don\u2019t even know the last time I looked at a woman. That\u2019s how I knew she was different. She called to me from the very beginning. She was meant to be mine. I\u2019d been waiting for her. Like a little gift for the hell I had to work my way through growing up. Now I got this angel and she and I will make a family together, like I\u2019ve always desired. We just have to make it through one last hell.</p><p>She\u2019s so ingrained inside my mind that she\u2019s my only memory of anything good and perfect. My need is so far beyond comprehension, I don\u2019t think I could describe to her exactly why it is I crave her, even if she asked me to. I just need to make her crave me, too. Dig myself deep into her, so when all the truths come to light, I\u2019ll be in too deep for her to try and push me away.</p> <p>I kiss her lips lightly, and her blush returns to her cheeks. I\u2019m ripped in two as I watch her walk back inside the bank. Not having her within reach is starting to become a problem. Now that I know what she tastes like, feels like. The reality was tenfold what my fantasies were.</p><p>When I get back in my Chevelle, I try to take a few deep breaths to keep from rushing back into the bank and carrying her out. I\u2019m inches away from calling this whole thing off, but I keep cool, knowing that if I stick to the plan, everything will work out.</p><p>It\u2019s too late now. She would probably go run to the police, and I could never have her. She wouldn't believe a word of what I would tell her. And I can\u2019t just walk away, because Heavy would send in someone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The plan is in motion, and it will be perfect. It has to be or I\u2019ll lose everything.</p><p>Leaving the bank, I head over to Heavy\u2019s strip club. It shouldn\u2019t be too bad on a Friday during the day, but with the way he runs his shit, I\u2019m sure it will be just as gross.</p><p>Heavy texted me this morning after my incident with Nick. No doubt he wants to talk about it. He says this meeting is for everyone to finalize plans for Monday morning, but it\u2019s directed at me. He wants to make sure I\u2019ve secured Tessa, while making sure I\u2019m not a threat.</p><p>Heavy isn\u2019t dumb; he knows something is going on, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s figured out what my real goal is for this job.</p><p>I send a text to Tessa as I pull up to the front of the club.</p><p>Me: My cookie wasn\u2019t half as sweet as your lips.</p><p>Tessa: Thank you for getting me one, but I\u2019ll have to take your word for it.</p><p>Me: Trust me, little fox.</p><p>Tessa: Stop making me blush!</p><p>Me: Never. Get back to work, and think about where I\u2019m taking you tonight.</p><p>I slip my phone into my jeans and try to wipe the smile off my face as I get out of the car and head into the club.</p><p>I walk through the double doors and make my way past the front bar and beyond the stage. There are a few girls dancing for a couple of guys. The loud music thumping through the room makes a knot form in my stomach, and I just keep reminding myself, only a few more days.</p><p>As I open the door to the private room, I see Heavy sitting in one of the armchairs, getting sucked off by one of the strippers. Jesus, can I walk in here once without someone\u2019s dick out?</p><p>Two of his men are tag-teaming another dancer in the back corner, while two more play cards off to the side like nothing is happening.</p><p>I stand there and cross my arms, waiting for this to end so we can get to business. At least this made the hard-on I\u2019d had in my jeans since being with Tessa finally go away.</p><p>As I scan the room, I see the bathroom door is open. Nick walks out, rubbing his nose, trying to wipe away the white powder. He looks at me and leers. He\u2019s jealous of me and the fact that I don\u2019t have to do any of this shit to do what I do. I may be a criminal, but I don\u2019t have to be a piece of shit. Somehow the concept of breaking the law and still being somewhat a decent human being is incomprehensible to him.</p><p>I raise my chin, letting him know I\u2019m here and I\u2019m waiting. Just then, Heavy grunts and holds the stripper\u2019s head back while he cums on her face. The sight of his tiny dick getting off is embarrassing, but for some reason, he thinks this makes him look powerful.</p><p>Needing to look away, I turn my body around and pull out my phone. A text from Tessa makes me warm inside and washes away some of the dirty filth surrounding me. When I read her text, though, my heart drops a little.</p><p>Tessa: I can\u2019t tonight. I\u2019m sorry. I have plans already and can\u2019t break them. Tomorrow?</p><p>Me: You know how to keep a guy begging. You working tomorrow?</p><p>Tessa: Nope. Off all day.</p><p>Me: Then I want you for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p><p>\u201cThat fat chick playing hard to get?\u201d</p> <p>I turn around to see Nick leaning against the table as everybody finishes up with the strippers and sends them out of the room. He didn\u2019t see my messages, so he must just assume she turned me down like she turned him down. I think it burns him that Tessa would never give him the time of day. He\u2019ll take any hit at her to make himself feel better.</p><p>I don\u2019t respond; I just stare him down. It\u2019s the fool in the room who speaks most often, and I\u2019m going to let Nick prove to the group just what a fucking idiot he is. I take a seat at the table next to the guys playing cards and wait for Heavy to join us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if she turned you down, Sparrow. Girl like that doesn't know how to act when someone talks to her. Bet that pussy hasn\u2019t even had a good fucking yet.\u201d</p><p>My hands are resting on my legs, and I lean back in my chair, as cool as I could possibly be. Inside is another story, though. Inside, I\u2019m ripping his flesh from his bones, and his screams are a beautiful melody to my ears. But on the outside, I don\u2019t so much as flinch as he talks about my girl. He knows my warning earlier was good, but I\u2019m not stupid enough to make a move with five of his guys in the room willing to take his back. Even if they know he\u2019s wrong, they wouldn\u2019t take my side.</p><p>\u201cMakes my dick hard just thinking about it. Hey, maybe I\u2019ll offer to fuck her tonight when we\u2019re out for drinks. Break her in a little bit for you.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand over his crotch and gives me a disgusting smirk.</p><p>Placing my hand on the table in front of me, I lean forward on my forearms and let out a little laugh. It\u2019s bitter and clipped, but he\u2019s pissed I\u2019m mocking him.</p><p>\u201cReally, Nick? Because from what I heard from her friend, she said all that shit you\u2019re putting up your nose is causing a few problems in the bedroom.\u201d I have no idea if I\u2019m right, but by the look on his face, and the laughter through the room, I\u2019ve hit my target.</p><p>Nick is embarrassed in front of his crew, and I can see how angry that makes him. His pride is his weakness, and it\u2019s going to be his downfall. He reaches into his jacket\u2014for a weapon, I assume\u2014 but I just lean back in my chair, smiling, as Heavy approaches us and takes the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Nick. We\u2019ve got business.\u201d</p><p>Heavy looks me over and then looks at Nick, and I see that he decides to go ahead and not bring up the situation earlier today, no doubt thinking that his side of the story was probably less than truthful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just keep still and sit back, letting the rage boil inside me. Before this is all over, I\u2019m going to take care of Nick. That little motherfucker doesn\u2019t get to talk about my girl like that and live.</p><p>Heavy rolls out the blueprint I provided him of the bank, and we go over the plan for Monday once more. There are a couple of last-minute changes, but nothing on my end to worry about.</p><p>We spend the next few hours checking and rechecking the plan.</p><p>What most petty criminals don\u2019t understand is that a plan to break the law is the easy part. Anybody can walk into a bank and hold it up. It\u2019s what happens after that, that\u2019s where the work begins. These fuckers have no clue. This is how you get caught, worrying about the details on how to get in but never thinking about getting away and what comes after. They have every second of every minute of this job planned out until the money is in hand. Then they\u2019ve sort of got an exit strategy. It goes beyond that. We have to study this further and map out all possibilities of things going wrong.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting back and listening to all of it, knowing that once I\u2019ve secured my package, step two commences.</p><p>After hours have gone by, I check my watch and see that Tessa should home by now. I pull out my phone and look at her tracker movements, and I see it\u2019s moving away from her house.</p><p>My heart starts to beat faster, but I can\u2019t just get up and bolt out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSparrow.\u201d Heavy says my name like he\u2019s said it a few times, and I turn my eyes to him. \u201cWe keeping you from something?\u201d</p><p>Slipping my phone back into my jeans, I lean back in my seat and wait for him to continue. I\u2019m going to kill all these cocksuckers by the time this job is done.</p> <p>Chapter 8</p><p>Tessa</p><p>I run my fingers across my lips for the twentieth time since lunch. With every touch I can\u2019t help but smile. I keep licking them like there still might be a trace of him left to taste. Who knew a kiss could be so\u2014</p><p>\u201cEarth to Tessa.\u201d Harper snaps her fingers in front of my face, bringing me back to work. I feel like I\u2019ve gotten nothing done today because all I\u2019ve done is think about the kiss over and over again. Not to mention how I keep picking up my phone to read the text messages, waiting for another to arrive.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I bite out, agitated that she ripped me from my daydreaming. She eyes me for a second, probably a little taken aback by my tone, but I can\u2019t seem to care this time. Nope. I\u2019m on a kiss high, and that\u2019s where I want to stay.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p> <p>I glance over at the clock on the wall and see it\u2019s already a little after four. \u201cOh, let me grab my stuff.\u201d I hop off the high-top chair and smooth my dress before grabbing what I was working on. \u201cTrain?\u201d I ask, wondering if she has a ride with her new guy. I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t get offered another ride. I\u2019d rather take the train alone, even if it takes me a lot longer to get home.</p><p>\u201cYep. Nick is just going to meet us there tonight.\u201d She says it in a dreamy voice, making me wonder if I\u2019d talk about Sean in the same manner.</p><p>\u201cJust let me drop this off and grab my stuff.\u201d I pick up my cookie and phone to take with me, but Harper grabs the cookie from my hand, almost making me drop the pile of paper I have stacked in my arms.</p><p>\u201cCan I have this?\u201d She starts unwrapping it from the plastic before she even finishes the question. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to go to lunch, and besides you don\u2019t really need it.\u201d The way she says it really makes my gut clench, breaking some of the kiss spell I\u2019d been under.</p><p>I want to smack it out of her hand just for the comment, but I also know she didn\u2019t get a chance to take a lunch break. By the time I\u2019d gotten back, we had a rush come through. By then it was already three, so Harper said she\u2019d just skip it. I\u2019m not sure if it was because she was being nice or the fact that a suit comes in every Friday mid-afternoon who she likes to flirt with. Either way, I know she didn\u2019t get to eat.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mumble, before turning to head to my office, wrapping up what I need to before grabbing my stuff.</p><p>Checking my phone again, I debate a response.</p><p>Sean: Then I want you for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I was supposed to respond. He wants to hang out with me all day, and that makes more butterflies take flight in my stomach. They\u2019ve been flying around since Sean walked into the bank today. Aren\u2019t dates supposed to happen at night, and then you wait a day or two before you do it again?</p><p>It seems like our date was set, but he didn\u2019t say anything after that. I don\u2019t want to give a simple Okay. I want to engage him in conversation. I want to keep texting him.</p><p>Me: Sounds perfect. I can always cook if you like, or we can go out.</p><p>I send the text and slide the phone into my purse before making my way back to the front of the bank where Harper is waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d Harper does a little shuffle of her hips. \u201cLet\u2019s stop and get a bottle of wine or something on the way home to drink while we get ready.\u201d</p><p>When we finally make it home with a bottle of wine in hand, Harper grabs some glasses and pours each of us a drink.</p><p>I pull my phone out again and check the messages, but nothing new has come in.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep checking your phone? That\u2019s like the tenth time now.\u201d She sounds a little annoyed but I don\u2019t know why. She keeps doing the same thing with her phone. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t normally even bother with my phone, but today I can barely let it out of my hands. This feeling is exciting, but also freaking scary. I don\u2019t like how gone I already am. It\u2019s as if at any moment a rug could be pulled out from under me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just shrug, not wanting to tell her about Sean. She already gave me a serving of advice, and I don\u2019t want another helping of it. Or maybe I don\u2019t want to hear the truth. I want to stay in this dreamy little bubble of the sweet hot guy chasing after me for as long as I can, whether it\u2019s real or not.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m really okay with whichever you want to do.</p><p>I try again, willing him to text me back.</p><p>\u201cYou jump in the shower first.\u201d</p> <p>I grab my wine from off the counter and take a sip. I don\u2019t like the taste. I\u2019ve never been a fan of alcohol of any kind. It all tastes gross to me, but Harper seems to enjoy it, chugging her glass and pouring another.</p><p>\u201cHop to it if you want me to style you up. I want to get there earlier to get a table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Okay.\u201d Taking my wine with me, I head to the shower, making quick work so Harper can dress me up.</p><p>When I get out, I check my phone again. Nothing.</p><p>Me: Do you need my address?</p> <p>Jesus. I sent three messages in a row. Is that like pathetic or something? Needy? I have no idea what I\u2019m doing here. Grr. I drop my phone and concentrate on brushing and blow-drying my hair. I don\u2019t want to think about it anymore.</p><p>But I have no self-control, and I pick up my phone again just as Harper is coming out of the bathroom. Is this what girlfriends do? They talk about boys. Well, men, I guess. Sean is so far from a boy it\u2019s almost laughable.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not texting me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Harper drops her towel so she\u2019s standing naked in front of me while she pulls her hair down from her ponytail and starts brushing it out. I feel awkward standing here with her naked, but if I had a body like hers, I\u2019d probably walk around naked, too.</p><p>\u201cThe guy from the bank,\u201d I confess a little sheepishly, like she\u2019s my mom and I\u2019m going to get in trouble.</p><p>\u201cI thought we talked about that. Player. You can\u2019t handle someone like him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d I try to protest, but she cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably got his dick deep in some other snatch, and he\u2019ll come a-calling when he\u2019s done with her and ready for the next.\u201d</p><p>I cringe at her words. Dick deep. Jesus. Even worse, jealously shoots through me, making me tense. That\u2019s not good.</p><p>She actually looks at me like she feels a little bad. \u201cTrust me, I know the type.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, her words do nothing to make me feel better because I believe her. She does know the type. She\u2019s had them coming in and out of here since she moved in.</p><p>\u201cUnless that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for? Just a little fun.\u201d She wiggles her eyebrows.</p><p>Could I just do this for fun? No. I definitely couldn\u2019t. Sean seems like that kind of man who would leave me devastated. A man no one else could ever live up to.</p><p>\u201cHe was so sweet.\u201d I can\u2019t stop myself from trying again. Standing up for him. There was just something there. I felt it. The way he touched me, pulled me close, like he couldn\u2019t get enough of me. I felt wanted for the first time in a long time. Someone had chosen me. No one ever chooses me. My parents didn\u2019t want me, so I was dropped on my grandma. She had no choice but to take me.</p> <p>\u201cThey all are. That\u2019s how they get into your pants. You think he can be an asshole and then you\u2019ll suck his cock? No. The worst ones are the sweet ones. They make you think they\u2019re different, but they\u2019re gone just as quick as the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>With that, she walks out of my room, only to return a few minutes later with a make-up bag and a robe on. I\u2019m still looking at my phone pathetically when Harper grabs it from my hands.</p><p>\u201cStop. Don\u2019t be a Debbie downer. I want to go out and have fun. Dance, get drunk, and then get laid. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t try to snatch the phone back. I need to stop obsessing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t respond to any of his texts if he texts you back tonight. You\u2019ll seem easy. Text him back tomorrow. If he even texts back. Hell, I\u2019d wait till Monday. Make it seem like you were super busy all weekend having fun.\u201d</p><p>Her reasoning doesn\u2019t seem half bad. Not like I have anything to compare this to. I just had my first kiss today, and I\u2019m falling all over the guy. She knows more about dating than I do, but I wonder if she ever even follows her own advice. She goes through men faster than I thought possible, but maybe that\u2019s what she wants.</p><p>\u201cNow. Let\u2019s get you dressed up and make you forget all about Sean.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my glass of wine and shoot it back. It burns going down, but the act makes a wicked smile spread across Harper\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cDo me up,\u201d I tell her, already feeling a smidge better. I\u2019m going to go out and try to have a good time. Whether I want to or not. One thing is for sure, though, I\u2019m not going to check my phone again.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Sean</p><p>The second we are finally finished at the club, I\u2019m out of my chair and out the door. I don\u2019t wait around to hear what gets said about me. I\u2019ve got somewhere to be, and that\u2019s with my girl, making sure she is okay. I hate when I don\u2019t have eyes on her. It makes me feel uneasy.</p><p>Nick gets up the same time I do, exiting the club and going to his car. I wait for just a second for him to leave, not wanting him following me.</p><p>I kept feeling my phone vibrate with incoming text messages throughout the meeting, but I couldn\u2019t check them. Too many eyes were on me, and I\u2019d already had enough attention brought to me today thanks to Nick. I needed to keep my head down and stick to the plan, and that meant paying attention and staying cool. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After Nick is long gone, I walk over to my car. When I get in, I crank it up and throw it in gear. I need to be a good distance away from eyes before I check where Tessa is.</p><p>Once I\u2019m a few blocks from the club and see I don\u2019t have a tail, I pull over and check her messages. I see I missed a few and then they stopped. I text back immediately, not wanting her to think I was ignoring her.</p><p>Me: Hey, little fox. Sorry. I had a meeting that ran late. What are you up to?</p><p>I wait to see if she reads the text message, but it just sits there, delivered, and I think I should try again.</p> <p>Me: I want to spend all day together, so send me your address. If you\u2019d cook for me, that would be great, but I would also like to take you out as well since we have the time.</p><p>I wait a few more seconds after it\u2019s sent before checking her tracker. But I\u2019m losing my patience.</p><p>I grit my teeth, my jaw nearly cracking when I see Tessa\u2019s at Coco\u2019s. It\u2019s the club Nick goes to a lot and where he said he met Harper a few times before. That place is crawling with trashy guys looking to get sucked off at the tables and fucked on the dance floor. I\u2019m sure it looks nice with all the leather seats and chandeliers, but it\u2019s as seedy as they come.</p><p>I can\u2019t figure out what in the fuck my girl is doing there.</p><p>Me: Tessa, where are you?</p> <p>Me: Are you okay?</p><p>Me: Tell me you\u2019re alright. I\u2019m worried.</p><p>Finally, the messages all pop up as \u2018read\u2019, and I wait while the little bubbles tell me she\u2019s typing.</p><p>Tessa: Fuck off, asshole. She\u2019s busy.</p><p>Me: Who is this? I want to talk to Tessa.</p><p>Tessa: Sorry, Sean. Her mouth is occupied ;)</p> <p>My foot is on the gas and my tires are screeching before I\u2019ve read the last word. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s got her phone or what kind of trouble she\u2019s in, but I\u2019m on my way to her. I don\u2019t like that my one way to track her is in someone else\u2019s hand. I wanted to wait and give her a chance to ask me to meet her out, or for her to tell me where she is. That had been my plan when I found out she already had stuff going on tonight. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll explain the fact that I knew exactly where she was, but I\u2019ll figure it out. What\u2019s most important is making sure my girl is okay. It\u2019s all that matters at this moment. Everything else can go fuck itself.</p><p>I won\u2019t have her separated from me like this again. The pain and panic running through my chest right now has my adrenaline pumping and my anger on edge. I\u2019m ready to rip someone\u2019s throat out, but I\u2019m worried something is wrong with my girl.</p><p>The drive should take about twenty minutes, but it\u2019s Friday night in downtown Chicago, and I\u2019m having a hard time getting around the traffic. I\u2019m constantly checking my phone for more texts and switching between that and her tracker to see if she\u2019s moved.</p><p>I finally find a break in traffic and pull up outside the front of the club. The valet comes around to take my keys, but I don\u2019t hand them over. I just give the kid a hard stare and he steps away. The head bouncer comes over as I step up on the curb, and he holds his hand up to the kid.</p><p>\u201cSparrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOak.\u201d I nod to him as he lets me pass, leaving my car exactly where I parked it. He and I go way back, and if I\u2019m pulling up outside this club, it\u2019s for a good goddamn reason. I don\u2019t hang at places like this unless I have to, usually if I\u2019m working a job or con.</p><p>Just as I reach the door, it\u2019s pulled open for me and I walk straight into the club. Oak is by my side now, and I tell him what I need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my girl. Redhead, curvy, name\u2019s Tessa. She\u2019s here with a regular, her name\u2019s Harper.\u201d He looks around for a second and then points across the dance floor. I spot her in half a second, something pulling me to her. Moving towards Tessa, I toss a thanks over my shoulder to Oak and make my way around to her table on the other side of the club.</p> <p>There\u2019s a sea of people here, and it\u2019s loud as fuck, but I don\u2019t take my eyes off my girl.</p><p>She\u2019s leaning back in the booth, the small table in front of her littered with empty glasses. Her head is resting on the back of the bench, her dark auburn hair piled up, revealing her neck. Even from across the room, I can see she\u2019s got a ton of make-up on. Jesus, has she been crying? It looks like the dark black around her eyes has run down her cheeks a little. As I get closer, I can see she\u2019s wearing something strapless, but her lower half is covered by the table. I grit my jaw tighter when I see the amount of cleavage she\u2019s showing. No one should get to see that but me. I\u2019m ready to stab out every eye that so much as looks her way. That is only for me to see, and I know who came up with the outfit.</p><p>As I get even closer, I look around her table and see Nick is there. Clenching my fists, I continue to push through the crowd, trying to get to them, pushing off anyone who tries to grab for me. It looks like just the two of them are at the table, and I see him leering at her. Just as I approach, I see hands come up around his waist from under the table and realize that must be Harper under there.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to scare Tessa, but I need her out of here, and I won\u2019t negotiate. She turns her fuzzy eyes to mine, and I see the moment she realizes it\u2019s me. The shock is clear on her face.</p><p>I pull off my leather jacket and lean down to help her put it on. I don\u2019t say a word to her, and she doesn\u2019t fight me.</p><p>I help her up out of the booth just as Harper comes up from under the table. Nick looks at me, and if I didn\u2019t have Tessa in my arms, I\u2019d fucking shoot him dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, where are you going with her? We were having fun!\u201d Harper\u2019s words are slurred, and I can tell she\u2019s just as drunk as Tessa.</p><p>\u201cYeah, stay awhile. We could all share.\u201d Nick wraps his arms around Harper as his eyes roam over my Tessa, showing that all the offhanded comments he\u2019s been making about her are bullshit. He wants her. I can\u2019t blame him, but it doesn't mean I won\u2019t stab him in the throat if he tries to have any part of her. And I do mean any.</p><p>If I have to choose between killing him in the middle of a club and getting Tessa out of here, I\u2019m taking care of my girl first. I can kill him later. And as much as I don\u2019t like Harper, I don\u2019t want to leave her here with him. I know if something happened to her, it would rip up my girl\u2019s soft heart.</p><p>I can see his words about getting at Tessa hit Harper harder than she expected, and I see her grabbing her purse and moving away from him.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d She doesn\u2019t meet my eyes as she stands up and nods her head. I\u2019ve got Tessa wrapped up in my jacket, and I want to carry her from here, but even as long as my jacket is, her bare legs are showing. I can\u2019t even think about how short that dress is and who saw her in it.</p><p>I hold her to me, still not speaking a word as I help her from the club and to my car at the curb. I open up the passenger door and let Harper climb in the back, putting Tessa in the front.</p><p>As I lean over her and buckle Tessa\u2019s seatbelt, I feel her lips whisper against my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d is all I can say in response as I walk around my car and get in the driver seat. I see Nick come out of the club just as I pull away. Both of us know this isn\u2019t finished.</p> <p>\u201cTake Plymouth up to Trent. We\u2019re two blocks up,\u201d Harper says from the back. Her voice is tired, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, it sounds like she\u2019s more than angry.</p><p>I look over at Tessa and see her leaning her head against the door, and her eyes are closed. She passed out within seconds, and I\u2019m relieved I got to her just in time.</p><p>We ride in silence to their apartment, and when I pull up out front, I get out of the driver\u2019s seat and let Harper out from behind me.</p><p>She gets out, but before she walks away, I stop her with my words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Tessa with me tonight. I want her safe.\u201d Harper looks at me for a second and then just shrugs, like she\u2019s giving up on Tessa, too. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Nick\u2019s a piece of shit, but he\u2019s a smooth talker. He can get pretty much talk anyone to do what he wants. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t meet my eyes, just nods her head and looks away. She takes a step but stops. \u201cHang on here a second, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>I watch as Harper goes into the building, and I lean into the car to check on Tessa. I push back some of the hair that\u2019s fallen over her face, and I see her face is indeed streaked with make-up and tears. I need to know what made her cry and fix the problem. I can\u2019t stand the thought of her being hurt by anything.</p><p>Tessa turns into my hand and blinks her sleepy drunken eyes at me. Suddenly, she has the biggest goofiest grin on her face, and it\u2019s as if she\u2019s just noticed I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cHey, hot lips,\u201d she slurs. The nickname brings a smile to my face.</p><p>\u201cHot lips, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Yous got like the best lips. I\u2019ve never had lips before you. But yous the best. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I let out a little laugh as she hiccups. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Big thick ones. Makes me wanna nibble.\u201d She closes her eyes and slowly opens them. \u201cBest first kiss ever.\u201d</p><p>Her words knock me in the chest. I was her first kiss? Jesus, why does that make my cock hard? If I\u2019m her first kiss, then I\u2019m going to be her first...</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I look up to see Harper holding out a bag, and I reach out to take it from her. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s some of her stuff. Girl shit.\u201d She rubs her arms like the cold is getting to her. \u201cJust, you know, take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d With that, I put Tessa\u2019s bag in the back seat and get behind the wheel. I watch as Harper goes inside the building, and then I put the car in gear.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a real bitch,\u201d Tessa slurs, and again I laugh. I get the feeling she\u2019s never said that out loud before.</p><p>She\u2019s utterly adorable when she drinks, though I\u2019m still not inclined to let her get this far gone again. It\u2019s easy to forget about the danger she put herself in when she\u2019s being cute and trying to sing the song from The Little Mermaid.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a fire, and why does it...what\u2019s the word...\u201d</p><p>Her silly hiccups keep interrupting her singing, and I reach over, holding her hand the whole way to my place.</p><p>Pulling up to the warehouse, I hit the button on my visor and the garage door opens. When I park, I shut the garage door, locking us in. I grab her bag and go around to the passenger side, opening up the door to help her out. Tessa shivers at the chill in the garage and proceeds to sing a song from the movie Frozen. I try to bite my lip so I don\u2019t laugh, and I reach down, scooping her up in my arms.</p><p>I carry her through the door and into the main warehouse. It opens up into a living space and kitchen, but I don\u2019t stop there. I carry her down a long hall that leads to my bedroom, and I take her to my bed.</p><p>After I lay her down on my bed, I turn on the bedside lamp. She lets out a deep breath as she snuggles into the covers, trying to escape the soft glow. She makes no protest at the fact that I\u2019ve just taken her home with me. She just snuggles into my bed like she\u2019s been doing it forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I get a washcloth from the bathroom and wet it with warm water. When I go back to the bed, I sit on the edge and start to wipe away the make-up on her eyes. She\u2019s got so much on, she doesn\u2019t look like my Tessa.</p><p>After a few swipes, it\u2019s mostly gone, and I can see the fresh-faced beauty I\u2019ve been craving. She looks so perfect here in my bed.</p><p>Leaning down, I place one soft kiss on her cheek, wanting more, but not able to let myself take advantage of her. No, when I take her for the first time, I want her looking into my eyes and begging me for more.</p><p>As I lean back and look down at her, she whispers my name as she falls asleep.</p><p>Now all I\u2019ve got to do is take her clothes off like a gentleman and keep my hands to myself. Shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, right?</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Sean</p><p>I give the dress a little tug and it does nothing at all. Trying a little harder, I yank with a little more force, making her big honey eyes pop open at me. I expect her to maybe jump or wonder where she is, but she just smiles at me. Trusting. A trust I\u2019m going to shatter, but I\u2019m going to enjoy it while I still have it. Soak up as much of it as I can. Hold on to each sweet moment.</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d Her voice is husky, and I growl at the simple word. I know she means yank on the dress harder, but all I can picture is her below me as I thrust my cock into her virgin-tight pussy while she begs me to fuck her harder. To give her something only I can. Telling me I\u2019m the only man she\u2019ll ever let have her. That she\u2019ll be mine forever.</p><p>She licks her lips and a sweet little giggle pops out of her mouth as she catches what she said. Her little giggle alone makes my cock ache with need. Fuck having blue balls, I\u2019m going to have a fucking blue body. I don\u2019t just want to fuck her. I want to rub every part of me all over her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, handsome. I\u2019m sure you rip clothes off women all the time.\u201d She reaches up and her finger traces the hair along my jaw before she grabs a handful off it. Yeah, I\u2019m never shaving again; I like her grabbing onto me like that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall ever ripping clothing off of a woman before,\u201d I admit. Fuck, I can\u2019t even remember the last time I\u2019d been with a woman, let alone who it was. When I was younger and just started getting my hands dirty, I played, but as time went on I quit that shit fast.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cocky when it comes to my looks, but I know I attract a lot of female attention. Add that to the fact that I don\u2019t treat women like shit like a lot of the men do in the places I hang out. Women would get attached to me, and then I\u2019d still end up hurting them. That was something I took no pleasure in. I\u2019ve been keeping to myself since, focusing instead on stacking my bank account. My hand did the job just fine when I needed the release, and that approach came with fewer problems.</p><p>I\u2019d always wanted to settle down one day, but I knew I had to get my hands clean. That was something I planned to do after this score, but sweet little Tessa stumbled into my life a few weeks before I was ready. She fell right into my path, and there\u2019s no turning around now. The goal is still the same, there are just a few added parts to it now. And the end goal is bigger and better than I could have ever dreamed of. No, I didn't think perfection and sweet innocence like her even existed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can be your first.\u201d She wiggles her eyebrows. \u201cYou can be my first, too.\u201d She parts her legs, and I can\u2019t stop myself from looking as she shows her simple white underwear. I thought maybe having too many meetings in the back of strip clubs had jaded me. I\u2019ve seen women in what\u2019s supposed to be the sexiest lingerie, but the sight of her in simple white panties has me wanting to cum in my pants.</p><p>I know the truth, though. It\u2019s not about what she\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s her. Everything about her seems to do this to me. This little curvy slip of a girl can turn me inside out without even trying. No games or batting her eyelashes coyly at me. It\u2019s simply her. Everything about her just does it for me. She\u2019s utterly perfect. Like she\u2019s made for me. Made to drive me utterly crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be your first what?\u201d I bait her, wanting to hear her say it. She parts her legs a little more, showing me her panty-covered pussy.</p><p>\u201cEverything. Go ahead. Ruin me.\u201d She giggles again, and I\u2019m not sure what to make of her comment.</p><p>Ruin her. I like and hate the idea all at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never ruin you.\u201d Make her want only me? Fuck yes. But ruin her? Never. It already kills me that I might jade her a little. She\u2019s so trusting and sweet. I\u2019d hate for her to lose that. I hate that I might be the one to make her lose that.</p><p>If only I\u2019d met her another way. She could have kept all the innocent trust she has because she\u2019d have me to protect her and to shield her from everything that could shatter it. Make sure nothing touched her so she could keep it.</p><p>Her hand drops from my face and runs down my chest. I lean into her hand, liking her touch.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d ruin me. I think I could cum just looking at you.\u201d She keeps running her hand over my chest and brings her other hand up to join in. Fucking hell, she\u2019s so cute when she\u2019s drunk. Gone is the shy girl, and in her place is someone who doesn\u2019t think before she speaks, and I love it. I love the shy blush that hits her cheeks, but I enjoy this just as much.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I told you that you\u2019d already ruined me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. Take off your shirt. I want to see how far those tattoos go.\u201d She\u2019s changing the subject, even when she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s doing it. My girl seems to have a problem with thinking she isn\u2019t hot or some shit, but we\u2019ll work on that over time. She\u2019ll soon see how fucking serious I am about us. She won\u2019t have a doubt her in mind about the lengths I\u2019ll go to to have her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Actions speak louder than words, and she\u2019ll be seeing that very soon.</p><p>Reaching over my head, I grab the collar of my shirt and pull it up and off, giving her what she asked for.</p><p>Her sharp inhalation makes me want to puff out my chest. She wiggles around, still rubbing her hands all over me. I need to get her under the covers and asleep before I have her legs over my shoulders, with me in between them.</p><p>I won\u2019t risk her not remembering our first time together. I want her to remember every detail of it. I want to hook her into me and show her all the ways I can please her. I want to give her what she needs.</p><p>I reach down and tug at her dress again. \u201cI hate this fucking thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it? I thought I looked sexy for once.\u201d She pouts up at me, her bottom lip sticking out, making me want to bite it.</p><p>\u201cYou're always sexy.\u201d I grab the top of the dress and do as she suggested. I rip it. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like other people seeing you with so few clothes on.\u201d</p><p>She gasps as the material easily comes apart in my hands, leaving her in just her panties. I throw the dress behind me, not caring where it lands.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that was hot. Can we do it again?\u201d Her wide eyes are filled with excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou got another dress around here I don\u2019t know about?\u201d I tease her.</p><p>She just shakes her head, that happy excited look still pasted across her face. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you more and rip them off you if you really want me to, but you only wear them in the house.\u201d No way is she ever going out dressed like that again. I\u2019d end up doing life in prison.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear whatever I want.\u201d She thrusts her chin up smugly, but it\u2019s too adorable to be threatening. I have no idea how someone can be smug and adorable all at once, but she\u2019s doing it, and I just smile at her as I try not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to walk around in public without a shirt on?\u201d Her fingers, which were busily trailing my chest, following the lines of my tattoos, stop and dig into me in a possessive manner. It makes my cock jerk, and I fucking love the feeling.</p><p>She glares at me.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that, little fox. It\u2019s all yours. I\u2019m just showing you how it makes me feel.\u201d I grab the blanket and pull it over her. Hiding her body from me. It takes everything in me not to look at it, but I know my control would probably shatter if I did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you some water and something to stop your headache before it starts.\u201d I pull myself from the bed and make my way towards the kitchen to grab a bottle of water and a few pills for her. When I turn around, I nearly trip over her.</p><p>She\u2019s standing in the middle of my kitchen with just her panties on.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to ruin me.\u201d She says it so matter-of-factly, no shyness at all.</p><p>She pushes her body up against me, her naked chest hitting mine. Her curves melt into me. Reaching up, she locks her arms around my neck, and I have to bend a little for her to reach, even though she\u2019s on her tiptoes.</p><p>All control snaps.</p><p>My hands go to her face, dropping the water bottle and pills, letting them hit the floor as I take her mouth. Her sweetness hits my lips, and the taste of her reminds me how desperate I am for her. It\u2019s like being trapped in the desert for weeks and finally having water. I can\u2019t stop myself from wanting to drink her down. One sip will never be enough. Thrusting my tongue into her mouth, I try to devour her. I never knew lips could be so soft. They yield to me just like all of her curves.</p><p>Her body wiggles against mine, her moan filling my mouth.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>I let go of her face and grab her hips, easily lifting her to me. Her legs wrap around my waist. Before I know what I\u2019m doing, I have her back in my bed without having broken the kiss. I\u2019ve somehow got my pants and underwear off, and my naked cock is pressed against her sheathed pussy. When I realize what I\u2019ve done, that I\u2019ve taken it too far, I pull back and rest my forehead against hers.</p><p>Get it under control, Sparrow. You can have her in the morning.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She moves her hips against me. Her warm pussy rubs my cock, testing every bit of control I have. I feel cum leak out the tip, and I have to bite the inside of my mouth to stop myself from cumming. No way would I cum before her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you what you need, little fox. Then you\u2019ll go to sleep like a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it. Take me. I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day. Come morning I\u2019ll be too shy to ask.\u201d She moves against me more. I know she\u2019s right. In the morning she will be too shy to ask, but I won\u2019t let her pull away. I\u2019ll bulldoze right through all those walls she might try to erect. Any self-doubt she might have, I\u2019ll shatter.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to ask. I\u2019ll always give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>I pull back from her a little so I have room to slide one of my hands between us. I dip one finger into her underwear, going straight for her clit, not wanting to draw it out. I know what she needs, and I\u2019m going to give her that. I won\u2019t leave her in need, but I\u2019m only willing to give her this tonight. Tomorrow she\u2019ll get it all.</p><p>Her hips rise and moans pour from her lips when I touch her there.</p><p>She\u2019s fucking soaked. Dropping my head down to one of her big tits, I take her nipple into my mouth and suck. I stroke my finger where she needs it the most, and she instantly cums. Her whole body jerks, and when my name leaves her lips, I find myself cumming on her. Fuck. I can\u2019t believe she went off for me like that. I didn\u2019t think anything could be hotter than that. A simple touch from me sent her over the edge. It gives me hope. I continue to suck her nipple and work my finger on her clit, milking her orgasm for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she goes limp under me, I look up to see a peaceful smile on her face, her eyes closed. She\u2019s out.</p><p>Pulling my finger out from her panties I bring it to my mouth, tasting her innocent pussy for the first time. It hardens my cock. I swear to Christ, it\u2019s the taste of pure heaven. I can\u2019t wait to have my mouth on her. I\u2019ll probably eat her pussy for days. Until she begs me to stop, and I\u2019ll beg her not to take it from me.</p><p>I have two days to make her fall in love with me. Ingrain myself into her as deep as possible, because come Monday, she\u2019s going to hate me.</p><p>Rubbing my hands over her stomach, I think of another way to keep her attached to me. I\u2019m going to put my baby there. Then she can never leave me. I\u2019ll be spending the next few days trying to plant my seed.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Tessa</p><p>I wake to a warm body pressed firmly against mine. One hand is inside my panties, cupping my core, and another hand grasps one of my boobs. Warm breath tickles my neck. A face is buried there. The night before starts flashing through my mind.</p><p>Getting dressed up with Harper, going to the club, shots, then I seemed to slip into some kind of Sean pity party. A few guys had hit on me, and I hated every second of it. All I could do was keep thinking about Sean. I was comparing them all to him. Most of the men there had that whole bad boy thing that he does, but they didn\u2019t have his soft eyes.</p><p>Then people started going at it. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was at a club or an orgy. Or maybe that\u2019s what clubs are like. Every time I went to check my phone, Harper would make me take a shot. Needless to say, I took way too many. Then I started to cry. I think I might be one of those depressed drunks. I\u2019m not sure how my head isn\u2019t pounding right now.</p><p>The club only made me feel like I didn\u2019t belong, and Harper didn\u2019t seem to help. As much as she would give me shit about Sean, she crawled all over Nick as soon as he walked in the door.</p><p>Did I call Sean? Just from his smell, I know it\u2019s him wrapped so tightly around me. I\u2019ll never forget that smell: earthy and warm. It will forever be branded in my mind. I don't think I could move an inch if I tried. His big body is locked around mine. Even his legs are tangled with mine, like we made crazy love all night and finally passed out like this.</p><p>That\u2019s when I feel a hard cock pressed firmly against my ass. It\u2019s clear Sean is big all over. Part of me wants to jump from the bed, but a bigger part wants to stay still and enjoy this. To soak in every second of it.</p><p>I try to remember more. Sean\u2019s face flashes in my mind again. Him pulling me from the table at the bar, wrapping his jacket around me, a look of jealousy and concern on his face, then taking me home with him, where I pretty much begged him to have sex with me. He didn\u2019t. I\u2019m positive I\u2019d still feel the effects of that if he did. I do remember him making me cum.</p><p>Sucking my nipple into his mouth as he slipped his hands into my panties, taking me to a place I\u2019d never been before. I want that again. Over and over again. Even more, I want to do it to him.</p><p>All the things I said to him flash through my mind, making me cringe. Jesus, how am I going to face him when he wakes? I\u2019d asked him to rip my dress from my body...and he did. His big hands grabbed hold and tore it like it was nothing. Maybe I could sneak out. I have no idea what I\u2019ll wear, though, because I\u2019m pretty sure that dress is destroyed.</p><p>I wiggle a little to see if I can slip free, but he only latches on tighter, and I swear I hear him mumble \u201cmine.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>I feel my vagina clench at the word. That\u2019s completely ridiculous and barbaric, and I want him to say it again. I wiggle again, but this time he just lets out a cute little manly growl. I have to hold my laughter in.</p><p>Then all the sweet stuff he said to me comes flooding back, making me smile. God, this man is too good to be true. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve won the man lottery or something. I curse the blanket that is laid over us; I want to see myself wrapped in his arms. I want to see those tattoos latched around me so possessively.</p><p>I remember following him into the kitchen and the look on his face when he turned around and saw me standing there. I should be embarrassed; I can\u2019t remember the last time someone saw me in my panties. Harper walks around naked like it\u2019s no big deal, but I find myself to be self-conscious. I have wide hips and a few stretch marks from when my boobs came in a little too quickly one summer.</p><p>But that look on his face when he saw me like that was one of pure hunger. Like he was starving for me. Me. I have no doubt this man could have his pick of women, but the way he keeps acting makes me feel like I\u2019m all he wants. It\u2019s me in his bed, not someone else. He came looking for me last night. I have no clue how he found me. I\u2019m just happy he did. Who knew where I could have woken up if I hadn\u2019t run into him last night?</p><p>I know I\u2019m new at this, but I find myself pushing all the things Harper has been chirping in my ear right out of my head. Sean has been nothing but pure sweetness to me, and I\u2019m not going to mess that up. I want to see where this could go. And besides, it\u2019s far too late.</p><p>I\u2019m already falling for him, and I\u2019m in way over my head. Either way, I\u2019m going to drown in him, and I want to enjoy every second of it. I\u2019ll pick up the pieces later. But maybe if I\u2019m lucky, he won\u2019t break me.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p><p>Sean</p><p>Mine.</p><p>I wake and feel Tessa stir under me, and I tighten my grip on her. She\u2019s spooned against me, and I\u2019ve got one hand down her panties cupping her pussy and one hand on her lush tit, letting it spill over my fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My aching cock is nestled against her ass, small drops of pre-cum dripping onto her lower back. I kept waking up and nearly cumming all over her, only to hold it back and fall asleep again.</p><p>Pressing against her again, I feel her push her ass up against my rock-hard cock. I don\u2019t know how the damn thing hasn\u2019t broken off from the need I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, little fox.\u201d I nuzzle her neck, kissing the warm skin there. I should feel guilty for what I want from her and what I\u2019m going to take from her. I should feel some kind of remorse for the things I\u2019m going to do, but I can\u2019t seem to find an ounce of it inside me. She\u2019s mine, and she will always be mine. I\u2019ll make damn sure of it.</p><p>\u201cIs there a hole around here I can crawl into and die?\u201d</p><p>I can feel the burn of her cheeks as I kiss her neck. She must be remembering what happened last night.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no place on earth you could hide from me, Tessa.\u201d I feel her shiver against me as my fingers find her wet clit. \u201cSlide your panties down. I promised I wouldn\u2019t take you until morning, and the sun is almost up.\u201d</p><p>I keep my grip on her as she wiggles her panties down to her feet and kicks them off. I start to kiss and bite her shoulder as her naked ass makes contact with my bare cock.</p><p>\u201cNow lift your leg up and drape it over mine. Open your body up for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. I know, baby. We\u2019ll go slow.\u201d</p><p>Tessa takes a little breath and relaxes back against me before raising her leg and draping it over mine. We lie spooned on our sides, with one of my arms under her, my hand cupping her tit, and the other hand still on her cunt, strumming her soaked clit.</p><p>I move my hips so my cock pulls away from her ass and moves down into position to penetrate her. The head rests against her wet heat, ready to take her hymen.</p><p>Feeling thick drops of cum coat her virgin hole, I hold myself back from releasing my seed. I have to cum inside her. I need to bind her to me, and this is the only way I can make damn sure of it.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Tessa.\u201d I rub little circles on her clit as I press inside her. Her opening nearly squeezes shut, refusing entry. \u201cLet me in, little fox. I\u2019m going to get inside you and make you feel so good, but you\u2019ve got to let me in.\u201d</p><p>I pinch her nipple and rub her clit. I feel her take a few more breaths, and her opening relaxes a little. It\u2019s enough for me to push just inside, bumping against her innocence.</p><p>I give her just a few shallow thrusts so she feels me pushing against it. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Tessa. Just one thrust and you\u2019re mine in every way.\u201d She shivers again at my words and presses her body down on my cock a little. \u201cTell me you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, Sean. Please, make me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay forever, Tessa. Tell me you want me forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>With that one word, she\u2019s signed her life over to me. She\u2019s mine now, and I\u2019m never letting her go.</p><p>Holding her close, I thrust up into her tight channel and start to cum the second my shaft is encased in her heat.</p><p>Tessa lets out a little squeak as I continue to rub her clit and pinch her nipple. I feel her clench around my cock as she draws more of my cum out of me. I press my forehead to her shoulder, grunting out my orgasm as I feel hers flow through her.</p><p>Her cunt grips me tighter than I\u2019ve ever felt as I splash my seed into her unprotected pussy.</p> <p>\u201cSean,\u201d she whispers as her orgasm starts to fade, and I start to move from behind her.</p><p>I thrust inside her lazily, both of us having cum from the first connection. Neither of us is in any hurry now. I feel every squeeze of her pussy as I try to leave her body, and she wants to hold me inside her. I feel the pulse of her cunt as I thrust back in, her body welcoming me every time.</p><p>There\u2019s no barrier to stop me from entering her. I\u2019ve taken her hymen, and her innocence belongs to me. Only me. She\u2019ll never have another, no matter what happens between us. I\u2019ll make her need me like I need her.</p><p>And if she doesn\u2019t want me, I\u2019ll want her enough for the both of us. If she doesn\u2019t love me, I\u2019ll just love her twice as hard. For her and for our unborn baby growing inside her.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Tessa. Tell me you need me.\u201d My words are a plea. I need them. I can\u2019t lose this.</p><p>She reaches up, grabbing a handful of my hair as I glide in and out of her. Some of my cum leaks out, but I\u2019ll put more inside her.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Sean. So much. Harder.\u201d</p><p>I thrust harder, giving her the pressure she needs. I move my fingers from her clit to rest on her lower belly, feeling where our baby is going to grow. She\u2019ll have no choice but to be bound to me and I to her.</p><p>As I thrust inside her, I feel her clenches start again, and I know she\u2019s getting close to another orgasm. I want her so far gone that she\u2019s willing to give me anything I ask for.</p><p>I put my lips to her ear, whispering to her. \u201cSay you want my cum inside you. Tell me you love my cum in you.\u201d</p><p>I feel her shiver, but she doesn\u2019t speak. I stop thrusting, and I just hold my cock inside her.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Tessa. Give me the words. I know you want to say them, baby. Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes and swallows, before whispering the words I want to hear. \u201cI want your cum inside me.\u201d</p><p>Her breathy hesitation makes cum leak out of my cock, but I\u2019m as deep inside her as I can go. I\u2019m pressed against her cervix. I\u2019m not going to stop the flow of cum now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay you love it inside you, Tessa.

Her words of love echo in my mind as I bring my fingers back to her clit.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s back at the edge after just a few strokes of my cock and light touches to her clit.

She wants me to send her over the edge into a blissful orgasm, but I want more.</p><p>\u201cSay it, little fox. Tell me this is the only cock you\u2019ll ever let inside you,\u201d I growl against her soft skin, needing the confirmation.</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d she pants. Her breaths are heavy, and our bodies are becoming sticky and slippery against each other. \u201cOnly your cock, Sean.\u201d</p><p>I throb at her promise, letting a little more cum leak out.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll always do what I ask, little fox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Her moans are loud as she begs for release. \u201cPlease, Sean. Please. I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will, Tessa. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Just as I thrust hard inside her one last time, I pinch her clit, sending her over the edge. Her body tenses against mine, and she lets out a scream as she cums.</p><p>I move my hand from her cunt, gripping her hip tightly. I hold her steady as I line the tip of my cock with her cervix again and empty inside her. I squirt into it, trying to get all of my seed into her fertile womb. I want my baby in her as soon as possible.</p><p>Her breaths are ragged as she comes down from her high, going limp against my body. I smile against her shoulder, holding our sweaty bodies together as we stay connected. Neither of want to break this moment.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Her one word makes me laugh, and I kiss her shoulder and her neck. \u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a word for how that felt. But good is a start,\u201d Tessa giggles, and it\u2019s music to my ears.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to try harder next time if that\u2019s all you can say.\u201d</p><p>She playfully hits my arm and laughs as I pull her closer to me.</p><p>We lie there quietly, and I can feel the stupid grin on my face. I close my eyes, placing kisses all over her, enjoying this perfect moment.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tessa whispers.</p> <p>Her words take me by surprise, and it\u2019s then I feel a little guilty. Pulling back a little, I turn her face so she can look into my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t ever thank me for what I do to you, Tessa. You deserve to be worshiped.\u201d I pause and look deeply into her eyes. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Tessa</p><p>Soft kisses rain over my face, Sean\u2019s beard tickles me, making me giggle. \u201cI\u2019m sleepy.\u201d I playfully try to push him away, but there\u2019s no real effort behind it. I don\u2019t want him to stop.</p><p>\u201cCome on, little fox. I\u2019ve got to get you clean and feed you. It\u2019s already almost noon.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to see the room flooded with light now. Sean stares down at me. His eyes look more green than normal, the afternoon sun making them glow. Thick eyelashes frame them. I\u2019m sure a lot of women would kill for those lashes.</p><p>\u201cYou passed out on me again. You\u2019re good for a man\u2019s ego.\u201d A soft smile plays at his lips, and his hair is a wild mess. God, a girl could get used to waking up to the sight of him. I\u2019ve done it twice already in just a few hours, and I already want it forever. I don't care how crazy that sounds. I still want it.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but raise my hand and run my fingers through his hair. I love how every time I touch him, he leans into me. Like he craves my touch.</p><p>\u201cYou could make a girl get used to being treated like this.\u201d I feel myself blush at my own words. How can something be so easy and hard at the same time? I feel like I can say or do anything in front of him, but my underlying shyness still lurks just below the surface. It\u2019s all swirling around inside, and I\u2019m not sure what to do with it, but for the first time I don\u2019t feel awkward. He makes me feel like I fit here with him. I\u2019m not the odd person out like I always seem to be. Not with him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll have you used to it before the weekend is over. Which you\u2019re spending with me, by the way.\u201d With that, he jumps off the bed, flinging the blanket onto the floor, leaving me laid out naked in his bed. Every inch of me is exposed by the afternoon light.</p><p>I go to cover myself, but he hauls me up and over his shoulder, making me squeal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too big! You\u2019re going to hurt yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tiny little fox. Besides, it will be a cold day in hell when I can\u2019t carry my woman around whenever I want.\u201d</p><p>I want to say something about the little comment, but I opt not to. Everything is little compared to him.</p><p>\u201cYour woman?\u201d I ask, as I stare at a very nice firm bare ass, the urge to bite it strong within me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby. For a smart girl, you\u2019re a little slow on the uptake. I\u2019ll keep reminding you just how mine you are until you finally believe it. And I\u2019ll enjoy every second of it.\u201d</p><p>God, I hope he does, and I will soak up every second of it like a lost little kitten just wanting attention. I don\u2019t even care. At this point I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s only for this weekend. I\u2019ll cherish this weekend for the rest of my life. It will totally be worth any heartbreak it might bring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulls me off his shoulder, and I slowly slide down the front of his naked body, his chest hair making my nipples harden as my feet touch the cold tile floor of the bathroom.</p><p>The action sends arousal coursing through my body as I stare up at him.</p><p>\u201cNone of that. I\u2019ve got to get you clean, and I\u2019m not putting my cock back inside you until you\u2019re well fed and we give your pussy some time to rest.\u201d Leaning down, he softly kisses me on the lips. \u201cYou sore?\u201d His tone turns from playful to concerned. \u201cI tried to be gentle, but with you...\u201d His hand comes up to stroke the side of my face, his thumb grazing my cheek. \u201cI find I get carried away. My control isn\u2019t so great with you, but I\u2019ll try to be gentler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was perfect.\u201d I turn my head to the side and kiss his palm, wanting him to know I mean it. \u201cJust a little sore, but it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how the man could be gentler with me. In fact, I liked it when he went a little rough with me in bed. The things he said, the things he\u2019d made me say...it made me feel freaking sexy. A feeling I\u2019m not used to. But he makes me feel that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure all of it\u2019s worth it.\u201d He places another soft kiss on my lips. His words seem to be about more than this moment, but he pulls away to turn on the shower and drags me in with him. Sean lets the water hit him first until he gets it to the temperature he likes. Then he pulls me under with him.</p><p>He takes his time washing every inch of me. I cringe a little when he drops to his knees and starts washing my stomach and hips, the places on my body I\u2019m most self-conscious of. Washing the soap away, he starts trailing open-mouthed kisses all over my belly and my hips before going lower.</p><p>He slowly pushes me back until I\u2019m against the shower wall. My breathing picks up as he stares right at my pussy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you how good I\u2019ll make you feel every day.\u201d He licks his lips, his intent clear.</p><p>\u201cEvery day?\u201d I moan, just thinking about what he\u2019s going to do. Put his mouth there. Holy shit. I close my eyes, dropping my head back, nervous and excited.</p><p>\u201cEvery fucking day,\u201d he confirms. His face goes right between my legs as one hand locks onto my hip. His other hand grabs my leg, throwing it over his shoulder as his mouth attacks me.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t tease; he goes straight for my clit, sucking it into his mouth. My hips jerk, but he keeps a firm hold on me.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh God,\u201d I chant between moans, not able to put a thought together. His beard rubs along my inner thighs, and I\u2019m sure there are going to be marks left behind.</p><p>\u201cCum on my face, little fox. Show me how good I make you feel.\u201d He sucks my clit back into his mouth again, and his words send me over the edge. My orgasm races through me, making me feel weightless. It\u2019s not until a few moments later do I realize it\u2019s because I\u2019m back in his arms once again, cuddling into him.</p><p>We stand there, letting the water run over us as we hold each other close. I have no idea how long we\u2019re there, but I have no desire to leave, until I realize the water starts to run cold.</p><p>\u201cCome on, little fox. I need to feed you. Don\u2019t want my curves going anywhere.\u201d He kisses me right under my ear, where he just whispered the words.</p><p>\u201cYou like my curves?\u201d I know he keeps implying it, but I want to hear him say it.</p><p>\u201cLike is putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>I smile against his neck as he carries me out of the shower and places me on the bathroom counter. He grabs a towel and dries both of us off before wrapping the towel around his waist, hiding his very obvious erection from me. It\u2019s then I remember he didn\u2019t get off in the shower, too. I want to make him feel as good as he did me.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d I can\u2019t look at him when I say the words, but I reach for the towel. He stops me, grabbing my wrist with one hand and putting his finger under my chin to make me look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou already did. But my cock just can\u2019t seem to go down when you\u2019re naked. Hell, when you're breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I don\u2019t understand what he means.</p><p>Releasing my wrist, he takes a step towards me, crowding me on the counter. He makes no move to touch me, but he places his hands on either side of me, caging me in. His smell invades my senses, making it hard to think.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I came eating your sweet cunt.\u201d He leans in a little more, his mouth just a breath from mine. \u201cMy woman is so fucking sexy and tastes so fucking good, I came just from eating her pussy.\u201d</p><p>His words send a rush of desire through me, making my vagina clench.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to get enough of you. Never going to let you go.\u201d His eyes are so intense, I believe him. I should be running because of how fast this is happening, but all I can do is close the sliver of distance between our mouths, my fingers latching behind his neck, never wanting to let go.</p><p>The kiss goes on and on before Sean finally pulls away.</p><p>\u201cGot to stop, baby. I want you again, and I want to get you fed and give your pussy a little rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmkay,\u201d is all I can say, still in the kiss fog.</p><p>He grabs my hips, pulling me off the counter before leading me back towards his room and over to a closet. He pulls out some clothes and hands me a dress.</p><p>I pause. He has a dress in his closet? What the heck? I want to say something, but I stay motionless as he grabs himself something. When he turns around and sees my expression, he rushes to explain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for you, little fox.

I find I\u2019m inclined to believe him.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, don\u2019t thank me for taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a habit. And it\u2019s the polite thing to do,\u201d I counter.</p><p>\u201cAlright. How about when you want to thank me, you do it by telling me you\u2019re mine or how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>I start laughing because that\u2019s ridiculous, but the look on his face says he\u2019s not joking. It makes me laugh even harder, and his brow furrows.</p> <p>He cracks a smile at me and lunges at me, scattering the clothes to the floor. I try to dodge him, but he\u2019s quicker and he throws me onto the bed. I go to scramble away, still laughing, but again he\u2019s much faster than me.</p><p>His starts tickling me, making me laugh even harder, my whole body shaking.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I can\u2019t take anymore!\u201d</p><p>He keeps tickling me as both of us roll around and I try to get away from him. A clearly impossible task. I can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed so hard. Maybe never. Definitely not since I lost my grandma.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours! Totally yours! I swear it!\u201d I finally scream, and he stops instantly. His big arms wrap around my body. It\u2019s then I notice how we\u2019re both naked again, his towel having been lost in his tickle attack.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I say breathlessly. And he does, his mouth coming down on mine. After just a second, he pulls away too quickly, jumping off the bed and placing a good amount of distance between us.</p> <p>\u201cStop trying to seduce me, little fox.\u201d He leans down, picking up the clothes he dropped. I take the chance to roll to my side, propping my head in my hand to enjoy the view. His tattoos cover not only his arms but most of his chest, too.</p><p>\u201cLike the view?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think anyone would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking anyone. Don\u2019t care what anyone thinks but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike is putting it mildly.\u201d I use the same words he used for me earlier, making him smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good, baby, because this is the only naked man you\u2019ll have for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>Once again I\u2019m struck speechless. The man can\u2019t go five minutes without reminding me I\u2019m his and I\u2019m going nowhere. He\u2019s definitely making sure I know by the end of the weekend I\u2019m his. Hell, I might already be there. There\u2019s no reason for him to put on some show. I\u2019m here and not going anywhere until he asks, and I\u2019m starting to think he won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to get dressed in the other room and start your breakfast, because I\u2019m about to pounce on your sweet ass and I\u2019ll never get you fed.\u201d</p> <p>He walks out the room, giving me his ass to watch as he exits.</p><p>I roll onto my back, looking up at the ceiling of the warehouse that has been turned into an apartment. Maybe it\u2019s a condo. I\u2019m not really sure what it is.</p><p>I almost feel like I\u2019m dreaming.</p><p>Not wanting to lie here and start second-guessing stuff, I pull myself from the bed and slip on the dress. I look around and spot my bag in the corner of the room.</p><p>Thank you, Harper. That might be the first time I actually mean it when it comes to her. I pull my stuff out and use the bathroom to get ready for the day. I put on some light make-up, brush my teeth, and pull my hair into a ponytail.</p><p>I stop and study myself in the mirror. Even after getting ready, I still look well loved. My lips are a little swollen, and I swear I\u2019m almost glowing. I can still feel the marks Sean\u2019s beard left on the insides of my thighs.</p><p>No wonder Harper was always doing the sex, because this is amazing!</p><p>Following the smell of bacon, I make my way through the warehouse slowly, taking it in as I go, wanting to learn more about Sean because I don\u2019t really know much. Except that he\u2019s crazy good with his mouth. In all ways.</p><p>There isn\u2019t much to the place. Everything is really bare and furnished with just the essentials. The walls are brick and stark. There are no decorations of any kind\u2014no paintings, no photos, no ornaments. Simple black furniture and nothing more.</p><p>\u201cHow many pancakes, baby?\u201d I pull my eyes over to the kitchen where Sean is watching me. He\u2019s got on a pair of jeans but has yet to put on a shirt. His body is really a piece of art. He\u2019s broadly built, but it looks natural. It doesn\u2019t seem like he spends hours in the gym.</p><p>\u201cA few should be good.\u201d He goes to pouring the batter into the skillet before flipping the bacon. I move towards him, taking a seat at the breakfast bar. It looks like the area that should be the dining room is also empty. No table or anything. Just the breakfast bar to eat at.</p><p>\u201cKind of bare around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a simple man.\u201d He turns to look at me from the stove. \u201cThe new place you can do up however you like. I seem to want a home now. This is just a place I sleep. I didn\u2019t need or want more from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew place? You\u2019re moving?\u201d I don\u2019t ask about him wanting me to decorate his place. I\u2019ll leave that one for now. Or why he suddenly wants a home and not just a place to lay his head. The way he says it made it pretty clear I was the reason for that. It makes my insides warm, but I don\u2019t want to read too much into it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d Sean makes his way over to the fridge, grabbing some orange juice and pouring me a glass, setting it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d I hope it\u2019s close to the train and not too far from my place. I\u2019d hate for him to move somewhere that would be hard for me to get to if we\u2019re going to keep seeing each other. And all signs point to a solid yes that we are.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to ruin the surprise. You\u2019ll see soon enough.\u201d He grabs a plate, puts some bacon on it, and places it in front of me. I grab a piece and take a bite.</p><p>\u201cIs it closer to your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. I plan on retiring soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you're only, like...\u201d Shit, I don\u2019t even know how old he is. Wow. How is that even possible? This man is imprinted into my skin, and I don\u2019t know anything about it. He must read the look on my face.</p><p>\u201cThirty-five.\u201d He places the cooked pancakes onto a plate and brings them over to where I\u2019m sitting. He takes the seat next to me. He swirls the chair so I\u2019m facing him.</p><p>\u201cWe have all the time in the world for us to get to know each other, and we will. One question at a time, but I think we know the important stuff. More than what we do for a living or in our spare time. We know we fit. All the other shit will come.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for my ponytail and pulls out the elastic, letting my hair fall all around my face. \u201cFor instance, I love when you wear your hair down.\u201d He grabs a lock of it and brings it to his nose like he\u2019s smelling it, and maybe he is. \u201cMakes me want to bury my face in it. I can\u2019t tell you how much I loved sleeping with my face buried in it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the sweetest stuff to me. I swear you\u2019re too good to be true.\u201d Something flashes across his face\u2014it looks almost like guilt\u2014but it\u2019s gone so quickly I\u2019m not even sure it was ever there.</p><p>\u201cTold you. By the end of the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might already be there,\u201d I whisper, dropping my eyes to my hands in my lap.</p><p>He growls at my words, making my eyes pop back to his.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking like that and I\u2019m going to drag you back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of like that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat. Then we\u2019re getting out of here for a few hours before I fuck you on every available surface in this place, making it impossible for you to walk for a few days.\u201d</p><p>He swirls my chair so I\u2019m facing my plate.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we could go down to Navy Pier and spend the day there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019ll always give you everything you want.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Sean</p> <p>As soon as we walk in the door, I\u2019m on her.</p><p>I grab Tessa by the waist and kick the front door closed with my boot before carrying her over to the couch. I don\u2019t have patience to take her all the way back to the bed, so this will have to do. I set her on the couch and kneel in front of her, pulling at our clothes.</p><p>\u201cI need to be inside you,\u201d I say, quickly putting my lips back on her.</p><p>Her hands go to my shirt, and it\u2019s clear both of us are beyond needing one another. As she pulls my shirt from my body, I tug her dress down, exposing her tits. Her hard nipples point at me for half a second before my mouth is on her.</p><p>Reaching between us, I unbuckle my belt and hurriedly take out my cock. I move my mouth to hers. I don\u2019t break our kiss as I push up her dress and pull her panties to the side. I thrust deep inside her, hard and fast, as I swallow her moans.</p><p>She\u2019s soaking wet as I easily slide in and out of her. Her ass is perched on the edge of the couch, a perfect height for me as I kneel in front of her. I grip her hips tightly, holding her in place, giving her every thick inch of me.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, I lean back a little to watch her tits bounce as I fuck her. \u201cPull your dress up, Tessa. I want you to watch.\u201d</p><p>Her hands move down to where we are connected, pulling the material up and out of the way. Her eyes lock on where I\u2019m penetrating her, my cock slick with her juices. It\u2019s not like this morning when I was covered in her sweet virgin blood. It\u2019s even better now because she can take me anytime I want without my having to break her barrier.</p><p>Her fingers slowly make their way to where we are joined, touching my cock as it slides in and out of her. Every time I pull out, her hand slides down to cup my balls. They\u2019re sticky from her horny juices running down between us, and they make a smacking sound with every stroke.</p><p>She groans with desire as she watches us fuck. My cock is being squeezed tightly by her clenches. I need to cum insider her, now.</p><p>\u201cPlay with your clit, little fox. I want to see you get off. Your pussy\u2019s milking my cum from me. Planting it deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>Her delicate fingers start to rub her button as I hold her hips tightly, moving in and out of her.</p><p>All day she\u2019s had me on edge. Her little playful giggles and touches drove me insane as I held her to me and secretly rubbed my palm across her ass. Sometimes I pulled her chest to mine so I could feel her big tits pressed against me, feel her soft body molding to mine as she sat in my lap as we looked out on the water. It was enough to have my cock painful with need all fucking day. And now I need relief. I never had a need for sex; I did not understand a lot of men\u2019s drive for it but now I am getting it. I gave that shit up easy years and years ago. I didn\u2019t want the hassle of it, but I could never give this up. Her up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me, Tessa. Say the words.\u201d</p><p>She moans, looking up to me, locking her eyes with mine. \u201cI need you, Sean. I want you. Only you.\u201d</p><p>I lean down and suck her nipple into my mouth, loving the sound of my name on her lips. She\u2019s wound tight with need, and when I graze my teeth across her nipple, it\u2019s enough to send her over the edge.</p><p>Her cunt pulses around me, and I feel her womb opening up for me. I hold her still as I sit up and thrust deeply, adjusting my angle. I want to be right against her cervix. I\u2019ll breed her before this weekend is over. I have to.</p><p>I won\u2019t take any chances of her trying to get away from me, and binding her to me is the only way to ensure it. I want her bred to make her mine.</p><p>Feeling my orgasm draw up from my balls and out of my shaft, I pump her full of my seed, her fertile body welcoming me.</p><p>We are both gasping for air as we come down from our high, my jeans still around my ass and her dress bunched around her waist.</p><p>I kiss her lips softly as I cup her face with gentle hands. I brush her cheeks with my thumbs as she smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful day, Sean. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about that?\u201d I warn, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>She kisses my lips and whispers against them. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>My cock throbs inside her, and I reach around her body, scooping her up and carrying her down the hall. Each step causes my cock to drive deeper inside her, and our combined cum leaks between us.</p><p>When I get to the edge of the bed, I grab a pillow and position it in the middle of the mattress. I keep us connected as I lay her back, placing the pillow behind her hips so they\u2019re tilted up. I want my cum to stay inside her, and this way it won\u2019t run out.</p><p>I can take her like this, or turn her over and take her from behind, her hips still in the perfect position to be bred.</p><p>I pull her dress up and over her head. I want her completely naked under me and looking into my eyes as I fuck her.</p><p>I don\u2019t pull out of her as I kick off my boots and jeans. My motions only make her clench around me, loving our connection.</p><p>\u201cI need you again,\u201d I growl, thrusting fully into her now. I cage her small body under mine, her hips raised exactly right for breeding. I feel animalistic as I fight into her tight channel, her cunt squeezing me deliciously.</p><p>She\u2019s slippery from some of my cum leaking out, and my cock glides smoothly into her. I grab her ankles and put them on my shoulders, holding her calves while I thrust in and out of her.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s arms go up behind her, grabbing the headboard as I drive into her. \u201cSean,\u201d she moans, raising her hips off the pillow, trying to take me deeper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, little fox. Say my name loud. I want to hear the only name you\u2019ll ever moan. You belong to me, Tessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sean. Please.\u201d Her words beg me as she tries to squeeze her legs together to find some relief. But I keep her ankles on my shoulders and pound into her, keeping her on edge.</p><p>\u201cMore, Tessa. Tell me just how much you love me inside you. Tell me you\u2019ll never leave me. Say that you\u2019ll always want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d She\u2019s panting. She\u2019s only a breath away from cumming.</p> <p>\u201cPromise me, Tessa. Promise me you\u2019ll always want me.\u201d</p><p>Looking into my eyes, she nods her head and gives me what I want. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>I reach down and rub her hard clit, giving her the pressure she wants and sending her over the edge. I thrust in hard one last time, wanting to cum at the same time, emptying into her once again. I don\u2019t pull out as I cum, knowing full well that this could be the time I get her pregnant.</p><p>Thinking about it, and knowing what she promised me, makes more cum leak from my cock. I may use it against her in the very near future, but I\u2019ll do what I have to in order to keep her. I\u2019ll play dirty if it means never losing her.</p><p>Letting her limp legs down off my shoulders, I lean over her body and kiss her lips tenderly. \u201cI had the best day with you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her lips smile against mine as she sleepily wraps her arms around me. \u201cI did, too. It was absolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>Tessa yawns, and her eyes start to blink slowly with sleep. I kiss her forehead as I pull out of her, but I don\u2019t move her hips off the pillow.</p><p>\u201cStay here, baby. I\u2019ll clean you up.\u201d I rise from the bed and get a warm washcloth and return to where she\u2019s lying. She\u2019s already half asleep, her hips still raised, not having moved an inch.</p><p>Her legs are still slightly open, and I can see that not much of my cum has slipped out. Perfect. I wipe away some stickiness on her thighs and lips but mostly leave my cum alone.</p><p>I go back to the bathroom and toss the cloth in the hamper. By the time I get back to the bed, she\u2019s completely out. I retrieve the sheet and place it over her, still not moving her off the pillow.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, I watch her for a while, just looking at her and stroking her lightly as she sleeps.</p><p>I feel a little guilt at what I\u2019m going to do, but I know it\u2019s for the best. There\u2019s no other way to get what I want from her, and I know that I can make it work. It has to.</p><p>After a while, I find that I\u2019m tired, too, so I slip under the covers with her and pull her to me. I hold her naked body against mine as I kiss her forehead, and I fall asleep dreaming of Tessa and our future.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Tessa</p><p>I sit between Sean\u2019s legs, his back against the headboard and my back to his bare chest. We\u2019ve lain in bed all day, and the sun is finally starting to set. I know I need to go home and get stuff ready for work tomorrow, but I dread leaving. I want to wake up in his arms every morning like I\u2019ve done for the past two days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arms are wrapped around me. His tattoos seem brighter than normal against my pale skin. I run my fingers up and down his thick legs, loving the feel of his hair against my fingertips.</p><p>One hand slowly strokes my stomach while he places lazy kisses on my neck. We\u2019ve been sitting like this since our last bout of lovemaking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to work tomorrow. I have some sick days. Maybe I can call out and we can do this day all over again.\u201d I hardly take any time off, and it would so be worth it. I don\u2019t want to move from this spot. I\u2019m nestled into his body, and I\u2019ve never felt more cherished.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, but I gotta work tomorrow.\u201d He nibbles a little at my shoulder before kissing the spot. Disappointment hits me. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s actually refused me something. \u201cBut maybe the next day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you even do? You mentioned retiring.\u201d He hasn\u2019t brought up what he does, but the few times he was messing with his phone, he just said it had to do with \u2018work\u2019 and changed the subject. It made me feel a little bit like he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and I didn\u2019t want to push.</p><p>\u201cI have my hands in all kinds of things. I guess you could say I\u2019m an entrepreneur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you came into the bank the other day?\u201d He stills against me for a second before he answers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re retiring? You\u2019re so young.\u201d It\u2019s clear he does okay for himself, between his car and this warehouse. This place can\u2019t be cheap.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Just a few loose ends to tie up and I\u2019m out.\u201d He stops stroking my stomach and wraps both arms around me again, locking his hands together and pulling me a little closer. \u201cI\u2019ve been saving and investing. I want to focus on other things now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther things?\u201d I hedge. I know he keeps telling me over and over again how he\u2019s never letting me go, but I want to know where this is going. How I\u2019m a part of his plans.</p><p>\u201cA family,\u201d he whispers in my ear, and his hand goes back to rubbing my stomach again.</p><p>My whole body freezes and air leaves my lungs in a gasp. Not once have we talked about protection, or even used it. Jesus. It never even crossed my mind, which is crazy and ridiculous. Or maybe subconsciously I let myself forget about it.</p><p>A little voice in the back of my head seems to agree with that. Did I think if he knocked me up I\u2019d always have him? Wow. That sounds pathetic. Am I that girl? Am l trying to trap a man? Oh, my God. What is wrong with me? I can\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cI did it on purpose,\u201d he whispers, cutting off my train of thought \u201cI couldn\u2019t control myself, little fox. When I had my cock in you, and I thought about you swollen with my kid, I couldn\u2019t have stopped myself from cumming even if I tried.\u201d He takes my earlobe between his teeth, pulling a little and making a chill run down my spine. \u201cNot that I tried.\u201d</p> <p>He did this, too?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re crazy,\u201d I blurt out. Because we are. This relationship seems to be moving at warp speed and shows no signs of slowing.</p><p>\u201cWent way past crazy the moment I saw you. No turning back now.\u201d I can hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>No, it seems we\u2019ve made sure we can\u2019t. We\u2019re both trying to bind ourselves to each other.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted a family? I\u2019ve been dreaming about one for as long as I can remember,\u201d I admit. It was just my grandma and me growing up. I loved her, and I know she did the best for us, but I want more. I want a home filled with family. It\u2019s something I hope to have some day. To be married and have children filling the house.</p><p>\u201cNever really had one myself. I always thought \u2018one day,\u2019 but I never put much thought into it. I think I was waiting for you, because when I saw you the idea started to come to life, and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve been able to see since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both kind of missed out on that growing up. We can have it together.\u201d I turn a little to look at him. He\u2019d told me all about growing up on the streets. That he\u2019s always been kind of a loner, never getting too attached to anything.</p><p>At first I was worried that he could move on from me like he seems to do to most things. Even his apartment shows that in him. He doesn\u2019t look planted. He could leave at the drop of a hat.</p> <p>\u201cNot can, will,\u201d he confirms, before molding his lips to mine.</p><p>\u201cI gotta take you home. Some stuff I need to take care of tonight and first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I take deep breath, letting my shoulders drop.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I know I\u2019m pouting, but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. He lets his arms drop from around me, and I pull myself from the bed, hating to have to leave it.</p><p>I wonder if the stuff he has to take care of is the same stuff he had to take care of in the middle of the night last night. I woke up around two in the morning in need of the bathroom and found the bed empty. After a search of the place, I knew he was gone. When I woke again this morning with his mouth between my legs, I\u2019d forgotten about it. And by the time I did remember, I didn\u2019t want to ask.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if it was out of place to ask him where he\u2019d been or what he\u2019d been up to, so I just let it go. But it\u2019s been sitting in the back of my mind ever since.</p><p>I slowly get my stuff together, trying to put off leaving, but all too soon I\u2019m all packed and we\u2019re at the front door of my apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come in for a little bit?\u201d I bite my lip and look up at him. The look on his face is one I can\u2019t make out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, baby.\u201d He cups my face and stares down at me. \u201cTake the train to work tomorrow, and keep your phone on you at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d My voice breaks a little bit. I\u2019m being a baby, not wanting him to leave. How could I have become so attached to someone so quickly?</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d The words hold an edge of desperation to them.</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p> <p>He leans down, placing his forehead against mine. \u201cDream about me, because all I\u2019ll be thinking about is you until I see you again.\u201d</p><p>His words make some of my unease slip away. \u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up from work tomorrow. Take you home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we can have that sick day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can have anything you want.\u201d His lips meet mine, and the kiss seems desperate, just like his words moments ago. I wrap my arms around his neck and deepen the kiss. We seem to get lost in the kiss, almost making love with our lips.</p> <p>When he finally pulls away, we\u2019re both breathless. He presses his forehead to mine again, squeezing his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cKnow that I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I let my hands drop from his neck and run my fingers through his beard. He leans back a little to look into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love that about you. How trusting you are. God, I don\u2019t want you to lose that. You just let me right in, and I want to protect that innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d It\u2019s the only word he said that I heard, and it makes him smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, little fox. Love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My words are cut off by the sound of the door to my apartment opening. I don\u2019t have to turn around to know it\u2019s Harper. I can smell her overpowering perfume already.</p><p>\u201cJust remember I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d He kisses me again, this time hard and fast. His lips are gone before they were even there. Then he\u2019s gone, too, leaving me to think about what he said.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Sean</p><p>\u201cYou got the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Nick looks over at me and gives me a creepy smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure after Friday night. The way you walked in and took her out of Coco\u2019s, I thought for sure you\u2019d pussy out.\u201d</p><p>I look over at him, not answering, and turn my attention back to the road. We\u2019re in my car, driving across town to Tessa\u2019s bank. It\u2019s Sunday night, and I\u2019ve just dropped her off at her place, leaving to pick Nick up.</p> <p>Heavy texted me last night wanting a meeting. I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was going on, but he\u2019d been sending me messages all day about needing to check in on some details. I think more than likely he was just wanting to check on me. The motherfucker loves to micromanage.</p><p>I was in bed with Tessa sleeping soundly in my arms when I got the last text. I needed to be there for another fucking meeting. One of his guys had gotten himself shot in some kind of bar fight and wouldn't be able to pull the job on Monday.</p><p>Slipping of bed quietly, I left for a few hours to meet up with Heavy and rework the positions. It was a fucking pain in the ass to lose a man this close to the date. But we think we have it worked out.</p><p>As much as it killed me to have to drop Tessa off at her apartment, I didn\u2019t have a choice. While I was out last night, I got a copy made of the bank keys I stole from her purse. I felt like an asshole doing it, but I keep telling myself it\u2019s for the best. When this is over, everything I\u2019ve done will have been to give us a better life. I\u2019ll make her see that. Then I will never be pulled from her side again. Every night I\u2019ll go to bed with her in my arms.</p><p>Once I had her keys printed and Nick lifted the combinations from Harper, we had our way in.</p><p>It\u2019s Sunday night, so we aren\u2019t getting in the vault yet. There are too many vaults to crack, and we won\u2019t have the time. I can shut off the notification of the alarms to the police but only for so long. There\u2019s a back-up system in place for something like this, but even that has a time limit for a shut off. Tonight, we are setting everything up for tomorrow. Our window is small, but we know what we\u2019ve got to do.</p><p>Nick is only coming with because Heavy insisted I needed backup tonight. And since Nick came through with the combinations, he\u2019s the one who gets the job.</p><p>I\u2019m making as little conversation as possible and just getting this shit done. I\u2019m already on edge being in the same car as this dumbass, and I\u2019m trying my best not to put a bullet in his fucking head.</p><p>\u201cWe all took bets on if you\u2019d be able to fuck that fat chick and still be able to do the job. Me? I thought you\u2019d fall in love the way you were looking at her. Guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I pull up a block away, gripping the wheel, my knuckles turning white. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Getting out of my car, I go around and make my way towards the bank. I feel Nick close behind me, and I take long strides, wanting to get this done as fast as possible.</p><p>The bank is situated between two buildings downtown and has a back service entrance for bank vendors and armored vehicles. This is where most of everything will go down tomorrow. There\u2019s a door with a keypad and a lock for access. There\u2019s also an alarm on the other side of the door that requires a ten-digit combination.</p><p>Beside the door is a big bay that opens up for deliveries. That door requires two scanned passes, two keypad codes, and disarming two separate alarms. Every code to get into the bay door has to be input simultaneously. One of the reasons we\u2019re waiting until Monday is because by the time we arrive, the armored car will already be here and waiting on the early employees to let them in before the bank opens. We want the back door and the bay open when we go inside. We need the easiest access in and out, and this is it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Nick and I reach the back of the building, I count and wait for the camera to move. I\u2019ve been watching the security footage, and I know exactly when the camera will point in this direction before moving to the next position, giving us a thirty second window to move.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d I look to Nick, and he nods his head.</p><p>When the time is up and I hear the camera move, we slip to the back door and I scan my pass. I was able to steal a pass from someone on the cleaning crew, duplicate it, and place it in the bathroom for an employee to locate, making it seem as if the cleaning crew member misplaced it for only a short time. The hassle to replace the keypad coding for all employees on their passes is a huge pain in the ass and not something they would have done for just a minor slip up.</p><p>As I scan the pass, the light turns green, and I use the key I copied from Tessa to unlock the back door.</p> <p>Nick and I slip inside silently, closing the door behind us before the camera can turn back to us. Once we\u2019re inside, the motion sensor goes off, and slow beeps build up to louder, faster beeps. We have fifteen seconds to enter in the ten-digit code. Otherwise, the alarms will go off and the authorities will be notified.</p><p>I watch Nick as he goes over to the keypad and punches in the code. Afterwards, we wait with our breaths held until two small beeps and a flash of green light indicate the motion sensor alarm is off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be five minutes, tops. Wait here.\u201d</p><p>Nick nods and stands by the back door. He\u2019s a piece of shit, but he doesn\u2019t want to go to jail either, so I\u2019m not worried about him making a scene and possibly fucking up his pay day.</p><p>I walk through the back hall and make my way to the lobby of the bank. Once there, I start with the surrounding offices and any desks that customer service employees sit at.</p> <p>At each location, there\u2019s a camera and a button they can push to alert the authorities of a situation. There\u2019s also one inside the vault, but we aren\u2019t getting in there tonight.</p><p>Each button is individually monitored, so I\u2019d have no way of controlling all of them on the day of the job. Manually coming in and cutting them is the best option right now.</p><p>I take out my wire snips and count off as I make my way around the room, locating every alarm button and clipping the connecting wire. At least if shit goes south tomorrow, someone can\u2019t run to their station or their desk and hit the button in panic.</p><p>Once I\u2019m finished doing the offices, I make my way down the teller line, clipping each one. When I get to Tessa\u2019s area, I hold the snips there, hesitating, but I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t be safe if I do it, but I don\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>I clip the wire. I move out from behind the desks and make my way back down the hall. This is as much as we can do tonight without pushing our luck.</p><p>When I reach Nick, he\u2019s in the same spot as before and ready to go.</p> <p>\u201cWe all good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Everything\u2019s in place for tomorrow.\u201d Nick goes to turn, but I grab his arm, pulling him back. \u201cThe code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He gives me a wicked smile, like he was just going to bust out of here, set off the alarm and leave me to clean up. This fucker is looking to get shot, and I\u2019ll be all too glad to handle it when the job is done.</p><p>He goes over to the keypad and enters the code, and we wait for the beep. Once the red light flashes, we\u2019ve got ten seconds to exit before the motion alarm is back in place.</p><p>I scan my pass on the inside panel and use the key to unlock the door. I count before opening it, making sure the camera is facing away.</p><p>Once we\u2019re in the clear, we exit, and I seal the door behind me before making a run to get around the corner in time.</p><p>When we reach the other side of the wall, we walk away like nothing happened. We\u2019re both cool and collected as we make it to my car and get in.</p><p>Pulling away from the curb, I look over to see Nick looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cEasy peasy, Sparrow. Now let\u2019s see how well you do tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the darkness I see in his eyes. Not one bit.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Tessa</p><p>\u201cYou look...\u201d Harper pauses as she runs her eyes over me, and I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t want to know how she thinks I look. She never fails to take a jab at me. Besides, she looks like hell herself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her this out of sorts. It looks like she went on an all-night bender and has yet to wash off her make-up from the day before.</p><p>Her shirt is covered in what I can only guess is food. She can get a little sloppy sometimes, but this is past that for her.</p><p>\u201cThis place is a mess.\u201d I cut her off. One weekend away and the whole apartment looks to have fallen apart. The coffee table is littered with soda cans and a variety of junk food. There are even chips smashed into the rug. I have to clench my jaw to stop me from saying something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to it later.\u201d Harper waves her hand at the mess like it\u2019s no big deal, but for some reason that just pisses me off more. Maybe because I don\u2019t want to be here. I want to be back in Sean\u2019s apartment, lying in his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I can tell she\u2019s prying for information about Sean. She had her eyes all over him when she opened the door, but he paid her no mind, his eyes never leaving me. I\u2019d noticed that a lot about him.</p><p>Even when we\u2019d gone out on Saturday, women always seemed to be looking at him. Not that I can blame them. He stands out in a room. Hell, I think a waitress even tried to hit on him when we were having lunch, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice. His full attention was always on me, like no one else was around, and I found myself not caring that they looked at him, because it didn\u2019t matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWith Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll weekend?\u201d Her tone carries a sneer of disbelief. She did just see him in our doorway dropping me off, it can\u2019t be that hard to believe. I mean, really.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he kinda didn\u2019t want me to leave.\u201d I can\u2019t help but take a little jab myself. I want her to know to keep her eyes off him because Sean is mine, and he\u2019s made it clear I\u2019m his. I won\u2019t have him coming over and her pulling some shit or trying to put me down in front of him. I\u2019ve put up with a lot from Harper but now I seem to give a shit.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re here now,\u201d she smirks, and her words burn. Point Harper.</p> <p>\u201cSome people do have to work, Harper.\u201d I push past her, not wanting to have this verbal jab fest. I may be over her shit right now, but I also don\u2019t want to hurt her with the things that are suddenly on the tip of my tongue. I want to let all the hateful comments fly and give her a nice dose of her own medicine.</p><p>Not right now, though. Right now, all I want is a hot shower and to go to bed. Tomorrow can\u2019t come fast enough. I\u2019ll be back with Sean and out of this apartment that I suddenly hate.</p><p>\u201cAre you cooking dinner?\u201d I hear her call out behind me, making me roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, before shutting my bedroom door and dropping my bag on the floor. I pull my phone out and scan for any messages. It\u2019s been maybe three minutes since he left and I\u2019m already checking them. This is going to be a long night.</p><p>It is. I toss and turn all night until my alarm finally goes off. I drag myself from the bed and slowly get ready, taking a little extra time to do my hair and apply some light make-up.</p> <p>I pull out my favorite work dress, hoping it\u2019ll give me some confidence. It\u2019s violet and hugs my body, but it looks professional and comes down to my knees. I pair it with some caramel kitten heels. I smile as I look at myself in the mirror. I wonder if Sean will like it.</p><p>I check my phone again and see no messages. Maybe he\u2019s just crazy busy.</p><p>Me: Miss you &lt;3</p><p>I put the phone back in my purse, making sure the sound is on so I can hear it when he does respond.</p><p>When I finally leave my room, I see Harper sitting at the breakfast bar eating a bowl of cereal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late,\u201d she warns, shoving a spoonful into her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine. I\u2019m just going to grab a muffin.\u201d I go to the pantry, grab two, and toss them into my purse. I\u2019ll eat them when I get to my desk. I reach for the coffee pot but see none has been made. I bite my tongue.</p><p>I make it every morning. She couldn\u2019t do it this once.</p><p>When I hear my phone beep, I hurriedly grab it, but the message is just from the bank manager.</p><p>Steve: I need you to close today.</p><p>\u201cGuessing lover boy isn\u2019t texting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look over at her as she gets up to put her bowl in the sink.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face when you got that text. Guessing it wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, but I play it off. \u201cNo, just Steve telling me I need to close today.\u201d I hate opening and closing, plus it\u2019s going to cut into when Sean is picking me up. I should probably let him know.</p> <p>Me: I have to work late. Pick me up at 7?</p><p>I stare down at the phone, willing him to text me back. Just a simple \u2018okay\u2019 would work.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta go.\u201d</p><p>Giving up, I drop the phone back into my purse again.</p><p>\u201cLet me grab something and I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d I dart to my room, snatch a bag and put a few items in it. I might need to stay at Sean\u2019s tonight and tomorrow. I dig through my drawer but can\u2019t find any sexy underwear.</p><p>Maybe I could run out at lunch and get something. I wonder what Sean\u2019s face would look like if I walked out of his bathroom in nothing but lingerie. Yeah, definitely going at lunch to find something.</p><p>It still blows my mind how last week I couldn\u2019t even think about walking around naked in front of anyone, and now here I am, openly baiting Sean with my body.</p><p>It\u2019s him. How he treated me all weekend. I feel sexy and needed. He kissed every inch of my body like he couldn\u2019t get enough of every part of me.</p><p>I close the drawer, grab my bag, and meet an inpatient Harper at the door.</p><p>We walk to the train in silence, and it isn\u2019t until we board does she start in.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be checking your phone all day? It looks a little sad.\u201d Her tone is mocking. Like I\u2019m a poor little puppy that she wants to pat on the head.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Looking over at her, I raise my eyebrow. I don\u2019t get what her problem is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. You had a weekend fling. Don\u2019t count on it being more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about what Sean and I did this weekend. Or what it means.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me like she feels sad for me, and it pisses me off. \u201cTessa, this is how men work. They fuck you all weekend, tell you how wonderful you are, how much they want you. Then bam, they\u2019re gone. Weekend of fun over, and they\u2019re on to the next.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s what Nick did to her, because she seems bitter. I don\u2019t get why. If I were her, I\u2019d be happy if Nick never called me again. Especially after how he treated her at the bar. No way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d I say defensively, hating that anyone would think Sean would be like that. He may look tough and a little scary, but he\u2019s sweet. He\u2019d never do anything to hurt me. He did what he told me he would do. Made me fall for him before the weekend was over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s blowing up your phone, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes two seconds to send a text.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. It only takes a second to respond. Maybe he\u2019s in a meeting. That doesn\u2019t count for last night, though. I kept thinking I\u2019d get a good night text or something, but all I got was radio silence. Until this morning when I had to send him one.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a bitch,\u201d she adds, and I almost want to laugh. No, she doesn\u2019t have to try to be a bitch, it\u2019s always there. \u201cJust enjoy it for what it was, a weekend of fun, and let it go. I bet he gave you some great orgasms. You could have one just looking at him.\u201d</p><p>I glare at her, thankful that the train has stopped and it\u2019s our turn to get off. I don\u2019t wait for her as I make my way off the train and towards the bank.</p><p>When I get there, I quickly open the doors to the bank and turn off the alarms. \u201cGet the front ready. I\u2019m dropping stuff in my office, and then we need to get the quarterly shipment ready. The armored truck will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for her to respond.</p><p>When I get to my desk, I pull my phone out. There\u2019s still nothing from Sean, and I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose, so fuck it.</p> <p>Me: I love you.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Sean</p><p>Our van pulls up to the back of the bank, and we park. We\u2019ve got about ten minutes before the truck pulls up to go into the bank and take the shipment.</p><p>\u201cI want everybody calm. We\u2019ve got this all planned out. We stick exactly to the plan, no matter what happens. If the cops show up, you guys know the exit strategy. We all clear?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the back of the van with seven guys. One of them is the driver, and another is staying with him to guard the van. Five of us are going into the bank, and it\u2019s going to be tight as we\u2019re down one person. The guy who got himself shot in the club was supposed to be another lookout, we\u2019ll just have to be extra careful.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody check your weapons and make sure they\u2019re good to go. Remember, nobody shoots. I don\u2019t want any gunfire inside. Clear?\u201d</p><p>I pass out the guns, making sure everyone is armed. I don\u2019t like going in guns blazing, and the quieter we keep this, the easier our getaway. But we\u2019ll need them inside to get everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cMasks,\u201d I say, checking my watch. It\u2019s almost showtime.</p><p>The crew pull down their ski masks and do as they\u2019re told. I reach up to pull mine down, but as I do, I catch Nick\u2019s eyes. He\u2019s giving me a cold stare as he pulls his down, and seeing him with only his eyes showing is menacing. Something is coming, I can feel it. Instinct has kept me alive all these years, and I need to watch my back today.</p><p>As I finish pulling my mask down, I see the armored car pull up. Just a few more moments and we\u2019re in.</p><p>The guards are the same ones that come each quarter, and I know their routine. The staff inside is at a minimum, and this is the best time to do this to limit casualties.</p><p>Tessa.</p><p>I stop that thought before it starts. I can\u2019t go there yet. Not yet. I have to get through this and then make her forgive me. I can do it. I can be strong enough to get us through this.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody on my mark. Silent, and follow the plan.\u201d</p><p>I wait just a beat, watching from a few yards away as the guards exit the truck and put in the dual codes. Once the bay is all the way open, it begins.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The five of us exit the back of the van, guns held up and trained on the guards.</p><p>\u201cDrop your weapons. Step away from the door.\u201d The codes have been entered, and the alarms have been turned off. So far, so good.</p><p>The two guards do as we say. Two of my men approach them, take their weapons, and secure them.</p><p>One of my men goes to the armored truck and takes the driver out from behind the wheel. He secures him, taking his weapon and zip-tying him up.</p><p>When we have the three guards bound and gagged, we pull them into the bay door and off to the side. One of my men stays with them to keep guard while four of us proceed inside.</p><p>We make our way silently down the hallway to the front of the bank. It\u2019s still just under an hour before the first customer arrives, but the vault has been opened, and the money inside is ready for shipment.</p><p>As we continue to the end of the hall, Paul, one of Heavy\u2019s men, moves up to lead the group.</p><p>We reach the end of the hall, and he looks back to give us the signal. He holds up three fingers counting down to one, and we all rush forward.</p><p>\u201cHands up where we can see them. Everybody out here on the ground.\u201d</p><p>My eyes immediately look for Tessa, and I see her in the doorway of her office. Harper lets out a scream, but other than that, it\u2019s silent.</p><p>Tessa stands there, frozen, but after blinking a few times, she holds up her hands and lies on the ground. Harper sees her and starts crying, then follows suit. Another teller stands in shock, and one of my men goes over, pulling her out from behind the teller line and making her lie face down with the others.</p><p>Paul turns and points to me, Nick, and the other guy, Brian. He nods towards the vault, keeping his weapon trained on the three women as we carry out the rest of the plan.</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>I take the keys to the vault door out of my pocket and let the three of us in. Brian and Nick go to the inner vault to take the cash while I stand guard and cut the lines for the alarms inside the main vault.</p><p>Or so they think.</p><p>I wait until I hear them in the back, bagging up the cash and loading it onto the dolly in the vault. We\u2019re planning on taking this out the same way the guards were, keeping it as easy as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once I know they\u2019re in the back, I reach over to the desk where Tessa pulled out the safety deposit box keys. I pull key number 425 out of my pocket and use it and the deposit keys to open the dual lock.</p><p>Opening the box, I don\u2019t take a second to look at the contents. I take out the single small yellow envelope and silently close the box again.</p><p>It takes me thirty seconds, tops, and I\u2019ve got the keys back inside the drawer, with no one the wiser. Just as the drawer rolls shut, I turn to see Nick standing there with Brian.</p><p>For a second, I see something flash in Nick\u2019s eyes, and I think I\u2019m busted.</p> <p>\u201cWe good?\u201d I ask, nodding at the bags of money on the dolly behind them.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Piece of cake,\u201d Brian says, pushing the dolly out of the vault.</p><p>Nick grips his gun tighter, and my fingers start to tingle.</p><p>\u201cLess than two minutes,\u201d I say, reminding him we\u2019re running out of time. Nick nods in acknowledgement and makes his way out of the vault behind Brian.</p><p>Just as I exit the vault, I lean over and hit the button for the police. Remember when I said criminals always play up to the job, never after? This is where my plan begins.</p> <p>Brian wheels the cash out of the lobby and down the small hallway. Nick and I walk over to Paul, letting him know it\u2019s done, so we can get the fuck out of here.</p><p>Just as I walk over, I can feel the shift in Nick. He\u2019s just fucked up both of our plans.</p><p>Before I can blink, he\u2019s over by Tessa and pulling her up by her hair off the floor.</p><p>\u201cPut her down!\u201d I shout through the room, my voice echoing off the marble. I raise my gun pointing it as his head, but he pulls Tessa closer, putting his own gun to her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say you tell me what was in that box, Sparrow.\u201d</p><p>I finally make myself look at Tessa, her gold eyes terrified. I see the look on her face as she realizes who we are.</p> <p>\u201cNick, what the fuck are you doing! Let\u2019s go, man!\u201d Paul shouts, clearly wanting to get the fuck out of here like Nick should, too.</p><p>\u201cNot until pretty boy gives up what he\u2019s really after. Because it wasn\u2019t this piece of ass. Was it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s got his gun pressed against her head, and tears are streaming down her face. She\u2019s terrified, and she hasn\u2019t spoken a word. My heart is nearly beating out of my chest, but my gun is straight and my aim unwavering.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me do it, Nick. Let her go. Now.\u201d I don\u2019t want to have to kill him like this, but I will.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d Harper says from the floor, but he doesn\u2019t turn to acknowledge her. He shoves his gun harder against Tessa\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me what was in that box, or she\u2019s dead. I don\u2019t give two shits about killing this bitch.\u201d</p><p>Rage boils inside me, but I take a breath and calm myself.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes, little fox.\u201d She looks at me for a half second before doing as I ask. In that quick look, I see that the trust is still there. She may not know what\u2019s going on, but she trusts me.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should close yours,\u201d Nick says, pulling his trigger.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of complete silence after the sound rings out, before all the women start screaming.</p><p>The sound of a second bullet reverberates around us as I pull my trigger and land a shot right between Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Before a heartbeat has passed, I\u2019m there in front of him, catching Tessa and holding her face to get her to look at me.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, baby. Tessa! Open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She opens them, looking at me and blinking rapidly. Her ears are probably ringing from the blank going off, and I\u2019m sure she can\u2019t hear what I\u2019m saying. I replaced everyone\u2019s gun but mine with blanks, knowing some stupid shit might happen.</p><p>I pick her up and throw her over my shoulder. I turn back to look at Paul.</p><p>\u201cStick to the plan!\u201d I shout at him, and he bolts out the door.</p><p>Running behind him with Tessa over my shoulder, I make my way out of the bay door in time to see three of my guys loading up the cash as the other two wait with the van.</p><p>I slip off to the right and out the side door of the bay before they spot me. Once I\u2019m outside, I see an unmarked car waiting for me. The guys have their money, so they won\u2019t wait around, and I hear the sirens already on their way.</p><p>I open the driver side door and help Tessa in and over to the passenger seat. When she\u2019s there and finally looks at me, I take off my mask and reach for her.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>I feel the sting of her hand across my face, and though I know I deserve it, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier.</p><p>Reaching into the console, I pull out the insurance I had Sal drop in here for me.</p><p>\u201cJust relax, little fox. I\u2019ll explain everything soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I see the shock hit her eyes when she realizes what I\u2019ve just done, and she looks down to see the needle in her arm.</p><p>\u201cIt will be easier this way, Tessa. I promise. I love you, baby. Just sleep.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Sean</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy I am to see you,\u201d I say, looking up at Dimitri, who\u2019s standing in the doorway to his private plane. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make the trip. I was sure I\u2019d be having a layover somewhere to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri just shoots me a cocky grin. \u201cIt\u2019s my little \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the FBI, even if they never even know it. Also, I\u2019m a little anxious to get my hands on the package.\u201d</p><p>He steps back from the doorway, revealing a tall thin man behind him. \u201cGet their bags. We need to get out of here.\u201d The thin man, who looks to be in his late forties and is dressed in a relaxed suit, darts down the stairs, going straight for my vehicle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBring her up already.\u201d Dimitri waves at me and disappears into the plane.</p><p>I look down at Tessa in my arms, her head against my shoulder, her auburn hair partially covering her face, and I feel my heart clench. What if she never forgives me? I was taken aback by the smack. Not that I didn\u2019t have it coming, but it just didn\u2019t feel like her. Tessa doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body, and I drove her to that kind of anger.</p><p>Not only that. God knows the fucking nightmares she might have because of that piece of shit Nick. Maybe his death will help ease that for her. Or maybe it will just make me more of a monster in her eyes.</p><p>There was no choice in ending his life. Nick was like a dog with a fucking bone, and once he knew I\u2019d taken something from the safety deposit box, he would have stopped at nothing until he got his hands on whatever it was.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want him coming after us, not that he would\u2019ve been able to find us, but it\u2019s better this way. I hope that Heavy thinks I got scared after popping Nick and that\u2019s why I took off. Not coming in for my share of the take. I don\u2019t see him searching me out to give me my cut, so I\u2019m certain our business is finished.</p><p>I take the stairs two at a time, entering the extravagant plane. I\u2019ve been on nice planes before, even a few private ones, but none as big as this. I knew Dimitri had money, but for fuck\u2019s sake, this is beyond that.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bedroom.\u201d He points to the back of the plane. \u201cFirst door on your left.\u201d</p><p>I nod, thanking him. \u201cI\u2019m going to lie with her until we take off so I don\u2019t have to buckle her in.\u201d</p><p>Dimitri just nods in response and takes a seat in one of the comfortable-looking chairs. I make my way to the back of the plane and open the bedroom door. It\u2019s a pretty good size, and there\u2019s a bed right in the middle of the room</p> <p>I lay her down in the center of the bed, taking off her shoes, then joining her as I start to feel the plane move.</p><p>I pull her to me, burying my face in her hair, something that I find myself always doing with her now. Just the smell of her seems to calm me. I breathe her in, telling myself she\u2019s okay. Seeing that gun to her head, even knowing it wasn\u2019t loaded, ripped me apart inside. I\u2019d never felt such blind rage before in my life.</p><p>Kissing the spot under her ear, I try to enjoy this moment for a little while. I know when she finally comes to, things won\u2019t be like this anymore. I\u2019m going to have to fight to make her want to stay with me. I can only pray that one day she will want to stay.</p><p>\u201cChoose me,\u201d I whisper, knowing she can\u2019t hear me.</p><p>And I will fight to keep her until I take my last breath. I wish I could say I was unselfish enough to let her go, but I just can\u2019t. I don\u2019t think I could breathe without her.</p><p>I spent so many years just drifting through life, one job after another, thinking I had things figured out. Then there she was, sitting right in the middle of my exit strategy. Plans had already been made. I\u2019d already gotten Heavy\u2019s attention on the bank, and before I could even try to pull out, he already had his sights set on her. My little fox.</p> <p>If I\u2019d known she was out there, maybe I could\u2019ve built a better life. Done things a little differently. Not gotten mixed up in the things I did when I was living on the streets as a kid. But back then it was mostly just about eating. I might not have been as dirty as some of the other criminals, but I still broke the law. Played by my own rules.</p><p>I hold her for a little longer before I pull myself from the bed, knowing Dimitri is probably waiting for me. I lean down and press a kiss to her lips.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby,\u201d I tell her, as she rolls to her side and reaches out for something. A little furrow appears between her brows when she comes up with nothing. It makes my breath catch. That\u2019s gotta be something. In her sleep she\u2019s still looking for me, reaching out to grab a hold of me.</p><p>I take one last look at her before heading out of the room to find Dimitri, who\u2019s still sitting in the same chair I left him in. I take the one across from him as he takes a sip of some brown liquor from his glass.</p><p>A tall blonde flight attendant appears. \u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d She bends over a little, trying to give me a shot of her cleavage, but I just turn my head and shaking it, dismissing her.</p><p>She tries again, making her voice drop a little, like I didn't understand what she was offering me. I want her to step back. I can smell her perfume, and it's eating away at the sweet smell of my little fox that I still have in my nose. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t get you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not interested,\u201d Dimitri pauses for a second, \u201cCindy.\u201d He\u2019d clearly forgotten her name.</p><p>She huffs a little as she walks away.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the agency gets some of these women, but next time I\u2019m requesting a man. My Laura would be raising hell right now if she was here.\u201d He says it with a smile on his face. Yeah, I think I\u2019d get off on the idea of my woman being jealous over me, too, because right now I think she probably just wants to smack me again.</p><p>\u201cYou got it?\u201d he finally asks.</p><p>I reach into my back pocket, retrieving the small package and my phone, and toss them on the table.</p><p>Curiosity gets the best of me. \u201cWhat comes in such a small package that a man will willing to pay over a hundred million for?\u201d</p><p>Dimitri opens the envelope and pulls out a small box. He opens it gingerly.</p><p>A simple ring sits inside. I raise my eyebrows. The ring is nothing to write home about, just a gold band with an emerald. Only a carat by the looks of it, if that\u2014nowhere near the price he paid for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at Dimitri with a question in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s. I want to ask Laura to marry me.\u201d He pulls the ring out of the box, admiring it, the smile stretching across his face as he looks at it with such love.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I asked Laura to marry me, I gave her a giant ring. The thing almost cost more than this plane. She told me to drop dead.\u201d</p><p>A burst of laughter escapes my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cShe said I was trying to buy her. Maybe I was in a way. I wanted to impress her.\u201d His eyes lock on mine. \u201cI just wanted her to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that will do it?\u201d I ask, leaning back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so, or I\u2019ll have to take a page from your book and do a little kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at the reminder. \u201cWasn\u2019t there an easier way to get into that safety deposit box? Or a cheaper one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I didn\u2019t want to risk falling into one of the FBI\u2019s traps, and I wanted to make sure I got it safely to me. If someone knew how much it meant to me, they could use it against me. I\u2019ve got more money than I\u2019ll ever need, and I would have paid ten times what I paid you for it.\u201d</p> <p>His hand locks around the ring, gripping it in a fierce hold.</p><p>\u201cI hope she says yes,\u201d I tell him. Meaning it.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He puts the ring back in the box, then stores it inside his suit jacket. He picks up a folder sitting on the seat next to him and tosses it on the table between us. I look down at it.</p><p>\u201cYou are now Mr. and Mrs. Cardinal. I thought an ornithological last name still seemed appropriate.\u201d</p><p>I flip open the folder and thumb through the new passports. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even have to ask her,\u201d I joke, thinking about our now-married status.</p><p>\u201cEverything you need is in there. All your documents and bank codes. I also moved your old bank accounts to your new name and a new bank.\u201d</p> <p>I raise my eyebrows at that because I never asked him to do that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he says cockily, before shooting back the rest of his drink. No wonder the FBI wants their hands on him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long flight to the South Pacific. Get some sleep and kill that phone.\u201d He nods to the cellphone sitting in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI hope you win your girl over, too. It hurts when they push away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re criminals,\u201d I remind him. No wonder our women are pushing us away.</p><p>\u201cThen do what you do best, Sparrow. You\u2019re a thief, after all. Steal her heart.\u201d With that little bit of wisdom, he stands and leaves.</p><p>I pick up the phone, ready to smash it, when I see all the missed text messages. They must have come before we got in the air. I skip all of them and go straight to Tessa\u2019s.</p><p>Tessa: I love you.</p> <p>Maybe there\u2019s more hope than I thought.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Tessa</p><p>It\u2019s all in pieces.</p><p>I remember everything from the bank robbery. The panic at first seeing the men with guns, then my training kicked in, and I did what they asked. I remember lying on the floor, my heartbeat in my throat as the men walked around like they knew exactly what was where. This was planned. That was the only thought that kept running through my mind.</p><p>Harper\u2019s crying was making me nervous, and I wanted her to be quiet. I just closed my eyes tightly and prayed for it to be over soon.</p><p>I remember my hair being pulled so hard I thought it had been ripped out. The gun pressed to my temple, and then thoughts of dying flashed through my mind.</p><p>Words were exchanged, but all I could do was wish I could see Sean one last time. One final time to say goodbye and tell him I love him.</p><p>Right before the gun went off, my wish came true. He was there. Only betrayal was the only thing I could see.</p><p>Once the gun went off, I thought I was dead. My ears were ringing so loud, I couldn\u2019t think. I may have blacked out, but I remember Sean\u2019s eyes. I remember him coming to catch me.</p><p>Even with his treachery, I felt safe in his arms.</p><p>But seeing the dead body of Nick beside me would be burned into my brain for the rest of my life. And after that sight, things went fuzzy.</p><p>I was in the car with Sean, and my hand was stinging. I hit him with more anger than I\u2019d ever felt before. Then there was a pinch on my arm, and it all went black.</p><p>There was a glimpse of a plane, and the feeling of Sean picking me up. There was a flash of someone else\u2014a man named Dimitri? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s real or a dream.</p><p>There was a bed that moved, and Sean was holding me.</p><p>But then he was gone.</p><p>I remember crying and kicking my legs, then another pinch on my arm. Sean was holding me down while I screamed, and then it all went black again.</p><p>My body aches. I feel like I\u2019ve been in the same position too long, and I roll over to stretch. I can\u2019t remember what day it is, but it\u2019s warm all around me, so I must be with Sean.</p><p>I reach for him, but there\u2019s nothing beside me.</p><p>Sitting up, I see that I\u2019m in a big, white fluffy bed surrounded by tons of pillows. There\u2019s a canopy over the top of it with pretty gauzy material hanging from it, which rustles in the breeze.</p><p>I look down and see I\u2019m completely naked, but I smell Sean all over me. I don\u2019t feel like I had sex, so he must have just slept on top of me.</p><p>Looking beyond the bed, I see the room is white and bathed in light, courtesy of giant windows and two huge glass doors that lead out onto a balcony.</p><p>I wrap the bedsheet around myself and get out of bed.</p><p>The cool tile feels nice against my feet, and my legs wobble a little as I take a few steps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I\u2019m at the balcony, I can finally see everything clearly. There\u2019s sand and palm trees and an ocean that stretches out as far as the eye can see. It\u2019s utterly beautiful and looks like something out of one of my fantasies.</p><p>Standing there looking at paradise, everything comes crashing back to me. This isn\u2019t the place of my dreams, it\u2019s a lie from a thief.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Sean</p> <p>\u201cShe refuses to eat. She won\u2019t talk to me. Hell, she won\u2019t even fucking look at me. But I don\u2019t want to push her. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get there. It won\u2019t happen overnight, Sean. You\u2019ll have to earn it from her.\u201d</p><p>Sal\u2019s words offer me comfort and remind me that I\u2019ll have to fight for what I want. I reach out and hug him, needing his support.</p><p>When Dimitri first offered me the job, I set my plan into place. I knew that I would need a location that was isolated, and I knew Sal would have to come with me. Until Tessa, I\u2019d never had any family besides him.</p><p>I bought the island in the South Pacific through a private sale.</p> <p>Laura's father, a reclusive billionaire, had owned it. When he died, she didn't want the place, but she knew it could be of use. I\u2019d never met her, but if Dimitri said she could be trusted, then I knew she could. Now that I know just how much he cares for her, I understand that she\u2019s probably the most trustworthy person in the world. Especially after all he\u2019s done.</p><p>The name of the island is Veilig. It means \u2018safe\u2019 in Dutch.</p><p>The island is only accessible by boat, but luckily it\u2019s only a short ride to the mainland. Sal hired a couple of people willing to work and live here full time\u2014a few who keep the grounds and a couple who maintain the inside of the home.</p><p>Two of the women he hired are certified midwives, so when the time comes, they can monitor Tessa while she\u2019s pregnant. Seems you can get anything set up if you have the money.</p><p>When I told Sal my plan to live on Veilig and cut all ties, he was more than willing to agree. He\u2019d spent his whole life digging snow in Chicago and trying to keep safe from street thugs. An isolated paradise was just what he was looking for.</p><p>My original plan didn\u2019t include Tessa, but as soon as I saw her, things changed. My idea of a home changed. My modified plan didn\u2019t include drugging her and bringing her here, but after what happened with Nick, I couldn\u2019t risk it.</p> <p>There won\u2019t be any blowback from Nick\u2014he\u2019s not someone Heavy will miss\u2014but I knew after Tessa recognized me she wouldn\u2019t come with me here willingly, and I couldn\u2019t risk it. I had Sal go by her place the morning of the robbery and pack up a few things, leaving a note and some cash for Harper. The note just said she was safe and wouldn't be coming back. I think the money I left for Harper will keep her quiet. At least for a little while.</p><p>Sal hopped on a plane to South America right after and took care of business, meeting us here later. We needed to travel separately, just in case. Neither of us is worried about the police. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re working too hard on tracking down the killer of a local criminal with a rap sheet a mile long. And my hitting the alarm in the vault on the way out was my ace in the hole.</p><p>The cops arrived just in time to catch some of Heavy\u2019s men, but the money still got away. So while Heavy has his money right now, I don\u2019t think it will be for long. The two guys they picked up will sing like birds once they know what kind of sentence awaits them, and they\u2019ll be the ones to blame when the cops come knocking on Heavy\u2019s door.</p><p>The bank gets its money back, Heavy and his team go to jail, and I\u2019m long gone. Not necessarily a free man, but I plan on spending the rest of my life living here with Tessa, so I\u2019m not worried about what I am in the eyes of the law.</p><p>It\u2019s been three days since she woke up, and it\u2019s not getting any better. I thought maybe once she got some distance, she would start to change her mind. Start to see what happened and realize that it was for the best. That all that mattered was that we were together.</p><p>I tried explaining it to her while she sat on the balcony and looked out at the ocean, but she wouldn\u2019t acknowledge anything I said. I\u2019ve tried to give her space. Not having her touch is eating me up inside.</p><p>Feeling the ache deep in my soul, I long to hold her to me and make it all okay. I don\u2019t want to force her, but I just can\u2019t see any other way. She has to snap out of this fog she\u2019s in, or I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be lost to me forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do some fishing today. Good luck, Sean.\u201d With that, Sal is gone, leaving me alone.</p> <p>I walk to the lower patio that looks over the sandy beach. It\u2019s so beautiful here, but I feel like a part of me is dead inside. I need Tessa to come back to me. I need her light to make my darkness go away.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think it was possible for someone to get inside you, and imprint themselves into your skin so quickly, but it happened.</p><p>There is no me without her, and I know that there is no her without me. These feelings I have aren\u2019t one sided, and as much as she\u2019s upset with me, I know it\u2019s still in there.</p><p>I know that even if she never forgives me, I can love enough for the both of us. And while I\u2019m strong, I\u2019m still weak without her. I\u2019m not even half a man without her in my arms.</p><p>Making up my mind, I turn from the patio and walk towards our bedroom. She may fight me, and she may even hate me after, but I\u2019ll make her see. I\u2019ll make her remember what we had and that I only did what I did because I love her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m going to remind her of our connection and how truly special it is. I\u2019m going to remind her that my touch is the only touch she craves and that forgiving me is her only option. I\u2019m sick to my stomach at not having her touch, and even if all she does is slap me, I\u2019ll take it.</p><p>I\u2019ll take even the smallest scrap of her attention. I\u2019m just that desperate.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Tessa</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d This has to be the best dream ever. I\u2019m back in Sean\u2019s bed, his head between my legs, his tongue stretching my tight opening, his beard scratching the inside of my thighs. His mouth makes love to me as his fingers force me to climax.</p><p>Everything else seems to just wash way. It\u2019s just him and me, still in our perfect weekend.</p><p>\u201cCum for me, little fox. I need you,\u201d he murmurs against my body before licking into my pussy with deep wet strokes. He goes back to my clit, dragging it into his mouth and sucking. Slipping two fingers inside me, he searches for my G-spot and sends me over the edge. My body coils and then succumbs as I call out his name, and the orgasm takes me.</p><p>I try to clamp my legs closed, but Sean buries his face deeper into the folds of my sex, making sure to get every drop of my orgasm. In my dream he\u2019s soaking it all up and loving me with every inch of his mouth.</p><p>Too quickly the heat is gone and it makes my eyes open lazily. That\u2019s when I remember.</p><p>Betrayal.</p><p>Death.</p><p>He used me to get into the bank, then he killed a man right in front of me.</p><p>It all comes crashing down on me. I stare at him as he sits in a chair in the corner of the room. He gazes back at me, licking his lips from the orgasm he just gave me. That was no dream. It was him. I roll over to face the other way. I don\u2019t want to have my eyes on him.</p><p>I hate the way I feel about it. I feel like it\u2019s ripping me in two. Part of me loves him, and part of me is so angry at him I can\u2019t speak. I hate the part of me that loves him, but it\u2019s still there.</p><p>Love isn\u2019t just a switch you can flip on and off. I\u2019ve learned that over the past few days. I loved him before I understood what was really happening, and that love doesn\u2019t seem to be fading with this new knowledge. I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m madder at, myself or him.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat, baby.\u201d I ignore him. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since I got here. I don\u2019t want to talk to him because my ability to resist him isn\u2019t so great. The only wall I can seem to keep up is silence. It wouldn\u2019t take much to crack, even knowing the things I know. Does that make me pathetic? Knowing he used me for all of this, yet I still want him? He has blood on the very hands that have held me close at night. The hands that captured my face as he rained kisses all over me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go on not eating,\u201d he tries again. He\u2019s been on this eating thing since yesterday. To be honest I hadn\u2019t even realized I hadn\u2019t eaten. I think with all the crying, I just didn\u2019t feel up to it. Nor was I hungry.</p><p>Now I am, but seeing how much it bothers him that I\u2019m not eating, I\u2019m doing it on purpose. It\u2019s spiteful and immature, but I can\u2019t find the energy to care. It might be childish, but I like seeing the misery on his face. I want him to be as miserable as I am. He did this to us. He ripped us apart and shattered everything. I should\u2019ve known he was too good to be true.</p><p>He has taken everything from me: my life, my job, what few friends I had, and the man I thought I loved. He made me fall in love with him so he could use me. Then took me from the only home I\u2019ve ever known.</p><p>I hear him move, coming to the other side of the bed so I\u2019m once again looking at him. He drops to his knees next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat, you're going to get sick.\u201d He pauses for a second, running his hands through his messy hair. I have the urge to reach out and fix it, but I clench my hand into a fist so that I don\u2019t. \u201cThis is killing me, baby. I love you. Just...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear what he has to say. The walls I have up are already shaking just looking at him. The miserable look on his face is killing me. I hate it, but I can't seem to bring myself to swipe it away for him.</p><p>\u201cIf you stop talking, I\u2019ll eat.\u201d His jaw clenches, but he nods his head as he stands and leaves the room.</p> <p>He comes back moments later with a tray in hand. It must have been sitting right outside the door. The sight of the pancakes and bacon makes my stomach growl loudly. Sean scowls at the sound, like my being hungry is making him angry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault I haven\u2019t eaten. If I was home, I bet I would have eaten by now,\u201d I say defensively. That\u2019s probably not true. I\u2019d most likely be in bed, curled up and crying about Sean not being who I thought he was.</p><p>What\u2019s just as scary is when I think about what would have happened if he\u2019d left me behind. I\u2019d never see him again. That thought seems more painful than this.</p><p>I sit up and let him place the tray over my lap. He goes back to his chair in the corner to sit in silence like I asked. I want to snap at him to leave, but then he probably would. I like when he\u2019s close, even if I want to smack him.</p><p>When the first bite of fluffy pancake and sweet syrup hits my lips, I moan. I look up in time to see Sean adjusting himself in his chair. His erection is clear as day, even from across the room. He licks his lips, and I wonder if he\u2019s thinking about my food, or still tasting me on his lips from earlier.</p><p>I get halfway through my food when the silence becomes too much.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I finally ask. Maybe if I ask the questions, I can control the conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d His tone is so matter-of-fact that I just stare at him. My heartbeat picks up at his words. I can\u2019t live without you. God, I want to run and jump into his lap. Those words seem so much deeper than an \u2018I love you.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t live without you</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar. I can\u2019t trust anything you say,\u201d I tell him, wanting the words to be true. I want him to make me believe him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never once lied to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you were looking at my bank to set up an account,\u201d I throw back at him. He never intended to open an account with us; he just used that lie to talk to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I said I was looking at your bank for work. You took it as I wanted to set up an account. I never said that.\u201d</p><p>I drop my fork down onto the plate. \u201cIt was a lie. Spin it how you like.\u201d My appetite is gone once again, but I ate more than half of what he gave me.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and leans back in his chair.</p><p>The silence starts again.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d My words come out in a whisper. Wasn\u2019t there another way to have gone about this if he wanted me? Was the bank robbery more important than me?</p><p>\u201cThe wheels were in motion before I ever even saw you. I couldn\u2019t stop it by then. It was all too late. I could only do what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, Sean. If that\u2019s even your real name!\u201d I scream out the last part. I don\u2019t even know if the man I\u2019ve fallen in love with is real.</p><p>Leaning forward, he places his elbows on his knees. I can see the dark circles under his eyes. He looks like he hasn\u2019t slept in days. I know he crawls into bed with me each night and leaves before I wake up, leaving only his smell behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still the man you fell in love with, Tessa,\u201d he shoots back, understanding what I was trying to get out. \u201cThe person I\u2019ve been when I\u2019m with you is who I am. The things I whispered in your ear when we made love. When I held you tight and told you I wanted a family. When I stroked your belly, dreaming of our baby growing in there. It was all true. Every. Single. Thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used me,\u201d I retort. I think I\u2019m trying to remind myself of this more than remind him.</p> <p>\u201cI had no choice. The people I got mixed up with were already planning to use you, and I couldn\u2019t let that happen. I tried, baby. I swear I did. I went back to call it all off and to wipe my hands clean. I wanted to be able to try to get you myself. Normal boy-meets-girl shit. But like I said, they already had you in their sights, and I wasn\u2019t letting them touch you. No one touches what\u2019s mine, and you are mine. It was too late, and the only thing I could do was make sure you were protected in all of it. Make sure that no matter what, you and I made it.\u201d The look he gives me dares me to challenge that, but I say nothing \u201cYou might be fighting it, but you know it\u2019s true. Just like I\u2019m yours. I always have been. You\u2019ve been mine before you ever knew I existed.\u201d</p><p>A lump forms in my throat. I don\u2019t want to cry anymore. I\u2019ve already cried so much. He must see it in my eyes, the tears trying to break free.</p><p>\u201cTessa.\u201d</p><p>The way he says my name is pained as need coats the word. I pull my eyes to his, feeling his stare all the way to my toes.</p><p>\u201cYou took me from the only home I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I brought you to your home. Your place is with me, and this is our home. It\u2019s made just for us. You belong here, not there. I\u2019ve never really had a real home, Tessa, but when I saw you that first time I knew you were it. From that very first moment. You are my only home, and I want to be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say you don\u2019t belong here with me. I don\u2019t think I can bear it. I\u2019ll show you. Please just let me prove it to you. If I didn\u2019t love you and want to be with you, would I have brought you here? No, I would\u2019ve left you behind and been long gone. But there was no leaving without you. Because without you I might as well be dead.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 23</p><p>Sean</p><p>Tessa looks at me with big eyes. There\u2019s hope in them, and she\u2019s close to the edge, I just need to help her get there.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted my world to touch you. I never wanted anything dark around me to dim your light. My biggest fear is that something would take away your innocence and the purity of your trust in me. I never meant to deceive you, baby. Never.\u201d</p><p>She hasn\u2019t told me to stop talking yet, so I keep going, needing to make her understand.</p><p>\u201cWhen Nick pulled you off the ground and I saw him put that gun to your head, my whole world fell apart in a split second. I knew the bullets were blanks, and I knew no harm would come to you, but knowing that in that split second you knew everything, I was crushed. I\u2019m so sorry that it happened the way it did. That wasn\u2019t the plan, and when everything went to shit, I had to improvise. That included getting you out of there and onto the island a lot sooner than I had anticipated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d Her fingers twist in the blankets as she struggles to believe me.</p><p>\u201cThe job was supposed to be simple, Tessa. In and out and no one the wiser. I had to go through with it to make sure you were safe and that no one touched you. I had to finish this one last job to give us the life I\u2019ve been telling you about. The life where it\u2019s just you and me and our babies.\u201d</p><p>I take a chance, getting up from the chair again and making my way over to the bed. She doesn\u2019t stop me as I slowly walk over, letting her know my intentions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is no me without you. And if I have to spend the rest of my life making it up to you, then I\u2019ll do it. I will never stop trying to prove to you that what I did was never meant to hurt you and was only meant to save you. To save me.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to the closet and pull out a small bag. I had Sal specifically pick up a few things that I knew Tessa would need if things went south. I didn\u2019t go about doing this the right way, but I\u2019ll die knowing the end justified the means.</p><p>\u201cThe plan was to complete the robbery and then come back to you. I was going to get you after work and tell you to pack your things and run with me. I would have told you all of it and brought you here of your own free will. But that\u2019s not what happened, and I have to deal with the aftermath. This may not make up for taking you from that bank, but I hope it helps.\u201d</p><p>I remove the tray and place the small bag in her lap, watching her fingers untangle from the sheet and slowly reach for it.</p><p>I kneel beside the bed, and she looks at me skeptically as she unzips the bag.</p><p>She pulls out the small brooch shaped like a fox. It was her grandmother\u2019s. As recognition hits her, she looks up at me with watery eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I ever saw you, you were wearing that. I knew it meant a lot to you, and when you showed me the picture of your grandmother wearing it, I knew it had to come with us. You\u2019ve been my little fox since the second I laid eyes on you, Tessa. I may have not done this the right way, but if you let me, I\u2019ll love you enough to make up for this until the end of time.\u201d</p><p>She rubs her finger over the fox, tears running down her face. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I cup her hands in mine as she cradles the fox. \u201cI\u2019m scared, too, baby. I\u2019m scared I fucked up everything and that you won\u2019t forgive me. I\u2019m scared that you won\u2019t ever look at me and feel what you once felt. But mostly I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t deserve you, and one day you\u2019ll realize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean.\u201d She looks up to me with her big golden eyes, so hopeful and so soft.</p><p>No sooner is the word out of her lips than I\u2019m on them. She\u2019s hesitant at first, but it only takes a half a second before she melts against me, opening her lips and letting me in.</p><p>Her warm mouth tastes of syrup and sweetness, and she moans as I sweep my tongue in, claiming her. I get off the floor and sit on the bed, never breaking our kiss. I pull her to me, onto my lap, as I wrap my arms around her and hold her against my body.</p><p>She moans as I suck her tongue and then nibble her lips, the last of her resistance slipping away. It feels as if she\u2019s letting go of all the anger, and she\u2019s as light as a feather. She\u2019s delicate and fragile in my arms, and I\u2019ll never break that gentle trust again. I\u2019ll never do anything again to make her question me or my motives. Ever.</p><p>I move my lips down her chin to her neck, needing to inhale her scent and taste every inch of her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sean. Don\u2019t ever do that to me again.\u201d</p><p>I pull back and cup her face, looking into her liquid-gold eyes. \u201cNever, baby. That life is in the past. It\u2019s just us now. I love you so fucking much.\u201d</p><p>My lips are back on hers again, needing to know that this is real. That the worst is over and it\u2019s all going to be okay.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Tessa begs, clinging to me. She pulls my body tighter to hers as she adjusts her position in my lap. She slings one leg around my waist so our cores are aligned, and her heat is against my solid cock.</p><p>\u201cPlease what, little fox? Say the words and make them dirty.\u201d I kiss down her neck, grazing the delicate skin there with my teeth.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me. I need you cumming in me, Sean.\u201d</p><p>Her words send a shiver down my spine, and a little cum leaks inside my jeans. Breaking away from her neck, I look into her golden eyes and see need there.</p><p>We both want to make up and bind ourselves to one another. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve been inside you, baby.\u201d I hold her face with both hands before running my fingers down her chest to cup her breasts. \u201cI won\u2019t last long. I\u2019m too desperate.\u201d</p><p>She nods a little at me, biting her lip. I see a blush creep across her cheeks, the little freckles there making her look so innocent and pure. Her gorgeous auburn hair flows around her as she grinds down on my erection, torturing me.</p> <p>\u201cI think my little fox likes the idea of me cumming quick.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got on pale pink panties and one of my oversized white T-shirts. I push the shirt up, exposing her underwear and watching as she moves her hips against me.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, Tessa? Do you want me to cum fast so we can do it over and over?\u201d I look up, and she bites her lip again, nodding at me. \u201cSay the words, little fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want you, and I want us. Make me remember why this is so perfect between us.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her by the waist, I flip us over so she\u2019s flat on her back. Her legs fall open as I move between them.</p><p>\u201cTake the shirt off. I wanna suck on your tits.\u201d</p><p>I reach down and unbuckle my jeans, pushing them down to my thighs. I\u2019m too wound up to take them all the way off. I will after this first time, but right now I just need our important parts to connect. Just the essentials, and then we can take it slow.</p><p>As soon as my cock is out, she falls back on the bed, the T-shirt gone. Immediately, I pull her panties to the side and press my cock to her opening.</p><p>I look up into her eyes, and as her nails slightly scratch down my chest, I thrust inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I groan, nearly collapsing on top of her as I bury my face in her neck. I start to pump into her hard, needing her and needing to bind us together. It\u2019s as if I can somehow fuse her to me with every thrust.</p><p>My breathing is labored as I try to hold on long enough so that Tessa cums, too, but I fear it\u2019s hopeless. Her legs come up around my hips, one hand on my back, clinging to me, and one in my hair, pulling it.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, baby. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she whispers, as she licks my ear, and I\u2019m done for.</p><p>Her words send me over the edge, cumming inside her with a loud moan. I grip her body tightly to me as I hold myself inside her, releasing my orgasm, emptying my thick load into her. I try to catch my breath. Holding her to me, I start to move again, needing to get her off as well.</p><p>I sit up a little and reach between us. I feel her clit slick with her need and my cum. \u201cNow you owe me two orgasms, little fox. And I\u2019m going to get them.\u201d</p><p>I lean down and take a nipple in my mouth, and again her hand goes to my hair, holding me in place. I lightly bite it and then move to the other, making sure to give equal treatment. I feel her tight channel clench me, and her wet nectar slips down between us.</p><p>I thumb her clit harder, and with just the slight pressure on her tits, she tenses under me and shouts out her orgasm. Her body ripples, and she moans my name as she pulls me tighter to her. It makes me feel needed and forgiven, and I want it all over again.</p><p>\u201cAnother,\u201d I mumble against her nipple, moving down and biting the thick flesh around it. \u201cAnother orgasm, and this time I cum with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she moans, and moves her hips under me.</p><p>Her first orgasm is still there, just barely dissipated as I rub her sensitive clit again and move back and forth between her nipples. I steadily thrust into her, and her body winds tighter and tighter.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tessa. You\u2019re mine, and I\u2019ll never let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she moans, and then her orgasm begins again.</p><p>I feel the tingle run up my cock and out the head as I thrust into her one final time, cumming into her womb. Her tight pulses pull my own orgasm from me as I give her body what it begs for.</p><p>Before she can come down from her orgasm, I flip us over so she\u2019s on top of me, straddling my cock and lying on my chest.</p><p>\u201cMore, Tessa,\u201d I whisper against her neck. I gently thrust into her, slowly this time and less rushed. \u201cI need much, much more.\u201d</p><p>She smiles down at me, then starts to move in time with my slow thrusts. \u201cI guess we have a couple of days to make up for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an entire island to make up on.\u201d</p><p>I feel my own smile match hers as our lips connect.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Tessa</p><p>\u201cI think you reached your goal three days ago.\u201d I look over my shoulder teasingly at Sean who has been kissing my back for the last twenty minutes, his beard tickling me.</p><p>It\u2019s late afternoon, and we\u2019ve been lying on the beach most of the day. The warm breeze rolls in off the ocean, leaving a sweet smell in the air. I could lie here forever.</p> <p>\u201cJust making sure,\u201d he says against my skin, still pressing kisses all over me, stopping every now and then for a little nibble. I\u2019ve noticed he likes to leave little love bites in random places on my body. I keep finding them when I turn in the mirror. Discovering a new one every time I look in the mirror makes me smile.</p><p>He said he wanted to taste every part of me, and he\u2019s been trying to reach that goal since. I\u2019m pretty sure he got it the first day. I give him a soft smile before turning myself back to the ocean, letting him do as he pleases with me.</p><p>Since I opened myself back up to him, he hasn\u2019t wanted to be more than a foot from me. It was adorable, until he tried to follow me into the bathroom to pee. Hell, what am I thinking? That was pretty adorable, too.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much for me to cave to Sean, but it\u2019s hard to tell someone you don\u2019t want something when you really want it. He\u2019s offering a life that seems too good to be true, but like he said, he\u2019s been showing me every day that he means it. I haven\u2019t wanted for anything, and the main thing I crave is him, and he\u2019s always at my side.</p><p>My life changed the day he entered it. From the very first moment I saw him, I came alive. It was like I was just moving through the motions, one thing after another, doing what I thought I should be doing. Existing but not really living.</p><p>He woke me up. It might have been crazy how we got here, but I can\u2019t bring myself to be mad or upset about it anymore. I want to be here with him, and I\u2019m done denying us both happiness.</p><p>The island is almost like a dream. It\u2019s like we\u2019re in our own little world here and nothing can touch us. Sean says the main island isn\u2019t that far away, but I don\u2019t want to go anywhere right now. I like being alone and getting to know Sean more, learning about his experiences growing up on the streets and how it slowly led him to a life of crime.</p><p>It made me ache for him and made me love him more than I thought was possible. I can\u2019t imagine being so young and feeling so alone. I was little when I found out my parents weren\u2019t coming back, but I had my grandmother to watch over me and love me the best she could. I can\u2019t judge him for the choices he had to make. It started out as just surviving and then turned into all he knew.</p><p>Now he wants a fresh start with me, and I want to give that to him. I want to be part of it because like him, I can\u2019t see myself living without him. Once my anger started to cool, I could see more clearly. This man loves me, and he would do anything to keep me. Why would I turn my back on that? He doesn\u2019t have to worry about that anymore because I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m not leaving this island. I\u2019m his until I take my last breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve met the people who live here and help maintain the island, and I also met Sal.</p><p>I could tell from the very first moment that I met him how much he cared for Sean, and that made me love him instantly. I also see where Sean gets some of his charm. Sal kept hitting on one of the women who helps keep the house up. I wanted to tell the woman she didn\u2019t have a chance, but learning is half the fun when it comes to men like them.</p><p>Sean rolls over and lays his head on my stomach while I run my fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cHow many do you want?\u201d he asks, and I don\u2019t even have to ask to know what he is talking about.</p> <p>\u201cI say we start with one and see how it goes.\u201d I hadn\u2019t really given much thought to having kids before Sean. Sure, I knew I wanted them one day...</p><p>\u201cI want two,\u201d he says lazily, like he\u2019s picturing it in his head. In my mind I can see a little girl with her father\u2019s eyes. The thought makes my heart squeeze. A little child\u2014a perfect mix of both of us. I couldn\u2019t think of anything more beautiful: both of us getting the family we always wanted, a family that would be filled with so much love I\u2019m not sure this island could hold it all.</p><p>\u201cTwo sounds nice.\u201d I agree. I wonder how we\u2019ll handle things on the island with children, but I\u2019m sure Sean already has everything mapped out. If there\u2019s one thing I know about him, he\u2019s always three steps ahead.</p><p>It\u2019s a comforting thought, to know he\u2019s already making plans to keep us safe and happy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s boy or girl, or what order they come in. I know I just always wanted a sibling.\u201d The words don\u2019t sound regretful. Maybe they would have at one time for him, but now we have a family. No need to long for one because it\u2019s already here. For all we know, one might be growing in my belly right now.</p> <p>\u201cMe too. But that could\u2019ve made it hard to be swept away to your private little love island.\u201d That\u2019s probably the easiest part of this whole thing. We aren\u2019t leaving anything behind. There are no wishes for our lives before, or what could have been. We both had nothing to stay for. I had asked Sean to make sure Harper was taken care of. She might not have been a good friend, but she had moments, and I didn\u2019t like the idea of her hurt. He\u2019d just smiled at me and said he was happy I still had that sweetness inside me. He was happy he hadn\u2019t washed it away from me.</p><p>\u201cOurs,\u201d he says, talking about the island. He closes his eyes, enjoying my fingers running through his hair.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I forgot that I\u2019m married,\u201d I say dryly. I had only found out I was married yesterday, along with finding out my new identity. His eyes pop open and narrow on me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be married to me?\u201d His eyebrows furrow, and I have to bite the inside of my cheek to stop myself from smiling at the half-scowl, half-pout on his face. I can already see our children pulling that look, too.</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll never know. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d I push a little more, intentionally trying to get him worked up. I like to get him going. It always turns out so delicious when I do.</p><p>Before I know it he\u2019s flipping me, and I land right on his lap, so I\u2019m straddling him, almost nose to nose.</p> <p>\u201cSay you want to be married to me.\u201d He grip my hips, his fingers digging in. I give him a half-smirk.</p><p>\u201cI want to be married to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, you do,\u201d he growls, before taking my mouth in a deep hungry kiss. He flips me over onto my back as he rubs his hard cock against the thin material of my swimsuit.</p><p>\u201cYou like your ring, little fox?\u201d he asks after he pulls back.</p><p>\u201cRing?\u201d Then I feel it on my finger. A smile spreads across my face as I realize he just slipped a wedding ring on my finger out of nowhere. This guy is some kind of crazy magician, but he\u2019s utterly adorable about it.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I whisper against his lips, still smiling from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to. You put it there. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Flipping me again so I\u2019m on top of him, he grabs a hold of my hips, and my hands land on his chest to keep me upright. My eyes land on the ring. The sparkle is nearly blinding in the sunlight. Just like I thought: perfect.</p><p>It\u2019s a round diamond on a gold band, but the rock is enormous\u2014big enough to scare birds away. My man is always making a statement.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t flip me around like this when I finally get knocked up.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how he does it now. I\u2019m not a tiny girl, but he\u2019s pretty big himself. He carries me around like I weigh absolutely nothing, and it makes me feel so small and delicate. He also bought me only bikinis to wear, so even if I am shy about my curves, he gave me no choice but to show them off.</p><p>\u201cI just want you on your throne\u201d He emphasizes what he means by dragging me across his cock and staring up at me.</p><p>I never thought I\u2019d be this girl. In a two-piece on top of her man, laid out on a beach, and not one insecurity eating at me. My man loves every part of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll proudly sit upon this throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a good thing, little fox, because your sweet married ass is going to be on it a lot until I plant my baby in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d I ask, before leaning down and taking his lips with mine.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Sean</p><p>I walk into our master bathroom, looking for Tessa. We were lying out on the beach earlier, and I\u2019d had enough of looking at her in that tiny bikini. I needed to get it off her and bury my face between her legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I walk in, I see she\u2019s bent over, looking for some more sunscreen under the sink.</p><p>\u201cI found it, Sean,\u201d she says, still bent over, not turning around to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI found it, too.\u201d I don\u2019t take my eyes off her ass as I approach her, stalking over to her silently and kneeling behind her</p><p>When my hands go to her hips, she jumps a little and then laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever I want, little fox.\u201d I pull the strings on either side of her waist, letting the bikini bottom drop to the floor. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the rough sound of my own voice. It\u2019s thick with need, just like my cock. But my mouth is watering, and I need her on my tongue when I take her.</p><p>She does as I ask, stepping wider and letting me see all of her. Licking my lips, I look at her tight pink pussy already glistening for me. I reach up and spread her ass cheeks and look at her back hole, wanting all of her exposed to me.</p><p>I lean in and nibble on her fat ass cheeks, biting slightly as I move closer to where I want to be.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she moans, leaning over further and giving me everything I want. She\u2019s all mine, and she knows it.</p><p>Dragging my tongue to her center, I lick her damp pussy lips, tasting her sugary sweetness. She\u2019s warm and wet, with just a hint of salt from our swim in the ocean.</p><p>Moving up, I dip my tongue inside her pussy, feeling little clenches around the tip of my tongue. She wants me inside her, but I need more from her first.</p><p>I grip her ass cheeks tighter and bring my tongue to her little asshole, making her shiver. She tenses up a little, and I pull back, kissing her cheeks again. \u201cYou won\u2019t deny me, will you, little fox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her whisper is so quiet, I almost don\u2019t hear it, but she gives in to me like I knew she would. The trust between us is strong, and she knows I would never do anything to hurt her. Even after everything we\u2019ve been through, she would allow me to have her body any way I wanted. Because I always make sure whatever I\u2019m doing will only give her pleasure.</p><p>I move back to her asshole and give it a few licks, tasting her sweetness there and helping her to relax. I press my finger against her tightest opening, applying a little pressure and letting her know what I want.</p><p>I kiss my way back down to her clit, licking her there and then finally sucking her into my mouth. Her loud moan echoes off the bathroom marble, and her tight ring relaxes, letting my finger penetrate her.</p><p>As I suck on her clit, I move my other hand to her pussy, rubbing two fingers in and out of her wet channel as the finger in her ass slowly starts to move at the same rhythm.</p><p>Tessa grips the counter and pushes back against me, seeking to meet my strokes. I can feel both her holes clenching, wanting more of me and loving the feeling.</p><p>After I take my mouth away from her pussy, she lets out a long whine. \u201cPatience, little fox. I need to put my cum in you again. It\u2019s been over an hour, and I can\u2019t get you pregnant if you keep walking around and letting it slip out.\u201d</p><p>Moving to stand up behind her, I pull my sticky hand free from her pussy, licking my fingers clean, and then use them to untie my swim trunks. Pressing the tip of my cock to her opening, I keep working the finger in her ass, wanting her to have as much pleasure as possible.</p><p>When I thrust inside her tight cunt, she clamps down on me, letting me feel every ripple of her need. My thick cock barely squeezes into her tightness, and I start to work it in and out of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. That feels so good. I think I\u2019m going to cum.\u201d</p><p>Her pulses get faster, and I let out a little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m usually the one who can\u2019t hold on to my cum when we make love. Hang on, baby. I want to enjoy it for a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Her breaths are coming quickly, and she\u2019s pushing against my cock and finger. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s fucking me and trying to steal her orgasm.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>My free hand comes down on her ass, leaving a little sting behind. It does nothing to stop her orgasm, the low moan from her throat letting me know she\u2019s even closer to the edge.</p><p>I press another finger into her ass, and there\u2019s a quick intake of breath. But her hesitation lasts only a second before she\u2019s back to pushing against me, begging for release.</p><p>I\u2019ll never deny her what she wants, so I adjust the angle of my hips and give her the pressure she needs to cum.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d she shouts, and it\u2019s music to my ears. I know if she\u2019s saying that word, then she\u2019s too far beyond her boundaries of pleasure. She\u2019s not thinking about what she\u2019s saying; she\u2019s just enjoying the feeling running through her body.</p><p>She clenches around my fingers and around my fat cock as her orgasm takes over and she peaks. Her screams of pleasure ring through the bathroom, and it all brings me to my own orgasm.</p><p>I thrust into her one last time, emptying myself into her tight cunt, hoping that she\u2019s opening for me and letting my seed take root. She\u2019ll be bred, and I don\u2019t care how many times I have to do it.</p><p>After the last of my cum has been pulled from me by her clenching pussy, I pull out and move my slick cock to her back entrance.</p><p>I remove my fingers and press the head of my cock to her ass, pushing against her hole and seeking entrance.</p><p>\u201cJust a few strokes, baby. I won\u2019t waste cum in your ass, but I want to feel it. Let me in, little fox.\u201d</p><p>I hear her gasp and push back against me. The head of my cock pokes through her tight ring, and the lube from our orgasms makes my entrance easy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slide in slowly, letting her adjust as I go. It only takes a few moments before she\u2019s totally relaxed and taking me all the way to the base of my cock. My balls press against her sticky pussy, and I feel her warm sugary syrup coating them.</p><p>I hold my cock in her ass for a few seconds. I want to enjoy the feeling of being in her ass. \u201cI won\u2019t cum, but I need to know that I\u2019ve claimed it as mine. Every part of you.\u201d</p><p>I push into her before pulling out slowly, then push in one final time. I will always prefer the warm welcome of her wet cunt, but I just needed to have this hole, too.</p><p>Pulling out slowly again for the final time, I leave the tightness of her ass and rub my palm over her asshole and pussy, gently petting the soreness away.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a shower, baby.\u201d I kiss her back and pull her with me into the shower, letting the hot water and bubbly soap wash us clean.</p><p>Once we\u2019re clean, I carry Tessa out of the shower and dry her off. I grab a simple cover-up for her and some loose shorts for me. We dress and walk down to the part of the island that\u2019s shaded.</p><p>There\u2019s a big cabana on this side of the island, which gives us privacy, but also a perfect view of the sunset. It\u2019s got a cover over the top and long silky panels that allow us to remain unseen, yet it still feels like we\u2019re outside.</p><p>I hold her to me as we lie in the cabana and watch the sun set. The peaceful calm between us is all we need. I steal little kisses and touches as we silently hold one another, just enjoying our perfect little paradise.</p><p>It\u2019s then time for dinner, so I scooping Tessa up and carry her on the path back to the house. When we get to the dining room, I place her in the seat beside me and sit down next to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you always going to carry me like that?\u201d She looks at me with her big golden eyes filled with love and happiness.</p><p>\u201cYes, Tessa. I will carry you, love you, spoil you, adore you, and worship you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>A blush hits her sun-kissed cheeks, and I lean down to place my lips on them.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing what we\u2019ve been through and how far we\u2019ve come in such a short time. People would probably consider us crazy, but if they felt even a tenth of what I feel for her, they would understand. I can\u2019t put into words exactly what she means to me, so I just have to keep showing her, over and over. If that\u2019s what it takes to show her what I feel inside, then I\u2019ll gladly do it.</p><p>Pushing a stray hair out of her eyes, I look at her and think how impossibly insane it is that I found her. That all my hopes, dreams, wishes, and love can be wrapped up in one person. I never intended for my life to end up this way, but it\u2019s more perfect than I could have imagined.</p><p>I started out as the thief, but Tessa stole my heart.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Tessa</p><p>3 months later ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to start running an extra two miles a day if Marie keeps this up.\u201d</p><p>Sean stands up from the little table in the kitchen. He raises his shirt to rub his belly as he smirks at me.</p><p>I have to agree. If we keep eating like this, I might have to join him. And I don\u2019t run. Ever. Unless something is chasing me, and that only happens when Sean and I are playing around. Though once I did suggest going with him. He said no, then made me ride him while he gripped my hips in a firm hold to remind me how much he liked them and how he didn\u2019t want them going anywhere. Needless to say, he didn\u2019t run that day either.</p><p>Reaching over, I grab a few of the hairs on his stomach and pull, making him yelp and jump back from me. I giggle. \u201cSee how she treats me, Marie?\u201d He leans down, placing one hand on the table and the other on the back of my chair, caging me in. He kisses me softly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cMissed a little,\u201d he whispers against my lips, licking any syrup that might be remaining.</p> <p>\u201cI see how she treats you alright.\u201d Marie\u2019s tone makes me blush.</p><p>Marie started working on the island about six weeks ago. She used to come each day on a boat until Sal finally talked her into staying with him permanently. Watching them together is utterly adorable, and I wonder if people look at Sean and me like that.</p><p>Giving me another quick kiss, Sean picks up my plate and his own to take to the sink, but Marie stops him and pulls them from his hands.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job,\u201d she scolds him. I can\u2019t see Sean\u2019s face, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s scowling at her. This has no effect on her, though he\u2019s probably a whole foot and a half taller than her. She\u2019s the definition of a spitfire if you get her going. I love that about her and have even picked up a few of her tricks. Sean and Sal both tried to get her to quit working here, saying she didn\u2019t need to work. She\u2019s Sal\u2019s woman, but she says she loves doing it. She needs something to do or she\u2019ll go stir crazy. They still ended up hiring another woman to help out, and the battle of wills is still going strong.</p><p>He makes his way back to me and crouches so we\u2019re at eye level. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to come with me? I\u2019ll be quick. It won\u2019t take me long at all to make sure everything is in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just going to lie down for a little. I bet by the time I wake up, you\u2019ll be back.\u201d Sean likes to go to town once a month to pick up a few things, check his mail, and look in on his accounts. I went with him the last time and enjoyed myself, but today I have something I need to take care of.</p><p>\u201cHow about I put it off, and we\u2019ll go tomorrow when you\u2019re feeling better?\u201d I can see the concern written all over his face. I lied this morning and told him I had a headache to get out of going today. Sometimes this man handles me like glass. I wonder how he\u2019ll be once he gets me knocked up. \u201cI could nap with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know what your kind of nap means,\u201d I laugh, knowing that it wouldn\u2019t be a nap at all. It would start with a little cuddling, which would turn to kissing, and then that would lead to kissing me everywhere, then him on top of me, making me scream his name.</p><p>His face turns serious, lines appearing in his forehead. \u201cStay inside. I don\u2019t want you near the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, I know how to swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please. Give me peace of mind while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p> <p>Grabbing his face with both hands, I dig my fingers into his beard. \u201cI\u2019ll stay inside and dream of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, little fox.\u201d He moves in for another kiss, this one deep but slow. His mouth moves against mine like we\u2019re making love.</p><p>When he finally pulls back, I keep a strong hold on his face, pulling a little at his beard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cutting it,\u201d he says for the sixth time this morning, his eyes going a little big. I caught him in the bathroom about to shave it this morning. He said it was just a summer cut. I might have lost it a little. I even threatened to go on a shaving strike of my own if he did, but he said I could turn into werewolf and he was still getting inside me. In the end I won. Facial hair was staying, and I was still keeping myself well groomed.</p><p>\u201cBetter not.\u201d</p> <p>He kisses me on the forehead and heads out the door. I sit at the table, sipping my orange juice while Marie does the dishes for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can\u2019t wait! Give it to me.\u201d I jump up from my chair and rush over to Marie as she pulls a pregnancy test out of her apron.</p><p>The last two tests I\u2019d done with Sean, and both times they came out negative. He acted like it was no big deal, but I could see the disappointment on his face. I want to make sure that the next time the subject comes up, I\u2019ll know for sure if I\u2019m pregnant or not.</p><p>\u201cI thought he\u2019d never leave.\u201d Marie shakes her head, wiping her hands off on her apron.</p><p>\u201cI know. I thought for sure he knew I was faking about the headache. I\u2019m the world\u2019s worst liar,\u201d I grimace. God, I hate lying to him.</p><p>\u201cCome on now. Let\u2019s see if we\u2019re going to have a baby around here soon,\u201d Marie says as we both rush to my bathroom. Quickly, I ready the test and do it, placing the stick on the sink when I\u2019m done. I open the door for Marie to come into the bathroom, and we both just stare down at the test and wait.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I scream out in surprise, jumping around to face Sean is standing in the bathroom doorway.</p><p>\u201cI...oh...\u201d I look to Marie for help, but she just stands there. \u201cI thought you left,\u201d I finally finish, stumbling over my words.</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d He runs his hands through his hair. \u201cJust felt like something was off.\u201d He takes a step into the bathroom, and I try to move further back, wanting to block the test, but my ass is already against the sink.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re kind of freaking me out here.\u201d He takes a few more steps until he\u2019s right in front of me, and I have to lean my head back to look at him. He must see the test on the sink behind me, because a smile breaks out across his face.</p><p>Suddenly, he\u2019s dropping to his knees in front of me.</p><p>I feel Marie move beside me, then her words hit me. \u201cTwo lines.\u201d</p><p>Sean places his face against my stomach, echoing her words \u201cTwo lines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby,\u201d I whisper, and run my fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Sean says to my stomach, and I feel a tear slip free.</p><p>Then he\u2019s picking me up and carrying me to our bed. Marie is long gone. Probably off to tell Sal they\u2019re going to be grandparents.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave the island. It\u2019s not safe here. Then maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off. \u201cCalm down. You planned for this. Think about it, Sean. We have Marie and the two midwives. It doesn\u2019t take long to get to the main island, and we can stay on the main island when the due date gets closer. We aren\u2019t leaving. This is our home. The home we\u2019ve made for the family we\u2019re going to have. We\u2019ll make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, little fox. We can do anything.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Sean</p><p>Nine months later...</p><p>\u201cWake up, baby. I think my water broke.\u201d</p><p>I shoot out of bed, nearly knocking Tessa to the floor. Luckily, my reflexes are good when it comes to her, and I grab her by both arms, picking her up in my arms before she can tumble back.</p><p>\u201cThe baby? It\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>She giggles at me and nods. This isn\u2019t a time for giggling. We have to move. Now.</p><p>\u201cWhen did your water break?\u201d I ask, striding around the room, not really having any kind of direction. I\u2019m just walking around, holding her in my arms while she has our baby in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cSean. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>Tessa agreed we would go off the island tomorrow and spend the last week of her pregnancy in town. It\u2019s our first baby, and we thought for sure she would go over her due date.</p><p>I begged her to go before, but she wouldn\u2019t. Finally, after dinner last night, I had to get on my knees and beg her to take the boat over in the morning. I couldn\u2019t handle the stress of being so far from the hospital with the baby so close to being born.</p><p>\u201cTessa.\u201d There\u2019s a warning in my tone that wants to tell her \u2018I told you so\u2019. But I\u2019ll do that later. Goddamn it, I knew this would happen!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already paged Sal. He and Marie are by the docks, ready to go. Our bags are packed, and it won\u2019t take us fifteen minutes to get there. I\u2019ve got time. Just breathe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those are supposed to be my words to her, not the other way around.</p><p>Carrying her out of the room, I try to think ahead and concentrate. I take her carefully down the dock and slip on my shoes. Marie must have left them there for me, predicting this would happen. Thank God, someone is thinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d I say in a panic as I see Sal and Marie waiting.</p><p>\u201cWe know, son. Just calm down. Everything is going to be okay.\u201d</p> <p>Sal puts his big hands on my shoulders, helping me into the boat as I clutch Tessa to my chest. I haven\u2019t put her down since she said her water broke, and I\u2019m a little terrified that if she stands on her own two feet, the baby will fall out.</p><p>I realize this isn\u2019t possible, but I\u2019m not exactly thinking rationally right now.</p><p>Marie comes to sit down beside me and pushes the hair out of Tessa\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. We radioed the hospital. They\u2019ll be waiting at the docks for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me and the baby I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s Twitchy McGee over here.\u201d</p><p>Tessa nods at me, and I immediately stop bouncing my feet up and down under her. I\u2019m nervous as fuck, but I need to hold it together. Our baby is coming, and I need to be her rock.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s going to be totally fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little less panic in your voice next time and you may convince yourself,\u201d Sal laughs as he gets behind the wheel of the boat and pulls out into the water.</p><p>The ride is only fifteen minutes. I can do this.</p><p>\u201cYou still think it\u2019s a boy?\u201d Tessa is trying to distract me, and I really need it right now.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I decide to focus on this. The sex of the baby is going to be a surprise. Both of us wanted that special moment when the baby comes.</p><p>I kiss her forehead and breathe in her scent. It calms me a little. She always calms me, and right now I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019ve still got her in my arms.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re convinced it\u2019s a girl?\u201d I say, looking into her big golden eyes. There\u2019s not an ounce of fear there, and it warms my heart to know how brave my girl is. She\u2019s always ready for whatever rolls her way. It\u2019s how I know she\u2019s going to be a phenomenal mother.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m totally right. I\u2019m the mom. I know it all.\u201d She laughs when she says it, not even believing that herself. She reaches up, running her hand through my messy hair. I love it when she does that. Just as much as she loves doing it. \u201cTell me something sweet.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trying to keep me focused on her, and it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world for me to do. \u201cIf it\u2019s a girl, I\u2019d like to name her Alma, after your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>She gets a little teary-eyed but just smiles and nods. After a moment, she clears her throat and smiles at me. \u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, I\u2019d like to name him Marcus. After Sal.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d thrown around a few names when we first found out she was pregnant, and I remember her asking me what Sal\u2019s middle name was.</p><p>Now it\u2019s my turn to get a little misty-eyed. I think all the stress and emotions are catching up to me, and all I can do is nod my head. It would be a beautiful way to honor the man who made me what I am today. Bad or good, it\u2019s who brought me to Tessa. And that\u2019s the legacy I want to leave behind in a hundred years when we\u2019ve both passed on. That if people only remember that I loved Tessa, it will be a life worth living.</p><p>\u201cThere they are,\u201d Marie says, pointing to the people from the hospital waiting on the dock just ahead.</p><p>Letting out a breath of relief I didn\u2019t know I was holding, I pull Tessa a little closer to me as we approach.</p> <p>Everything is going to be okay.</p><p>The hospital is what you\u2019d call pretty basic. It\u2019s totally clean, and they have everything we need, but there aren\u2019t a lot of frills like you\u2019d have in the States. Instead, what we do have are three nurses and a doctor all for us, and everyone is standing by to deliver a healthy baby.</p><p>Some of my stress is relieved when they get Tessa hooked up to the monitors and see that she\u2019s okay and so is the baby.</p><p>Once we\u2019re there and the doctors check her over, they all start speaking softly to one another, and my stress skyrockets again.</p><p>Finally, right before I\u2019m about to scream the room down, the doctor comes over and lets us know that Tessa is nearly fully dilated and we need to begin pushing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tessa and I yell at the same time. Both of us are in shock. She\u2019s barely made a peep and hasn\u2019t said the first thing about contractions.</p><p>Suddenly, I feel her gripping my hand, and the nurses get in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to only feel pressure when you walk and still be this far dilated.\u201d Tessa looks up at me and glares, because most of her pregnancy I didn\u2019t let her feet touch the ground. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to push.\u201d</p><p>I hold her hand and encourage her through everything, and dear God, is my woman a champ. She does everything they say, and when the labor starts to really hit her, she doesn\u2019t crumple under the pressure.</p><p>After an hour of solid labor and hard contractions, our son, Marcus Sean Cardinal, is born. Though he\u2019s technically a Cardinal, he\u2019ll always be my little Sparrow.</p><p>When the labor is finished and everything has calmed down, the three of us cuddle on Tessa\u2019s hospital bed while she nurses and I alternate between kissing her and our son.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Tessa whispers, rubbing his full head of dark auburn hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust like his mommy.\u201d</p><p>Sal and Marie are bursting with joy when they\u2019re finally allowed back to see us. I think Sal even shed a few tears when we told him the name, the big guy melting into a pile of mush.</p><p>Our little family might be far from traditional, but it\u2019s damn near bursting with love.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Tessa</p><p>Six months later...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that.\u201d Sean\u2019s sitting in the corner chair, his legs outstretched in his jeans, and his plain white T-shirt makes the tattoos on his arms stand out. When I lie in bed at night, I always find myself tracing his newest one. It\u2019s my name, and he plans on getting Marcus\u2019s name, too.</p><p>\u201cThis is the third one I\u2019ve tried on. Everything else I have is more beach-dress and not a night-out-dress.\u201d I give him my best pout.</p><p>I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s that showy. The bottom part is flowy, stopping mid-thigh, but the top hugs my breasts. It gives me a perfect, curvy, hourglass shape. I\u2019d ordered multiple dresses a few months back and called them my \u2018goal dresses\u2019 for after I had the baby. They\u2019re now fitting perfectly, which only makes me more excited about our first date night on the main island since we had little Marcus. I love him to pieces, but I\u2019m so okay with leaving him with Marie and Sal for the night. Hell, Marie taught me everything I know about having a baby.</p><p>He growls, standing up from his chair, and I know what\u2019s coming. I dart for the bathroom, trying to close the door, but he\u2019s way faster than me. Before I know it, my ass is planted on the bathroom counter, my skirt bunched around my waist, and my underwear pulled to the side.</p><p>\u201cTake me out,\u201d he snarls, staring down at my pussy.</p><p>I quickly do as I\u2019m told, getting more turned on by the second. When his cock springs free, he grabs it and rubs it against my clit.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I moan. His mouth crashes down on mine as he works his cock back and forth on my clit, picking up speed. There are no slow teases. He\u2019s not dragging this out. It\u2019s clear Sean is on a mission to cum sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried on all these dresses for me? Got me so fucking hard thinking about taking it off you when we get home tonight. But knowing you\u2019d be walking around for people to see you like this, that has me having a whole other feeling.\u201d He pulls away from my mouth, looking down at me while he continues to stroke his cock against my clit.</p><p>I\u2019m only catching about every other word he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to let me mark your pussy. That way I know when you\u2019re walking around with me tonight, I\u2019m all over this sweet little cunt. That it\u2019s mine. Only mine.\u201d</p><p>The pressure on my clit and the dirty picture he describes make me cum instantly, his possessive words sending me over the edge.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he grunts, and I feel his release start to spill onto me.</p><p>\u201cOnly yours,\u201d I moan, as he continues to rub himself across my clit, milking both our orgasms. He uses the head of his cock to smear his cum around, making sure my pussy is covered in it before pulling my panties back into place.</p><p>He tucks himself back into his pants and pulls me off the counter.</p><p>\u201cAll better?\u201d I tease, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cIt helped, but only tonight will tell.\u201d</p><p>I turn to look in the mirror and see my lipstick is smudged.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need another five minutes,\u201d I tell him as he stands behind me, looking at him in the mirror. He moves in closer, moving my hair off one shoulder, kissing me there before taking a light bite.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You look well loved by your man. Nothing fucking hotter than that.\u201d</p><p>I have to agree.</p><p>Needless to say, it still takes us another hour before we finally make it to the main island and to our dinner reservations.</p><p>The food was good but not as good as Marie\u2019s. But it\u2019s nice to be out, just the two of us. I drink champagne, almost killing half a bottle by myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to pump and dump,\u201d I say. Sean pulls me from my chair and leads me out of the restaurant to our next spot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of that when we get home.\u201d</p><p>My pussy clenches at his words, knowing what he means. Sean can\u2019t seem to get enough of my breasts since I\u2019ve had Marcus.</p><p>\u201cWe could skip dancing and go home,\u201d I suggest, wanting him to make good on his word. I rub up against him a little, not caring we\u2019re in the middle of the street. The champagne made me a little bold.</p><p>\u201cYou said dinner and dance. That\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you, little fox.\u201d</p><p>I smile up at him, getting on my tiptoes to get a kiss. He leans down, meeting me. The kiss is soft and only lasts a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he says, pulling me into a little bar.</p><p>A live band is playing, and people are already dancing even though it\u2019s a little early.</p><p>Sean finds us a table in the corner and orders us both a drink before pulling me onto the dance floor and holding me close as a slow song fills the bar.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me even closer, holding me tight.</p><p>\u201cNever knew I could be this happy. Hell, this fucking lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did this, Sean. You made all this happen for us. You fought for us even when I fought against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cAll of this is nothing without you. You\u2019re the heart of it all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>And he does. Until the song finally ends and a faster one comes on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom, baby. Stay at our table until I get back.\u201d I nod, making my way back to our table. I\u2019m stopped by a young man who looks to be about my age. He\u2019s got blond hair and blue eyes and has \u2018American\u2019 written all over him. It\u2019s easy to spot now who lives on the islands and who doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou have the time?\u201d he asks, a little slur to his words.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I reach into my purse and pull out my phone. \u201cJust a little after nine.\u201d</p><p>He steps a little closer, and I try to retreat but bump up against our table.</p><p>\u201cHow about you give me your number and we meet up later? You look like a good fuck after how you were all over that guy on the dance floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what he was. I know an easy lay when I see one.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly Sean is next to me, taking my phone from my hand. I hear the crack of the shattered phone and see the broken pieces to the floor.</p><p>\u201cJesus, was that thing made of crackers?\u201d I say, looking down at the phone.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you take a fucking step back from my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d The guy steps back, throwing his hands up like he\u2019s going to walk away. But he doesn\u2019t. No, he does the wrong thing altogether. \u201cI\u2019m up for sharing, man. She got enough ass and tits for the both of us.\u201d</p><p>I barely see Sean move as the blond guy gets a fist to the face. He falls back onto a table before rolling to the floor.</p><p>Sean turns to me and cups my face. \u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p> <p>He just hit someone and he\u2019s worried about me?</p><p>\u201cYour hand.\u201d I\u2019m thinking about the shattered phone and the punch. That should hurt, right? I feel like I\u2019d cry if that was me.</p><p>He kisses my cheek. \u201cTold you that dress would be trouble, and now you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he says in my ear, pulling me from the bar after throwing some money on the table. \u201cSorry about your phone. I\u2019ll get you a new one.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to get home, and for Sean to show me all the trouble I\u2019m in.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Sean</p><p>Six months after that...</p><p>\u201cSean! Are you in here?\u201d</p> <p>I hear Tessa coming into our room, and I go to the closet to hide the bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I turn around, wondering how the hell she got to me so fast.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Tessa rolls her eyes and stands there, crossing her arms under her big breasts. All it does is accentuate them in her bikini top, and I lick my lips.</p><p>\u201cFocus, big guy. You\u2019re a terrible liar. What\u2019s in the bag?\u201d</p><p>She goes up on her tiptoes, trying to look behind me, and I feel my face blush.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you being so sneaky?\u201d A devilish grin crosses her face, and I know what\u2019s coming.</p><p>Suddenly, she\u2019s jumping at me, and I have no choice but to catch her, dropping the bag of pregnancy tests behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to be prepared,\u201d I stumble. Feeling silly. \u201cYou know, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Tessa laughs and wraps her legs and arms tighter around me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I don\u2019t remember you asking at all last time. I just remember you putting a baby in me.\u201d</p><p>My cock twitches at her words. She\u2019s right. Things have grown stronger between us since we\u2019ve been on the island, and I know I never have to worry about her leaving me. But I still want another baby with her. She\u2019s an incredible mother, and seeing Marcus grow over this past year has been magical. I never thought I\u2019d be the guy who got excited about first steps or first words until I met Tessa. I never realized how much I wanted to make a family until the first time I laid eyes on her.</p><p>I carry her over to the bed and climb on, laying her down under me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, but I\u2019ve also come to realize we have lots of time. I just thought I\u2019d cum in you as many times as possible and then maybe steal your pee out of the toilet and keep testing it until I get you bred.\u201d</p><p>Tessa puts her hands over her face and I hear her giggle. \u201cThere\u2019s that crazy love of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d I push her sundress up, revealing her naked pussy. She stopped wearing bottoms a long time ago, and it\u2019s made life a lot easier.</p><p>\u201cMarcus is with Sal and Marie this afternoon. I think that\u2019s all the invitation you need.\u201d</p><p>Growling, I move down her body and shoulder her legs apart. I put my mouth on her cunt. I know exactly how to get her off, and I don\u2019t want to draw it out. I plan on having her at least three times before Sal comes back with Marcus, and I want to make the most of it.</p><p>Pushing two fingers inside her wet channel, I curl them up, hitting her sweet spot and making her back arch off the bed.</p><p>\u201cSean,\u201d she moans, gripping my hair and grinding down on my mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, little fox,\u201d I mumble against her wet core. \u201cFucking use my mouth.\u201d</p><p>I suck her clit as she pushes against me, begging for what only I can give her. I lay my free arm across her hips, holding her down and pulling her orgasm from her.</p><p>She cums in my mouth, shouting my name and pulsing under me. Her body is like an instrument and I\u2019ve gained mastery over it. Strumming the right strings makes the sweetest music. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I move back up her body, pushing down my loose shorts and gripping my thick cock. I rub the head through her wetness and thrust in, feeling the aftershocks of her orgasm in the contractions of her pussy.</p><p>I start fucking her hard, burying myself balls-deep. I pull her top down, letting her breasts spill out as I lean down and suck a fat nipple in my mouth. God, I miss the taste of her milk, but soon enough I\u2019ll have it again. Thinking about it makes me harder, and I thrust roughly into her.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d She pulls at my T-shirt, and it\u2019s then I realize I\u2019m still dressed. Only my cock is out, and it\u2019s working in and out of her tight body. My shirt is the last thing on my mind.</p><p>I don\u2019t stop moving inside her as I help Tessa remove my shirt. I\u2019m like an animal, wanting to give her my seed make a baby.</p><p>Kissing up her neck, I bite her earlobe and lick the shell of her ear. I feel her shiver under me, and I hold her close as she tightens her legs around my waist.</p><p>\u201cSay it, little fox.\u201d</p><p>I hear her intake of breath as I plunge deeper, needing to be inside her body as fully as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Sean. Only yours.\u201d</p><p>I feel her clench around me, and I reach between us to rub her clit. She\u2019s already ready for another orgasm, and this time I want to cum with her.</p><p>Feeling her tighten on me again, I adjust the angle of my hips, letting her have every rigid inch of me.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right you are. And I\u2019m yours, Tessa. Only yours.\u201d</p><p>She clamps down on my cock, exploding into her orgasm. She clings to me as her hips jerk upward, tensing and contracting as she goes off.</p><p>Thrusting into her as far as I can go, I hold myself there as her clenches pull my own orgasm from me. I spill my seed into her welcoming womb.</p><p>I feel the smile on my face as I hold myself up on my elbows and bury my face in her neck. Nothing is sweeter or more satisfying than being inside my love.</p><p>Grabbing her hips, I roll us over so she\u2019s straddling me and lying on my chest. I can feel her trying to catch her breath as I try to catch mine, both of us spent from the quick passion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, baby,\u201d I say, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>She looks up at me and raises an eyebrow. \u201cWelcome for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just gave you a baby girl. It\u2019s what you wanted, right?\u201d</p><p>I feel her pussy pulse around me again as she starts to laugh.</p><p>I thrust into her, and her giggles turn into a moan as I lazily move in and out of her soaked cunt. \u201cWhy are you laughing, little fox? You know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to you, Sean, I never doubt a thing you say. I guess only time will tell.\u201d She pushes down on my cock, moving with me, then sits up to take all of me.</p><p>I hold her hips, rocking her back and forth on my cock, getting as deep as I can go.</p><p>\u201cYou love me, little fox?\u201d I never get tired of hearing her say how much I mean to her, and I don\u2019t suspect I will.</p> <p>Pushing her gorgeous auburn hair out of her face, she looks down at me and smiles. \u201cI love you, Sean.\u201d</p><p>I sit up and kiss her neck, needing my mouth on her. \u201cStealing you was the best decision I ever made.\u201d</p><p>I feel the vibrations of her laugh against my lips, and I smile, too. It sounds crazy saying it out loud, but I\u2019ve never once regretted it. Taking Tessa and bringing her to the island and making a family has been more than I could have ever dreamed of.</p><p>She\u2019s given me a life I don\u2019t deserve, and I spend my days worshiping her and taking care of our son.</p><p>One day I\u2019ll tell him the truth about what I did and how we came to be here. He deserves to know when he\u2019s older, but not today.</p><p>No, today is for making love to my perfect goddess and creating a new life inside her. Today, like every day, is for happiness. Today I hold my angel in my arms and tell her over and over how beautiful she is and how lucky I am that she chose me.</p><p>Even if I never gave her a choice.</p><p>THE END </p> </body></html>"]
