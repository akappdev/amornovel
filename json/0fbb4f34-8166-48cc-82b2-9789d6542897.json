I\u2019d learned how to wield a sword, how to bluff a monster, how to fall, and how to get back up.</p><p>Perhaps most of all, I\u2019d learned about loyalty. And based on the magic that was pouring through the House\u2019s first-floor hallway, I hadn\u2019t been the only one who\u2019d taken that particular quality to heart.</p><p>Dozens of Cadogan\u2019s vampires stood in the hallway outside the office of our Master, Ethan Sullivan, waiting for a call, for a word, for a plan. We stood in our requisite Cadogan black with our katanas at our sides because Ethan\u2014our Liege and my lover\u2014was preparing to run.</p><p>\u201cOut of one fire and right into another,\u201d said the attractive blond vampire beside me. Lindsey was a member of Cadogan\u2019s guard corps and a skilled and capable fighter, but tonight she looked, as usual, more like a fashionista than a century-old vampire guard. She\u2019d left her suit jacket downstairs and had matched her satin-striped black tuxedo pants with a white button-down and four-inch stiletto heels.</p><p>\u201cDo they actually think we\u2019d just let them take him?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat we\u2019d let them arrest him\u2014our Master\u2014right there in front of the House?\u201d</p> <p>An hour ago, a Chicago Police Department detective\u2014fortunately, one of our allies\u2014had come calling, advising us that the city\u2019s prosecutor had obtained a warrant for Ethan\u2019s arrest.</p><p>Ethan had killed Harold Monmonth, a powerful vampire from Europe who\u2019d murdered two human guards before turning his sword on us. Ethan had acted in obvious self-defense, but violence had recently rocked the Windy City. Its citizens were afraid, and its mayor, Diane Kowalcyzk, was looking for someone to blame. She\u2019d apparently managed to bring the prosecutor to her side.</p><p>That\u2019s why Ethan was sequestered in his office with Luc, the captain of Cadogan\u2019s guards, and Malik, the House\u2019s second in command, making a plan.</p><p>Detective Jacobs suggested Ethan seek refuge with the Breckenridges, a family of shape-shifters who lived in Loring Park, a suburb outside Chicago. That meant he\u2019d also be outside the mayor\u2019s jurisdiction. The Brecks were \u00fcber-wealthy, well connected, and politically influential. That was a powerful combination and enough, we hoped, to keep the mayor from using him as a sacrificial lamb.</p><p>Papa Breck, the family patriarch, was a friend of my father, Chicago real estate mogul Joshua Merit. I\u2019d gone to school with some of the Breckenridge boys and had even dated one of them. But the Brecks had no love for vampires, which was part of the reason for the closed-door negotiations.</p><p>Ethan was the other reason. He was nearly four centuries old, and he had the stubbornness to match his age. Going gently into that good night wasn\u2019t his style, but Luc and Malik wanted him safely away. It had been a long winter for the House\u2014including Ethan\u2019s premature demise and resurrection\u2014and we didn\u2019t need any more drama. We certainly didn\u2019t trust Kowalcyzk and feared turning Ethan over to a justice system that seemed to be rigged against us.</p> <p>The door had been closed for an hour. Voices had been raised, and the disagreement between Ethan and his soldiers spilled tense magic into the hallway. That was my particular point of contention. I was Cadogan\u2019s Sentinel, but I hadn\u2019t been allowed in the office. The words \u201cplausible deniability\u201d had been thrown around\u2014right before the door had been shut in my face.</p><p>\u201cThe mayor knew there\u2019d be trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cThe CPD already said Ethan acted in self-defense. And we just handed McKetrick to them on a silver platter. The city has absolutely nothing to complain about where we\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>The detective\u2019s warning had come only hours after we\u2019d managed to prove McKetrick, the city\u2019s now former supernatural liaison, was the source of the riots that had spread violence, destruction, and fire around the city. You\u2019d think that would have put us in the mayor\u2019s good graces. Alas, no.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t stay away forever,\u201d I said. \u201cJacobs wouldn\u2019t have warned us if he didn\u2019t think they were serious. And that doesn\u2019t give us many options. Ethan flees, or we have to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever their next move, the House will be ready,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cWe just have to scoot Ethan out of here.\u201d She checked a delicate gold watch. \u201cNot much time before sunrise. This is going to be close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa Breck could still say no,\u201d I pointed out, wrapping my arms around my knees. He and Ethan were different sups, but equally stubborn.</p><p>But Lindsey shook her head. \u201cNot if he\u2019s smart. Arresting a vampire for a bullshit reason isn\u2019t far from arresting a shifter for a bullshit reason. If Papa Breck doesn\u2019t take a stand now, he\u2019ll put the Pack at risk. But if he does take a stand?\u201d She clucked her tongue. \u201cThen he wins, double or nothing. We\u2019ll owe him a favor, and he\u2019ll have stood up to Kowalcyzk. That reinforces his power, and it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could finish, the office door opened.</p> <p>Luc and Malik emerged, Ethan behind them. All three were tall and bore the toughened shoulders of men in charge, but the physical similarities ended there.</p><p>Luc had tousled blond-brown hair and preferred snug jeans and well-worn boots to Ethan\u2019s and Malik\u2019s exquisite suits. Since Ethan\u2019s welfare fell under his jurisdiction, Luc\u2019s ruggedly hand- some features were tight with concern.</p><p>Malik had cocoa skin, closely cropped hair, and pale green eyes that thoughtfully took in the hallway of vampires. Malik was reserved, careful, and unquestionably respected by the House. But like Luc, he also didn\u2019t look thrilled with the circumstances.</p><p>And then there was Ethan.</p><p>He was built like an athlete\u2014long and lean, with taut muscles and a body that fit perfectly into his trim black suit. His hair was straight, shoulder length, and golden, framing a face so gorgeous it might have been sculpted by a master artist. Straight nose, honed cheekbones, lush mouth, and eyes as sharp and green as flawless emeralds. Ethan was as alpha as they came, protective and pretentious, intelligent and strategic, and stubborn enough to match me well.</p><p>We\u2019d had our false starts, but we\u2019d finally found a clear path to each other. That might have been the biggest miracle of all.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s forehead was pinched in concern, but his eyes gave away nothing. He was the Master of our House; he didn\u2019t have the luxury of self-doubt.</p><p>A dozen vampires jumped to their feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be traveling to the Breckenridge estate,\u201d Ethan announced. \u201cCadogan vampires do not run. We do not hide. We do not scurry into the dark. We face our problems\u2014head-on. But this House has been through much of late. I have been asked, for the sake of the House, to consider making myself scarce. I have agreed to do so\u2014as a temporary measure.\u201d</p><p>The tension in my chest eased, but not by much. He clearly wasn\u2019t thrilled with the plan.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019ll try to put this ugly business to bed. The House\u2019s lawyers will address the warrant. Malik has a friend in the governor\u2019s office, and he\u2019ll reach out to determine if the governor can encourage Mayor Kowalcyzk to act reasonably.\u201d</p><p>That was news to me, but then again, Malik was the quiet sort. And I didn\u2019t think he was the type to call in a political favor unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take Merit to the Brecks\u2019?\u201d Lindsey asked.</p><p>\u201cAssuming she can fit it into her schedule,\u201d he said.</p><p>Drama or not, there was always time for snark in Cadogan House.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d I assured him, \u201calthough I hate to leave my grandfather here.\u201d</p><p>My grandfather was Chicago\u2019s former supernatural liaison\u2014emphasis on the \u201cformer\u201d\u2014but he and his employees, Catcher Bell and Jeff Christopher, still helped the CPD with supernatural issues. Because he\u2019d helped us investigate the riots, McKetrick had targeted him. Grandpa\u2019s house had been firebombed, and he\u2019d been caught in the explosion. He was recovering, but he was still in the hospital. He\u2019d been more of a father to me than my actual father, and although he had people to protect him, I felt guilty leaving while he was out of service.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check in on him,\u201d Luc promised. \u201cGive you updates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cwe\u2019ll leave shortly. Malik has the House. And as you know, he makes a very capable Master when I\u2019m . . . indisposed.\u201d</p><p>There were appreciative chuckles in the crowd. It wasn\u2019t Malik\u2019s first rodeo as Master; he\u2019d held the job when Ethan hadn\u2019t been among the living.</p><p>\u201cI will be honest. This may not work. We are betting that Diane Kowalcyzk is politically ambitious enough to not cross the Breckenridge family. That gambit could prove incorrect. Either way, our relationship with the city of Chicago could get worse before it gets better. But we are, and we will remain, Cadogan vampires.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow, a habit he used frequently and usually with good effect. \u201cOf course, those Cadogan vampires should be at work right now, not eavesdropping outside their Master\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Smiling and appropriately chastised, the vampires dispersed, offering good-byes to their Liege as they passed. Margot, the House\u2019s brilliant chef, squeezed my hand, then headed down the hallway toward the kitchen.</p><p>Malik, Luc, Lindsey, and I stepped inside Ethan\u2019s office. He looked over his staff.</p><p>\u201cWe have a brief reprieve,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cbut the city may come knocking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe House is ready,\u201d Luc said. \u201cLakshmi, however, is still on her way. We couldn\u2019t convince her to delay.\u201d</p><p>That was another sticky situation. Cadogan was no longer a member of the Greenwich Presidium, the organization that ruled North American and Western European vampire houses. Monmonth had been one of its members. The GP was no friend of Cadogan House, and they apparently weren\u2019t willing to ignore the fact that we were now responsible for the deaths of two of their members. While we were no longer concerned about their opinion of us, they made powerful and dangerous enemies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lakshmi, one of the remaining GP members, was traveling to Chicago to render its verdict. It probably helped that she was one of the more commonsensical members of the GP, but it was odd that she was traveling while Darius West, the GP head, stayed under the radar in London. He\u2019d been a political nonentity since an attack by a vampire assassin relieved him of his confidence, or so we surmised.</p><p>As it turned out, Lakshmi also was a friend to the Red Guard, the secret organization that kept watch on the Houses and their Masters. I was a new member, partnered with the guard captain from Grey House, Jonah. Lakshmi had provided insider information about GP shenanigans; in return for her help, I\u2019d offered an unspecified favor. It was inevitable she\u2019d attempt to collect; vampires were particular that way.</p><p>\u201cKeep her out of the House,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t members of the GP, and she has no business in our domain. She may have a legitimate claim to reparations, but that can be dealt with when we\u2019ve dealt with the city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spoke with Lakshmi\u2019s majordomo,\u201d Luc said, \u201ctried to winnow information out of her. She wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it when we deal with it,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cThis entire situation is fraught with hazard.\u201d</p><p>Malik nodded. \u201cIt all comes down to who blinks first.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyes flattened. \u201cWhatever happens, Cadogan House will not blink first.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>We lived in Chicago, which meant off-street parking spots were hard to come by and the objects of envy. The House\u2019s coveted underground parking lot was accessible through the basement, so we headed downstairs. Ethan keyed the security pad at the door and stepped inside the basement but, when the heavy door closed behind us, dropped his duffel and grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, voice heavy with desire. He didn\u2019t wait for my response, but caught me by surprise, his mouth on mine, his hands at my waist, suddenly insistent.</p><p>I was nearly out of breath when he finally released me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I barely managed to ask.</p><p>Ethan brushed a lock of hair behind my ear. \u201cI had need of you, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me,\u201d I assured him with a smile. \u201cBut at the moment, we have need of speed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot your best work,\u201d he cannily said, but he put a hand on my cheek and gazed into my eyes as if he might discover the world\u2019s secrets there. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous about leaving,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe was asleep when I called. He\u2019ll understand\u2014he always does. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to ask him to be understanding.\u201d</p><p>Ethan kissed my brow. \u201cYou are a good granddaughter, Caroline Evelyn Merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. But I\u2019m trying.\u201d Sometimes, that was the best a girl could do.</p><p>I gestured toward the gleaming silver bullet that sat in the House\u2019s visitor spot, the antique Mercedes roadster Ethan had bought for me from the Pack leader himself. She was sweet and perfectly restored, and I called her Moneypenny. She was also still registered in Gabriel\u2019s name, which seemed a better transportation option than taking Ethan\u2019s car. But since he had decades\u2019 more driving experience than me\u2014and we were in a hurry\u2014I held out the keys.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p> <p>Ethan\u2019s eyes widened with delight. He\u2019d been attempting to buy Moneypenny for years and had probably wanted to slide behind the wheel for even longer.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to run,\u201d he said, taking the keys from me, a spark jumping across our fingertips as they brushed, \u201cwe might as well escape in style.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes that was the best a vampire could do.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS</p><p>That the Breckenridges had money was undeniable when one was facing down their palatial estate in Loring Park. Chicago was a metropolis bounded by water on one side and farmland on the other. Loring Park managed to fit itself just outside the latter, a fancy suburb of rolling green hills a simple train ride away from the hustle of the Second City.</p><p>Loring Park itself was a small and tidy town, with a central square and pretty shopping centers, the area newly developed and decorated with dark iron streetlights and lots of landscaping. A winter carnival had even set up shop in a parking lot, and residents undoubtedly sick of winter were trundling around amid the games and handful of rides. It would be months before green would peek through the flattened brown grass, but the snow was nearly gone. It had been a strange winter in northeastern Illinois\u2014the weather veering back and forth between frigidly cold and practically balmy.</p><p>The estate was located a few miles outside the city center on the crest of a long, rolling hill. The house, with turrets and windows and several wings of rooms, was modeled after Biltmore and was surrounded by rolling hills of neatly manicured grass; the back lawn sloped gently down into a forest.</p><p>As hidey-holes went, it wasn\u2019t a bad option.</p><p>We pulled the car up to the door, covered by a stone arch, and got out, gravel crunching beneath our feet. The night was dark and moonless; the air was thick with wood smoke and magic.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d A tall, dark-haired man burst through the door, and a wave of prickly, irritated magic followed him like a cresting wave. He was broad shouldered, and he came out with arm raised, pointing an accusing finger at us. \u201cYou want to let those bloodsuckers stay here? In our home?\u201d</p><p>The accusing gaze and shoulders belonged to Michael Breckenridge, Jr., the oldest of Papa Breck\u2019s sons. He was in his thirties now, but he\u2019d been a football player in his youth, and he hadn\u2019t lost the muscle, or apparently the testosterone. He was the expected heir of Breckenridge Industries and the family fortune, and he evidently had a temper. Papa Breck was going to need to keep an eye on that.</p><p>Michael Breckenridge, Jr., I silently told Ethan, using the telepathic connection between us.</p><p>Charming, was his reply. He was even sarcastic telepathically.</p><p>\u201cBe polite to the guests,\u201d said another voice in the doorway.</p><p>The man who stood there was tall and lean, with dark hair that waved over his forehead and a glint in his steely eyes. This was Finley Breckenridge, the second oldest of the Breck boys. There were two others\u2014Nick, the one I\u2019d dated, now a journalist, and Jamie, the youngest.</p><p>I guessed Finley and Michael had been in the middle of a disagreement regarding their father\u2019s decision to let us stay.</p><p>\u201cGo back inside, Finn,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>Finley took another step outside, hands tucked casually into the pockets of his trousers, but his eyes were cool, his body taut, ready for action.</p><p>\u201cIt concerns the family,\u201d Finley said. \u201cAnd it concerns Pop, who\u2019s already made his position clear.\u201d</p><p>Michael stalked toward us. Being good security, I shifted to block his path to Ethan. He stopped, glared down at me. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>His tone was laced with hatred, and the magic that spilled off his body was downright contemptuous. The threat began to speed my blood, but I kept my voice calm. We were guests, after all. Welcome or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that,\u201d I said, forcing a light smile. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Michael.\u201d</p><p>His jaw twitched, but he took a step back. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, lifting his hands in the air like a cornered criminal. \u201cBut when they fuck up everything, I won\u2019t hear a word from you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped around me and stalked off around the house, leaving the scent of expensive cologne in his wake.</p><p>Ethan glanced back at Finley, brow raised.</p><p>\u201cApologies,\u201d Finley said, walking forward with a hand outstretched, ready to play peacemaker. He and Ethan shook hands, both of them obviously appraising the other.</p><p>\u201cFinley Breckenridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire who made Merit,\u201d Finley said. The statement was a challenge, poorly disguised by curiosity and a smile that didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI initiated the change,\u201d Ethan confirmed. \u201cI saved her from an attack, and I made her immortal. I find she has no complaints.\u201d His tone was mild, his expression unperturbed. If he was irritated by the question, he wasn\u2019t going to let Finley see it.</p><p>Finn flicked a glance at me. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Merit. If not under these circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, the most I was willing to offer considering the attitudes. \u201cI take it Michael\u2019s not thrilled we\u2019re staying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael and the old man disagree on various things,\u201d Finn said, gaze falling on the point where Michael had disappeared into the darkness. \u201cIncluding having vampires in residence.\u201d</p><p>Their timing impeccable, liveried staff in dark pants and short jackets emerged silently from the house, took our bags and keys, and whisked Moneypenny down the driveway.</p><p>How very upstairs/downstairs, Ethan said.</p><p>My father would be jealous, I agreed. Although my grandfather had been a cop, my father was obsessed with money. Perhaps not surprisingly, he was very good friends with Papa Breck.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we be staying?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe carriage house. You got permission from the big man to stay, but he drew the line at your being in the house.\u201d Finn gestured toward the gravel walk, which led around the house to a series of secondary buildings.</p><p>Ethan looked unimpressed with our demotion from the main house, which did ring of supernatural pettiness. But we were here because we didn\u2019t have a better option. I thought it was best not to look that particular gift horse (shifter?) in the mouth.</p><p>The carriage house was a small brick building, its sides marked by dark green shutters around the windows that had once been doors for cars or carriages. The building was just behind the main house, completely invisible from the road and the driveway. The carriage house might have felt like an insult to Ethan, but it would be a secure location to spend a few quiet nights on the lam. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finn pushed a key into the lock and opened the door. \u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><p>The invitation wasn\u2019t strictly necessary\u2014that particular bit of vampire myth was actually myth\u2014but we preferred not to trespass.</p><p>The carriage house had been outfitted like a small apartment, with hardwood floors, colorful furnishings and d\u00e9cor, and a ceiling striped by large oak beams. There was a sitting area and a small kitchenette, and a door that led to what I guessed was a bedroom. The Brecks hadn\u2019t spared any expense on the d\u00e9cor. Books and orchids were arranged just so on a coffee table, knickknacks placed here and there, one wall covered in a mix of line drawings and paintings in gilded frames.</p> <p>\u201cPop uses the place for visiting board members,\u201d Finn said, stepping inside and surveying the living room, hands on his hips. \u201cKitchen\u2019s stocked with blood and food, so you should find everything you need here.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to a keypad beside the door. \u201cThe entire house is rigged to the security system, which is hooked up to the main house. There\u2019s also an intercom in case you run into trouble.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around, didn\u2019t see a back door. \u201cIs this the only door in and out?\u201d</p><p>Finn smirked. \u201cYes. And I see Nick wasn\u2019t kidding\u2014you really are a vampire fighter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night long,\u201d I said, gesturing toward the windows. \u201cWhat about those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Finn pressed a button on the keypad. Segmented plates descended across the windows, covering them completely. With those guards in place, we\u2019d be safe from sunlight and marauders.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Finley,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cWe appreciate your family\u2019s thoughtfulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Nick\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Ethan tightly said, \u201cwe appreciate his thoughtfulness. And with all due respect, as we have amply demonstrated, your family has no reason to be hostile toward us.\u201d</p><p>Finn\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not hostile toward Merit. I\u2019m hostile toward you. I don\u2019t know you, except that you\u2019ve embroiled her in a world that\u2019s worrying her father and put her grandfather in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>The attitude was irritating, as the facts were wrong. My grandfather had been Ombudsman before I\u2019d become a vampire, and I wouldn\u2019t have become a vampire without my father\u2019s meddling. Not that Finley needed the details.</p> <p>\u201cWe all make our own choices,\u201d Ethan said, his smile thin and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cSo we do. A suggestion?\u201d</p><p>Ethan lifted his brows, as Finley slid his glance to the sheathed katanas in our hands.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to leave the weapons here. They don\u2019t exactly scream \u2018friendship.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He walked back to me, concern in his eyes. He held out the set of keys, which I took, our fingers brushing. He might have played polite, but he was as angry as Michael. He spilled magic into the air, sending an electric thrill across my fingers.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded, not sure what to say.</p><p>With that, he opened the door and disappeared into the night.</p> <p>\u201cWell, they are just delightful,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>I snorted, then walked over and locked the front door. I was responsible for Ethan\u2019s safety, after all. Not that a dead bolt would do much good against a sustained attack. I didn\u2019t think SWAT teams, paranormal or otherwise, would drop down on us during the daylight, but I suppose that was a risk we\u2019d have to take.</p><p>\u201cHas Michael always been that aggressive?\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at Ethan, who\u2019d pulled off his suit coat and draped it on the back of a nearby chair. \u201cActually, yes. When we were younger and I spent summers here, Nick and I, sometimes Finn, would play together in the woods. Michael never played at anything. I mean, he participated in football, but it wasn\u2019t a game to him. It was a battle. He\u2019s always had a very serious demeanor. And it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s loosening up with old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes are challenging for everyone,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s taken some supernaturals longer than others to realize and accept that. It\u2019s easier, I think, for them to name us enemies rather than consider the possibility they\u2019re surrounded by millions of humans who\u2019d easily wish them dead.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a comforting thought. Especially since it\u2019s undoubtedly true.\u201d I was sure we had human allies\u2014those who didn\u2019t judge, those who were fascinated by our differentness, those who longed for our fame. But we\u2019d been coming face-to-face with mostly the haters recently.</p><p>Ethan glanced around the apartment, gestured toward the open doorway. \u201cBedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually have no idea.\u201d I\u2019d spent a lot of time at the Breck estate as a child, but I\u2019d never ventured into the carriage house. Why bother, when there was an entire mansion to explore?</p><p>I followed him through the door, found he was right. It was a small bedroom, with tall, exposed-brick walls. A bed covered in white linens and a buffet of pillows in shades of blue and green sat in the middle of the room, the head covered by a canopy of wispy tulle that draped romantically over the sides.</p><p>\u201cLike the world\u2019s weirdest bed and breakfast,\u201d I muttered, dropping my bag onto the bed. There was an old-fashioned alarm clock on the bedside table and a copy of Cosmo. I hoped it had been left by a former guest and not a member of the Breck family who hoped to give me and Ethan a particularly exciting evening.</p><p>There was a small bathroom on the other side of the room. Pedestal sink, black-and-white-checkered floor, shower large enough for three. Very pretty, down to the monogrammed guest towels.</p><p>When I peeked back into the bedroom, Ethan stood with one hand on his hip, the other holding his phone as he reviewed his messages with a narrowed gaze. He looked more like the head of a Fortune 500 company than a Master vampire on the lam, but I wasn\u2019t complaining. Ethan might have been cunning, funny, brave, and generous . . . but he was also undeniably eye candy.</p><p>Tall, lean, and imperious, he\u2019d been my enemy, and he was the opposite of the man I\u2019d thought I\u2019d grow to love. I\u2019d expected to fall for a dreamer, a thinker, an artist. Someone I\u2019d meet in the coffeehouse on a weekend with a satchel full of books, a pair of hipster glasses, and a tendency to quote Fitzgerald.</p><p>Ethan preferred Italian suits, vintage wine, and expensive cars. He also knew how to wield a sword, or two of them. He Mastered the House, and he\u2019d killed vampires by his own hand. He was infinitely more complex and difficult than anyone I might have imagined.</p><p>And I was more in love with him than I\u2019d imagined was possible. Not just infatuation. Not just lust. But love\u2014complex and awe inspiring and utterly frustrating.</p><p>Nearly a year ago, I thought my life was over. In reality, it was just beginning.</p><p>Ethan looked up at me, frustration fading to curiosity.</p><p>\u201cSentinel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cGo back to your domineering. I\u2019m just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly domineer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made several lifetimes of domineering.\u201d I gestured toward his phone. \u201cAny news from Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll is quiet on the eastern front,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>We could hope all we wanted. Unfortunately, hope rarely deterred humans with a grudge against vampires.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Much like he had in the rest of the building, Papa Breck hadn\u2019t spared any expense in the bedroom. The bed was soft and undoubtedly expensive. The linens were silk soft\u2014and probably just as expensive. Not that a twin-sized bed in a cold room was bad when you got to fall asleep beside a very sexy blond vampire.</p><p>We unpacked and undressed and prepared for the day ahead. I ensured the windows were covered, then messaged Catcher to check my grandfather\u2019s condition.</p><p>ASLEEP, Catcher responded. AND WELL CARED FOR. YOUR FATHER SPARED NO EXPENSE.</p><p>He rarely did. If I couldn\u2019t be with my grandfather, at least I knew he was getting the care he needed.</p><p>I also messaged Jonah, my RG partner, to let him know we\u2019d made it safely to the Brecks\u2019 house.</p><p>YOU\u2019RE RUINING ALL OUR RG FUN BY HANDLING THESE THINGS.</p><p>IT\u2019S NOT BY CHOICE, I assured him. DRAMA FINDS CADOGAN HOUSE.</p><p>SO I SEE.</p><p>I made him promise to tag me if there was trouble.</p><p>YOU\u2019LL BE IN THE FIRST FIVE, he cheekily promised.</p><p>\u201cBusiness?\u201d Ethan asked, as I sat on the edge of the bed, one leg curled beneath me, the phone in hand.</p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d I said, fingers finishing my equally snarky good-bye.</p><p>Ethan growled, a manly display meant to remind me he still wasn\u2019t thrilled about my ties to the tall, auburn-haired, and handsome guard captain.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my partner,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve already consented to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of what he is, Sentinel. Just as I\u2019m aware of what you are to me.\u201d</p><p>The sun peeked above the horizon only seconds before Ethan\u2019s hands were on me, stripping me of clothing and inciting my body to flame. His mouth enveloped mine, then my neck, my breasts, my bare stomach, before he extended the length of his body over mine and chained my wrists above my head with his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he said, with a wicked spark in his eyes that sent a thrill down my spine.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own me,\u201d I reminded him, arcing my body just enough to prove the point.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed, his lips so soft, playing at the edges of my breast. \u201cWe own each other. I am your Master. And you are my Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>He wasted no time; I hadn\u2019t needed any. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, plunging inside me, plundering my body, demanding everything I had to offer, and then more.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled, as pleasure bloomed across my body like a living thing, as cold as ice and as hot as fire, emptying my mind and soul of anything but Ethan. His mind, his soul, his body, and the word he murmured over and over again.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said, each word a promise, a declaration, a thrust. \u201cMine,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, passion riding him as it had me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said, kissing me with such ferocity I tasted blood, the magic rising between us as he thrust fiercely and groaned like an animal as pleasure swamped him.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said, softly now, and pulled my body into his. The sun rose, and there in the darkness of a borrowed room, we slept.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>We awoke to riotous noise\u2014pounding on the front door that had both of us shooting upright. The sun had only just dipped below the horizon again, but not quite far enough along to pull us from sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name?\u201d Ethan asked, his voice still slumber slurred, his hair more surfer than moderately pretentious Master vampire.</p><p>The pounding sounded again. Someone was in a hurry.</p><p>Ethan moved to climb off the bed, but I stopped him with a hand. \u201cGet dressed. I\u2019ll see who\u2019s there first. Luc will kick my ass if I let yours get kicked.\u201d I had a bad feeling this was going to be one of those nights on which I really, really wished I could sleep in and defer being an adult for a few more hours.</p><p>I pulled on Ethan\u2019s shirt from the night before and buttoned it up. It wouldn\u2019t do as protective armor, but there weren\u2019t enemies at the door, at least not of the CPD variety. I\u2019d tempered my own katana with blood and magic, which left me sensitive to the presence of steel and guns. I didn\u2019t sense any outside.</p> <p>Now draped in tailored and expensive menswear\u2014only the best for our Master\u2014I trundled back into the living room. Ethan\u2019s katana was propped beside the door; I\u2019d taken mine to bed, just in case. I picked it up and took a cautionary peek through the peephole . . . and found a shifter on our stoop.</p><p>\u201cOpen up, Kitten. I know you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door; a cold breeze lifted goose bumps on my bare legs.</p><p>He stood in the doorway, six feet and some-odd inches, all muscle and wolfish energy. His hair was tawny and gold tipped, and it reached his shoulders in shaggy waves. His eyes were amber colored and, at the moment, swirled with amusement.</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d said Gabriel Keene, the Apex of the North American Pack. He gave me an up-and-down perusal. \u201cI trust I\u2019m not interrupting anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping,\u201d I managed, crossing my arms over my chest. \u201cWe were sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan stepped behind me, chest bare, buttoning jeans. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain you know precisely what you were interrupting.\u201d</p><p>Gabe smiled broadly, revealing straight, white teeth. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now, since you\u2019re both awake. Get your asses dressed. We\u2019ve got business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Ethan arched an eyebrow, his favorite move. \u201cWhat business? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for the Pack, just as you are.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grunted. \u201cWe\u2019re here because Papa Breck made us pay for the privilege.\u201d</p><p>I slid Ethan a glance. He hadn\u2019t mentioned a payment to the Brecks. And that information would have been good to know before we put our fate\u2014before I put his fate\u2014in their hands.</p><p>\u201cHe made you pay,\u201d Gabriel said, \u201cbut not for the privilege you think. That money was an admission fee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Ethan asked.</p> <p>\u201cFor the Greatest Show on Earth,\u201d Gabriel said with a smile that could only be described as wolfish. \u201cIt\u2019s the first night of Lupercalia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Lupercalia?\u201d I asked, in spite of myself. I should have been ducking back inside, but I found the name\u2014and Gabe\u2019s appearance at our door\u2014intriguing.</p><p>\u201cOur annual NAC festival,\u201d Gabe said, \u201cand has been since Rome\u2019s founding. Three nights in late winter to call spring to rise, to celebrate our animals, our connections to the woods, to the world.\u201d</p><p>That explains Michael\u2019s animus, Ethan silently said. He wouldn\u2019t want us here for that.</p><p>Part of it, maybe. But I\u2019d bet Michael hadn\u2019t cared for vampires before we\u2019d arrived, and wouldn\u2019t like us any more when the festival was over.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d Gabe said, \u201cyou\u2019re our guests. Among others.\u201d He stepped aside, revealing two sorcerers and a shifter behind him. The sorcerers were my best friend, Mallory Carmichael, and Catcher, her boyfriend. Mallory had been disgraced by bad deeds, but Gabe had adopted her for rehabilitation.</p><p>Mallory and Catcher were bundled against the cold in jeans and boots. Hers were fawn colored and knee high over skinny jeans. Her blue hair, darker at the tips, lay straight on her shoulders.</p><p>Catcher stood beside her, wearing his typically dour expression. His hair was shaved, his eyes sparkling green, his mouth lush. He was partial to snarky T-shirts, but I couldn\u2019t tell if he wore one beneath his coat.</p><p>Jeff was the final member of the trio, my grandfather\u2019s employee and favorite white-hat hacker. Granted, he was the only computer hacker I actually knew in person, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d have been my favorite anyway. Tonight he\u2019d traded in his usual uniform\u2014khakis and a button-down shirt\u2014for jeans, boots, and a rugged outdoor jacket. His light brown hair was tucked behind his ears, and he wore his usual smile\u2014friendly, with touches of bashful and goofball.</p><p>\u201cSullivan,\u201d Catcher said with a bob of the head, then answered Ethan\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cWe\u2019re here for Lupercalia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to participate,\u201d Jeff said, a blush in his cheeks as he dutifully managed not to stare at my legs.</p><p>It was great to see them, but if they were here, my grandfather was down two guardians.</p><p>They must have seen the worry in my eyes. \u201cYour mother and father limited your grandfather\u2019s visitors today,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cThey want him to rest. So we\u2019re out of a job there.\u201d</p><p>Jeff wiggled his phone. \u201cAlthough we did manage to sneak in a panic button, just in case. He can reach us immediately if there\u2019s any problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d I said with a smile, relieved that they\u2019d thought of it.</p><p>Of course, I was still standing half naked in the doorway of a shifter\u2019s carriage house, my hair undoubtedly ruffled by sleep and sex. Throw in a college math class I\u2019d somehow forgotten to attend, and I was revisiting my recurring nightmare.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you doing here?\u201d I asked Mallory, smoothing a hand down the front of Ethan\u2019s shirt to ensure no important parts were leaked to the public.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to practice,\u201d Mallory said.</p><p>Part of Mal\u2019s rehab was figuring out how she could use magic productively. A little more Luke, a little less Anakin. She\u2019d made progress during our anti-McKetrick brigade, and it looked like the Pack was giving her another opportunity to try.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s expanding her understanding of magic,\u201d Gabriel added. \u201cWhat it is, what it isn\u2019t, what it can be.\u201d</p><p>Mallory smiled prettily and held up two bottles of Blood4You, the bottled blood that most vampires drank for convenience, and a bag from Dirigible Donuts, one of my favorite Chicago foodstuffs. (To be fair, it was a long and distinguished list.) \u201cI have a consolation prize for your humiliation.\u201d She gave me an up-and-down look. \u201cI\u2019d say two to three raspberry-filled donuts should do it.\u201d</p><p>I stood there for a moment, cheeks flushed in embarrassment, toes freezing from exposure to the cold, my friends confident I\u2019d be mollified with nothing more than a bag of jelly donuts.</p><p>\u201cJust give me the damn thing,\u201d I said, bowing to their expectations and snatching breakfast. But I gave them all a deadly look before stalking back to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that we\u2019ve satisfied your bodyguard,\u201d Gabe said to Ethan behind me, \u201cwe\u2019ll just come in and make ourselves comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>As it turned out, raspberry-filled donuts were an exceptional way to soothe humiliation.</p><p>I\u2019d emptied a bottle of blood and devoured two of the donuts before Ethan came back inside, a bundle of red fabric in hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you saved one of those for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI better have,\u201d I said. \u201cShe bought a dozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand by what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get any with that attitude. What\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, gesturing toward the fabric.</p><p>\u201cApparently someone in the Pack decided they wanted swag,\u201d Ethan said, unrolling two T-shirts, cardinal red with what looked like a retro ad for a bar called Lupercalia, the name in old-fashioned letters above two wolves toasting with beer steins at a pub table.</p><p>\u201cThey actually made T-shirts,\u201d I said. \u201cGabriel okayed that? It seems very . . . public.\u201d The public knew shape-shifters existed, but the Packs still tended to keep to themselves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d guess this was a do-it-and-apologize-after-the-fact scenario,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cThese are for us to wear. Gifts from the Pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChilly for February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll allow you to layer, Sentinel.\u201d He held out a hand for the bag of donuts, but I didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWere you going to tell me we had to pay the Brecks?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flattened. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of managing the House\u2019s financial affairs, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest you weren\u2019t. But I also don\u2019t like being blindsided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a business transaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was protection money,\u201d I insisted, and from the flash in his eyes, he knew it, too.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care to advertise that fact, Sentinel. But I\u2019d have told you.\u201d</p><p>He must have seen the doubt in my eyes, because he stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019d have told you,\u201d he said again. \u201cWhen we had a moment to discuss it. As you\u2019ll recall\u201d\u2014he tugged gently at the first button on the shirt I wore\u2014\u201cyou were very distracting last night.\u201d</p><p>Ethan was still shirtless, and he stood at the edge of the bed, washboard abs and a trail of blond fuzz peeking above his jeans\u2019 top button. Heat rushed me as he moved in for a kiss, and my eyes drifted shut.</p><p>But he sidestepped me, grabbed the bag, and pulled out a donut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDistracting?\u201d I asked him, offering a dubious look.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and pastry,\u201d he said, swiping a drop of raspberry jam from the edge of his mouth. The urge to lick it away nearly silvered my eyes.</p><p>He rolled down the top of the bag and placed it on a side table, then pulled on his Lupercalia T-shirt. The flat plane of his abdomen rippled as he moved, and I didn\u2019t even bother to pretend not to look.</p> <p>When he was done dressing, he cocked an eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m just enjoying the show.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, snatched up the second T-shirt, and swatted me with it. \u201cGo get dressed, or Catcher, Jeff, Mallory, and Gabe are going to suspect more than dressing is going on in here. Again.\u201d He put his hands on the bed on each side of my body and leaned in. \u201cAnd although I have definitive plans for you, Sentinel, they do not involve the lascivious imaginations of the sorcerers and shifters presently outside that door.\u201d</p><p>He touched his mouth to mine\u2014soft and promising, his lips berry sweet.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Ten minutes later, I was dressed in my Lupercalia T-shirt, a long-sleeved T-shirt beneath it for warmth. I wore two pair of socks against the cold, boots, and jeans, and put my long, dark hair into a high ponytail. I pulled on my leather jacket, a gift from Ethan to replace the one torched in the fire that injured my grandfather, and tucked a small and sleek dagger into my boot. The Pack wasn\u2019t likely to appreciate my bringing a katana to a shifter festival, so I\u2019d have to rely on the dagger if anything went amiss. And since I was heading out with a refugee vampire, two rogue sorcerers, and a family of shifters who hated vampires, I presumed \u201camiss\u201d was pretty likely.</p><p>I was dressed and ready for action. But before I turned my attention to the Pack, I had one final bit of business. I\u2019d missed checking in on my grandfather yesterday, so I dialed the hospital and requested his room.</p><p>\u201cThis is Chuck,\u201d he answered.</p><p>I smiled just from the sound of his voice. \u201cHey, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl! It\u2019s good to hear your voice. I understand you\u2019re in a bit of a pinch.\u201d</p><p>Relief swamped me. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I\u2019d wanted to talk to him\u2014or how much guilt had settled in when I hadn\u2019t been able to make it happen.</p> <p>\u201cA misunderstanding. I\u2019m sure Mayor Kowalcyzk will come around eventually.\u201d And if she didn\u2019t, hopefully Malik could convince the governor to intervene. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken. I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d I cheerily said, but I had to push back the memory of my grandfather huddled beneath debris. I made sure my voice was steady before I spoke again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I always thought you\u2019d be a teacher. You love books and knowledge. Always did. And then your life changed, and you became part of something bigger. That\u2019s your job, Merit. That something bigger. And it\u2019s okay that you have to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>There was mumbling in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s time for what they generously refer to as \u2018dinner\u2019 around here,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cCall me when you\u2019ve got things in hand. Because I know you\u2019ll get there eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>I found the crew in the living room, chatting collegially.</p><p>\u201cMerit,\u201d Catcher said, sitting beside Mallory on the couch, an arm around her shoulders. Their relationship had hit the rocks when Mallory turned to the dark side, so the casual affection was a pleasant development. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you clothed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now that she is,\u201d Gabriel said, standing, \u201cwe should get moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, exactly?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>\u201cTo a land beyond space and time,\u201d Jeff said drawing an arc in the air. \u201cWhere the rules of mortals have no meaning.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked up at the ceiling as if he might find patience there. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Brecks\u2019 backyard. Into the woods, right here in Illinois, where most of us are quite mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlli-noise,\u201d Jeff said with cheeky enthusiasm. \u201cBecause the wolves will howl.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head but clapped Jeff on the back good-naturedly. \u201cSettle yourself, whelp. We haven\u2019t even gotten started yet.\u201d</p><p>I had a sense they weren\u2019t going to settle themselves anytime soon. And since I was playing bodyguard, I took it upon myself to act like one. If we\u2019d be staying on the Brecks\u2019 property, we\u2019d be as safe (as we\u2019d ever been) from Mayor Kowalcyzk\u2019s troops. But that didn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019d be safe around the Pack. Not if they shared the Brecks\u2019 attitude.</p><p>\u201cDoes the Brecks\u2019 protection extend to the woods? And the rest of the shifters?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled at me. Keenly. \u201cIf you\u2019re here, Kitten, you\u2019re safe. That goes for both of you. Frankly, most Pack members don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about politics in Chicago. And even if they did, they aren\u2019t going to choose a bullying politician over friends of the Pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got your back, Mer,\u201d Jeff said with a wink, earning a dark look from Ethan.</p><p>The shifters and sorcerers filed into the night, but Ethan stopped me with a hand. \u201cDagger?\u201d he quietly asked.</p><p>\u201cIn my boot,\u201d I said. Vampires usually preferred not to employ hidden weapons, but these were special circumstances. \u201cYou don\u2019t share Gabe\u2019s confidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe knows what he has planned. I do not. We have allies, certainly. Him, Jeff, Nick. A Pack member would have to be, as you might say, wicked ballsy to commit treachery under Gabriel\u2019s nose.\u201d We\u2019d seen it before, and with unpleasant consequences. \u201cBut clearly many of the shifters aren\u2019t fans of vampires, and like Michael, they won\u2019t be glad to see us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never say \u2018wicked ballsy.\u2019 But I take your point.\u201d And I hoped we hadn\u2019t escaped Diane Kowalcyzk only to fall into a new kind of drama. But in case we did: \u201cYou\u2019re armed, too?\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cA blade, like yours. A matched set,\u201d he added with a smile, tugging on the end of my ponytail. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand into mine but, when we started toward the door, glanced down at my booted feet.</p><p>\u201cColor me surprised, Sentinel. Your shoes appear to be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cIt was icy that night, so I wore galoshes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith couture. Very expensive couture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Chicago in February. I made a practical decision. And I pulled it off.\u201d</p><p>Only to have him carry me to my parents\u2019 threshold and fake a marriage proposal on one knee. So I\u2019d managed to avoid falling in stilettos\u2014but had still nearly had a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Mallory said, peeking into the doorway. \u201cI believe we\u2019re waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, stepping outside as Ethan followed behind me. \u201cJust debating the finer points of fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly vampires,\u201d Gabriel muttered, and moved forward into the darkness.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>LONE WOLF</p><p>The night was cold but uncommonly still. No wind at all, which was a blessing in Chicago in February.</p><p>With Gabriel in front, the frozen ground crunching beneath our feet, we played follow the leader around the house and toward the estate\u2019s back lawn. It dipped down to the woods, which made a dark curtain at the edge of the visible world, a black sea beneath a blanket of stars. They twinkled above us, cold and unfeeling, and a sudden ominous shiver went through me.</p><p>Sentinel? Ethan silently asked, taking my hand.</p><p>I squeezed in response and dismissed my fear. I wasn\u2019t a child; I was a vampire. A predator, and with allies around.</p><p>\u201cDark out here,\u201d Mallory said with a nervous laugh ahead of us, hand in hand with Catcher.</p><p>\u201cCould be worse,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cYou could be a vampire on the lam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d I said. \u201cAlthough it certainly does make for interesting bedfellows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better be your only bedfellow, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho could possibly replace you?\u201d I asked, grinning when Mallory looked back and winked. A twinge of nostalgia went through me. That was the camaraderie I\u2019d missed, something we\u2019d begun to lose when the supernatural drama had grown between us.</p><p>As we descended the hill toward the tree line, a breeze blew toward us, and there was magic in it. Fresh and peppery and hinting of animals.</p><p>We stepped onto the dirt path that led into the woods, ground that I\u2019d trod many times before. The trail where Nick and I had played as children had been cleared and widened, allowing access for adults.</p><p>There was movement to the left. Nick Breckenridge emerged from a side trail in front of Mallory and Catcher, a woman behind him, their hands linked together. He was dark and tall, with closely cropped hair and rugged features. With his snug shirt, cargo pants, and strong jaw, he looked every bit the journalist, albeit one more used to war zones and exotic locations than tramping through the woods of a multimillion-dollar estate.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t look familiar. I knew Nick was dating someone\u2014or at least that a woman had answered his phone a few nights ago\u2014but I didn\u2019t know if she was the one. She had the self-assured bearing of a shifter, but if she had magic, she hid it well.</p><p>\u201cMerit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met Yvette.\u201d</p><p>Yvette nodded.</p><p>\u201cMerit and I went to high school together,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she said, and they disappeared into the darkness ahead of us.</p><p>Mallory moved back to me and linked an arm in mine, displacing Ethan as my hiking partner.</p><p>\u201cI think you just got jealous,\u201d she whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous. But I am more than \u2018a girl he went to high school with.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cWhat did you want him to say? That you\u2019re the girl he\u2019s pined over since he made the regretful decision to break up with you in high school? Which was ten years ago, I\u2019ll point out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, drawing out the word to emphasize just how silly that thought was. \u201cBut maybe something along the lines of, \u2018This is Merit, sentinel of Cadogan House, protector of the weak, defender of the innocent\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Let me know when the Avengers come calling. In the meantime, while he does have a very curvy Yvette, you have an Ethan Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wise beyond my years.\u201d</p><p>The trail narrowed, and we fell into a silent, single-file line, the skeleton trees standing sentinel around us. The woods were draped in winter silence, the native creatures sleeping, hibernating, or deliberately avoiding the train of predators. The woods were deep, and I\u2019d been back as far as a hedge maze that I thought was somewhere to my right. But it was dark and the trail was pitched, and I wasn\u2019t entirely sure of my direction.</p><p>We followed the trail for ten or fifteen more minutes, until the woods opened, revealing a large meadow surrounded by glowing torches.</p> <p>The clearing was at least the size of a football field, and in the middle stood a twenty-foot-tall totem, animals carved in a trunk at least four feet thick. Tents, campfires, and folding chairs were sprinkled here and there. And everywhere, shifters milled, most in the official black leather jackets of the North American Central.</p><p>Scents filled the air. The fur and musk of animals, charcoal, roasting meat, earth. There was life here. Renewal and rebirth, even though spring was still weeks away.</p><p>I guessed that was why the Brecks hadn\u2019t wanted us here. Shifters could take care of themselves, certainly, but there were a lot of families in the open space, and tents wouldn\u2019t be easy to defend. On the other hand, they were, like us, on private property held by one of the most powerful families in Chicago. That was a point in their favor.</p><p>Gabriel left us at the edge of the wood, walking to his wife, Tanya, who stood in the clearing with their infant son in her arms. Tanya was a lovely brunette, a woman with smiling eyes and pink cheeks, her softness a contrast to Gabe\u2019s tawny ferocity. Gabe put a paternal hand on Connor\u2019s head and pressed a kiss to Tanya\u2019s lips. She beamed up at him, the love between them comfortable and obvious.</p><p>Jeff found Fallon, Gabriel\u2019s younger sister. They\u2019d been on-again, off-again for a time, but considering the warmth of their embrace, I guessed they\u2019d made \u201con\u201d a little more permanent. Fallon was petite, with a sturdy, athletic body and wavy hair the same sun-kissed color as Gabe\u2019s. She preferred black clothing and tonight wore knee-high motorcycle-style boots, a short skirt, and an NAC leather jacket.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know Fallon very well, but I knew Jeff, and there weren\u2019t many I respected as much as him. If he loved her\u2014and the look in his eyes made clear that he did\u2014then she was good people.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>\u201cNow or never,\u201d Ethan said, taking my hand as we stepped forward into the meadow and into the fray.</p><p>Shifters chatted in camp chairs, watching cautiously as we passed. Others hurried around us with steaming food or boxes of gear. Someone nudged my elbow, and I turned to find a squatty woman with freshly bleached hair standing behind me, a foil-wrapped bundle in her hands. It was as large as a newborn baby and smelled of meat and chilies.</p><p>She looked me over, shook her head in disappointment, and thrust the package at me.</p><p>I nearly grunted under the weight. It was as heavy as a newborn baby, too.</p><p>\u201cHello, Berna,\u201d I said.</p><p>Berna was a shifter, a relative of the Keene family, and the bartender at Little Red, the Pack watering hole in Chicago\u2019s Ukrainian Village neighborhood. She was convinced I didn\u2019t eat enough and enjoyed plying me with food. Since I enjoyed eating, we\u2019d managed to stay friends of a sort.</p><p>She looked at Ethan and winged up her pencil-drawn eyebrows suggestively. \u201cHello, man,\u201d she said in her sturdy Eastern European accent.</p> <p>\u201cBerna,\u201d Ethan said politely, eyeing what I guessed was a baby-sized burrito. \u201cNothing for me?\u201d</p><p>Without even blinking, Berna yanked the package from my hands and offered it to Ethan.</p><p>\u201cIs family recipe. You will eat. You\u201d\u2014she looked him over, from blond hair to booted feet\u2014\u201cshould remain strong. Handsome.\u201d</p><p>I think I just won Berna, he silently said, and nodded gravely at her. \u201cThank you, Berna. I\u2019m sure this will be delicious.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, as if offended by the mere possibility it wouldn\u2019t be delicious, but her eyelashes stayed batty, and her gaze didn\u2019t stray much from his face.</p><p>\u201cI guess we aren\u2019t getting anything,\u201d Catcher muttered behind us.</p><p>\u201cSo these are the vampires?\u201d</p><p>A shifter stepped beside Berna\u2014a woman who was taller and thinner, with a short shock of platinum blond hair. She was muscled and rugged, her features better described as handsome than pretty. And she all but vibrated with irritated magic.</p><p>\u201cTwilight,\u201d Berna confirmed, pointing at me and Ethan. \u201cGrumpy,\u201d she said, pointing around me at Catcher.</p><p>She looked at Mallory for a few seconds before offering judgment. \u201cMagic,\u201d she finally said with the smallest of smiles, and it was obvious she meant the word as a compliment.</p><p>Mallory beamed, but Berna\u2019s friend was not impressed.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said, pointing at each of us in turn and flinging magic with each movement. It left a sting like tiny insects. \u201cThis isn\u2019t any of your business, and it isn\u2019t for you.\u201d She stuck her nose into the air, slid Berna a narrowed look. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t carouse with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were invited here,\u201d Mallory said. I think she might have put an arm around Berna, except that Berna had already puffed out her chest and was nearly buzzing with irritation.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said, flicking her hands at the woman. \u201cGo elsewhere. Too negative.\u201d</p><p>But Berna\u2019s dismissal only seemed to encourage the woman.</p><p>\u201cMark my words,\u201d she said, that finger pointed again. \u201cThis is all doomed because we didn\u2019t go home when we could have. We should have left Chicago months ago, and we certainly shouldn\u2019t be here now. The Keene family should have been removed a long time ago. They are leading us right into disaster.\u201d Her eyes flashed with self-righteous anger. That emotion seemed to be in unusually strong supply among shifters lately.</p><p>She walked away before Berna could respond to the slight, joining up with two other women who gave us suspicious looks. But Berna\u2019s balled fists made it clear she\u2019d had words in the hopper.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve met Aline.\u201d Gabriel joined us, made a point of putting a hand on Ethan\u2019s shoulder. Aline and her troop of friends didn\u2019t seem impressed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a charmer,\u201d Ethan dryly said.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been keeping her locked away?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>\u201cShe keeps herself locked away,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cShe and my father butted heads and she\u2019s transferred that hatred onto our generation.\u201d</p><p>Berna patted his arm collegially. \u201cYou are not popular, but you are doing right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Gabriel said, \u201cbut I\u2019d prefer to be both.\u201d He towered over Berna and glanced down at her from his couple of extra feet. \u201cWe ready?\u201d</p><p>She made a sound that made clear exactly how ridiculous she thought the question. Berna, apparently, was always ready.</p><p>Gabriel smiled. \u201cMy fanged friends, you\u2019re about to be witness to a very special treat. Tonight, you get to hear us roar.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and unleashed a howl that sent shivers down my spine\u2014and invoked the rest of the chorus. Not all shifters were wolves, and the Pack\u2019s sounds were just as varied and cacophonous. Howls, screeches, feline roars, and screams that might have been from birds of prey. Together, as the shifters formed a circle around the totem in the middle of the meadow, they lifted their voices and sang into the night, the very sound magic.</p><p>Goose bumps lifted on my arms. Ethan slipped his hand into mine as we shared the sight and sound of it. After a moment, the howls quieted, now a backbeat instead of a melody.</p><p>Gabriel looked at Mallory appraisingly. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath with pursed lips, then loosened her shoulders and nodded, this time confidently. And although nervousness still fluttered in the air around her, it was a good kind of nervousness. Excited anticipation\u2014not the resigned dread I\u2019d sensed before.</p><p>Side by side, they walked forward into the circle and stood in front of the totem. A hush fell over the crowd.</p><p>I glanced at Catcher. His expression was blank, but his eyes fixed on Mal and the shifter at her side. If he was nervous for her, he wasn\u2019t showing it.</p><p>His hair pushed behind his ears, Gabriel looked more like a biker or boxer than Pack Apex, the king of his people, but there was no doubt in the set of his shoulders and grave expression that he stood as leader of them all.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he said, hands on his hips, \u201cwe celebrate the Pack, the mothers, the sires. We celebrate our founding, our brothers, Romulus and Remus, and our future. We celebrate the wild things. We have voted to remain in the realm of humans and vampires. That decision was not unanimous, but it was a decision to stay, to join, to bind together with our brothers and sisters and become stronger in the binding.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Mallory. \u201cThere are those among us who have erred, deeply and significantly. Who have wounded the world and broken themselves. The worst of them lose themselves in their errors. The best of them crawl back, one foot at a time, and seek to amend their breaches. That is the way of the brave.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looked back at the crowd. \u201cThis woman knows only of the magic of sorcerers and vampires. Tonight, we sing to her of the rest of it. Of the truth of it. Of the magic the earth has to offer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel reached out his hand. After sucking in a breath, Mallory linked her fingers with his. She closed her eyes as magic began to spill out and through the shifters again. I closed my eyes and savored the hot rush of raw, unmitigated power. It was the life force of the earth, called up by the predators who gathered together to celebrate their community.</p><p>And then it transformed.</p><p>Mallory must have unlocked some magical gate of her own, because a new stream of magic\u2014younger, greener, brighter\u2014began to mix with the magic of the Pack. Her hair lifted like an indigo halo, and her lips curled into a smile of satisfaction and contentment. Of relief.</p> <p>Together, the magicks swirled and danced around us, invisible but tangible, like an electric breeze. This wasn\u2019t defensive or offensive magic. It wasn\u2019t used to gather information, for strategy or diplomacy, or to fight a war against a supernatural enemy.</p><p>It simply was.</p><p>It was fundamental, inexorable. It was nothing and everything, infinity and oblivion, from the magnificent furnace of a star to the electrons that hummed in an atom. It was life and death and everything in between, the urge to fight and grow and swim and fly. It was the cascade of water across boulders, the slow-moving advance of mountain glaciers, the march of time.</p><p>The shifters moved around the circle, grabbing our hands and pulling us in, connecting us to the magic. Magic flowed between us like we were transistors in a circuit, connecting the shifters to one another and us to them. We moved in concentric circles around the center totem, heat rising until the air was as warm as a summer\u2019s day, until sweat beaded on my forehead.</p><p>This magic was lustful, almost drowsy with sensuality, and I felt my eyes silver and my fangs descend in an answering call. This was the magic of feasting and fucking, of savoring the blood of a kill and calling the Pack to dine.</p> <p>Mallory\u2019s eyes were open now, her hair damp with sweat, her body shaking with power, but her hand was still linked to Gabriel\u2019s, and she smiled with more contentment than I\u2019d seen from her in months.</p><p>A year ago, I\u2019d assumed my relationship with Mallory would continue just as it always had\u2014that we\u2019d be friends who shared silly inside jokes, griped about our jobs, dreamt about our futures.</p><p>And then I became a vampire, and she discovered she was a sorceress.</p><p>Our lives were never going to be the same. They would never be as simple, as predictable, as they had been those years before. Instead, they\u2019d be overlain by our responsibilities, by our strengths, and by the burdens we undertook because of them.</p><p>For the first time, I realized that was okay.</p><p>Our friendship wasn\u2019t limited to habits, to circumstances, to neighborhoods. We were friends because we were connected together, because something in our souls called to each other, understood each other. That connection, that spark between us, would remain even if our lives had changed completely. I hadn\u2019t accepted that before.</p> <p>I could accept it now.</p><p>I searched for her in the circle so I could let her know that I finally understood, that I\u2019d come to terms with it. But I moved so quickly, my feet dancing to keep up with the shifters beside me, that I couldn\u2019t get my bearings, couldn\u2019t find her in the crowd.</p><p>Something strange flitted in my chest. A pinprick, sharp and uncomfortable. Not tangible, but a hidden note of magic. A bit of the current that wasn\u2019t meant to soothe or celebrate but to incite.</p><p>I tried to ignore it, thinking I was just being paranoid, that the quantity of magic was triggering some protective instinct.</p><p>But I feared that wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019d felt magic before\u2014many varieties, many flavors\u2014even mixed into the current tonight. This was different. Panic began to bloom like dark roses.</p><p>The hand on mine tightened, as if the shifter at my side had felt my wavering fear.</p><p>I looked for Ethan, found him five yards away, eyes closed as he swayed in time with the shifters around him.</p><p>I pulled my hands free, breaking the circle and pushing through bodies to get closer, to put him in reach in case my fear was real.</p> <p>Ethan, I told him. Stay where you are. I\u2019m coming for you.</p><p>Sentinel, he said, obviously surprised. What\u2019s wrong?</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to answer, because I\u2019d been regrettably correct.</p><p>The sky blackened as a thick, dark cloud began to spin above us, angry with sound and magic. The shifters stopped, the furious dance coming to a stumbling halt as they, too, cast their gazes on the threatening sky.</p><p>\u201cA storm?\u201d someone near me asked.</p><p>I moved forward until I reached Ethan, grabbed his wrist. But he didn\u2019t even look at me. He stared at the sky as it broke open, revealing the truth of the cloud.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the forerunner of a storm, but an attack.</p><p>All hell broke loose.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>GHASTLY, GRIM, AND ANCIENT</p><p>They looked like the harpies of Greek and Roman mythology. Bodies of pale, thin women. Massive wings, the feathers so deeply black they gleamed like velvet. They were naked but for their long hair\u2014straight and black, with thin braids tied throughout\u2014and their silver, crested helmets. Supernatural battle armor, I feared, as they spun above us like a supernatural tornado, blotting out the stars, the magic that accompanied them fierce and unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I yelled over the rising din, adrenaline beginning to rush through me. \u201cNobody told me harpies existed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine nobody knew it until today,\u201d he said, pulling a dagger from his boot and gesturing for me to do the same.</p><p>When the dagger was in hand, I looked for Gabriel. He stood a few yards away, shouting orders and sending his own sentinels in various directions. He and Mallory exchanged a glance, and I saw him weigh the choices, the decision.</p><p>He made the call and nodded at her and, I guessed, authorized her use of that magic he\u2019d been so careful to train up. Catcher had no such hesitation. He\u2019d gone to Mallory, grabbed her hand, was already pointing into the air, discussing what looked like strategy.</p><p>Gabriel unleashed a bloodcurdling yell, a call to arms. Light erupted across the clearing as shifters changed into their animal forms, the transition as stirringly magical as their ceremony had been. Changing into animal form was rough on clothes, so some shifters disrobed before they shifted, leaving shirts and pants in piles on the ground, ready and waiting for when it was time to shift back.</p><p>The smaller creatures, pairs of sleek red foxes and coyotes, ran quickly for the shelter of the woods. The larger animals prepared to fight: the Brecks\u2014big cats; the Keenes\u2014big wolves. I recognized Gabriel\u2019s great gray form as he sprung into existence.</p><p>Jeff, a shockingly large white tiger with deep gray stripes, appeared beside him and roared with fury enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck. Fallon stayed in human form, a hand on Jeff\u2019s back, perhaps to remind both of them that they fought together.</p><p>Ethan was beside me, dagger in hand, poised for action. I had the urge to drag him into the trees to keep him safe. But he tossed the dagger back and forth in his hands, his history as a soldier peeking through his eyes, which were fixed on the harpies and flat with concentration. He wasn\u2019t leaving now.</p><p>The swarm of creatures descended, growing larger as it sunk toward us. I watched them fly for a moment, circling around the meadow but avoiding the trees\u2014and the torches that lined them.</p><p>Suddenly, they let out a horrific scream as sharp as nails on a chalkboard and dive-bombed the clearing like dogfighting World War II planes.</p><p>What had been a celebration . . . became an unexpected battlefield.</p><p>The shifters who remained on the field weren\u2019t afraid of battle, and many of them leaped, meeting the harpies in the air. The human portions of their bodies might have been thin, but harpies were strong. Some overbalanced, hitting the ground in a tumble of fur and feathers that shook the earth; others batted away the shifters with a dip of wings that sent wolves flying.</p><p>A harpy spied us, the only vampires on the field, dropped her head, and dove toward us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions,\u201d I yelled to Ethan over the din.</p><p>\u201cStay alive!\u201d he offered back, blading his body toward the harpy, limiting her access to vital organs. I did the same, moving closer beside him so we were a combined vampiric weapon, immortal and strong, although my heart raced like life was a delicate and fragile thing.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know anything about harpy anatomy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lick, Sentinel. But they look like ladies to me!\u201d</p><p>A lot of help he was.</p><p>The sound was ferocious now, the beat of her wings as loud as a jet plane, sending gusts of air across the field. She was close enough that I could have seen the whites of her eyes, if she\u2019d had any. Her eyes were solid black; regardless the shape of her body, they carried no visible trace of thought or humanity.</p><p>She extended her arms and scratched out her claws, their tips aimed at our necks. We dropped to the ground, her smell\u2014pungent and sour\u2014streaming past as she flew above us.</p><p>\u201cShe did not get perfume for Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Ethan surmised, spinning to watch her bank and turn back for a second shot. The width of the harpies\u2019 wingspan helped them rise and fall quickly, but their turn radius was substantial. It took seconds for her to spin back in our direction, but only a moment for her to dip again. She\u2019d learned the mistake of her first effort and, instead of swiping at us on the move, came straight for us and didn\u2019t veer.</p><p>We hit the ground, rolling away in different directions to avoid the claws on her feet, which were as black and sharp as those on her hands.</p><p>She decided to follow me. I was on the ground, a few feet away from the spot where she\u2019d fallen to earth, and it wasn\u2019t far enough. She followed and scratched, talons raking at my arms and abdomen with vicious effectiveness.</p><p>The claws had looked pointy and sharp, but they were jagged like serrated knives, and they tore at flesh instead of slicing through it. They were weapons of destruction. She scraped my face, and the skin burned like fire beneath her nails.</p><p>Fear turned to fury, but it took me a moment to remember the dagger in my hand, and I thrust it upward again and again, the knife bouncing off bones I couldn\u2019t see, hitting no true target but causing enough of a painful nuisance that she backed off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere!\u201d Ethan yelled, pivoting back and forth behind her to let me get to my feet.</p><p>I stood, adrenaline numbing the cuts I\u2019d already received, and wiped the dagger\u2019s handle, slippery with the harpy\u2019s wine-dark blood, on my pants. The smell of it was just as pungent as the rest of her body, more like vinegar than the penny scent of human blood. Even for a vampire, there was nothing appealing about it.</p><p>She turned on Ethan and flapped forward only a few feet off the ground.</p> <p>That, I thought, was my chance. If flying was her advantage, I\u2019d have to take it away from her. And I only needed gravity for that.</p><p>Distract her! I silently told Ethan. He obeyed, weaving back and forth as she tried to follow him, her wings too large for quick maneuvers.</p><p>While she focused on him, I dropped . . . and lunged for her ankles.</p><p>She screamed out, bobbing in the air as she fought off my weight, kicking at the vampire who\u2019d become her uninvited (and literal) hanger-on. But I held tight, sinking my face into the curl of my arm to avoid the barbs at the tips of her wings, which were as jagged and sharp as her nails.</p><p>Gravity won, and the harpy pitched forward, taking me with her. I hit the ground, rolling quickly to avoid her frantically beating wings, but she kicked out and hit me square on the left cheekbone, which cracked and sang with pain strong enough to bring tears to my eyes.</p> <p>As she rose again, I uttered a curse that would have had my prickly mother swatting my bottom in horror, and tried to climb to my feet but found the ground swayed a little. I made it to my knees, nearly retching from the sudden vertigo.</p><p>The harpy slammed to the ground beside me, her black eyes open, a thin line of blood trickling from the corner of her mouth, and a bloody wound across her neck, pale sinew and bone peeking through skin.</p><p>The sight didn\u2019t help my dizziness, and I sat firmly on the ground again. I looked up to find Ethan standing over her, hands and dagger bloodied, eyes green and fierce. There were streaks of blood and scratches across his face, and worse across his shirt.</p><p>He crouched in front of me, looked over my face. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. She got my cheek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bruise is already showing,\u201d he said, offering a hand and helping me to my feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say. But it doesn\u2019t make the punch feel any better.\u201d</p><p>A voice rose behind us. \u201cLittle help here!\u201d</p><p>We glanced across the meadow, found Catcher and Mallory twenty feet away, lobbing blue orbs of light at a pair of harpies who easily avoided them, swiping at their heads as they bobbed overhead. The sorcerers looked tired; their font of magic wasn\u2019t endless, but required recharging. They both looked wan and sweaty, like they\u2019d need the recharging soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cStay here until you\u2019re balanced again.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d have argued if I could have, but he was already on his way to Mallory and Catcher.</p><p>Before I could join him, a wolf was beside me, nudging my leg. I glanced down. It was Gabriel, his wolf form enormous, his haunches nearly reaching my waist. And although he was undeniably animal\u2014from thick fur to the tang of musk\u2014there was something very human in his eyes.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>He nudged my hand again. Odd, because it wasn\u2019t like Gabriel to turn his back on a fight. And why would he be afraid?</p> <p>The thought struck me with cold dread. Tanya, also a wolf, could have shifted. But Connor was only an infant; I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if infants could shift. And in any case, she\u2019d have to carry him away.</p><p>\u201cTanya and Connor,\u201d I said, and he yipped in agreement.</p><p>We ducked to avoid the tips of claws and wings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them out of here and into the woods,\u201d I promised. \u201cKeep Ethan out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to find Tanya and Connor, I warned Ethan, who\u2019d already reached Mallory and Catcher and was joining his dagger to their efforts. Please keep yourself safe.</p><p>I . . . intend . . . to, he haltingly responded, between his own evasive maneuvers.</p><p>I ducked and ran to the highest point in the meadow, a spot near the tree line on what I guessed was the southern side of the field, in order to scan the battlefield. Most of the shifters had actually shifted, but there were still some who I guessed found it easier to fight this particular enemy in human form. Tents were crumpled to the ground and fluttering wings obscured the view. If I was going to find them, I was going to have to run for it.</p><p>It was like an obstacle course, but instead of paintballs, giant naked women dropped from the sky with daggerlike claws. That wasn\u2019t nearly as romantic as it sounded. I darted from one tent to the next, looking for any sign of the queen of the Pack and the heir to the throne. But I found nothing.</p><p>I made it to a tree stump, dropped beside it as I scanned the part of the field closest to me. I saw nothing but fighting, harpies apparently intent on wiping out the Pack in one fell swoop. And I\u2019d traversed only a third of the meadow.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d I murmured, cupping my hands around my mouth and screaming into the night, \u201cTanya!\u201d</p><p>I strained to hear a response but heard only the yips of injured shifters and the squeals of pissed-off harpies.</p><p>\u201cTanya!\u201d I tried again. And this time, I heard an answering call.</p><p>\u201cMerit!\u201d</p><p>The cry was too low to be close, but it was enough to signal her direction. I ran to the next obstacle, then the next, and finally found her crouched on the ground beside the totem, which now lay on its side in the middle of the clearing, sheltering her son with her body.</p><p>There was no fear in the magic that swirled around her, just a sense of determination. She was a mother, and she would protect her son, regardless the cost.</p><p>I ran toward her, put the dagger back in my boot, and extended a hand. \u201cLong time no see.\u201d</p><p>She smiled just a little. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is quite the party Gabriel had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope not,\u201d I said, \u201cor he\u2019s a horrible planner. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I twisted my ankle. Tripped over something in the field.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get to the woods. The harpies can\u2019t fly through the trees.\u201d</p><p>Tanya nestled Connor in the crook of one arm, nodded, and grabbed my hand with her free one to pull herself upright. She bobbled a bit on her left foot but stayed upright.</p><p>My arm around her back, I scanned the sky, gauged the distance between the shelter and the trees, and prepared to run. If I could just wait for them to begin the rotation away from the woods, we\u2019d have a few seconds to make a run for it.</p><p>A metallic screech rang out above us. We crouched as a harpy flew only a foot above our heads, sending Connor into a fit of tears.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d I told her, trying to drown out the noise and the fire and the scent of blood and the snow of molted black feathers that fell from the sky.</p><p>The harpy banked and turned and gave us our chance.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d I yelled, and we took off at our stumbling pace.</p><p>She made it ten awkward yards before stumbling forward, nearly pulling me down with her. But I managed to stay on my feet and keep an iron grip on her waist. I kept her upright and she found her balance again, but her ankle wobbled beneath her. Shifting into her wolf form would allow her to heal, but we didn\u2019t have time for that.</p><p>The piercing scream rose behind us, and I risked a glance over our shoulders. The harpy had seen us, and she\u2019d turned our way.</p><p>Tanya tried to release my grip. \u201cTake Connor. Run for the woods. Keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>A nervous laugh bubbled up. \u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m not going to leave you here for the world\u2019s angriest chickens. We do this together.\u201d I pulled her free arm around my shoulder and put my arm back around her waist, tilting my body to take more of the weight off her ankle. Together, the sound of thwushing wings behind us growing louder with each step we took, we hobbled to the tree line.</p><p>The hair rose on the back of my neck. Gods, but this is going to be close.</p><p>\u201cFaster!\u201d I said, sucking in oxygen as we raced the last twenty yards, then ten, pulling her toward the trees with all the strength I could muster.</p><p>The harpy dipped, and time seemed to slow. Visions passed before my eyes, of friendships, of my nieces and nephews, of Ethan, and of the green-eyed child Gabriel had once hinted was in my future. Green eyes I wouldn\u2019t get a chance to see if we didn\u2019t make it.</p><p>I pushed harder, calling up every spare ounce of effort I could find, that same determination that had driven me through all-nighters in grad school and endless hours of ballet practice. It didn\u2019t feel good, but that was irrelevant. You don\u2019t stop until the job is done, my father was fond of saying.</p><p>Tanya wasn\u2019t yet safe; my job wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>We reached the stand of winter-bare trees, and the harpy banked, wings swatting the trees on the edge of the wood, black feathers ripped out by branches floating to the ground.</p><p>I helped Tanya sit down on a fallen tree, Connor now crying fitfully. Other shifters who\u2019d taken shelter in the woods turned back into their human forms and looked out on the battle with horror.</p><p>I knelt down in front of Tanya, who tried to calm her son.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d I asked, when her gaze met mine.</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes still wide with shock. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even\u2014what are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarpies, I think. Is this a fight with the Pack? Did the Pack piss someone off?\u201d Perhaps by inviting vampires to his woods? I silently wondered, hoping this wasn\u2019t because of us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know. This is so horrible, Merit. So awful.\u201d</p><p>The bare limbs above us shook as harpies circled overhead, looking for a place to dive into the undergrowth. I pulled the dagger from my boot and stood up again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going back.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThe Pack still needs help, and Ethan\u2019s still out there. I don\u2019t quit until he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>There was bravado in my voice\u2014the kind of bluffing I actually could manage\u2014and it masked the fear. My allies were engaged in battles of their own, and I had only a slim and slender dagger to take down a woman-bird with an attitude problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Tanya smiled at me like I\u2019d seen Gabriel smile before. Knowingly. Wisely. And with utter calm. \u201cYou can do this, Merit of House Cadogan. Go save your man.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, somehow buoyed by the sentiment, and left Tanya and her subjects in the trees. Flipping the dagger nervously in my hand, I walked back to the tree line and peered into the darkness.</p><p>She dropped to the ground in front of me, torchlight flickering across her naked body.</p> <p>She seemed, somehow, even larger on the ground. At least six feet tall, with a twenty-foot wingspan. Her eyes were solidly black, hair blowing wildly in the wind, revealing small breasts and a web of battle scars across her abdomen.</p><p>She tucked her wings behind her and moved forward, knees bent, the motion bouncy and unnatural. Harpies clearly weren\u2019t meant to run; they were meant to fly.</p><p>She opened her mouth and screamed. I winced at the aural assault and resorted to my standard defense mechanism. Sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to Hollywood with pitch like that,\u201d I advised her.</p><p>Her dark eyes flicked back and forth like a bird\u2019s, but it didn\u2019t appear she actually understood what I\u2019d said. Maybe she didn\u2019t understand English. Or finely grained sarcasm.</p> <p>Regardless, she understood battle. She attacked, vaulting forward, teeth bared.</p><p>For a moment, I was too transfixed to move. She looked like a creature from an ancient time, a warrior from an era when gods and goddesses reigned in gauzy robes and gold laurel crowns. If The Ride of the Valkyries had begun to play, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised.</p><p>I kicked, trying like I had before to get her off her feet. She avoided the shot by taking to the air, then gave back better than I had, kicking forward and hitting me square in the chest, sending me flying.</p><p>I hit the ground on my back, knocking the wind out of me. I clutched at the grass at my sides, gasping for air, as the ground rumbled beneath my feet.</p><p>\u201cUp, Merit!\u201d yelled Tanya behind me, and I reared back, then hopped to my feet, as if her words had been an order instead of a frightened suggestion. I was tiring, still healing and dizzy from my last round, adrenaline beginning to fade, and I was beginning to react on autopilot. Fortunately, I\u2019d been trained to fight beyond fear, beyond exhaustion.</p><p>Standing again, I bounced on my feet. The harpy\u2019s eyes narrowed and she moved forward again. I looked for a target, recalled how ineffective my dagger had been against the other harpy\u2019s abdomen, and picked a new target.</p> <p>If I couldn\u2019t beat the human, I\u2019d go for the bird.</p><p>I beckoned her forward, and she windmilled her claws as she moved toward me again, looking for purchase and a soft bit of flesh to tear. I swerved to the left, and she followed. Her legs moved awkwardly, and her wings provided just enough drag to make me faster than her. I dodged back to the right, and she moved back again, but slower this time . . . giving me just enough time to make my move.</p><p>Her wing brushed me as she sought to move again, and I grabbed the top of it, a long rib beneath a covering of slick and oily feathers, and stuck with my dagger.</p><p>She screamed in distress, reared back, and swung at me, but I leaped backward, flipping to avoid the shot. Her wing hung limply on one side, and I was struck with pity. I\u2019d winged my enemy but hadn\u2019t brought her down.</p><p>And she was pissed.</p><p>Faster than she\u2019d moved before, she bent her knees and jumped forward. She was on me before I could move, heavy and awkward, her mouth wide and pointed teeth aimed for my face, apparently intent on taking a bite.</p><p>\u201cEthan will not like that,\u201d I muttered, humor my last weapon against fear and exhaustion. I watched for the right moment and, when her head darted up to strike, pushed the dagger through her neck.</p><p>She arched back, screaming, hands at her throat, and pulled out the dagger, which hit the ground some feet away. I watched it roll, afraid she\u2019d come back for a second round and I\u2019d have no recourse, no protection. But blood and worse gushed from her wound, and she staggered and fell, shaking the earth beneath.</p> <p>I wiped fresh traces of blood from my face, thinking, just as I\u2019d promised Ethan, that I\u2019d heal. The harpy, unfortunately, would have no such luck.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>When I\u2019d gotten to my feet again, grabbed up my dagger, and scrubbed off blood and dirt, I took a look at the rest of the battle. Harpies still circled the sky\u2014a dozen maybe\u2014but the attack was clearly on the wane. And it would leave death and destruction in its wake.</p><p>Some shifters fought; others lay on the ground, unmoving, the scents of untimely deaths moving across the field, thrown into the air by the flap of wings. Shifters could heal themselves, but only if they shifted, and they had to be awake and conscious to do that. For some of them, it was clearly too late.</p><p>So much death, I thought, staring blankly at the carnage, trying to process it. I\u2019d fought battles before, and seen death. But rarely this much, and never all at once.</p><p>\u201cMerit.\u201d</p><p>I looked over, found Ethan a few feet away. He was dirty and blood smeared, but all limbs were intact. I nearly sagged with relief.</p><p>\u201cTanya and Connor?\u201d he asked, moving quickly nearer and looking me over.</p><p>\u201cThe woods,\u201d I said. \u201cI got them to the woods, then dealt with her.\u201d I gestured to the harpy, who looked scrawny and pitiful there on the ground, her wings folded in death.</p><p>\u201cThis is a miserable thing,\u201d he said, no little pity in his voice. \u201cLet\u2019s get back in there.\u201d</p><p>We walked back into the clearing as Gabriel finished off a harpy with a vicious bite to the neck, and we ran to his position at the edge of the battle.</p><p>Light exploded, and Gabriel burst back into human form, naked as the day he was born. There were a few scratches on his body, a result of the weird magic of shape-shifting. Although changing from human to shifter would heal injuries received as a human, it didn\u2019t work in reverse.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is tiring,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Gabriel nodded. Jeff ran up, hastily clothed, pointing at Catcher and Mallory.</p><p>\u201cThey think this is a magical attack,\u201d he said, \u201cand they think they know how to finish it with the magic they have left. But it will be big magic.\u201d</p><p>Catcher and Mallory knelt together on the ground in the center of the meadow, near the fallen totem. They held their left hands together, palms flat, and their right hands flat against the earth, as if testing it for weakness, or pulling strength from it.</p><p>\u201cMallory won\u2019t do it without your go-ahead.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked at her for a moment. \u201cWill it hurt the Pack?\u201d</p><p>Jeff shook his head. \u201cIt will be targeted at the magic itself. It shouldn\u2019t touch anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel wet his lips, nodded. \u201cIf they think they can end it, they should. Just tell us what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet down,\u201d he said, then cupped his hands around his mouth. \u201cGo!\u201d he yelled across the clearing.</p><p>As Catcher nodded at Mallory, Ethan grabbed my hand and pulled me down into a crouch.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see the magic around Catcher and Mallory, not with my eyes, but I could feel it ramping up, like the supercharged atmosphere before a storm, the air suddenly heavy and smelling of ozone.</p><p>A bubble of magic emerged from the earth, quickly encompassing the two of them, growing until it was ten feet tall, and then suddenly exploding, pulsing, like a wave through the sky.</p><p>The magic hit the birds like a bomb. They exploded into swirls of acrid black smoke. Like it was a living thing, the smoke rose into a giant, swirling column over the clearing, a cyclone of magic. It screamed with noise\u2014like the squeals of a thousand harpies together\u2014and blew tents and leaves and the rest of the bonfire to the ground in an explosion of noise.</p><p>It spun faster and faster, debris winding around and around like a children\u2019s toy, narrowing and rising farther and farther into the sky until, with a final scream of sound that made me clap my hands over my ears, the column broke apart, sending black tentacles of smoke into the sky.</p><p>The night went silent, and the smoke began to dissipate, revealing the stars once again.</p><p>We all rose again. Gabriel looked at Ethan. \u201cGet back to the house. And Catcher and Mallory, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the house?\u201d Ethan asked, his magic and body suddenly tense, making all my spidey senses tingle uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWe were just attacked, and you\u2019re the odd ones out.\u201d</p><p>We weren\u2019t shifters, he meant.</p><p>We were different.</p><p>We were suspects.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>BLOOD WILL TELL</p><p>They\u2019d undoubtedly been attacked before. They\u2019d had intra-Pack struggles, and they\u2019d overcome them. But tonight they\u2019d been attacked, without warning, by creatures that weren\u2019t supposed to exist.</p><p>This had shocked them. Unfortunately, we were on the wrong side of that shock.</p><p>We followed Gabriel silently back to the house, where Finn directed us to the kitchen.</p><p>It was large, with white cabinets and sleek black countertops, and a large kitchen island with an expensive stove and several stools for casual meals. The Breckenridges\u2019 kitchen staff, dressed in their formal black-and-white uniforms, watched us from one corner as Mallory, Catcher, Ethan, and I were directed to the center island.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Finn said, then disappeared from the room. The house staff, also shifters, but apparently on duty during the festival, stood together, arms crossed, whispering and regarding us with obvious hostility.</p><p>Ethan sat beside me, his hand protectively at my back. Catcher and Mallory took seats across from us, and the strain in her face was clear. They\u2019d interned us in the house while they grieved together, reminding us just how separate our worlds still were.</p><p>\u201cWhat will they do now?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>\u201cClean up. Mourn. Heal,\u201d Catcher said, running a hand over his shorn scalp.</p><p>Mallory looked worried and guilty, and she nibbled nervously on the edge of her thumb. I could read the fear in her face: She was the witch, the woman who\u2019d used black magic, the one they\u2019d taken in.</p><p>She\u2019d come here, and she\u2019d brought death with her.</p><p>As if reading my mind, she looked up at me and met my gaze, and the weight of her emotions made my chest clench. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I knew her again. As well as I\u2019d known her before, but now as a sorceress, tested by magic and come through the other side. I might not ever forget the past, what she\u2019d done. I wasn\u2019t a child, or naive. But I could forgive her, and we could move on and try to build something better, something stronger, than what had been before.</p><p>But still, no one spoke. I could deal with comfortable silence, but this silence was not comfortable. I broke through it, clearing my throat. Ethan, Mallory, and Catcher frankly looked relieved by the intrusion.</p><p>\u201cHarpies don\u2019t exist,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t supposed to exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain they do exist,\u201d Ethan said, glancing at Catcher. \u201cI presume from their disappearing act they were magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA manifestation of some kind,\u201d Catcher agreed. \u201cThey weren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey killed,\u201d I said. \u201cThey fought and wounded. They were real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were tangible,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t real. Not real harpies, anyway,\u201d he added at my questioning look. \u201cThey were magic\u2014power shaped and molded into something three-dimensional and solid.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced warily at the kitchen staff, then leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s how you thought to use magic to destroy them at the end.\u201d</p> <p>Catcher nodded, glancing at Mallory. \u201cShe figured it out. They fought like real animals, fiercely, drawing blood, killing when they could. But their magical signature was wrong. The look in their eyes was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlank,\u201d I offered.</p><p>Mallory looked at me and nodded. \u201cExactly. More automaton than actual monster. So we unwound them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou unwound them?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat does that mean? And use nongeeky, layman\u2019s terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a formulaic element to magic,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cIt can be a chant. A charm. A spell. Some start with that but deepen it. They layer it. Charms atop charms atop charms.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cWe took those layers, unfolded them, stripped them back to their elemental magic, and dispersed them. That spell wouldn\u2019t have worked if they\u2019d been real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this wasn\u2019t just a monster,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cIt was dozens of harpies, acting individually. Not just a walk and slap, but something with the look of a coordinated attack, and on shifter territory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWalk and slap?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>\u201cAn old European custom,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBefore the houses existed, certain feuding vampire covens engaged in petty slights, back and forth, to air their grievances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAristocratic vampire slap fights? With period costumes?\u201d Mallory asked, looking at me with obvious delight. \u201cI am all over that and the graphic novel it inspires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoordinated attacks,\u201d Catcher said, returning to the point. \u201cThe magical layering is doable, but it would have required someone powerful and very talented.\u201d</p><p>Ethan looked at Catcher for a minute. \u201cYou could have done it.\u201d</p><p>Catcher\u2019s jaw twitched at the insinuation. \u201cWith enough time, yes. Mallory, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Paige, Simon, and Baumgartner,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cCould they do it?\u201d</p><p>Paige was a magician formerly stationed in Nebraska and now in Chicago. She didn\u2019t live in Cadogan House, but she was dating the House librarian, which was close enough. Baumgartner was head of the sorcerers\u2019 union, which Catcher had been kicked out of, and Simon was Mallory\u2019s former and utterly incompetent magical tutor.</p> <p>Catcher drummed his fingers on the countertop, considering the question.</p><p>\u201cBaumgartner has the magical capacity, but he wouldn\u2019t have a reason to do it. It would upset his apple cart. Simon doesn\u2019t have the mojo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaige?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but she doesn\u2019t seem like the type. She\u2019s interested in the mathematics of magic, the history. Not so much the execution, and certainly not wholesale destruction.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sat back, drawing the attention of the kitchen staff, whose eyes narrowed suspiciously. Did they think he was plotting a revolt right here in the Brecks\u2019 kitchen? I considered flashing my fangs but guessed it wouldn\u2019t be easy to intimidate the staff of a shape-shifting family.</p><p>After a moment of silence, he glanced at Catcher. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to tell the Pack we think this was a magical attack, we\u2019re going to have to prove it, one way or the other. Talk to the sorcerers, confirm their whereabouts. If they are, as we suspect, not involved, find out who they think might have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t errand boys,\u201d Catcher testily said, lip curled.</p><p>But Ethan wasn\u2019t fazed. \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t. But we\u2019re in Pack territory, surrounded by shifters who are angry and grieving. And they have us separated and under guard. Until we prove otherwise, we\u2019re their suspects.\u201d He glanced at Mallory, and my stomach curled. \u201cAnd I imagine Mallory is suspect number one.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We were summoned an hour later, still filthy and scarred from the battle. A man in a trim suit sent us to Papa Breck\u2019s study, which had been one of my favorite rooms in the house as a child. Nick and I had stolen several summer days there, poring over antique books, inspecting mementos of Papa Breck\u2019s travels, and nabbing lemon drops from a crystal dish he kept on his desk.</p><p>Tonight, the room was dark, cigar smoke swirling in the air. Gabe sat in a leather armchair, the Keene and Breck brothers surrounding him like men at arms. Papa Breck, silver haired and barrel-chested, sat behind his desk, a cigar between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cThree dead,\u201d Papa Breck said, ashing his cigar and beginning the inquest. \u201cThree dead. Two missing. Fourteen injured.\u201d</p><p>Ethan clasped his hands in front of him, met Gabe\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for your losses.\u201d</p><p>Michael sniffed. \u201cI notice you aren\u2019t injured.\u201d</p><p>Ethan slid his gaze to Michael but didn\u2019t alter his tone. \u201cWe incurred our share of injuries, but we heal. We fought alongside you, and as you may recall, Catcher and Mallory destroyed what remained of the harpies.\u201d He glanced at Gabriel. \u201cWe also took care of your queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou showed up at our house,\u201d Papa Breck said, \u201cand all hell broke loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, we are sorry about tonight\u2019s tragedy. But you should look elsewhere for the blame, as we had nothing to do with it. Merit and I are your guests because of circumstances in Chicago. Mallory and Catcher are your guests because she is a student of Gabriel\u2019s. We fought with you against the harpies. We did not create them, nor did we lure them here.\u201d</p><p>Papa Breck shook his head, looked away. He\u2019d already decided we were guilty, and rational arguments weren\u2019t going to sway him now.</p><p>Ethan looked at Gabriel. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the obvious question: Has the Pack made any new enemies lately? Or incited any old ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always have enemies,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know of any new ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what about old ones?\u201d Michael asked, looking at Mallory. \u201cHow did you know to use magic?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think sorcerers and shifters had been enemies, but Michael didn\u2019t seem the type to be concerned with fact.</p><p>Still, Mallory stepped forward, shoulders squared against the doubt in their eyes and the fear in the room. I liked this Mallory.</p><p>\u201cTheir magic was too uniform,\u201d she said. \u201cNot even a hint of personality or distinctiveness. And their eyes were blank. Empty. We guessed\u2014correctly as it turned out\u2014that someone wound the magic to create them. Layered magic to create the harpies,\u201d she said, when the shifters looked confused. \u201cWe unwound it. That\u2019s what blew them apart.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel bobbed his head, considering. \u201cThat was good work.\u201d</p><p>But Michael snorted. \u201cIf they knew how to stop it, why didn\u2019t they stop it earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d All eyes turned to Catcher, whose loathing was barely masked. \u201cAre you seriously suggesting we knew what was going on and just let it continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Michael asked, pleading with Gabe. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised me to see him drop to his knees in supplication. \u201cThis was magic, and they have magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Gabriel challenged, leaning forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cWhat, precisely, would you have me do, Michael? String them up for coincidentally having magic? And even if they didn\u2019t stop it soon enough, would you have me kill them for that? As far as I\u2019m aware, you didn\u2019t fight at all.\u201d</p><p>Michael paled. \u201cI was protecting the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were protecting your own ass,\u201d Gabe said, giving him a dismissive look and his father a warning one. \u201cThe two who are missing\u2014who are they?\u201d</p><p>Papa Breck\u2019s eyes fairly bulged with shock. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly think they were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I think is irrelevant. What matters is the truth. Who\u2019s missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan and Aline,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyebrows perked with interest. \u201cAline, who doesn\u2019t like your father or your siblings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very same,\u201d Gabriel said. The look in his eyes made it clear he wasn\u2019t dismissing the coincidence.</p><p>\u201cShifters wouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d Papa Breck spat. But his voice was quiet. He disagreed with the Apex, but he wasn\u2019t going to be overly loud about it.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t know anything about who did this, except that they used complicated magic.\u201d He offered Ethan an appraising glance. \u201cFortunately, we have right in our presence a group that\u2019s pretty good at figuring those things out.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s magic spiked alarmingly, but he stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires and sorcerers maintain they\u2019re not responsible for what happened here. Considering their unique skills, they should be able to identify who is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they can\u2019t uncover who did this?\u201d Papa Breck asked, as if we weren\u2019t in the room and couldn\u2019t hear the doubt that stained his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel steepled his fingers, gazed at us through hooded eyes. \u201cThen we\u2019ll just continue to wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The sun would soon be on the rise. Gabriel dismissed us, and three shifters I didn\u2019t recognize escorted us back to the carriage house like prisoners returning to their cells. Considering the implicit threat in his final words, maybe we were.</p> <p>We\u2019d come to Loring Park to avoid prison; instead, we\u2019d found a different one.</p><p>Since we were still dirty from battle, the four of us agreed to take turns in the shower. Mallory, then Catcher, then me, and Ethan was last. They hadn\u2019t planned to stay at the Brecks\u2019 and hadn\u2019t packed bags, so I let Mallory borrow clothes, and Ethan offered replacements for Catcher.</p><p>I emerged from my turn in the bath wrapped in a towel, my skin blissfully clean of gore and dirt and probably worse, hair damp around my shoulders.</p><p>Ethan stood in the bedroom, naked from the waist up, bare toes peeking beneath his jeans. His hand was on his hip, his dirty hair framing his face. His phone was in his free hand, brow furrowed. That expression was easy enough for me to read.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced up at me, male appreciation in his eyes as he took in the towel. But exhaustion quickly replaced interest. I didn\u2019t take it personally; it had been a long night.</p><p>\u201cI advised Luc of tonight\u2019s events and asked him about the CPD. He said there\u2019s been no contact, either from the CPD or Kowalcyzk.\u201d</p><p>I moved to my duffel bag to pick out sleepwear. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a good thing. Maybe she\u2019s realized how ridiculous she\u2019s being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cLuc has given her a copy of the House\u2019s security tapes, which quite clearly show the intrusion and Monmonth\u2019s threats.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at him. I wasn\u2019t normally one to play the optimist, but we\u2019d already gone on the lam. There wasn\u2019t much else to do but wait and hope.</p><p>\u201cThat could have been enough. Maybe Detective Jacobs convinced her that pursuing you would be completely illogical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs much as I appreciate Detective Jacobs, your premise requires her to use rational thought and logic. I\u2019m not certain she\u2019s capable.\u201d</p><p>I found a tank and pajama bottoms, zipped up the duffel again. \u201cWell, if she intends to push, she isn\u2019t showing it now. We\u2019ll just have to wait until she relents or our other plans work. What about my grandfather? Any word from Luc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stable,\u201d Ethan said with a smile. \u201cAnd he despises hospital food. You have the appetite in common.\u201d</p><p>My grandmother had been an amazing cook\u2014a whiz with vegetables and salt pork\u2014and she\u2019d undoubtedly sparked the appreciation of it in both of us.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s better or worse to tell him what went on tonight. He won\u2019t need the stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must give him constant fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour material is usually better than that, Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to see just how good my material is.\u201d Ethan put the phone on a bureau and moved toward me, arms outstretched for a hug and a grin on his face.</p> <p>But he was filthy, so I hustled out of reach and pointed a warning finger at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still disgusting, and for the first time in hours, I\u2019m not. Shower first. Then affection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel mistress,\u201d he said, but disappeared into the bathroom.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I dressed while Ethan showered, grateful for a few minutes of privacy and silence. I checked in with Jonah, advised him what was up, and wasn\u2019t at all surprised by the cursing that followed.</p><p>LEADS? he asked when he\u2019d exhausted his phone\u2019s symbol keys.</p><p>NOT YET, I advised, BUT GABE HAS ASSIGNED US TO INVESTIGATE. WE FIND ATTACKERS, OR WE ARE ATTACKERS.</p><p>YOU GET ALL THE FUN JOBS, he advised. CALL IF YOU NEED HELP.</p><p>ROGER THAT. KEEP CHICAGO SAFE.</p><p>THAT WILL BE EASY, he messaged. ALL THE TROUBLEMAKERS ARE IN LORING PARK TONIGHT.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue much with that.</p><p>Ethan had emerged from the bathroom\u2014clad only in perfectly fitting jeans and scrubbing a towel through his hair\u2014when the carriage house\u2019s front door opened and closed.</p><p>My gaze on Ethan\u2019s chest, it took me a moment to recognize the sound and turn my head toward the shuffling in the other room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just check that out,\u201d I said, moving toward it while Ethan searched for a T-shirt.</p><p>Gabriel stood in the living room in front of the coffee table, arms crossed, watching as Berna and several shifters, her apparent helpers, carried in aluminum trays of food. My stomach, empty and roiling, rejoiced.</p><p>\u201cI have brought dinner,\u201d Berna pronounced, eyeing me nastily, as if there was a chance I\u2019d decline free food. My patience for shifters was growing shorter by the moment.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Berna, when have you ever known me not to eat?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem entirely satisfied with the answer, but I was saved by distraction.</p><p>Ethan walked into the room, hair still damp but fully dressed. Berna\u2019s eyes lit with feminine appreciation.</p><p>\u201cBerna brought us dinner,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat was very thoughtful of you, Berna,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cIs for health,\u201d she said, squeezing her knotted fingers around Ethan\u2019s biceps. \u201cFor muscles and teeth. Good, strong muscle. Strong. Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve got it.\u201d Gabriel smirked.</p><p>She humphed and herded her crew back to the door, but not before snapping a towel in his direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you outside,\u201d Gabriel said, closing the door when he was the only shifter left in the room.</p><p>\u201cChow time for the prisoners?\u201d Ethan asked. His voice was low, threatening, and very, very alpha.</p><p>Gabriel grunted and headed for the kitchen. While Ethan, Mallory, Catcher, and I exchanged glances, the refrigerator door opened and closed again, and the clink of glass sounded.</p><p>He walked back in with a bottle of beer in hand and looked, I realized for the first time, utterly exhausted. He\u2019d probably been playing Apex all evening, and for the festival he\u2019d planned for. Here, finally, he was with people who weren\u2019t his subjects. For a brief moment\u2014a rare moment\u2014he shook off the mantle of power and sprawled onto the couch.</p><p>\u201cThe Pack is pissed,\u201d he said, taking a drink of the beer. \u201cNo,\u201d he amended, gesturing with the bottle. \u201cThey\u2019re scared. And that\u2019s infinitely worse.\u201d</p><p>Ethan considered the admission for a moment, then took a seat on the couch across from Gabe. If you hadn\u2019t known they were Apex and Master, you might have thought them athletes relaxing after a game. Or A-list actors between scenes on a movie set. There was just something about the supernatural that brought out the best in male genetics.</p><p>Taking cues from the alphas, Mallory and I took seats as well, and Catcher followed. I sat beside Ethan, comforted by the closeness of his body and the smell of his cologne, the familiar things that brought comfort in unusual times.</p><p>That, I thought, was one of the best parts of being in a relationship. No matter how foreign the world, the landmarks, the customs, I\u2019d never be a stranger beside Ethan. Love bred the best kind of familiarity.</p><p>If, down the road, Ethan was leaving dirty socks on the floor, I might not find the familiarity so charming. But for now, it soothed with a depth that surprised me.</p><p>\u201cWe are not their enemy,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gabe said, taking another drink, the bottle slung between two fingers. \u201cBut trouble arrived shortly after you did. That coincidence isn\u2019t going unnoticed.\u201d He looked up, smiled wolfishly. \u201cIt would go a long way toward mending fences if you could figure out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t given us much choice,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve made it sound like we\u2019re guilty if we don\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdded incentive,\u201d Gabriel said with a smile.</p><p>I didn\u2019t smile back. I, for one, was sick of being manipulated by shape-shifters. In addition to being slammed in the face. At the moment, those two things were at the top of my shit list.</p><p>Gabe sat forward. \u201cLook. You\u2019re not cops, and you\u2019re certainly not on the Pack payroll. It\u2019s not your job to solve our problems. I get that. But you know how to do this.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cYou and your team have a way of figuring these things out. You\u2019re better at it than I am, even if I had the time. But I\u2019ve got colleagues to mourn, a Pack to watch over.\u201d He paused. \u201cI need the help, Sullivan. And I\u2019m asking for it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan watched him silently, jaw clenched. He didn\u2019t like being manipulated. But he was a vampire and a Master at that, and honor was everything to him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Ethan said, resignation in his voice. \u201cBut we\u2019ll need information, starting with your theory about who orchestrated this attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone with the skills to build a hoard of harpies,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cMagic can be bought,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cBut animosity like we saw tonight grows naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur enemy list hasn\u2019t grown any deeper recently,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cYes, there are people who don\u2019t like the family, don\u2019t like the Pack, don\u2019t like shifters. But there haven\u2019t been any catalysts\u2014nothing that would have set off a night like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aline?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou said she butted heads with your father. What\u2019s the story there?\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded, glanced at me. \u201cShe had relatives\u2014cousins\u2014in the Atlantic Pack. They got into trouble\u2014got drunk, roughed up a clerk at a bodega, and stole some money. Afterward, they wanted shelter and turned to us. Aline was in favor of it, said the kids were set up. But my father didn\u2019t buy it and wouldn\u2019t allow it. He didn\u2019t want to shelter troublemakers. He told Aline about his decision, and they had a very public disagreement. She backed down, but she didn\u2019t forgive him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the cousins?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cKilled,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cThe robbery wasn\u2019t the first time they got into trouble, and it wasn\u2019t the last. They tried grift, a short con, and got caught. The vic wasn\u2019t amused, and made an example of them.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have engendered any better feelings in Aline.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWhen my father died, she rallied for another alpha to take over the Pack.\u201d He smiled, with teeth. \u201cThat particular whelp was not successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now Aline is missing,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>\u201cOr she left,\u201d I said. \u201cIt sounds like her anger\u2019s been simmering for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded. \u201cI think that\u2019s accurate. But I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s been anything recently. And I don\u2019t know of any connections she\u2019d have to magic like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Rowan?\u201d Mallory asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d Gabe said, with obvious regret. \u201cEmployed by the Brecks, works on the property. Keeps to himself, is a hard worker. I don\u2019t know of any reason he\u2019d organize something this violent.\u201d He rubbed his jaw contemplatively. \u201cAll that said, they\u2019re still missing. If they don\u2019t return by sunset\u2014or we don\u2019t find evidence they were victims\u2014I\u2019ll have to question them myself.\u201d</p><p>There seemed little doubt the Apex of the North American Central Pack would find the answers.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do about the rest of Lupercalia?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rock and a hard place,\u201d Gabe admitted. \u201cWe cancel, we show weakness. We continue, we put shifters at risk of round two of whatever this is.\u201d He looked at Ethan. \u201cI imagine you\u2019ve faced similar dilemmas.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cTo stand or to protect. It is the perennial dilemma of the Master of any house.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded. \u201cTruth. I\u2019m mulling over our options, but I\u2019m leaning toward letting the party continue. When the mourning\u2019s done, the Pack will need a release.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about us?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the mystery-solving gang, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Catcher muttered something unflattering, and Mallory nudged him. \u201cI presume you want us to stay here tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt would make things easier,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll sleep on the couch,\u201d Catcher said, \u201clike we\u2019re twelve-year-olds at a slumber party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fairness,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cwe don\u2019t all have to sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fairness,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cyou can kiss my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cLet\u2019s put on our big-girl panties. Merit and Ethan are already sleeping in the bedroom, and there\u2019s no point in making them move. Catcher and I can take the couch. The shifters will feel better if we make this work, and it\u2019s no great loss to any of us.\u201d</p> <p>We all stared at her for a moment, at her implacable tone and reasonable words. If this was Mallory 2.0, I thoroughly approved.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to run out of clothes, though,\u201d she said.</p><p>Gabriel nodded, looked over the sorcerers. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Fallon, Nick. They should be about your size, might have something to offer.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cAnd there will be plenty of Lupercalia shirts to go around. I doubt most will want the souvenirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d appreciate whatever you can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually have a small request,\u201d I said, and Gabriel angled his head toward me.</p><p>\u201cYes, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have our swords tonight. Finley basically told us not to wear them, that they\u2019d piss off the family. But if we\u2019re looking for monsters\u2014especially monsters with magic\u2014I want steel.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, sharing an appreciative glance with Ethan. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel then gestured toward the food still untouched on the coffee table. \u201cSun will be up soon. I\u2019ll let you eat and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>I was seated closest to the door, so I rose, too, intending to fix the locks after he\u2019d gone. But when we met at the door, Gabriel stopped to turn his gaze on me. His eyes, the color of warm amber, swirled like tempests.</p><p>\u201cThank you for saving them.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I was glad to help.\u201d</p><p>But his expression stayed serious, his eyes deep and fathomless, the sight of them enough to raise goose bumps on my arms.</p><p>\u201cAs in much of life,\u201d he quietly said, \u201cit could have gone the other way.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened. Like sorcerers, shifters had the gift of prophecy. Did he mean Tanya might have died? That he might have lost her and Connor in the battle?</p><p>A bolt of something ran through my chest, a feeling on the precipice between gratitude and grief. I was glad his family was safe, and troubled that things might so easily have ended in tragedy. I didn\u2019t know how to give voice to the feeling or how to respond.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t predict the future,\u201d Gabriel said, answering one of my unspoken questions. \u201cBut I know the weight of things. There is a gravity about her now, about Connor, that suggests things might have gone the other way. That their roads might have diverged from mine. They didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like you, Kitten. You\u2019re good people.\u201d He leaned in and pressed a kiss to my cheek, and the flush rose from the tips of my toes to the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and before I could ask my own questions\u2014about the other prophecies he\u2019d made\u2014he slipped outside and into the darkness. There never seemed to be time for that particular future.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Gabriel gone, and a long night of warring behind us, we looked back at the food. It smelled porky, but when Mallory pulled back the aluminum foil, she revealed a tray of unidentifiable grayish chunks, some of which were tubular and looked distastefully intestinal.</p><p>Ethan slanted his head as he looked at it. \u201cIs Berna trying to feed us or kill us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect the Brecks put in their two cents about what we should be eating,\u201d Catcher said, who nevertheless forked a pile of the meaty chunks, flecked with fat and sinew, onto one of the paper plates she\u2019d provided.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t digging in, Sentinel,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stick to blood,\u201d I said, the meat not even slightly appealing despite my obvious hunger. \u201cWhat ever happened to that package Berna gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost in the battle,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t that a disappointment?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed bottles of Blood4You for Ethan and me and sat down on the couch beside him again, exhaustion sinking heavy into my bones.</p><p>\u201cWhat a miserable night,\u201d I said, handing over a bottle.</p><p>\u201cSeconded,\u201d Catcher added. \u201cUnfortunately, I doubt we\u2019ve seen the end of the trouble.\u201d He lifted a long, spiral bit of pork from his plate.</p><p>My stomach\u2014usually so hearty\u2014twisted nastily. But I\u2019d need my strength, so I made myself finish the blood and then grabbed a yeast roll from the other tray Berna had brought. The meat might have been questionable, but there was no faulting the warm and buttery bread.</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll attack again?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be unusual to bring the amount of fight and magic we saw tonight and assume that was the end of it. But I doubt they\u2019ll attack overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause the harpies were as much show as substance,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cYou attack when everyone\u2019s asleep, you don\u2019t get the show.\u201d</p><p>Ethan walked to one of the large windows and pushed aside the curtain. \u201cIn the event there is an attack, there are two guards. One on each side of the door.\u201d He hit the button that dropped the window guards into place and turned back to face Mal and Catcher.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, to be on the safe side, you could add a layer of magic?\u201d Ethan asked. \u201cA ward in case Gabe\u2019s colleagues decide their loyalties aren\u2019t entirely firm?\u201d</p><p>Catcher nodded, chewed. \u201cAlready discussed it. A little buzz along the doors and windows to signal a trespass, and a second layer to make trespassers think twice.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded and returned to the couch, but instead of sitting beside me, he stretched out along its length, his head in my lap. He didn\u2019t relax easily, and certainly not with an audience. Exhaustion must have worn him down. I ran my fingers through the golden silk of his hair, watched his eyes close in relief. It had been a long night; I was thankful we\u2019d come through it mostly unscathed.</p><p>Something made me glance up. I found Mallory watching me, surprise in her expression. She\u2019d been with me when I met Ethan for the first time, and while we\u2019d battled each other. Ethan and I had grown closer when Mallory and I had grown apart; maybe she was still getting used to seeing us as a couple. Hell, I was still getting used to it. I made a mean Sentinel now, but at the time of my making I\u2019d preferred books to most everything else, and he\u2019d chosen me. That still awed me on occasion.</p><p>\u201cSun\u2019s nearly up,\u201d Catcher said, patting Mallory\u2019s knee. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two get to bed, and we\u2019ll get things fixed up in here?\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded, rose from the couch, and held out a hand, his gaze beckoning. \u201cCome, Sentinel. Let us away and leave them to their magic.\u201d</p><p>Here, in the midst of Pack territory, I didn\u2019t think it would be easy to escape.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I woke once during the day, the bedroom still dark. We weren\u2019t meant to wake when the sun was above the horizon, so my mind was thick and fogged. But I heard a wolf baying, the sound long and mournful. More voices joined in, the animals obviously grief stricken and wailing for their dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d have their own rituals, their own ways of mourning. This was their funeral, their dirge beneath the cold, cruel sun.</p><p>I drifted back to sleep, Ethan warm and quiet beside me, and dreamt of amaranth.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>GAME, SET, VAMPIRE</p><p>I woke with a start just after sunset. Ethan lay at my side, his eyes closed in sleep, an arm over his head. His long legs were tangled in the pale sheets, his silk pajama bottoms riding temptingly low on his hips.</p><p>He opened one eye, smiled invitingly. \u201cGood evening, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSullivan,\u201d I said, leaning over to press a kiss to his lips.</p><p>There was a knock at the bedroom door. Catcher opened it without waiting for a response. I sat up straight again, grateful I\u2019d slept in pajamas and wasn\u2019t staring him down half naked.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he said. He wore his typically dour expression and a T-shirt with NOPE! across the front in bold, white letters.</p><p>Ethan flipped the blanket over my body like a matador, covering even the pajamaed parts. \u201cI don\u2019t recall inviting you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sorcerer, not a vampire. I don\u2019t need an invite. And now that we\u2019ve discussed our supernatural predilections, we need to get going. Gabriel wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>Mallory stepped into the doorway, a bowl of cereal in hand, mouth busy with a spoonful. \u201cGood evening, vampires.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape me that she took a moment to admire my particular vampire.</p><p>\u201cEyes on your own man candy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy man candy\u2019s already dressed,\u201d she said between bites of what looked like chocolate sludge. \u201cYours is . . . less so.\u201d</p><p>And mine was clearly enjoying the attention. He linked his hands behind his head, showing off his well-toned chest.</p><p>\u201cDown, boy,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, boy,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cQuit flirting with my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Ethan only smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re the ones darkening my doorway. I\u2019m beginning to see why so many sups don\u2019t like sorcerers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s grumpy at sunset,\u201d Mallory said, glancing at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just sunset,\u201d Catcher offered. \u201cAnd we\u2019re wasting time on the argument, so get dressed, and let\u2019s go.\u201d He rapped twice on the doorjamb before he and Mallory shuffled back into the main room.</p><p>\u201cFine friends you have, Sentinel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re your friends, too, Sullivan. You\u2019ve known Catcher longer than you\u2019ve known me.\u201d</p><p>I climbed out of bed, and he swatted me on the bottom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s flattering to either of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d I admitted, \u201cbut at the moment, we\u2019re all stuck with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ethan grabbed breakfast from the kitchen while I dressed. Thinking I couldn\u2019t be too careful, I dressed in my leathers, then settled in with blood and a bagel.</p><p>After he\u2019d eaten, Ethan pulled on jeans and a V-neck sweater with a shirt beneath. A lock of blond hair fell across his face as he tucked the shirt into very-well-fitting jeans, looking more like an East Coast blue blood than a midwestern vampire.</p><p>His phone rang, and Ethan finished the tuck, pushed his hair behind his ears, and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cLuc,\u201d Ethan said in greeting. \u201cYou\u2019re on speaker. We were just about to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take long. Just wanted to give you an update. The lawyers report Kowalcyzk is apparently trying to convince the prosecutor the House\u2019s security tapes were tampered with\u2014that the video of Monmonth arriving at the House and killing Louie and Angelo was doctored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd therefore that Ethan didn\u2019t act in self-defense,\u201d I concluded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s patently ridiculous,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAs if we don\u2019t have anything better to do than doctor our own security footage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor is, the prosecutor has doubts. And he\u2019s the one who\u2019d have to take the case to a jury. In any other city, that would probably be enough. But this is Chicago; the mayor\u2019s got pull.\u201d</p><p>God knew, I loved my hometown. But sometimes the Second City needed a good kick to the groin.</p><p>\u201cWe can prove the tapes weren\u2019t doctored,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cForensics run both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can,\u201d Luc agreed. \u201cAnd the lawyers are negotiating for that, and billing the House like its going out of style,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cUnfortunately, while the lawyers argue, she\u2019s attacked on another front.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne Rice\u2013style, as it turns out.\u201d Luc waited a beat for us to get the punch line.</p><p>\u201cInterview with the Vampire,\u201d Lindsey put in. Luc must have had us on speakerphone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d Luc said. \u201cAnd you win the prize. Jonah called. The mayor\u2019s people picked up Scott Grey fifteen minutes ago for questioning.\u201d</p><p>Scott Grey was the Master of Grey House, and Jonah\u2019s boss.</p><p>Magic spiked as Ethan\u2019s irritation rose. \u201cI presume Scott\u2019s Second arranged for a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has. Our guys say she\u2019s sharp, but the mayor\u2019s muscle isn\u2019t letting her near Scott. She apparently was told he doesn\u2019t have a right to counsel because the Houses are under suspicion as domestic terrorists.\u201d</p><p>It took Ethan a moment to respond. And in the seconds that passed, magic rose to a furious crescendo.</p><p>\u201cDomestic terrorists?\u201d Each syllable was bitten off.</p><p>\u201cTheir words. The muscle\u2019s from a task force she\u2019s set up. All the lawyers are talking. I also called Morgan and gave him a heads-up.\u201d</p><p>Morgan rounded out the city\u2019s three Masters. He became Master of Navarre after the former Master, Celina Desaulniers, was accused of murder. Morgan and I had briefly dated when I\u2019d first become a vampire, but the relationship, such as it was, hadn\u2019t lasted long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he answered the phone considering the blacklist.\u201d</p><p>When we left the GP, the organization had responded by forbidding Navarre and Grey from communicating with us. That hadn\u2019t stopped Grey House, at least not in the long run, but Navarre played by the GP\u2019s rules.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t thrilled. I\u2019d call it denial with an arrogance chaser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw in him,\u201d Lindsey said.</p><p>I glanced at Ethan. \u201cMy Master demanded I date him for the benefit of the House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one of my better decisions,\u201d Ethan admitted. \u201cKowalcyzk can call us domestic terrorists if she wants, but she won\u2019t be able to make that stick. There\u2019s no evidence of anything but the opposite\u2014that we help the city at every turn. What about the governor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dice so far,\u201d Luc said. \u201cMalik\u2019s spoken with her, but she\u2019s loath to get involved in an investigation. She\u2019s calling it comity and federalism and blah-blah political mumbo jumbo I don\u2019t care about. In any event, we\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s any movement.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded, and silence descended for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly where you\u2019re supposed to be right now,\u201d Luc said, responding to Ethan\u2019s unspoken complaint. \u201cAnd we have a plan. It just may not come together as soon as we\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re here for the duration in any event,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cShifter arrest is better than human arrest?\u201d Luc cheekily asked. \u201cOh, and one more thing while I\u2019m checking off my list of craptastic news. Lakshmi\u2019s arrived. She\u2019s in a suite at the Peninsula.\u201d The Peninsula was one of Chicago\u2019s swankiest hotels, located a few blocks east of Michigan Avenue.</p><p>Nerves jangled at the edges of my consciousness, but I pushed them back. Worrying about when she\u2019d call in her favor would have to wait; my plate was full.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s made arrangements to speak to Malik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. She said she\u2019d wait to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Ethan. \u201cThat seems like good news. If they were going to go ballistic, they wouldn\u2019t care if you were there or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr their price is stiff and meant just for me.\u201d</p><p>That ominous prediction settled uncomfortably in the room.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cThe Pack is awaiting our arrival. Keep us posted.\u201d</p><p>They said their good-byes and ended the call, and Ethan slanted a worried glance at me. He\u2019d pulled his hair back today, framing rugged cheekbones and his emerald eyes, which were clouded with worry.</p><p>\u201cIs this one of those times I\u2019m supposed to be supportive and tell you everything will work out perfectly?\u201d</p><p>Ethan made a vague grunt of amusement. \u201cOnly if you can say it honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll just keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Ethan smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. He pulled me into an embrace, his warmth and clean cologne enveloping us both. \u201cI don\u2019t want others to bear the burdens of my choices.\u201d</p><p>So Scott\u2019s situation concerned him, I thought.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just interviewing him,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through worse than an interview. And frankly, this may not be retribution against you. If she\u2019s got a task force, it could just be her usual brand of paranoia.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head. \u201cYou\u2019re a good and comforting Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to be the Sentinel that talks some damned sense into the mayor, but that opportunity hasn\u2019t yet arisen.\u201d</p><p>I texted Jonah, let him know we were aware of Scott\u2019s interrogation and were monitoring. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much else we could do from Loring Park.</p><p>Vampiric business concluded, we met Catcher and Mallory in the front room.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Catcher said, taking a final drink from a mug before putting it down on the table.</p><p>\u201cScott Grey is now in Kowalcyzk\u2019s custody,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Catcher looked up, surprised. \u201cReally.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan nodded, just once. \u201cSuspected of domestic terrorism, according to our rather creative mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lady is off her rocker,\u201d Mallory said, adjusting her knit cap, from beneath which peeked two ombr\u00e9 braids.</p><p>\u201cShe is something,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAny leads in the sorcery area?\u201d</p> <p>Catcher shook his head. \u201cBaumgartner\u2019s on vacation in Tucson with his wife and grandkids. And even if he\u2019d been here, he\u2019s not exactly a think-outside-the-box type of guy. We haven\u2019t reached Simon yet. Paige and the librarian have been in a hotel room in the Loop for a belated Valentine\u2019s Day. Their minds are on other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Paige and Baumgartner are out, if they weren\u2019t already. And once again, we have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d I said, squeezing Ethan\u2019s hand. \u201cWe always find something.\u201d</p><p>The issue was finding it soon enough.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>We pulled on coats and gloves, belted on our katanas, and headed outside. The shifters who awaited us didn\u2019t even spare them a glance, so I presumed Gabriel had approved our wearing them.</p><p>The night was cold, the sky covered by a bank of clouds that glowed orange on the horizon, lit by the pollution of a million sodium lights in Chicago. But I was jumpy and couldn\u2019t stop glancing into the darkness, waiting for a new squadron of monsters to emerge.</p><p>We walked silently back to the house, hands in pockets and collars lifted against the wind, the shifters forming a guard in front of and behind us. They were all men, all wearing NAC jackets. They didn\u2019t bother to look at us, which I found I preferred. Disinterest, in my book, was better than barely concealed loathing.</p><p>One of the shifters in front held open a door, and we entered a spare and utilitarian hallway. This part of the house was for the staff, allowing them to serve the Brecks inconspicuously.</p><p>We were marched into the main portion of the house, and then into a formal living room, where Gabriel held court again. The same crew was here again tonight\u2014the Keenes, the Brecks, and a dozen other shifters, including Jeff.</p><p>Once again, the room was mostly men, but tonight there were exceptions. Fallon sat on an immaculately tailored couch beside her brother, and Tanya sat on his other side, Connor in her arms. Another female shifter sat on the floor at Tanya\u2019s feet, a petite brunette who had Tanya\u2019s big eyes and sweet features. I guessed she was in her early twenties and probably a younger sister of Tanya\u2019s. She was a lovely girl, with bee-stung lips and pink cheeks, her brown hair pulled up in a messy knot.</p> <p>The energy in the room was different than it had been last night. Still cautious, grieving. But tonight there was something else, a new softness running through the weft and warp. I presumed Tanya and her sister had brought that to the party.</p><p>Tanya glanced at me, nodded her head in acknowledgment as she brushed a hand across the fuzz on Connor\u2019s head, comforting him\u2014and probably her\u2014at the same time.</p><p>\u201cGuests,\u201d Gabriel said, nodding mildly at us. He wore a long-sleeved T-shirt with a complicated pattern, jeans, and boots with traces of mud on the bottom. The faint scents of dirt and blood lay beneath fresh flowers and the cologne of the various men in the room. They\u2019d been outside, probably walking the earth where their comrades had died.</p><p>Gabe caught my gaze, and I looked up at him. \u201cI trust you slept well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well as possible, considering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny developments regarding the attack?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Gabe glanced at the large grandfather clock that ticked ominously across the room. \u201cBut that report should come any moment now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the festival?\u201d Ethan asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not give up easily,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to get the grounds back into shape, the tents prepared again.\u201d That explained the mud on his boots. \u201cLupercalia will continue tonight.\u201d</p><p>Volleys of magic filled the air as the shifters in the room reacted to the announcement. Some were relieved, some nervous, some angry.</p><p>I felt Ethan\u2019s jolt of surprise, understood it. But we were vampires, and the violation hadn\u2019t been against us. Perhaps they needed to prove to the world\u2014and themselves\u2014that they could battle back.</p><p>\u201cWe wish you the best,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd obviously we\u2019re happy to assist as we can.\u201d</p><p>The clock struck six with a sound like church bells, and the door creaked open.</p><p>The shifter who stood in the doorway was tall and rangy, with black hair that reached his shoulders and a shadow\u2019s worth of stubble. His skin was honeyed, and his eyes were chocolate brown and deep set, offsetting honed cheekbones and a generous mouth. He wore the NAC jacket over jeans and boots, and a series of tangled cords and wraps on his right wrist.</p><p>As manly appreciation wasn\u2019t appropriate under the circumstances\u2014and considering the stink eye from Ethan\u2019s direction\u2014I muted my expression. But as I looked away, I happened to catch the wide-eyed interest in Tanya\u2019s sister\u2019s face. I\u2019d seen that look before\u2014I\u2019d had that look before\u2014and it was immediately recognizable, as was the way she seemed to shrink back into her own body, as if willing herself to disappear. She was interested in this new shifter but hadn\u2019t yet confessed her feelings. It was the look of every shy teenager who\u2019d come face-to-face with a high school crush, of every coed who\u2019d decided the object of her affection was out of her league.</p><p>All the while, the shifter stood statue still before his Apex, oblivious to the wanting in her eyes, waiting for instructions.</p><p>\u201cDamien Garza,\u201d Gabriel said, gesturing to him. \u201cA member of the Pack.\u201d Gabe gestured to us. \u201cMerit, of Cadogan House. Ethan Sullivan, of Cadogan House. And you know Catcher and Mallory.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded, and Damien acknowledged us with a small dip of his chin, his face devoid of expression.</p><p>\u201cDamien is here to report on our missing mates,\u201d Gabe said, signaling Damien to begin.</p><p>\u201cThere is no sign of Aline,\u201d Damien said, his accent melodic. \u201cBut Rowan\u2019s body has been found. Just inside the tree line on the south side of the meadow.\u201d</p><p>His expression was as neutral as it had been before, but the magic in the room dipped sadly, becoming low and melancholic. Gabe closed his eyes and leaned back against the couch, shoulders slumping in grief.</p><p>\u201cWe are sorry for your loss,\u201d Ethan gravely said. We\u2019d had to say that too many times since our arrival in Loring Park.</p><p>Gabe nodded, rubbing his forehead with his palm as if to soothe the tension there. \u201cIs Aline gone by choice or coercion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d Damien said. \u201cBut she is not on the estate. And I have looked well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely she\u2019s just gone home,\u201d Finley said, glancing at his fellow shifters. \u201cLeft the premises because of the drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those years she didn\u2019t leave,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cWhy would she leave now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you brought sorcerers and vampires into your sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>All eyes looked to Mallory, who\u2019d spoken the words. She glanced across the room, making eye contact with each shifter, the act an apology and a reckoning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth, right out of her mouth,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cMaybe it was the final straw for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of the reason,\u201d Gabe said, \u201cthe timing is suspect. She left precisely when the night brought tragedy to our people, and I don\u2019t believe in coincidences.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Damien. \u201cGo to her home. Learn what you can.\u201d Then he looked at Ethan. \u201cAs you\u2019ve offered your help, I suggest Merit go with Damien to look for Aline. It wouldn\u2019t be wise for you to leave the estate, all things considered. I suggest you and the sorcerers stay here and help us ensure the safety of the Pack tonight.\u201d</p><p>Papa Breck scoffed at the notion he needed protecting, and it was clear Ethan didn\u2019t like the idea of our splitting up. But as plans went, it wasn\u2019t as bad as it might have been. We had agreed to investigate, and Ethan couldn\u2019t leave the estate until the coast was clear. Lupercalia was going ahead as planned, so we might as well help the Pack.</p><p>\u201cI cannot speak for Catcher or Mallory,\u201d Ethan carefully said. \u201cMerit will go with Damien\u2014but Jeff will go as well.\u201d</p><p>Ethan, ever the strategist, had done the math. Damien was an unknown, but Jeff was an ally. We\u2019d literally walked through fire together.</p><p>A thin smile played at Gabriel\u2019s lips. \u201cYour terms are acceptable, Sullivan. Damien, Jeff, Merit\u2014go now. And find her.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to leave Ethan. I (mostly) trusted his safety to Catcher and Mallory, but they\u2019d still be surrounded by shifters who hadn\u2019t decided whether we were friend or foe. And many were leaning toward the latter.</p><p>Ethan escorted me to the foyer, where we waited while Jeff and Damien researched Aline\u2019s address. I took the opportunity to play Sentinel.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you\u2019re armed in case there\u2019s another attack. Keep your phone on you. And stay in Catcher\u2019s line of sight at all times. He\u2019ll keep you out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>Ethan cocked an eyebrow. \u201cI do not need a sorcerer to keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause that wouldn\u2019t do much for your hard-ass vamp cred.\u201d</p><p>Ethan humphed. \u201cI have all the hard-ass vampire cred.\u201d The ferocity in his eyes was actually pretty convincing. \u201cYou\u2019ll stick to Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs close as I can. Do you know anything about Garza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all,\u201d Ethan said, sliding his gaze to the tall and rangy shifter, who stood against the opposite wall, arms crossed as he looked down at Jeff.</p><p>\u201cThis was the best bargain you could make,\u201d I assured Ethan, squeezing his hand. He didn\u2019t look entirely convinced, but I was right; there was no better bargain in the offing.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Jeff said, tucking his phone away and moving back toward us. \u201cWe\u2019re good to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep an eye on her?\u201d Ethan asked, giving Jeff the same cool look he\u2019d given me.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping she\u2019d keep an eye on me,\u201d he good-naturedly said. We smiled, looking at Damien pleasantly to invite him into the conversation, but his expression stayed blank.</p><p>Realizing the joke hadn\u2019t gone far, Jeff grimaced and gestured toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s forget this happened and get in the car.\u201d</p> <p>Wordlessly, they walked to the front door and disappeared outside, letting in a swift breeze that swept across the foyer.</p><p>Ethan took my lapels in hand and hauled me against him, his body hard and hot against mine. He kissed me slowly, deeply, madly.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured, mouth slipping to my cheek, an electric chill running the length of my body.</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment, letting myself linger against him. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me again and released me. \u201cAnd Sentinel?\u201d</p> <p>I glanced up at him, fairly drunk from the kiss.</p><p>\u201cFor the sake of peace between shifters and vampires, do try to avoid staring at Damien Garza.\u201d With that advice and a sly smile, he slipped back into the room, just in time to avoid catching the blush on my cheeks.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t stared.</p><p>I\u2019d admired. There was a difference.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>In his boots, Damien couldn\u2019t have been a hair under six feet five. He was long and lean, which made the small electric car he pulled up to the front of the Breckenridge house seem like a clown car by comparison.</p> <p>\u201cThis looks . . . energy efficient,\u201d I politely said, as I squeezed into the backseat, katana across my lap.</p><p>Jeff climbed into the passenger seat beside Damien, the front of the car small enough that their shoulders nearly touched.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Damien said, eyes narrowed at me in the rearview mirror. I smiled politely and couldn\u2019t help imagining the possibility he\u2019d drive Jeff and me to the middle of a cornfield, take us out, and leave our bodies for the crows.</p><p>On the other hand, I thought, as he revved the car\u2019s lawn-mower engine, I could probably run faster than the car.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cInto town,\u201d Jeff said, glancing back. \u201cAline\u2019s got a house near downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friends or relatives she might have gone to visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here in town,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cBut she does have a human resources gig at an agricultural company about halfway between here and Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFriends?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cUnknown,\u201d Damien said. \u201cShe kept to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall seeing her at the battle,\u201d I said. \u201cWe met her before it started. She made a snarky comment about nonshifters and the downfall of the Pack, and then hustled off into the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Damien nodded but didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>A few minutes later, he pulled the car into the driveway of a small cottage on a quiet residential street. The surrounding houses were small but the yards were tidy, and probably would have been full of pansies had the weather been warm enough.</p><p>Jeff helped me out of the car, and I belted on my katana. Damien gave it a quick glance, lifted his gaze to mine.</p><p>\u201cYou can use that effectively?\u201d</p><p>Not appreciating the tone, I decided to meet it head-on. I rested my fingers on the handle, gave him an appraising glance. \u201cCan you shift effectively?\u201d</p><p>When he made a dubious sound\u2014something between a snort, a chuckle, and a grunt\u2014I decided I\u2019d made the right play.</p><p>Alert for any sign of life, or harpies with hostages, we walked up the sidewalk to the front door. Jeff climbed the stairs, pulled open the metal storm door, and tried the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cLocked,\u201d Jeff said, glancing back at us.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d Damien said, sliding into Jeff\u2019s spot, wiggling the knob, and then rapping his knuckles along the edges of the frame, as if testing for weakness.</p><p>\u201cStand back,\u201d was the only warning we got, and he barely managed to finish the warning before his foot was up and out and he\u2019d made contact, kicking the door in.</p><p>It flew open, slamming back against an interior wall with rattling force. When it swung forward again, still propelled by his momentum, he caught it in a hand, nodded at us.</p><p>\u201cNot locked,\u201d he simply said.</p><p>Quiet was Damien Garza. And effective.</p><p>The scent that wafted from the house was strong and not entirely welcoming. It wasn\u2019t the smell of death\u2014thank goodness\u2014but of dirt. Old paper. Dust. Musty fabrics. And beneath it all, the acrid scent of animals. Cats, I thought. A few of them, considering the odor.</p><p>My eyes adjusted to the darkness. Aline\u2019s house was small, dingy, and full of . . . everything. Dust motes floated through the few shafts of light that managed to penetrate the darkness and the tall columns of boxes, magazines, and flea-market finds. Ceramics from the 1970s competed with quilted jackets, and romance novels with bodice-ripping covers were stacked with tangled coat hangers.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a hoarder?\u201d Damien asked.</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cApparently so.\u201d He glanced around the room and the narrow paths through the stuff, then pointed at the pathway straight ahead. \u201cMerit and I will go that way. You go to the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d I said, and Damien quickly disappeared behind a towering stack of mismatched encyclopedias. I took a few steps into the other path, and Jeff fell in step behind me.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the scoop on Damien?\u201d I quietly asked.</p><p>\u201cThe scoop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him around before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stays behind the scenes,\u201d Jeff added. I glanced back. He\u2019d found a stack of magazines and papers and was flipping through them. He chuckled, pulled out a magazine, and held it up. Monthly Disco Review, read the cover, which featured a couple in flimsy chiffon beneath an enormous disco ball.</p><p>\u201cA classic publication,\u201d I said. \u201cBetter photographs than Disco Review Monthly and better articles than The Disco Month in Review.\u201d</p><p>Jeff chuckled, as I\u2019d meant him to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot avoiding,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cJust being discreet.\u201d He slid the magazine back into its stack. \u201cDamien handles the Pack\u2019s messier matters. Sensitive matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an enforcer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a title,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a trusted Pack member, and that\u2019s all a nosy vampire needs to know.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t nosy, Jeff Christopher, Gabriel wouldn\u2019t want me here. It\u2019s one of my finer qualities. And speaking of nosy, it looks like you and Fallon are getting along well.\u201d</p><p>The circumstances might have been grim, but that didn\u2019t stop the smile that lifted his lips. \u201cWe\u2019re officially a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. I\u2019m glad to hear it worked out.\u201d</p><p>Something ghosted across his face, but he shook it off. \u201cMe, too, Merit. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>We walked quietly through the labyrinth.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she found solace in this stuff,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cOr tried to.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, gently pushing aside the dusty leaves of a silk houseplant as I walked past. The dust looked undisturbed, and there was no sign of life in the house. We continued down the path, the clearing so tight we couldn\u2019t see more than a few feet in front of us, and crossed a threshold into a small bedroom. There was a bed, a single window, and piles of clothing and newspapers and knickknacks in every bit of the room that wasn\u2019t occupied by the bed. The bed was neatly made, a glass of water on the side table. But a thin layer of dust covered the surface of the water.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like she hasn\u2019t been here in a while,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my thought,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cBut if she isn\u2019t here, where is she?\u201d</p><p>As if in answer, something skittered on the other side of the bed, rustling the ruffled curtain. I held up a hand to signal Jeff, pointed to it. He nodded me forward.</p><p>I took one step, then another, flipping the thumb guard on my sword as I moved. \u201cAline? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>A stack of sweaters shuddered from the movement of some unseen foe. I swallowed, gripped the handle of my katana, and prepared to unsheathe it. \u201cJeff,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhat animal is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Gabe didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>There in the dark, with shadows moving across unfamiliar towers of stuff, my brain decided she was a wolverine, teeth bared and claws exposed, pissed off and ready to defend herself.</p><p>I did not want a faceful of wolverine.</p><p>\u201cAline? Can you come out? We just want to talk.\u201d I took another step forward.</p><p>Without warning, as quick as a fox, she attacked, a blur of black fur and teeth and bright green eyes. I let out a howl of surprise, my body jolting with fear, and slashed the air where the animal had attacked.</p><p>\u201cMerit!\u201d Jeff yelled out, rushing forward . . . as a small, sleek black cat dropped onto the bed. Oblivious to the commotion it had caused, the cat stuck its bottom into the air and began to knead the blanket.</p><p>Jeff howled with laughter.</p><p>I tried to slow my racing heart while mortification reddened my face. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou screamed like a kid in a horror movie,\u201d Jeff said, now doubled over and wiping tears from his eyes. \u201cThat was tremendous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance that cat\u2019s a shifter?\u201d I asked, hoping to save what remained of my pride.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely a cat,\u201d Jeff said, laughing as Damien emerged from a clearing across the room.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerit found a monster,\u201d Jeff said, gesturing toward my feline attacker. \u201cAnd a fierce one.\u201d</p><p>The cat looked up at Jeff and began to clean its paw.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the help, buddy,\u201d I murmured, resheathing my sword and saying good-bye to what was left of my pride.</p><p>Damien glanced at me, and for the first time, I caught a glimpse of humor in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you actually found anything helpful?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMerit has decided she hasn\u2019t been here in a while. I\u2019d agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough she hasn\u2019t been gone long enough to bother the cat,\u201d I said. Apparently clean enough, he sat on his haunches and looked between us, the picture of health.</p><p>\u201cWhat about magic?\u201d Damien asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a sorcerer\u2019s workshop,\u201d I said, thinking of the basement in Mallory\u2019s Wicker Park brownstone. \u201cNothing here looks like she\u2019s been mixing spells or magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no magic,\u201d Damien said, \u201cand no Aline. If she\u2019s not here, where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be somewhere. We just need a clue. I\u2019ll check the mailbox,\u201d I said, then glanced at Jeff. \u201cMaybe you can find a computer or laptop in this mess? Maybe her Web searches will give us a clue, or there\u2019s a receipt that tells us where she\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood thought.\u201d</p><p>I entered the labyrinth again, only a little nervous when Damien fell into step behind me.</p> <p>\u201cSo, do you live in Chicago?\u201d I said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cCuriosity killed the cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cat\u2019s perfectly healthy,\u201d I reminded him, \u201cand I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel calls you Kitten. Although since you\u2019re scared of them, the moniker seems a little inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>I was glad Damien was behind me and couldn\u2019t see the searing expression on my face. But I changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cThere was a girl sitting by Tanya at the house. Is that her sister?\u201d</p> <p>It took him a moment to answer, which only piqued my killing curiosity even more. \u201cEmma,\u201d he said. \u201cHer name is Emma.\u201d</p><p>His voice was softer now, careful, as if speaking her name too loudly would work its own magic.</p><p>We reached the front door and I pulled it open, relieved to breathe fresh air again. The neighborhood smelled different than the Breckenridge estate had. There, the air was heavy with the scents of crushed pine needles, animals, pastures. The air on Aline\u2019s front porch smelled more like a city\u2014more smoke, more vehicle exhaust, even the scent of food from the carnival down the road.</p><p>Aline\u2019s mailbox was at the end of the pitted sidewalk in front of her house, the wooden post surrounded by a tangle of vines with long-wilted flowers. I pulled open the door, found a single envelope inside.</p><p>I looked at it for a moment, debating whether I\u2019d be jailed for tampering with the mail.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Damien asked, looming behind me. He was tall enough to peer over my shoulder but seemed content to let me do the tampering.</p><p>\u201cNone at all,\u201d I said, sliding the envelope from the box and turning to read the label in the streetlight.</p><p>Luck shifted. It was addressed to Aline Norsworthy from Pic-N-Pac Storage, and from the clear window on the front, I guessed it was a bill.</p> <p>\u201cAline has a storage unit,\u201d I said, handing the envelope to Damien, who ripped it open and pulled out the letter.</p><p>\u201cA new storage unit,\u201d he said, handing the paper to me. It was a bill for forty-eight dollars, fifteen of which was allocated to a \u201cNew Locker Setup Fee,\u201d which was processed two days ago.</p><p>I whistled, glanced up at Damien. \u201cOur disappeared shifter just rented a storage unit.\u201d</p><p>I memorized the address, stuffed the letter into the mangled envelope, and put it back where I\u2019d found it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure mail tampering\u2019s a felony.\u201d</p><p>Damien made a gravelly laugh, started back up the sidewalk. \u201cGirl, you\u2019re a vampire. This day and age, everything you do is a felony.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>WITHIN AND WITHOUT</p><p>We walked back into the house to collect Jeff, found him huddled over a boxy computer that sat on a desk comprised of cardboard boxes and vintage board games.</p><p>\u201cNot much for tech, is she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jeff offered the arrogant grunt of an IT whiz kid. \u201cNot even slightly. And she\u2019s stealing wireless from her neighbors. But that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201d</p><p>Damien stepped forward. \u201cDid you find anything that is here or there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d he said, typing with the heavy, plastic clack of ancient keys, \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up a browser window that showed the pixelated image of a receipt\u2014for a flight to Anchorage that had left at eight o\u2019clock this morning.</p><p>My brows lifted in surprise. I hadn\u2019t actually expected him to find evidence Aline had skipped town. She seemed the naive and complaining sort, the type to gripe about irritations but not actually attempt to fix them.</p><p>I looked back at Jeff. \u201cI presume you fly into Anchorage if you\u2019re going to Aurora?\u201d The North American Packs\u2019 ancestral home was in Aurora, Alaska. If she was running, she was running back to ground.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>\u201cLeaving town doesn\u2019t mean she had anything to do with the attack,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cMaybe it was the last straw for her. The last failure of the Keene family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ticket was booked five days ago,\u201d Jeff said, pointing to the purchase date on the screen.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cSo she planned to leave nearly a week ago, but shows up to Lupercalia, waits out the attack, and leaves. If she knew the attack was going down, why show up at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she wanted to see it,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s angry enough that she wanted to watch it go down. She wanted her revenge.\u201d</p><p>It was definitely plausible. And it was the best lead we had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve uploaded the hard drive onto a thumb drive,\u201d Jeff said, holding up the small stick. \u201cI can dig more at the house. You find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe rented a storage unit. Bill was in the mailbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the smell of evidence in the morning,\u201d Jeff said. He flipped the computer\u2019s power toggle and rose again. \u201cI think we\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the cat?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf she\u2019s gone to Alaska, we shouldn\u2019t leave it here alone.\u201d</p><p>Damien disappeared for a moment, reappeared a minute later, the kitten blinking drowsily in the crook of his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>Tall, dark, and handsome was hot. Tall, dark, and handsome with nestled kitten? Atomic.</p><p>\u201cIt will need a name,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>Damien looked down at the scrimpy kitten in his arms, scratched between his ears, and set the cat purring. \u201cBoo. I\u2019ll call him Boo.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s how Boo Garza joined the North American Central Pack.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The brain coped with complexity by making shortcuts, by categorizing.</p><p>Shifters, to my brain, were a rough-and-tumble sort. So I expected Damien Garza was the type to open a beer bottle with his teeth. I expected he loved a good steak, had specific opinions about football or boxing or hockey. He had the look and the vibe.</p><p>I did not expect we\u2019d drive to Pic-N-Pac Storage in his tiny, fuel-efficient car while he held a kitten on his lap, its rumbling purr audible even in the backseat.</p><p>Damien Garza was a good reminder that people were rarely what they seemed, that judging a book by its cover was a remarkably inaccurate way of taking its measure.</p><p>On the way, Jeff called Aline\u2019s work. I checked on Ethan and advised what we\u2019d found.</p><p>ALINE MAY HAVE SKIPPED TOWN, I messaged. FOUND TRAVEL RECEIPT TO ALASKA. CHECKING STORAGE UNIT.</p><p>It took a few moments for him to answer\u2014a delay that made me worry more about his safety\u2014and I felt a wash of relief when his message came through.</p><p>THAT\u2019S A LEAD, he agreed. SORCERERS MAKING GO OF FESTIVAL. MOOD STILL GRIM, BUT BOOZE AND MEAT SOOTHE FEELINGS.</p><p>So I\u2019d been right about the meat and beer.</p><p>STAY ALERT, he told me, and my phone went silent again.</p><p>Communications done, I glanced at Jeff. \u201cAny luck at the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo answer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut her voice-mail box was full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo people have been trying to reach her?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>We found the Pic-N-Pac on the edge of town, a run-down area far from the wealth of the Breck estate.</p><p>The facility, a few rows of low-slung metal storage sheds, was situated between a mobile home park and a closed skating rink, the FOR SALE sign fading and cracked, not unlike everything else we saw.</p><p>We pulled through the gate, passing only a couple of pot-bellied guys in a beat-up truck loading very large boxes into storage. They stared at us as we passed, clearly not happy about the company.</p><p>\u201cWhat number?\u201d Damien asked.</p><p>\u201cForty-three,\u201d I told him. It was the last locker on the second row, its aluminum sliding door closed with a silver padlock.</p><p>We climbed out of the car, waited until Damien had built a bed for Boo on the front seat from his leather jacket. Boo immediately climbed inside, pawed at the leather, and snuggled in.</p><p>We glanced at the lock. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you has a bolt cutter?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBolt cutters lack subtlety,\u201d Damien said, stepping forward and pulling a couple of small silver implements from his pocket. He inserted them into the key slot while Jeff looked nervously around.</p><p>\u201cMight want to do that quickly,\u201d Jeff suggested. \u201cIn case there\u2019s security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamera\u2019s busted,\u201d Damien said without looking up. \u201cCheck Merit\u2019s seven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Jeff and I both looked back to the position Damien had indicated, found a small camera perched on the wall between Aline\u2019s locker and the next one, its unconnected wires dangling below like tentacles.</p><p>Little wonder Gabriel trusted Damien with \u201csensitive\u201d matters. His attention to detail was impressive.</p><p>With a snap, the lock flipped open. Damien replaced his tools and tossed aside the lock.</p><p>He put a hand on the lever but looked back at us. \u201cAnybody think anything\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>I lifted the block on my vampire senses, which was usually down so I wouldn\u2019t be driven mad by an excess of sensations. But even with my shields down, I sensed nothing at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot that I can tell,\u201d I said, but unsheathed my sword anyway. Better to be safe than sorry. Or leave Boo without a father.</p><p>\u201cIn that case . . . ,\u201d Damien said, pulling up the door with a ratcheting sound. He flipped a penlight from his pocket and shined it into the space.</p><p>It was empty except for a cardboard box on the ground, the top flaps woven closed.</p> <p>\u201cThat was anticlimactic,\u201d Jeff said as I slid the sword home again.</p><p>Damien moved forward and nudged the box with a toe. When nothing happened, he crouched in front of it and pulled open the flaps.</p><p>\u201cLooks like trash to me.\u201d He stepped back, gesturing for me to take a look.</p><p>The box was filled with ephemera. Old photographs and paper scraps, notes and holiday cards. I reached inside, pulled out a black-and-white photograph. It was an old-fashioned Polaroid, a pretty woman kneeling on the ground, each arm around a cute kid.</p><p>I turned the picture around. \u201cChas and Georgie,\u201d it read.</p> <p>I glanced back at Jeff and Damien. \u201cWhat were the names of the boys Aline wanted the Pack to shelter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Jeff asked, looking at Damien. \u201cSomething with a \u2018J\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d Damien said. \u201cAnd Charles.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, I handed over the picture, let Jeff and Damien reach their own conclusions.</p><p>\u201cI somehow doubt this is a coincidence,\u201d Jeff said, dropping the photograph back into the box. \u201cBut why would she bother to get a storage unit for one box of stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this stuff was important to her,\u201d I said. \u201cThe boys certainly were. Maybe she wanted to keep these things separate and safe when she decided to run.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr she needed the space for more hoarding,\u201d Damien said, rising again. \u201cAnd this is the first thing she decided to store here.\u201d</p><p>That was certainly the easier answer. The more obvious answer. But either way, the case against Aline was getting stronger.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Without another immediate lead, Jeff and Damien decided to take a break and work through what we knew about her reason for leaving. They picked a twenty-four-hour chain restaurant not far from the Pic-N-Pac, a diner-style joint at the end of the parking lot where the carnival held court.</p><p>It was late, music still blasted from the carnival\u2019s speakers, and the Ferris wheel rolled lazily, the spokes outlined in lights that flashed in patterns as it turned. The air smelled deliciously of fried food and sugar. Damien tucked Boo into his nest, and we walked inside, found plenty of quiet booths. While the guys slid into one, arguing about the best way to serve hash browns\u2014plain, or covered with cheese and onions\u2014I stopped at the jukebox inside the door, bosom buddies with a cigarette machine that now held packs of gum. I hadn\u2019t seen a jukebox in years, so I scanned the music choices, which ran the gamut from Top 40 to classic country, heavy on the big hair and sequin vests.</p><p>My phone rang, and I pulled it from my pocket, found the number blocked.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lakshmi,\u201d said the prettily accented voice on the other end of the line.</p> <p>My heart began to pound, and I glanced back at Jeff and Damien, who were looking over laminated menus. I had only a moment to talk.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I nervously said. \u201cAre you trying to reach Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying to reach you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to discuss our previous arrangement.\u201d</p><p>I cursed silently. It wasn\u2019t as if I hadn\u2019t known this was coming, but her timing could hardly have been worse. \u201cYou need a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But it would be better to discuss in person.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t renege on our deal. That would be dishonorable for me, the House, and Jonah, who\u2019d put his ass on the line to get the favor from Lakshmi in the first place. On the other hand, I was rather involved in something at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really get away right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. The murder investigation and the shifters,\u201d she said, apparently aware of what was going on.</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t suppose you have any pull with Mayor Kowalcyzk? Or know anything about harpies?\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what attacked the Pack? Harpies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a magical manifestation of harpies, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Pack is holding you hostage?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re helping them investigate.\u201d That was only partly the truth, but enough for her purposes. I wasn\u2019t about to incite a war between shifters and vampires by telling the GP we were at their mercy.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we meet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I stood there dumbly for a moment, the phone in hand, debating my next move. I\u2019d have to meet with her, one way or the other. But to do it, I\u2019d have to get away from the shifters, the sorcerers, the house, and Ethan. He knew about my RG membership, but he didn\u2019t know Lakshmi was a source. This was going to be tricky.</p><p>\u201cI can come to you,\u201d she offered. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of some urgency. Where can we meet?\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the table, and Jeff caught my eye, waved me forward. I was nearly out of time.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a carnival in Loring Park,\u201d I said, providing directions to the first place that came to mind. It would be busy\u2014full of sounds and smells and people\u2014and would give us a bit of anonymity.</p><p>\u201cOne hour,\u201d she said, and disconnected the call.</p><p>I checked the clock on the wall, ensuring I knew when to make my exit. Now I just had to figure out how to do it.</p><p>I rejoined the shifters, sliding into the booth beside Jeff. \u201cCadogan House,\u201d I said. \u201cJust checking in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews from home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat looks good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaffles and bacon for me,\u201d Jeff said, handing over his menu. \u201cAnd Damien\u2019s looking at crepes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not eat crepes. Eggs, sausage, toast,\u201d he said, when the uniformed waitress walked over, a notepad in hand. \u201cEggs over hard. Toast buttered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHon?\u201d she asked, glancing at me over glasses with square frames.</p><p>\u201cJust orange juice.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and disappeared through a door that flapped back and forth.</p><p>\u201cJust orange juice?\u201d Jeff said with a chuckle, sliding his menu back into place. \u201cSince when do you just have orange juice?\u201d</p><p>Since a member of the GP asked for a secret meeting, I thought, my stomach roiling with nerves. But I couldn\u2019t exactly tell them that.</p><p>\u201cStress,\u201d I said, crossing my arms against the chill. Patrons moved in and out of the diner, which sent blasts of cold air careening across the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jeff said, linking his hands on the table. \u201cSo Aline. What are we thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe receipt says she left town,\u201d Damien said. \u201cAlthough the circumstances are suspect. She left a cat and a single box in a storage locker. She left one day into Lupercalia, when she could have avoided it altogether.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head at Damien. \u201cSo you think the receipt\u2019s bogus?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at me. \u201cI am not sure. But I think it\u2019s suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have been set up,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cDo we know of any specific enemies?\u201d I asked. \u201cOther than the Keene family, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>The waitress came back bearing drinks, which she passed out with smiles.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have any friends in the Pack?\u201d I asked, when the waitress disappeared again. \u201cShe seemed to know Berna. They talked last night, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thought,\u201d Damien said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her. Other than that, I believe she kept to herself?\u201d He glanced at Jeff for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cFar as I know,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about people in Aurora?\u201d I asked. \u201cWould she have told anyone she was coming? Made arrangements to stay with a friend? I mean, I don\u2019t imagine there are lots of hotels up there.\u201d I leaned forward, curious. \u201cActually, how do you accommodate everyone if the Packs get together up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiant puppy piles,\u201d Damien dryly said. \u201cCurled up on an old plaid blanket by the fire.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was joking, but it did make for an interesting mental image.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a resort,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cA former resort, anyway. The Meadows. Had its heyday in the fifties and sixties.\u201d</p><p>I imagined well-heeled men and women playing badminton in long white skirts and pants, staff members carrying watermelons to their bunkhouses, Dirty Dancing\u2013style.</p><p>\u201cIt fell into disrepair,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cThe Packs got together, bought it, rehabbed it. Now it\u2019s private, and it holds a hell of a lot of shifters. Nothing fancy, but it does the job. Plenty of space to act human, plenty of space to roam.\u201d</p><p>Visiting the Meadows popped up to the top of my bucket list. \u201cHow does a vampire get an invitation to such a place?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d Damien said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re volunteering to be kibble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I crisply said, sitting back again. He was joking, but considering the mood at the house, I decided there was still a kernel of truth in it.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t make kibble of you,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cWe\u2019d serve you up with fava beans and a nice Chianti.\u201d</p><p>I pointed at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging out with Luc too much, and you\u2019ve reached your quota for movie references today.\u201d</p><p>Jeff grinned. Damien rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEven if she skipped town because she\u2019s the cause of this, she couldn\u2019t have done it herself.\u201d Damien looked at me and Jeff, eyebrows knitted over those dark eyes. \u201cTell me about the sorcerers.\u201d</p><p>His implication was clear, and it had Jeff shifting in his seat. \u201cThey\u2019re solid, both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2014Mallory\u2014caused a lot of trouble. Has a lot of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did and does,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd she\u2019s making amends, as I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d My tone was icy. But if it bothered him, it didn\u2019t register in his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t the only ones who can make magic,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t. There are three others in the Chicago metro area.\u201d I gave him the details about Simon, Paige, and Baumgartner\u2014and what we\u2019d learned so far.</p><p>He looked surprised. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was because he didn\u2019t figure we\u2019d bother to ask, or because the sorcerers were potentially alibied.</p> <p>\u201cSo who did this? Aline couldn\u2019t do it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t. But we don\u2019t have anything that suggests who else was involved.\u201d</p><p>Damien lifted hopeful eyes to me, and I felt him shift the weight of that hope to my shoulders. \u201cGabriel thinks that\u2019s what you\u2019re good at. Finding out who was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about \u2018good,\u2019\u201d I said honestly. \u201cBut we do tend to get wrapped into things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re wrapped up good and tight in this one,\u201d Damien said. \u201cAnd good luck to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The waitress brought our food, offered ketchup and hot sauce, which the guys declined. As they ate and I sipped my orange juice\u2014and ate a piece of bacon Jeff had thoughtfully offered\u2014we came up with a to-do list.</p><p>Damien would check with the resort to see if Aline had made arrangements to stay there, and find out if other Pack members had information about her travel plans.</p><p>Jeff would continue to check her computer for anything that suggested she was involved in the attack\u2014or offered any clue about her whereabouts; I\u2019d look through the box we\u2019d found in the storage unit.</p><p>When the waitress topped off coffee and brought the check, I put a couple of dollars on the table for my orange juice. Damien looked up at me with irritation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t cover your orange juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea whether you can cover my orange juice,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t expect anyone else to pay my way.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, considering. \u201cI wondered if you\u2019d expect it.\u201d</p><p>Jeff whistled low in warning, aware of the sensitive spot Damien had poked. My father may have been wealthy, but I\u2019d worked my way through college and grad school, and I\u2019d bled, quite literally, for the pay I\u2019d earned as Sentinel. I had the scars and aching cheekbone to show for it. I wasn\u2019t thrilled I had to defend myself against others\u2019 assumptions, but such was life as the daughter of a real estate mogul. I\u2019d grown up with enough of an advantage that I could suck it up.</p><p>\u201cI make my own way,\u201d I quietly said, not taking my eyes from his. If he wanted to confirm the truth, he could read it in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy bad,\u201d Damien said, and I nodded back, the momentary build of tension dissipating again.</p><p>I cleared my throat, thinking my moment had come while the guys sipped their coffee. \u201cI need a few minutes to take care of something.\u201d</p><p>They both looked at me curiously, so I broke out the ultimate weapon, the errand it seemed nearly guaranteed they\u2019d want to avoid.</p> <p>\u201cI need to run down to the grocery store at the other end of the shopping center. We left Chicago in a hurry, and I need to grab a few things.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cA few personal items.\u201d</p><p>Vampire or not, the mention of unspecified \u201cpersonal items\u201d was uncomfortable enough to send both of them\u2014the tech genius and the rugged shifter\u2014into awkward foot shuffling and throat clearing.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll drink our coffee and wait for you here,\u201d Damien said, raising his mug to his lips.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d Jeff agreed, and I left them in the booth, doctoring their drinks with extra attentiveness and trying not to consider what personal items, precisely, I needed.</p><p>None, of course. What I needed was at the carnival.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I grabbed my katana from the car, thankfully unlocked, and glanced at my phone. I had ten minutes until the meet. Figuring I\u2019d need evidence when I joined the guys later, I followed the sidewalk across the shopping center to the grocery store, where I bought gum and an energy bar, then wrapped up the bag and stuffed it into my jacket.</p><p>Humans in coats still milled around the carnival, holding cheap stuffed animals and knickknacks they\u2019d won on the midway. Some enjoyed cotton candy; others tore pieces of steaming funnel cake from paper plates, their shirts and fingers dotted with a spray of powdered sugar.</p><p>I walked down the small midway, barkers begging me to throw a hoop or a baseball or use a water gun to take down a target, probably weighted, that wouldn\u2019t move unless the barker wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re looking for excitement. I think you\u2019ve come to the right place.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at the woman who\u2019d called out, not to me but to a middle-aged man whose wife looked doubtfully over the entire event.</p><p>She was petite, with gray eyes, dimples at both cheeks, and long, wavy, brown hair tucked into a braid that fell over her shoulder. Her bangs fell in a neat trim just above her eyebrows, and a tiny hat was perched coquettishly to one side. She wore a button-up shirt with old-fashioned trousers and suspenders, the pants rolled up to reveal tidy boots with lots of buttons and argyle socks.</p><p>She stood in front of the Tunnel of Horrors, where a small car on rails disappeared behind a giant mural depicting a classic Count Dracula character, a mummy, and Frankenstein\u2019s monster.</p><p>The man, blushing as the barker tucked her arm into his, looked back at his wife. \u201cWhat do you think, hon? Should we do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only five bucks,\u201d said the barker, winking knowingly at the man\u2019s wife. \u201cThat\u2019s cheaper than a cup of coffee these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>The wife sighed, then pulled a bill from her jeans pocket and handed it over. The attendant grinned, dimples alight, and pressed a kiss to the man\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Blushing furiously, he climbed with his wife into the tiny car, which lurched forward, sending them into darkness.</p><p>I kept moving before the woman decided I was her next victim, wandering to a quiet spot where I watched a blade-shaped ride flip passengers into the air.</p><p>\u201cMerit.\u201d</p><p>I glanced beside me, found Lakshmi at my side. She was absolutely gorgeous, tall and slender, with dark skin and long, dark hair that waved at the bottom. She wore trousers and heels beneath a slim, taxi-yellow trench coat buttoned and tied at the waist.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for meeting me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much time I\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, and I\u2019ll get right to it. We have reached an unusual time, Merit. A precarious time. Two members of the GP are dead.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd the present leadership is weak.\u201d She meant Darius, the current head of the GP.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>She linked her hands together and rested her forearms on the gate, her gaze on the ride as it rotated. \u201cLeading the GP requires a certain cachet, a certain attitude. Due to recent events, Darius has lost both. It\u2019s time for him to step down. And that brings us to the favor.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, paused for a moment, and then let loose the request she\u2019d flown nearly four thousand miles to make.</p><p>\u201cI want Ethan to challenge Darius for the head of the GP. And I want you to convince him to do it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>DEEP-FRIED TRUTH</p><p>My heart and head went numb, shocked by the request.</p><p>She wanted Ethan to challenge, outright, the head of the GP? I couldn\u2019t imagine anybody, much less Darius, would take kindly to the idea. Just by trying to leave the GP we\u2019d ended up with murder at our doorstep. We were still dealing with the fallout from that decision, which was why I was at a carnival in Loring Park, Illinois, in the freezing air of February.</p><p>And then there was the other issue: The GP was in London. Ethan would have to go there, live there, and work there while I stayed in Chicago, honor bound to serve Cadogan House.</p><p>My heart jumped in my throat. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even part of the GP anymore,\u201d I said. That was the only defense I could think of, the only words I could put together.</p><p>\u201cNot the GP as it was before,\u201d she said, turning to lean back against the railing. There was a glimmer of strategic excitement in her eyes. She and Ethan had that in common.</p><p>\u201cThe GP as it could be. A different kind of organization. A federation of Houses, not a dictatorship. And not led by a vampire who lords himself over the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>I almost snorted. If she didn\u2019t think Ethan would lord himself over the rest of us as head of the GP, perhaps she didn\u2019t know Ethan as well as she thought.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019d try to take control?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019d impose his will on the Houses?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head at me, an expression that reminded me she was a vampire\u2014a predator\u2014of repute. \u201cYou would convince me he\u2019s ill suited for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so stubborn that you aren\u2019t in a relationship with him.\u201d</p><p>She had a point, so I tried a different tack. \u201cHe has enemies, and challenging Darius would only make more.\u201d</p><p>Lakshmi nodded gravely. \u201cThe road would not be easy. Ethan has enemies, certainly. His campaign would be difficult. There would be many to convince, to bring to his side. Travails to overcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat travails, exactly?\u201d The Canon had been shady about the process of getting a new king.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d have to demonstrate his worth and fitness for the position. Convince the Prelect\u2019s council he is worthy of the task, that he is powerful and strong.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. Harold Monmonth had been the Prelect. And we all knew how that had ended up.</p><p>\u201cAnd then the Houses vote,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat all assumes Darius steps down peacefully.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, acknowledging that. \u201cThere is no point in being coy. Ethan would have opponents from the beginning to the end. But he is worth the battle. He\u2019d bring peace and honor to the GP, which have been lacking of late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Handy, I thought, that she was a member of the GP. Bringing honor to the organization would help her\u2014raise esteem for her and the rest of them. Bring her power that she\u2019d lost in the recent drama.</p><p>But there was power, and then there was power . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy not run yourself?\u201d</p> <p>She slipped her hands into the trim pockets of her coat. \u201cBecause I\u2019m too young. Because Ethan has more allies\u2014even those who don\u2019t have insignia above his door. They know him. They don\u2019t know me. And there are . . . skeletons in my closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkeletons?\u201d I asked without moving, like she was an animal I might frighten away.</p><p>But she was wise enough to avoid the trap. \u201cMy life is no concern of yours, Novitiate. We all have our secrets to bear.\u201d She looked at me for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him. I can hear it in your words, see it in your eyes. The fear of loss.\u201d</p><p>I waited a beat, unsure of her motives, and nodded. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flattened. There was a different kind of predator in her eyes now. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only vampire that needs him. We are endangered, and you must consider whether your needs as an individual are more important than the needs of your House, the Chicago Houses, the American Houses, all the Houses in the GP. Ethan Sullivan, I believe, has the opportunity to become a Master of Masters. And consider this: If Ethan doesn\u2019t become the new head of the GP, who will?\u201d</p> <p>We looked at each other for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re in Chicago because the GP wants to extract some price of the House. What is that price?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me for a moment, taking my measure. And, I belatedly realized, sending her soft and delicate tendrils of glamour, sweeping curls of it, to test me and my defenses. My endurance. My stubbornness. Fortunately, I had some immunity to that kind of magic.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she concluded, \u201cis also not for your ears.\u201d She put a hand on mine. \u201cThis will not be an easy road to travel. I understand that. But it is the right road. I know you understand that and will make the right decision.\u201d</p><p>With that, she tucked her hands back into her pockets and turned toward the exit, her heels clacking on the asphalt with every step. After a moment, she disappeared into the crowd, leaving me in a sea of humans with worry in my heart.</p><p>I did the only thing I could think of. I grabbed my phone and dialed up my partner.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Jonah said. \u201cMerit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLakshmi\u2019s here. In Loring Park. She came to talk to me.\u201d The words flooded out.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201chold on a minute.\u201d I heard him speak, murmuring to others around him, and then a door opened and closed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was in our ops room,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about Lakshmi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came here to talk to me. I owe her a favor because she gave us information about the location of the dragon\u2019s egg.\u201d The Faberge-style egg had been a gift from fairies to Peter Cadogan, the House\u2019s founder. On the GP\u2019s orders, Monmonth had stolen it in order to bribe the fairies to war with Cadogan. He\u2019d been successful, which was another mark against him.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd much like the Grim Reaper, she\u2019s come to collect. What did she ask for?\u201d</p><p>It took me a moment to put the words together, because once I said them aloud, they\u2019d be true. \u201cShe wants Ethan to challenge Darius for his spot on the GP. And she wants me to convince him to do it.\u201d</p><p>There was silence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I think about that.\u201d</p> <p>I knew what I thought. Both sides of it. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t tell her no\u2014I can\u2019t piss off our best ally on the GP. But I can\u2019t help her.\u201d And, most important, I couldn\u2019t send Ethan to London.</p><p>I sat down on a bench bookended by a dead shrub and a pile of dirty snow, which seemed about right. \u201cHe may very well want to do it. But I can\u2019t just demand he undertake that kind of risk. And he can\u2019t do it right now, anyway. We\u2019re stuck here until Chicago comes to its senses.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be willing to go out with her? Sweeten her into giving up that favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to pimp myself to make your life easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, yes. Could you?\u201d I asked, feigning hopefulness.</p><p>His voice was flat. \u201cNo. And I hate to say it, Mer, but her idea\u2019s not bad. Ethan\u2019s old, he\u2019s powerful, and he\u2019s got friends. He\u2019s one of the few vampires out there who\u2019d actually use all that power and political capital for good.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t disagree that he\u2019d be good at it, that he\u2019d be good for vampires. But I\u2019d be suborning the overthrow of the GP, a ground-up revolution, with Ethan as Paul Revere and George Washington rolled into one. The last American Revolution had been successful in stripping away England\u2019s rule. But I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d get lucky a second time around. And my job was to keep him safe.</p><p>I\u2019d also have to give him up. For the greater good, perhaps, but he\u2019d be gone nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Jonah asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. How does a person decide something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your very good brain and your very good heart,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep me posted.\u201d</p><p>I promised I would, and hoped I\u2019d have good news to share.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I pulled the prop grocery bag from my pocket and walked back to the restaurant, using the strip mall as a windbreak. Fears flitted through my mind like dancers.</p><p>London. Treason. Rebellion.</p><p>I remembered the first time I\u2019d been near Ethan, when he knelt behind me, bit my neck, and changed me into a vampire. I remembered the first time I\u2019d really seen him, when Mallory and I had barged into Cadogan House. I remembered the night Celina had thrown an aspen stake at me and he\u2019d stepped forward to intercept it, turning to ash before my eyes. I remembered the night I\u2019d seen him emerge from the smoke and destruction that Mallory had wrought, alive once again.</p><p>We\u2019d overcome vampires, monsters, death, and each other. And now I was honor bound to send him to war . . . and to London. Thousands of miles away from Cadogan House.</p><p>Thousands of miles away from us. I couldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>On the other hand, how could I not? The GP was tyrannous. Dictatorial and cruel. They\u2019d ignored Celina\u2019s antics, blamed the House for everything that went wrong in Chicago. They\u2019d sent a sadist to live in the House and demanded we prove our obedience with blood and fire. They\u2019d extorted money, killed humans, and tried to kill us when we hadn\u2019t followed the party line.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t I obliged not just to encourage him, but to do everything I could to help him actually win? Ethan was honorable, fair, dedicated. He believed humans were more than cattle and that all supernaturals should get a fair shake. He knew how to make alliances, avoided making enemies whenever possible. He was willing to take a stand, but also to compromise. He knew the value of both.</p><p>He\u2019d make an inarguably good addition to the GP. And while there was little doubt Malik would make a fantastic Master in Ethan\u2019s absence\u2014he was doing it now\u2014I didn\u2019t want Ethan to be absent. I wanted him here, with me, being cheeky and jealous and fighting at my side. I wanted his intelligence and snark and sarcasm. I wanted him.</p><p>I paused and wondered, just for a moment, what it would be like to snap my fingers and become someone else. Bizarro Merit, the evil or twisted version of myself. Bizarro Merit would have her own agenda. Bizarro Merit wouldn\u2019t encourage Ethan to run for the GP, or tell him that Lakshmi had suggested the idea. She\u2019d snap her fingers, send the GP into a parallel universe, and warp space-time so she could spend immortality with Ethan and a book on the deck of a boat on Lake Michigan.</p><p>While I stood there, engaged in my fantasy, the hairs on the back of my neck lifted, piqued by something . . . magical?</p><p>I ignored the quick punch of fear. Without moving my head, I scanned the area around me. I was facing down the length of the shopping center, but other than the usual traffic in and out of the parking lot, nothing looked unusual.</p><p>Looks, I knew, could be deceiving, so I closed my eyes, let the breath flow out of me, and allowed the sensations of the world to drip back into my consciousness.</p><p>Sound became a roar\u2014moving cars, the squeak of carnival rides, the slide of the automatic door at the grocery store, the faraway whispers of humans . . . and the nearby shush of fabric. And now that I was paying attention, I sensed the faint, tart smell of magic. Fresh, green, vegetal.</p><p>Someone was here. And I needed a look.</p><p>I closed the barriers again and pulled out my phone, feigning sudden interest in it, but sliding my gaze to the store window beside me.</p><p>She was behind me, probably fifteen feet, mostly hidden behind a concrete pillar.</p><p>I didn\u2019t recognize her, or even what she was. She looked physically similar to the mercenary fairies who\u2019d once guarded the gate at Cadogan House. Tall and slender, with a lean face and hollows beneath her sharp cheekbones. But her chin was more sharply pointed, her eyes larger and rounder, dominated by huge, dark irises. Her hair was dark, closely cropped, forming curled wisps around her face.</p><p>She wore a simple dark tunic with a keyhole collar and match- ing pants, the fabric nubby and homespun. She didn\u2019t look like a threat . . . until I turned to face her.</p><p>Wheeee.</p><p>Whistling like a bottle rocket, a three-foot-long arrow flew into the empty planter on the ledge beside me.</p><p>My mouth went as dry as dirt.</p><p>The shaft of the arrow, pale and slender, with stripes of gold and teal, ivory feathers slitted into the end, vibrated from the movement.</p><p>Slowly, I glanced back over my shoulder.</p><p>Now a man stood behind me, also in a dark tunic and with short hair, a four-foot-long recursive bow in hand, an arrow tipped with a shiny silver point already strung and taut. The fingers that held the bow were long and thin, ending in long and equally sharp nails.</p><p>Had the circumstances been different, I might have admired the weapon. It was carved of pale wood and beautifully curvy. Unless the shafts were made of aspen, being shot by an arrow wouldn\u2019t kill me. But that didn\u2019t mean I was looking forward to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glanced back, looking for egress, but they\u2019d been joined by another woman and man. It was four to one, and my allies were still tucked in a restaurant down the road.</p><p>The odds were not in my favor, but I put on my fighting face\u2014a haughty expression punctuated by a hell of a lot of feigned bravado.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll want to lower your weapon, friends. And explain why you\u2019re following me.\u201d</p> <p>The man watched me silently without blinking. I could read nothing in his eyes. They were too dark, too glassy, too shielded. \u201cYou have made war against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have attacked the People. You have breached our trust and our pact. We claim the right of retribution.\u201d</p><p>Completely flummoxed, I evaluated my chances while trying to ferret out what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t attacked anyone. We were attacked last night. A squadron of harpies struck from the air.\u201d Keeping my eyes on them, I flipped the thumb guard on my katana.</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d came the prim voice of the woman who\u2019d followed me. \u201cHarpies are imaginary creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were made of magic. And we lost four in the battle. I\u2019m not sure what happened to you, but it wasn\u2019t because of us.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s gaze narrowed. He pulled the bow tauter, raising his arms so the arrow pointed directly at my heart. Apparently, he meant to skewer me here and now, in front of\u2014I glanced at the store beside us\u2014Pilchuk Mufflers, which, according to the carefully painted storefront, had four convenient metro locations to serve all your muffler needs.</p><p>It would be ignominious to die, I thought, sprawled on the sidewalk in front of Pilchuk Mufflers. So I decided not to.</p><p>\u201cHarpies!\u201d I yelled out, shifting their attention just long enough to move. I dropped and punched the bowman in the kneecap, drawing a groan and enough distraction that he let the arrow fly over my head.</p><p>I pulled my sword, raked the biting edge against his shins. Blood, thin and shockingly green, spilled through the new slit in his leggings and dripped to the ground. He roared in pain, eyes wide in fury that I\u2019d had the temerity to fight back\u2014and that I\u2019d managed to nick him.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again.</p><p>Before I could move, he kicked, his boot connecting with my abdomen and sending a wave of pain and nausea. I nearly retched on the sidewalk but managed to roll enough so his second shot just grazed me.</p><p>Then I was violently hauled to my feet, dropping my katana in the process. I found myself staring back into the eyes of the man.</p><p>His orbed black eyes were wild with fury. I brought up a knee, trying to catch him in the groin, but my aim was off and he blocked the blow with a shift of his knee.</p><p>He slapped me. The world wavered, and my mouth filled with blood.</p><p>Someone behind me pulled my ponytail, wrenching back my head with a hot flush of pain that spilled down my neck like boiling water. My head upside down, I saw the first woman behind me, a feline smile on her face.</p><p>She wrapped her arm around my neck and squeezed. Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t find air at all. Panic struck, my vision dimming on the edges as my legs kicked backward, as I tried to free myself from her vicious grip and find air again.</p><p>This is the way the world ends, I thought, and the world went black.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I woke in darkness, gasping for air. It took moments to realize that I was alive, my head still attached, but my neck sore and probably bruised. My throat ached, and my head felt unusually heavy. I couldn\u2019t see anything around me. If I could, I imagined it would be spinning.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t dead. Which was completely unexpected.</p><p>I also didn\u2019t think I was in front of Pilchuk Mufflers. Shapes and faint colors began to emerge in the darkness. I lay on a braided rug on the dirt floor of a small round room. The walls were made of pale birch saplings strapped together, and a conical roof was built above it, rising to a point in the middle of the ceiling. The remains of a fire sat in a depression in the middle of the room, and the entire space vibrated with low and malignant magic.</p><p>\u201cMerit?\u201d</p><p>It was Jeff\u2019s voice, and I nearly wept with relief.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered, but my voice was scratchy, hoarse. I rubbed my throat, swallowed past parched lips, and tried again. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I pushed myself up on an elbow, looking through the darkness. My hands and feet were bound by large silver manacles and chains tethered to a large metal hook in the dirt floor.</p><p>Jeff and Damien sat a few feet beside each other, bound in the same silver chains. Their faces were bruised. Jeff\u2019s right eye was cut and swollen, and the air carried the peppery scent of blood. They were hurt, but they were alive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d I asked. My words were scratchy but clear enough.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Damien agreed. But his eyes looked a little woozy and unfocused, which couldn\u2019t have been good. \u201cSilver chains. And silver-tipped arrows.\u201d He nodded toward a dark spot of blood near the crux of his left shoulder.</p><p>Not all myths about supernaturals were accurate, but it appeared the shape-shifter weakness to silver was right on.</p><p>I glanced at Jeff, who nodded. \u201cGlad you\u2019re awake,\u201d he said with a sheepish grin, which belied the worry in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure,\u201d Damien said. \u201cWe were out when they brought us here. Farther from the carnival\u2014I can\u2019t smell it.\u201d</p><p>He was right. The air smelled woody, smoky. \u201cIn the forest,\u201d I guessed. But there was a lot of forest near Loring Park, so that didn\u2019t narrow it down much.</p><p>\u201cThey got you at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>Damien nodded. \u201cOutside it. We were looking for you. When you didn\u2019t come back, we got worried. Where\u2019d they get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking back to the restaurant.\u201d I considered Lakshmi\u2019s visit to be RG business, which made it none of the Pack\u2019s. \u201cThey were following me. And when I confronted them, they pounced. How long was I unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one in the morning,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>We\u2019d been gone for a few hours. Ethan would be in a panic. I called his name, tried to activate the link between us, but couldn\u2019t reach him. He was too far away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElves,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what they looked like. They\u2019re relatives of the fairies\u2014mutated relatives. They look even less human, so they had an even harder time assimilating. They call themselves the People. Believe they are the highest order of sentient beings. Everyone else is Other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly Europeans found them, hunted them down,\u201d Damien continued, looking around, wincing when the move strained his shoulder. \u201cThey were believed extinct. Looks like that\u2019s fundamentally wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must have migrated,\u201d Damien said. \u201cBut how did we not know they were here?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the carefully constructed room, the gaps between the saplings neatly filled with mud or daub. This place hadn\u2019t been built yesterday; the elves had been here for some time. Which made me also wonder how the shifters had missed them.</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d I suggested, but that didn\u2019t seem to satisfy Damien, who shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what they want?\u201d Jeff asked me.</p><p>\u201cThey said they were attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the harpies?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThe ones that jumped me said harpies were imaginary. They thought I was lying.\u201d</p><p>Sounds rose outside\u2014shrieks and pounding feet. Instinctively, I pulled at my chains, seeking freedom.</p><p>Sentinel?</p><p>My head darted up, searching for the sound of his voice in my head. Ethan? Are you here? We\u2019re chained.</p><p>Working on it, he told me. I\u2019ve brought your army.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s up,\u201d Damien said, glancing at the noise that was beginning to shake the walls of our prison.</p><p>\u201cEthan\u2019s here. He said he\u2019s brought an army.\u201d</p><p>Before I could answer, a door on the other side of the room was shoved open. Three elves, the man from before and two new men, walked in. Without speaking or acknowledging our existence, they unlinked the chains that bound us to the floor. But they didn\u2019t unchain our bound hands and feet.</p><p>They yanked us to our feet and pushed us outside.</p><p>It was dark, the bits of sky visible through the canopy of limbs still indigo. But that was the only thing that made sense. We were in a wood, the trees stripped bare by winter.</p><p>We were also in a village.</p><p>Structures, cylindrical like the one we\u2019d just stepped out of, filled every clearing in the woods around us, white smoke puffing from the openings in the conical roofs. Footholds had been cut into the tree trunks, and smaller structures hung from the trees. The structures looked old. Comfortable and lived in, with rough-hewn tools hanging along the exteriors and green linens strung across lines that extended between the trees. This wasn\u2019t a camp; it was a neighborhood.</p><p>The elves were everywhere. Hundreds of men and women, all approximately middle-aged, trim and fit in the same tunics, either running toward the sounds of battle with slicked bows in hand, or battening down their simple homesteads. Untying lines of laundry, carrying steaming cooking pots into their homes.</p><p>There was an entire city of elves tucked into the woods outside Chicago and no one had seen it? No one had discovered them? How was that possible?</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even have time to welcome them to the neighborhood with muffins,\u201d Jeff murmured beside me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get muffins, either,\u201d I pointed out, trying to keep some levity.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you then. We get out of this, I\u2019ll get you a muffin.\u201d He tried for a smile, so I tried back.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d said the man from the shopping center, pulling my katana from the scabbard he\u2019d belted around his waist.</p><p>I generally preferred not to be poked with my own sword, and certainly not by the very person who\u2019d taken it from me. He yanked my arm, pulling me forward. Since we were moving toward the sounds, I didn\u2019t fight back. They were taking me precisely where I wanted to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With Damien and Jeff stumbling behind us, we walked the narrow path through the trees and up a low rise, which gave way to a snowy field, still dotted with the remains of last year\u2019s cornstalks . . . and marked by the columns of the invading army.</p><p>They\u2019d found us.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>THE SPOILS OF WAR</p><p>There were hundreds of shifters, some in NAC jackets, some in animal form. All behind the front line\u2014which consisted of the Keenes, Nick, Ethan, Catcher, and Mallory\u2014and waiting for orders.</p><p>Ethan searched the marching bulk, body stilling when he finally saw me, as he took in the chains on my ankles and whatever concoction of blood and dirt had stiffened on my face. His body went rigid, his eyes hot with fury, and I feared he\u2019d begin the charge himself, ripping through elves in order to punish them for my injuries.</p><p>I\u2019m fine, I assured him, hoping to delay First Blood, and glad he couldn\u2019t hear the hoarseness in my voice.</p><p>Sentinel, he crisply said. You\u2019ve managed to get yourself into trouble again.</p> <p>They nabbed me as I was walking down the sidewalk, I assured him. And I think the Canon needs updating.</p><p>Evidently, he responded, and there was a gravelly edge to his voice.</p><p>How did you find us?</p><p>Damien sent an alert before he was taken. The shifters scented out the rest of it.</p><p>The elf\u2019s fingers still wrapped tightly around my arm, we marched forward, creating another line of troops. Behind us echoed the muted and rhythmic thud of boots on soil. The elves had their own army, and quarters had been called.</p><p>They stretched out beside us, shifting their short rows to form three long lines with Rockette-level precision. They raised their bows and tucked arrows into the strings, the silver arrowheads glinting in the moonlight, the air thick with tension and magic.</p> <p>Our escort pushed us to our knees, where we knelt on hard, frozen ground in front of our colleagues and loved ones, enemies at our backs, weapons in their hands.</p><p>Ethan looked calmly at the elves, his body stiff and hiding the fear and anger that I knew ripped at him. But fear was a nasty motivator, and we didn\u2019t need another supernatural war brewing outside Chicago. Not when events there were tense enough.</p><p>They were attacked, I told Ethan. And they think we\u2014the Pack and vampires\u2014were the culprits. They followed us, took us in. They must have been waiting for an opportunity to get us alone.</p><p>Ethan murmured to Gabriel beside him, probably offering the intel.</p><p>\u201cYou have breached our peace,\u201d said the elf. \u201cYou shed First Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have shed no blood,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWe were attacked last night without provocation. Several members of our Pack were injured. Four are dead.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to register with the elf. \u201cOne of ours is gone. We seek retribution in equal kind.\u201d</p><p>As if those words were enough to justify murder, he lifted the sword ominously.</p> <p>I braced to move, to fight back, but Ethan beat me to it. He unsheathed his katana, catching the moonlight like Excalibur might have. And he was Arthur, blond and strong and proud, willing to destroy a kingdom for his Guinevere.</p><p>\u201cYou make one move with that sword,\u201d Ethan said, stepping forward, eyes furiously green, \u201cand you\u2019ll have every vampire in the world hunting you down. Beginning with me.\u201d</p><p>The elf\u2019s eyes narrowed with keen pleasure, as if the thought of taking on a vampire\u2014or a world of them\u2014was a prize, not a threat.</p><p>But Gabriel wasn\u2019t keen on the destruction of his kingdom, his Pack, or his allies. He put a calming hand on Ethan\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cIf you commit violence,\u201d Gabriel said to the elf, \u201cyou will breach the contract between us.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyes narrowed, and while he didn\u2019t speak to me, it was easy to guess the line of his thought. The Pack had a contract with a species that wasn\u2019t supposed to exist\u2014which had apparently created a village just outside Chicago\u2014and no one had bothered to tell us about it.</p><p>\u201cYou breached the pact first,\u201d the elf said again, his voice growing irritable and sounding not unlike an ornery child. \u201cWe claim the right of retribution.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel watched him for a moment, considered. \u201cSupport your claim.\u201d And when Ethan began to protest, Gabriel held up a hand. \u201cI would hear precisely how the elves believe we wronged them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was glamour,\u201d the elf said, damning me with a look. Glamour was the particular magic of vampires\u2014the mythical ability to seduce and control others. But the ability to glamour varied significantly from vampire to vampire. Ironically, I couldn\u2019t glamour worth a damn.</p><p>\u201cWe were together for our midday meal,\u201d the elf continued. \u201cWe\u2019d just taken our mead when the fog began to thicken.\u201d</p><p>That was a strong defense for me and Ethan. Fog or not, midday meant sunlight.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of fog?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cMist,\u201d the elf said, looking up, posing the word as a half question. It was a guess, and one about which he still had doubts. \u201cThick. And there was magic in it.\u201d</p><p>The elf\u2019s eyes went slightly out of focus, as if he was remembering precisely what he\u2019d seen\u2014and how it had felt. \u201cMagic that swayed. Magic that seduced. It invited,\u201d he said, eyes focusing on me again. \u201cIt propositioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were propositioned by magic mist?\u201d Gabriel mildly asked.</p><p>The elf looked back at him, glared, and ignored the question, continuing with his story. \u201cWe were overpowered by the magic, by the glamour. Like the undead, without control of ourselves or our bodies. We were drunk with magic and made senseless by it. Some lost awareness of the world. Some fought.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed visibly and clearly was uncomfortable. \u201cSome copulated, there in the middle of the feast, rutting like animals. We are not prudes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this was not about mating, about strengthening the clan. There was no lust in their eyes. No love. Only death.\u201d</p><p>I slid Jeff a quick glance, and he acknowledged with a small nod. We\u2019d seen those flat eyes before, in the harpies who\u2019d attacked the first night of Lupercalia.</p><p>This time, sympathy slid through my irritation. However incorrect the elf\u2019s conclusions about the cause of the trauma, there was no doubt his people had been violated.</p><p>\u201cI do not remember all of it; most of us do not. But we recognized its insidiousness. It was glamour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the First Blood?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cNiera,\u201d the elf said. \u201cOne of the mothers of our clan. We awoke some hours later when the sun was nearly set, half naked, violated. She was gone. Her house was empty.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cIf she is missing, how do you know First Blood was shed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElves do not leave the clan,\u201d the elf insisted. \u201cMothers do not leave the clan.\u201d He smoothed a hand down the front of his tunic, seemed to soothe himself. \u201cBecause she would not leave us, First Blood was shed. Thereby, our claim is justified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot against us,\u201d I said. My throat was still raw, the words hoarse, but the sound carried on the wind well enough.</p><p>\u201cYou have a claim against those who attacked you. We were not those people, and you\u2019re in the wrong.\u201d</p><p>The elf reached out to slap me for the second time, but I\u2019d grown tired of the show. I was a vampire and, more important, a woman who\u2019d rather go down with steel than with cowardice.</p><p>I reached up, punched his forearm to force him to release my katana. My hands were still bound, but I stretched the manacles as far as I could and just managed to snatch the dropping katana with my other hand. I jumped to my feet, spun the sword in hand, and waited.</p><p>I heard Ethan\u2019s warning in my head\u2014Sentinel!\u2014but it was too late for that. Spurred by my audacity, the elves formed a tight circle around me and Jeff and Damien, a thousand arrows pointed in our direction.</p><p>I ignored the welling fear and considered my odds, estimating I had a forty percent chance of taking out an elf or two before they took me out. I gave myself a four percent chance of surviving the fight.</p><p>\u201cSteady now,\u201d Damien murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you see?\u201d the elf said, gesturing at us. \u201cDo you see the violence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a woman attempting to protect herself against false allegations,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cAll due respect, you\u2019re wrong. If the attack happened midday, vampires could not be responsible. They cannot face the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fog\u2014,\u201d the elf said, but Gabriel stopped him with a hand.</p><p>\u201cIt is irrelevant. A little moisture does not protect a vampire from sun. Besides\u2014they were in our facility during the day under lock and key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are also Other,\u201d the elf said with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cOther and mourning our dead,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cWe were attacked and put four of our own in the ground. Whatever happened here, we had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>The elf looked at Gabriel and considered the evidence. Wrong or not, he was in a bad spot. If he backed down, he looked like a coward. If he authorized his elves to let fly their arrows, he\u2019d truly break the contract with the Pack.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a truce,\u201d Gabriel offered.</p><p>The elf looked suspicious. \u201cOf what manner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth our clans have been attacked by magic. Those attacks might be related. We are part of the human world, and we are investigating the attack. We will continue to do so. If Niera cannot be found, there is nothing we can do. But if she did not leave by choice, if she was taken, we will find her, and we will bring her home to you. And that will resolve the perceived breach.\u201d</p><p>The elf glanced back across his army. I didn\u2019t know if they could communicate telepathically, but he seemed to seek their input.</p><p>\u201cWe accede to your request,\u201d he said, turning to Gabriel again. \u201cYou will send a messenger under flag, and we will meet you here again and receive our mother. If this matter is resolved to our satisfaction, the clan will fade into the canopy again.</p><p>\u201cBut if it is not\u2014if you protect murderers or engage in more treachery\u2014the d\u00e9tente between our clans will be nullified. We will not fade, nor will we share this land that we inhabited before the rest set foot upon the soil. All of our clans will come forth. All of our villages will be visible once again. And humanity will pay for the transgressions that have accumulated in the meantime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The elves closest to us unlocked our chains with small keys they pulled from leather cords around their necks. Damien and Jeff stood again, grimacing as they rubbed the spots on their wrists where the shackles had chafed. Even in the dark, it was easy to see the skin beneath was mottled and red, irritated by the silver.</p><p>The rest of the army released the tension from their bowstrings and dropped the arrows back into the leather quivers strapped to their backs. They all stood straight again, turned on their heels, and disappeared into the woods.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Their departure left the three of us, wounded and exhausted, looking back at the army who\u2019d come to save us.</p><p>Ignoring the shifters around him, Ethan stalked toward me, lifted me up, and buried his face in my neck, releasing the tension he\u2019d been holding while an army of elves surrounded his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cThank Christ, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t generally object to public displays of affection, but we were surrounded by hard-bitten shifters, and embarrassment bloomed in my cheeks.</p><p>Ethan pressed a hard kiss to my lips, leaving little doubt of the ravishment he intended at a more appropriate time. He released me, saw the pink in my cheeks, and smiled. \u201cLet them see, Sentinel. I\u2019ve no interest in hiding my affections.\u201d</p> <p>We weren\u2019t the only sups in the mood for reunion. Tanya checked Damien\u2019s wounds while her sister stood shyly beside her, clearly not sure if she should step forward or if her attentions would be welcome. But Damien had eyes only for her. His dark brow was furrowed, his dark gaze focused on the girl\u2019s face, his expression intense and needy. I guessed the prospect of battle had sped his blood.</p><p>Jeff and Fallon talked quietly nearby. She pushed his hair behind his ears and inspected his face, the movements equally efficient and tender. As the second oldest in the Keene family, I guessed she\u2019d taken care of her share of scrapes.</p><p>\u201cHealing begins with loved ones,\u201d Ethan whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d I said, squeezing his hand.</p><p>Gabriel walked to us.</p><p>\u201cIs Lupercalia usually this exciting?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cOnly when vampires are about. You two have a unique way of inciting trouble.\u201d</p><p>I smiled a little at the attempt at humor, but Ethan\u2019s gaze was heavy and accusing. Gabriel had withheld information, and Ethan wasn\u2019t happy about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak with you,\u201d Ethan murmured, low and threatening.</p><p>\u201cWhen the opportunity permits,\u201d Gabriel said. He turned to walk toward Damien, but Ethan grabbed his arm. The look in Gabe\u2019s eyes was deadly. He cast a glance at Ethan\u2019s hand like it was an alien thing, as if no one had ever attempted to grab him bodily.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Sullivan,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cCareful?\u201d Ethan gritted out, jaw clenched and anger radiating off his body like heat off asphalt in summer. \u201cMy Sentinel was accosted, beaten, marched, and nearly beheaded in front of your shifters. She was held at arrow point\u2014kidnapped from a public place\u2014because you failed to mention the elves were alive and living in our backyard.\u201d</p><p>Since I\u2019d held my own, I silently objected to \u201cnearly beheaded\u201d but found the rest of it accurate enough.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s jaw twitched, his eyes swirling like a warming brandy. \u201cNow is not the time or place to discuss these matters,\u201d he said, which made me wonder how much he\u2019d kept from the rest of the Pack.</p> <p>I took the opportunity to glance around, check the faces of the shifters, who still looked shell-shocked that an army of elves shared their territory. Whatever Gabe had known, he hadn\u2019t shared it with the rest of the Pack. And I guessed that omission was going to require some reckoning.</p><p>Ethan swallowed down irritation and released Gabriel\u2019s arm. The tension eased, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Ethan bit out, \u201cwould be an opportune time to discuss what just happened, and the fact that my Sentinel was kidnapped by elves?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel watched him for a moment, his face offering nothing. \u201cI need to speak to my people. Wait for me at the house.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Ethan to respond.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Gabriel arranged for Damien and Jeff to get the car\u2014and Boo\u2014which still waited at the restaurant. The rest of us drove back to the estate in the variety of vehicles the Pack had used to get to the wood.</p><p>This time, neither the Brecks nor anyone else stopped us when we walked into the kitchen. The house was silent, the staff hiding or otherwise occupied.</p><p>Without waiting for permission, Ethan sat me bodily on a stool at the island while he searched the enormous, glass-doored refrigerator for sustenance. He pulled out two bottles of Blood4You, popped the tops on the edge of the counter like a frat boy at a mixer, and handed one to me.</p><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d he said, putting the other bottle down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need blood,\u201d I protested, but only weakly, as my stomach began to rumble from need. I wasn\u2019t exactly hungry\u2014my nerves were still too shot for that\u2014but my body was attempting to heal from the elves\u2019 abuse, and it wanted sustenance.</p><p>\u201cDrink it,\u201d Ethan said again, staring down at me until I lifted the bottle to my lips.</p><p>It was gone in seconds, and I replaced it with the second before he could argue.</p><p>Mallory and Catcher walked into the kitchen, and Mallory rushed over. \u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d she asked, scanning me for injuries.</p><p>\u201cA little bumped and bruised, but I\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you taken?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>\u201cShopping center in Loring Park. Four of them jumped me, bows and arrows right there in public view. They knocked me out\u2014a choke hold,\u201d I explained, touching my neck. The skin was no longer tender, but the muscle beneath still ached.</p><p>A wash of shifter magic flushed through the room like a moody tsunami, angry and tense. It left an uncomfortable prickle on my skin and made my clothes feel uncomfortably tight.</p><p>I rubbed my goosefleshed arms. \u201cWhat do you think\u2019s going on out there?\u201d</p><p>Ethan made a sympathetic sound. \u201cI imagine Gabriel is explaining to his Pack why he didn\u2019t mention the elves before tonight. Why he didn\u2019t mention the wolves at their door, no pun intended.\u201d</p><p>I finished the second bottle of blood, placed it on the counter beside the first. \u201cHow did they not notice it? The humans? The Brecks? A hunter, a farmer, a utility crew? Someone had to have seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d Catcher said with a shrug. \u201cA mechanism that allowed them to blend into the trees, or which obscured them completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA village of hundreds in Illinois,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one clan. If they came west from Ireland and Scotland, how many more clans might be sprinkled between here and the Atlantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery many,\u201d Catcher guessed. \u201cBut perhaps the better question\u2014how many of them have arrangements with the rest of the American Packs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably too goddamned many,\u201d Ethan said grimly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, too, Sullivan.\u201d Gabriel walked in alone, moved to a cabinet, and grabbed a bottle of whiskey with a plaid ribbon around its neck. He loosened the lid and took a slug directly from the bottle, throat moving as he swallowed. Maybe shifters had a different metabolism, as the quarter bottle he ingested would have put me on the floor. And maybe he was stressed enough to need it.</p><p>He put the bottle back in the cabinet, then braced his hands on the countertop and dropped his head. It was the second time in as many days he\u2019d let his guard down in front of us. I both appreciated the trust\u2014and regretted the need. Even with his back turned, it was obvious he was exhausted. His Pack had come to the Brecks\u2019 estate for camaraderie and fun. And they\u2019d met only threats, violence, and death.</p><p>We waited until Gabe stood straight again, running his hands through his hair and turning back to us.</p><p>\u201cThe contract was negotiated by my father. He told Papa Breck when the Brecks bought the property, thought it was only fair Papa Breck know who was living nearby. When my father passed, Papa Breck told me. I\u2019ve never even seen the elves until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain that\u2019s an excuse,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cNot for what my people and yours have been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe elves\u2019 interest is in keeping quiet, in staying underground. They were nearly eradicated. They wanted to live peacefully, and they have done so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil tonight,\u201d Ethan emphasized, voice firm. \u201cThey are barbarians. They protect their lands without regret, kill without remorse. They do not believe in weakness, and they don\u2019t overlook it. They don\u2019t believe in pity. They kill children they don\u2019t believe will flourish, men and women past their prime. They do not live peacefully. They wait.\u201d</p><p>The reference to children and the elderly made me think\u2014I hadn\u2019t seen either at the village. Everyone appeared to be in the prime of middle age. Maybe twenty-five to forty-five in human years. Anyone outside that group could have been indoors or hidden. Or perhaps they\u2019d been culled.</p><p>\u201cWe have no fight with them,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cBecause you have not seen them fight,\u201d Ethan insisted. There was hard experience in his eyes. He\u2019d been born in Sweden, had served his time as a soldier, and had nearly been killed because of it. He\u2019d also apparently been in Europe long enough to have seen elves there on the ground and know their practices.</p><p>\u201cI have seen battlefields littered with women and children. Ground they stained with blood. They attack without mercy, and they allow no survivors. That Merit, Jeff, and Damien were allowed to live today was a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it is proof that this clan is different from those which lived in Europe,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cHumans are different now, too. Humans fight differently, battle differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans battle with and through machines,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut that does not absolve them of their atrocities.\u201d</p><p>Mallory moved closer, catching both of their gazes. \u201cLet\u2019s pause,\u201d she said, and I felt a gentle nudge of calming magic. It was a nice thought, but considering the story the elves had told about nonconsensual magic, it just left me feeling uncomfortable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe elves are clearly here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf, for some reason, we can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on here in the larger sense, how bad could this get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could seek revenge for the wrongs they think have been done to them throughout history,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cThe elves release their magic, show their societies to the world, and there\u2019s human panic and genocide. What we saw tonight was only posturing,\u201d he softly added. \u201cDo not mistake their bows and arrows for a lack of savvy.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my face, trying to soothe the headache that was beginning to build there, then glanced at Gabriel. I didn\u2019t think he was the type to feel guilty, but there was obvious regret in his eyes. It was time for a little optimism\u2014or at least a little strategy.</p> <p>\u201cThen we need to ensure it doesn\u2019t get that bad,\u201d I said, meeting Gabriel\u2019s gaze. \u201cIf we do as they\u2019ve agreed\u2014find Niera and bring her back\u2014will they go back into the woods again?\u201d</p><p>He shared my gaze for a moment, then glanced at Ethan. \u201cSullivan?\u201d</p><p>The question was an obvious concession\u2014he was recognizing Ethan\u2019s expertise, looking to him for information.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how honorable they are,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cFear tends to make new enemies. But we\u2019ll assume they\u2019ll hold to his deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo team!\u201d I said with false cheer. As no one seemed moved by the faux enthusiasm, I waved it away. \u201cSo that\u2019s our solution. We find Niera. We have two attacks here\u2014one on shifters, one on elves. The first attack by harpies, which weren\u2019t supposed to exist in the first place. The second against elves, which weren\u2019t supposed to exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a coincidence?\u201d Mallory asked, face scrunched with the question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it seems significant. Harpies aren\u2019t an obvious weapon, and elves aren\u2019t an obvious target. So the person\u2014or people\u2014behind this have good information about supernaturals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo probably not a human,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cNot unless they have better knowledge than even you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you believe yourself to be quite knowledgeable.\u201d</p><p>Ethan arched an eyebrow. \u201cI resemble that remark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Catcher said, crossing his arms and leaning back into his stance, preparing for some serious consideration and analysis. \u201cKnowledge of supernaturals, and very serious intent. This isn\u2019t just a nymph pissed off because they ran a rubber-duck parade through the Chicago River without her approval.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t really happen,\u201d I said. But Catcher\u2019s flat look said different.</p><p>\u201cCould and did. And cost me a week\u2019s worth of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a slew of gift cards for the stores on State Street,\u201d Mallory said with a smile. \u201cI know what nymphs like,\u201d she added, in a singsong voice.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Catcher said, sliding her a glance, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a run-of-the-mill issue, a minor grudge between sups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a full-out attack in the first instance,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd something else in the second. The glamour the elves mentioned\u2014does it ring any bells?\u201d He glanced at Mallory, Catcher, Gabriel.</p><p>Gabe leaned against the island. \u201cNot for me. All due respect, it sounded like typical vampire mojo. Elves acting like zombies? Doing what someone telepathically directed them to do? Fighting? Fucking? Passing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlamour doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Ethan flatly said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work over distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure no vampire was nearby the elves when the attack occurred?\u201d</p> <p>At Gabe\u2019s question, Ethan opened his mouth, closed it again. \u201cI am not,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cBut glamour doesn\u2019t make zombies of anyone. It is suggestive, not unlike what Mallory tried a moment ago to calm us down.\u201d</p><p>Mal blushed prettily. \u201cJust trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Catcher put an arm around her shoulder, squeezed.</p><p>But they\u2019d given me an idea. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s part of it\u2014both times, the attacker mimicked some other kind of magic. In the first attack, the magic mimicked harpies. In the second, the magic mimicked vampire glamour. The attacker wasn\u2019t actually a harpy or a vampire\u2014he was someone with magic enough to pretend to be both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s powerful magic,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cAnd magic with range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRange,\u201d Gabriel said, standing straight again. \u201cHow close would someone have to be to work magic that powerful?\u201d</p><p>Catcher\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cI\u2019d actually meant the other kind of range\u2014the ability to imitate different kinds of sups\u2014but that\u2019s a good point.\u201d</p><p>I drummed my fingers on the countertop. \u201cSo someone is using a lot of magic\u2014variable magic\u2014relatively nearby to attack two groups of sups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGroups,\u201d Ethan said, tapping a finger against my hand. \u201cBoth were in groups\u2014the shifters were gathered together for Lupercalia. The elves were together in their village.\u201d</p><p>Mallory reached out to a crock on the island that held spoons and spatulas and plucked out a rubberized whisk. \u201cSo they attacked when they could do the most damage?\u201d she asked, as she toyed absently with the bent wires of the utensil.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. \u201cBut why? If this was a political thing, a grudge thing, wouldn\u2019t we know it? Wouldn\u2019t there have been a statement? Overt blame? They aren\u2019t even really framing someone, because they\u2019ve used different magic both times. There\u2019s no obvious motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it comes back to the victims,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cTo the shifters who passed.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Gabe. \u201cThe shifters you lost. Is there anything controversial in their histories? Anything that suggests they were targeted?\u201d</p><p>Gabe leaned over the counter again, propping his elbows on it and linking his hands together again. \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of. They weren\u2019t related, weren\u2019t friends. One was from Memphis\u2014young guy who I think had some leadership ambitions. Messy childhood. Woman from New Orleans. Lawyer who went to Tulane. Excellent cook, and a very spicy woman.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and Catcher grunted in some kind of vague male agreement. Mallory and I shared a dubious look.</p><p>\u201cThird was a man from Chicago. Assimilated. Lived with a human family, although the wife knew what he was.\u201d Gabe shook his head ruefully. \u201cThat phone call sucked. And you know about Rowan.\u201d</p><p>I reached out, touched his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, using the two words that were always woefully inadequate to ease anyone\u2019s grief, but still seemed the only appropriate thing to say.</p><p>Gabe nodded, patted my hand. \u201cAppreciate it, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps the key isn\u2019t the deceased,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cbut the missing.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d seen vampire disappearances before, and they hadn\u2019t been coincidental. They\u2019d been the work of an assassin hungry for revenge, and he\u2019d be difficult to catch and stop. But in that case, the key was the killings\u2014the vampires were killed as warnings to the rest of us to leave Chicago. The bodies had been left for us to find.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re back to Aline and the elf,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cWhat was her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiera,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>\u201cAline is definitely gone,\u201d I said, realizing I hadn\u2019t had a chance to report what we\u2019d found at her house. The kidnapping and threats had interrupted our investigation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a hoarder\u2014there was stuff everywhere in her house, but nothing really helpful until we found her computer. Jeff found a receipt for a plane ticket to Anchorage. She also has a storage locker, but the only thing in there was a box of ephemera. We haven\u2019t had a chance to look through it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the flight to Alaska look legit?\u201d Catcher wondered. \u201cOr planted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked legit to me, but if you\u2019ve got the ability to create winged monsters from thin air and turn elves into zombies, who knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould they have something in common?\u201d Mallory wondered. \u201cAline and Niera?\u201d Apparently bored of the whisk, she stuck it back in the canister again to mingle with its colleagues.</p><p>\u201cHow could they, if Aline didn\u2019t know the elves existed?\u201d But then I looked at Gabriel. Aline did seem like the conspiracy type, and God knew she hated the Keene family. \u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d</p><p>There had to be some connection. This many attacks\u2014large-scale attacks\u2014in two days couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. I looked at Ethan. \u201cHave you talked to Luc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing you safe was first on my list.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWhen you call him, you might see if Paige and the librarian are back from their rendezvous. The librarian has stores of microfiche and, you know, Internet access. If there\u2019s a connection between Aline and Niera, they\u2019d be the ones to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good idea.\u201d Ethan pulled out his phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m full of them,\u201d I said, glancing at a clock on one of the Brecks\u2019 sleek appliances. \u201cWe only have a few hours until dawn. I\u2019ll check the box when it gets here, talk to Jeff or Damien about whatever I find. Maybe they can provide some context.\u201d I glanced at Catcher and Mallory. \u201cCan you follow up again with Baumgart- ner, see if this new glamoury magic rings any bells? And check again on Simon if you still haven\u2019t reached him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do both,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cbut neither is likely to lead to much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to check and come up empty than miss a lead,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ethan looked at me with obvious amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re becoming quite the investigator.\u201d</p><p>I searched my memory for a good quip about cops, maybe something from a film noir about private detectives that would have made him laugh, but came up empty.</p><p>\u201cBook \u2019em, Danno?\u201d Catcher offered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>Jeff, Damien, and Nick walked into the kitchen together. Jeff and Damien looked significantly better than they had when I\u2019d seen them before. They\u2019d changed clothes and their superficial wounds were gone, probably because they\u2019d shifted and let their magic do its work.</p><p>Nick walked to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of water.</p> <p>Jeff carried Aline\u2019s box, which he set on the counter, then smiled at me. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel like I lost another life or two, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d He nudged Damien collegially, but Damien just offered back a mild blink.</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Jeff said and, when Damien continued to stare, turned to me with a crooked smile. \u201cAlrighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoo\u2019s okay?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cBoo?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cDamien\u2019s babysitting a kitten we found at Aline\u2019s,\u201d I explained.</p><p>Damien nodded. \u201cWas sleeping in the car. Now sleeping in a box in the living room. Any developments here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan\u2019s calling Paige and the librarian to check for any connections between Aline and Niera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems unlikely,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. But it\u2019s also unlikely that harpies attack shifters, and hours later someone pulls mojo on the elves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking they come from the same source?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence either way, yet. But I\u2019m thinking two major magical attacks in a five-mile radius in the span of twenty-four hours cannot be a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that way,\u201d Damien said, \u201cI can hardly argue with the conclusion.\u201d</p><p>I rose, picked up the box. \u201cWe had a to-do list,\u201d I said, reminding Damien and Jeff. \u201cThis part was my assignment.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do with her hard drive.\u201d</p><p>We looked expectantly at Damien. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m going to make some phone calls.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at Nick, who stood quietly beside the refrigerator, bottle in hand. \u201cCan I borrow a room to look through this?\u201d</p><p>Ethan looked worried. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to rest?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cToo much adrenaline. And irritation. I need to work. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I added, when the line between his eyes didn\u2019t disappear.</p><p>\u201cUse the drawing room,\u201d Nick said, as if it would be obvious to everyone which room that would be. It was to me, as it turned out, because I\u2019d been there a thousand times.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>If Papa Breck\u2019s office was one of my favorite rooms in the Breck house, the drawing room was one of my least favorite. The office was a place of adventures and hidden secrets. The drawing room was a place of manners and sitting quietly. It was where Julia, Papa Breck\u2019s wife and the Breck family matriarch, would spend a quiet afternoon with a book and a cup of tea, or where she\u2019d make me and the boys endure a time-out if we\u2019d been too noisy in the hallways. \u201cYour father did not make his money by letting out the bought air,\u201d she\u2019d tell us, and demand we spend an interminable half hour sitting on hard, uncomfortable furniture until she was satisfied that we\u2019d calmed down.</p><p>I was hardly \u201cjust a girl he knew in high school.\u201d</p><p>I carried the box into the drawing room. It was prettily arranged\u2014lighter and more delicate than Papa Breck\u2019s study\u2014with butter yellow walls and tailored furniture. A round pedestal table sat on one side of the room, with several hard wooden chairs (learned from experience) and a leather case that held two decks of cards. Both decks were missing their one-eyed kings, because we\u2019d decided the cards held secret codes and deserved saving.</p><p>I put the box on the table, walked to the shelves that lined the other end of the room, tracing my fingers over the linen-covered hardbacks that were placed in groups amid bud vases and family pictures.</p><p>I found the copy of Ian Fleming\u2019s Casino Royale\u2014because a book about James Bond with a casino in the title obviously had to relate to our one-eyed kings, and slid it from its home.</p><p>Tucked inside, back to back, were two aging kings of spades.</p><p>So many memories in this house. Each time I came back, I built new ones, even if they weren\u2019t always pleasant. I tucked the cards back into the book, slid the book back onto the shelf, and moved back to the table. I shoved the leather box of cards aside and made space on the table while I opened the box.</p><p>Just as the house had demonstrated, Aline wasn\u2019t one to throw things away. Anything. Receipts. Greeting cards. Lists. The paper wrappers that held silverware inside restaurant napkins. I assumed every scrap of paper and receipt in the box had meaning for her, some emotional weight that kept her from throwing them away, that bound them to her as the years went on.</p><p>I looked through the piles, separated them into groups, and when that didn\u2019t reveal any universal truths, put them into chronological order.</p><p>By the time Jeff knocked on the door, I had several tidy piles of paper and absolutely no clues whatsoever. Maybe he\u2019d had more luck.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNada.\u201d He pulled out a chair and took a seat. \u201cShe plays a lot of solitaire, which just seems extra-sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTravel plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ticket looked completely legitimate. But there was nothing in her Web history that indicated she booked it on that computer.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cCould be someone else booked it; could be she used a faster computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that doesn\u2019t really help us narrow anything down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not,\u201d Jeff agreed.</p><p>I frowned down at the box. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know anything at all so far. I\u2019ve looked through everything in this box, stacked and reordered it, looking for a pattern.\u201d I gestured at the receipts I\u2019d organized. \u201cThese piles are geographical. I was hoping something would hit. But I\u2019m not seeing anything.\u201d I glanced at him. \u201cDo you want to take a look? Maybe there\u2019s shifter significance I don\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d he said, but settled in to peruse.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>PAPER MOON</p><p>We worked quietly, deliberately, searching through the only potential bit of evidence we had. And it wasn\u2019t much.</p><p>\u201cI think keeping all this stuff would weigh me down,\u201d I said, pulling out a grocery receipt for utterly innocuous items: milk, eggs, cookies, paper towels.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, flipping through a stack of greeting cards. \u201cBut you have Ethan, a family, friends. You have connections.\u201d He flipped open a card, grimaced at whatever he found there, and closed it again. He put the card in the pile and looked at me. \u201cI don\u2019t think she does. I mean\u201d\u2014he spread his hands over the stack\u2014\u201call this stuff would be relatively meaningless to us. Cards from people who don\u2019t sound like they know her at all, bills, receipts. Photographs of other people\u2019s kids. It\u2019s almost like she was trying to build a life from paper, from the stacks of stuff that she kept in the house.\u201d</p><p>That was both poetic and sad, and it made more sense than I preferred to admit. If Jeff was right, Aline led a sad and lonely life that had been capped by a potentially sad and lonely end. We just weren\u2019t sure yet.</p><p>\u201cSo where does that get us?\u201d</p><p>He pushed his hair behind his ears. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>I stood up, getting a fresh perspective on the piles we\u2019d made on the dark wood table. \u201cOkay. So she\u2019s missing. The question right now is whether she\u2019s missing on purpose, or because she\u2019s a victim of the mattacker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018mattacker\u2019?\u201d Jeff asked, blinking.</p><p>\u201cThe magical attacker. I shortened it a little.\u201d</p><p>Jeff chuckled. \u201cShorten it all you want. But nobody else in the house is going to refer to the perp as a \u2018mattacker.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. But they aren\u2019t in the room right now. So\u2014we know a flight was purchased for Aline\u2014whether or not by her.\u201d I looked back at Jeff. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know anyone with an airline connection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cWhy?\u201d But before I could answer, his brows lifted in understanding. \u201cBecause if she got on the plane, she probably wasn\u2019t kidnapped. I don\u2019t know anybody offhand, and I\u2019d prefer not to hack into transpo databases. That kind of stuff gets you flagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a legit reason,\u201d I assured him. \u201cSo she gets a storage locker, buys a flight, comes to Lupercalia. Leaves right before or right after the attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing here that touches on any of that,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cAt least, not that I can see. But that\u2019s part of the problem\u2014it could all be relevant, and we wouldn\u2019t even know it because we don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on here.\u201d He picked up a faded and water-stained receipt. \u201cShe got gas.\u201d He picked up a strip of three yellow tickets. \u201cShe went to the carnival.\u201d He picked up a small wax paper bag with a logo on one side. \u201cShe bought cookies at Fran\u2019s Delights of Loring Park. That has got to be the most pretentious name for a cookie joint I\u2019ve ever heard, but I\u2019m getting off track.\u201d</p><p>I was proud he realized that. He didn\u2019t always.</p><p>\u201cNone of this stuff means anything without context, and shifter context isn\u2019t helping much. None of it, as far as I can see, is shifter related. She lived like a human. Bought things like a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould that be the reason she\u2019s gone? She pretended to be a little too human?\u201d</p><p>Jeff shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can rule it out. It might be time to call your team.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI think we can arrange that.\u201d I pulled out my phone and started up the program Luc had created for the House\u2019s guards. It had timers, alarms, alerts, and, according to him, a \u201cslick\u201d little videoconferencing setup.</p><p>I set up the phone on the table and turned on the app, selecting the option to connect with the Ops Room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An animated clip of Luc filled the screen. His animated cowboy hat bobbed back and forth as he screeched \u201cShow me the Ops Room!\u201d over and over again.</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be a play on \u2018Show me the money\u2019?\u201d Jeff wondered.</p><p>\u201cGod only knows,\u201d I said, smiling with relief when the real Luc replaced the faux one.</p> <p>He smiled brightly at Jeff and me. \u201cSentinel, I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re taking advantage of the technological resources we\u2019ve provided for you. And that you\u2019re alive. Ethan said things got hairy. And for you, too, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a hostage is always a bummer,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cBut we came out all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about Scott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott?\u201d Jeff asked with alarm.</p><p>\u201cKowalcyzk\u2019s interviewing him today,\u201d Luc explained. \u201cJonah said the lawyers are negotiating with the mayor\u2019s office, the police commissioner, the feds. No other news yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least he\u2019s got advocates,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cAnd loud ones. The lawyers are all over TV, the Web, talking about how poorly their client is being treated, how it\u2019s baldly unconstitutional. They\u2019ll get him out, or set him up for a civil suit later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you play by the rules they give you,\u201d I said. \u201cI assume Ethan gave you the rundown about everything here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. He\u2019s talking to the librarian. And good timing there; he just got back to the House an hour or two ago. What can I do you for, Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to borrow your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Ethan had given Luc the overview, heavy on the elves and their apparent existence. We stuck to the facts of the attack, walked him through what we knew, and brainstormed about the potential cause.</p><p>Luc wasn\u2019t convinced they were related at all. \u201cTwo different methods,\u201d he said. \u201cOne much more violent than the other. One kills, the other\u2014what would you say\u2014violates? One attack during the day. The other at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s two attacks on supernatural groups in Illinois within twenty-four hours. The methods may not have much in common, but they have to be connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know if she got on that plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Jeff and I were saying. I don\u2019t suppose you know someone?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cI might, you know, know someone.\u201d His cheekbones glowed faintly pink, and there was a bashful look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFormer girlfriend?\u201d I asked with a grin.</p><p>Luc hunched over a little, as if shielding the camera and his answer from the other people in the room. From the topic, I assumed Lindsey was one of those people.</p> <p>\u201cBriefly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t stress that enough. We haven\u2019t talked in a while, but I could maybe make a phone call. I wouldn\u2019t, of course, want it to become a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m empathic,\u201d we heard Lindsey call out offscreen. \u201cAnd you\u2019re hardly whispering. I can hear you, Merit and Jeff.\u201d</p><p>We waved weakly back at Luc, whose face had turned a mottled shade of crimson.</p><p>A flounce of blond hair popped into view. \u201c\u2019S\u2019up?\u201d Lindsey asked with a grin. \u201cJeffrey. Merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please give your boyfriend permission to call his ex-girlfriend and ask if our victim-slash-perpetrator boarded her flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hardly qualified as an ex-girlfriend,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cThey may have bounced around together a smidge, but that\u2019s it. It barely counts.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d have much preferred to dive into Lindsey\u2019s scale of what did and did not \u201ccount\u201d for purposes of \u201cbouncing,\u201d but this wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that means you have no objection to Luc calling Bouncy so we can continue our supernatural investigation and get the shifters and elves off our backs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d she said, before Luc nudged his way on-screen again. He no longer looked especially amused.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll let us know?\u201d I asked cheerily.</p><p>He grumbled something, and the screen went blank. I scratched absently at an itch on my shoulder, glanced at Jeff.</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d Jeff said with a shrug, as if that explained everything.</p><p>I yawned hugely, stretching back in the chair. I was still residually sore from being dragged around and bound. It was nothing that a little sleep wouldn\u2019t fix, but I was getting achy from sitting.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like bedtime for you, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>I looked back, found Ethan in the doorway, hands in his pockets, lips curled in amusement. \u201cHaving any luck here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn bit,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can\u2019t find anything that gives us a motive for Aline, or indicates she was a target of the attack. What about you? Any luck with Paige and the librarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re looking through the archives,\u201d he said. \u201cI was advised my request was substantial and it would take them some time.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s voice was flat, and I could easily imagine the librarian giving him a very pointed speech about the time he\u2019d need to complete an assignment. Like most of the vampires of Cadogan House, the librarian was particular.</p><p>Another yawn racked me, and I raised the back of my hand to my mouth. I was too tired to hold it in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a bit of an evening,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to head back to the carriage house.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and stood up, regretting that the end of the evening hadn\u2019t been more productive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get this cleaned up,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cAnd check in with Damien.\u201d He glanced at Ethan, smiled. \u201cMerit held her own. Had those elves shaking in their boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she did. And it probably didn\u2019t hurt to have a tiger in her corner.\u201d</p><p>Jeff smiled shyly. \u201cI\u2019m just glad we got everyone out of there okay. Hopefully, we\u2019ll find Aline tucked away on holiday, and Niera on a jaunt, and everything can go back to normal.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t disagree with the hope, but I was beginning to think crisis was the new normal.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We had an hour until sunrise, but my body was already shutting down. Ethan all but carried me back to the carriage house, where Mallory and Catcher had showered and were lying on the couch, a predictable Lifetime movie on the television. Some men golfed; some wrenched. Catcher Lifetime\u2019d.</p><p>I headed straight for the bedroom, stripped down to bare skin, and blistered myself in the shower. My body ached like I was awaiting the onset of the flu. I could only assume the elves had thrown me around like a sack of potatoes in the process of getting me into the village.</p><p>When I\u2019d risked using all the hot water, I flipped off the faucet and wrapped myself in a fluffy towel. They had their prejudices, but you couldn\u2019t fault their taste in linens.</p><p>I pulled on a Cadogan T-shirt and plaid pajama bottoms, and then took care of the other necessary bit of business\u2014sword care. I\u2019d managed to snatch my sword back from the elves, but it hadn\u2019t come away unscathed. The steel was filthy, dotted with mud and probably worse, little clumps of dirt clinging to the scabbard. I placed both carefully on the floor, then grabbed the small kit Catcher had given me from my duffel bag. Rice paper. Oil. A whetstone to hone the surface.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t yet used the whetstone. The katana had been made by hands significantly more experienced and learned than mine; I\u2019d long ago decided to leave sharpening to the experts. But I was good with oil and rice paper, which would clean the steel to a sheen and protect it from nicks during the next battle.</p><p>After removing the gunk with a soft cloth, I dotted oil onto a square of rice paper and folded the small sheet around the blade. With a smooth, swift motion, I wiped the oil from one end of the katana to the other, then repeated the process until the blade gleamed. The blade had been tempered with blood and magic, and with each pass of the paper I felt the answering shiver of satisfaction, as if the sword appreciated the care.</p><p>When I was done, I slid it back into the sheath with a zing of sound, and placed it on the top of the bureau beside Ethan\u2019s sword, already scabbarded. They made a beautiful pair, artisanal weapons of death, handcrafted protectors of honor.</p><p>As I patted myself on the back for my mental poetry, a knock sounded at the front door.</p><p>I opened the bedroom door and peeked into the living room.</p><p>For the first time tonight, it wasn\u2019t bad news. A teenager with pink cheeks stood in the doorway wearing a Loring Park Pizza cap, and the siren\u2019s call of roasted meat spilled into the air from the four steaming pizza boxes he carried. The scent was nearly tangible; I could practically see the wavy lines of meat smoke rising off the box.</p><p>A victim to my hunger, I marched into the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>\u201cDinner, I guess.\u201d The kid shrugged. \u201cGuy at the house paid for it, sent me out here with it.\u201d He grinned. \u201cSaid you should tip me really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet he did,\u201d Catcher mumbled, pulling his wallet out of his back jeans pocket. He snatched out bills, then exchanged the cash for pizza and watched the kid head back down the driveway\u2014as if there was a threat the pizza delivery boy might change his mind and attack.</p><p>After a moment, Catcher closed the door and put the pizza on the table. \u201cI guess the Pack felt bad about last night\u2019s grub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr tonight\u2019s hostage situation,\u201d Ethan said, throwing open a box and grabbing a steaming slice. Without napkin, fork, or plate, he dove into the slice, earning openmouthed stares from Mallory, Catcher, and me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that pretentious,\u201d he said over a mouthful of a pizza that looked like a butcher-shop special. I recognized pepperoni; the rest of it was a hearty, delicious mystery.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d the three of us said together, but we were smiling when we said it. We all grabbed slices and took seats on the sofas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou find anything in your magic box?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>\u201cReceipts and ephemera. In other words, a big, fat nothing. You get anything else about Baumgartner or Simon?\u201d</p><p>Catcher chewed, shook his head. \u201cSimon is in South America. Decided a change of scenery was a good idea. I\u2019m not crying that he\u2019s on a different continent. I told Baumgartner what we saw. He denied they were really elves\u2014probably fairies or humans dressing up like elves\u2014and said the magic sounded like vampires.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaumgartner is a royal sack of crap,\u201d Mallory said.</p><p>\u201cAnd still prefers to keep his head in the sand,\u201d I suggested, then glanced at Ethan.</p><p>He\u2019d opted for the forkless slice and was now swabbing his hands with napkins. I predicted fork in his future.</p><p>\u201cThe pizza\u2019s good,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cIt\u2019s not Saul\u2019s, of course, but it\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pizza snob,\u201d Catcher said.</p> <p>She elbowed him. \u201cNo, I was raised right. Don\u2019t deny a Chicagoan the right to pick her favorite slice. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d</p><p>I was inching into my second when my phone beeped. The slice went back to the plate, and I scrubbed grease from my hands before pulling it out of my pocket. I checked the screen . . . and my stomach curled with icy-cold nerves.</p><p>It was Lakshmi.</p><p>She was reminding me\u2014as if I\u2019d somehow forgotten\u2014of the favor I owed and the message she wanted me to pass along. And she\u2019d carefully drafted her message to ensure I recalled her larger point.</p><p>THE HOUSES DESERVE A MASTER WHO CAN TRULY LEAD THEM, she texted. DO NOT LET SELFISHNESS DEPRIVE THEM OF THAT.</p><p>Was it so selfish to want him close? To keep on the same continent the man I\u2019d come to love, to need, to depend on? Or was it selfish of her to ask, to demand sacrifice of others instead of putting herself forward as a candidate, taking her own stand against tyranny?</p> <p>\u201cSentinel?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice, I remembered I was sitting in mixed company\u2014and with him. I plastered on a smile I didn\u2019t feel and tucked the phone away again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said, and grabbed a piece of pizza as if hunger was my only concern.</p><p>But of course it wasn\u2019t nothing, and the curiosity didn\u2019t disappear from Ethan\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Sunrise found us tucked into the bedroom. The house was locked, the guards outside, Mallory and Catcher curled up in the living room. While Ethan showered, I plumped pillows and folded back the covers, climbed into cool sheets.</p><p>And then I obsessed about the GP.</p><p>My phone was in hand, Ethan on my mind, Lakshmi\u2019s text under my squinty gaze. Jonah had tattoos on each arm\u2014a devil on one side, an angel on the other. I thought of both, miniature devils and angels sitting on my shoulders, offering contradictory advice. But in my case, the angel looked like Seth Tate, Chicago\u2019s former mayor, a former angel of peace who\u2019d become magically linked to his identical twin, Dominic. Dominic had been an angel of judgment, a devil, and was as fallen as they came.</p> <p>The devil derided me for even considering giving in to Lakshmi, a member of the GP, which had caused so much trouble for Cadogan House we\u2019d been forced to quit it.</p><p>The angel shared Lakshmi\u2019s fire, promising that I would be doing the right thing.</p><p>And all the while, as they debated, I still had to keep Ethan out of prison.</p><p>The bathroom door opened. Ethan, wearing only a towel, looked out. He\u2019d brushed his hair, which was water-slicked back from his face.</p><p>Guilty and torn, I stuffed the phone hastily under the covers. But not so quickly he didn\u2019t see me do it.</p><p>I\u2019d never been a good liar, and this wasn\u2019t an exception. \u201cArranging a secret rendezvous, are you, Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just checking in.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re a miserable liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can usually bluff pretty well. But apparently not to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about the message you got during dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you like to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>There were things I could have said. You\u2019d be the best GP leader. You should run. Take your position as the sire of vampires. Challenge Darius. But seconds passed and the sun inched higher toward the horizon, robbing me of the ability to debate. And I wasn\u2019t going to take on something this serious when I wasn\u2019t at full capacity.</p><p>\u201cNothing big,\u201d I drowsily said. \u201cJust a personal concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA personal concern?\u201d he asked, a spark of green fire in his eyes that I recognized as jealousy. He probably imagined the personal concern involved Jonah and the RG, as that was the only thing I normally wouldn\u2019t discuss with him in detail. But Ethan was the only man on my mind.</p><p>Apparently intent on guaranteeing that fact, he flicked a finger, and the towel fell to the ground, heaping at his feet. Ethan stood there, still damp, golden hair around his shoulders, hands on his hips and a less-than-modest expression on his face. Considering his impressive erection, modesty would have been wasted on me anyway.</p><p>I ignored my body\u2019s undeniable twinge of interest and dragged my gaze to his face. \u201cNot that kind of personal concern.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ll be the only man on my mind?\u201d Especially with the image of him standing there seared into my retinas and memory. \u201cYes. I\u2019m quite certain. Positive, you could say.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little. \u201cSentinel, you\u2019re mumbling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. And your nakedness is distracting.\u201d</p><p>But I moved to him anyway. Because sometimes distraction was just the thing you needed.</p><p>Some hours later, darkness fell without a knock at our bedroom door or any other. But alarms weren\u2019t always raised with fists.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>LOOK AT LITTLE SISTER</p><p>We were dressed the next evening and preparing to emerge from the bedroom when our phones rang simultaneously. I reached for mine, but Ethan found his first.</p><p>\u201cSullivan,\u201d he said, answering it through the speakerphone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Luc. Turn on the television. NBC affiliate. Now.\u201d</p><p>Dread ran cold along my spine like a spill of ice water.</p><p>We ran for the door, pulled it open, found Mallory on the couch, yawning as she flipped through a magazine. Catcher was gone, but there was shuffling in the kitchen.</p><p>Ethan reached the television first, switched it on, and found the channel.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the emergency?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>A newscaster\u2019s solemn voice began to ring through the air, drawing my attention back to the television. And there on the screen was Scott Grey, his lip bruised and bleeding, one eye swollen, his arm in a make-do sling. He limped as he walked, two men in black suits escorting him from the police station. The man on his left whispered to him, close and confidential.</p><p>\u201cCatcher,\u201d Mallory said, the same look of mortification in her eyes, \u201cyou need to see this.\u201d</p><p>Catcher emerged from the kitchen, a mug in hand and wearing only boxers. He nodded at me and Ethan, then fixed his eyes on the screen.</p><p>\u201cScott Grey, the quote-unquote Master of Chicago\u2019s Grey House of vampires, was led away from the precinct tonight by his lawyers after a day of intense questioning. Police spokesmen say they spoke with Grey about the recent murders and riots that have racked the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastards,\u201d Ethan gritted out with obvious temper, needles of magic spilling into the air. \u201cThey\u2019ve beaten him like he\u2019s a goddamned animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolice say Grey is not a suspect in those events, but he may have information which could lead to the arrest of those suspected. John Haymer has more live from the precinct steps.\u201d</p><p>The shot switched to a young man with dark skin, sharp gray eyes, and a very serious expression. \u201cThank you, Linda. I\u2019m here with Terry Fowler, a resident of Hyde Park, with commentary.\u201d</p><p>Haymer tipped a black microphone toward Fowler, a man with bony shoulders and a gleaming pate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Fowler said, with a thick Chicago accent and a waggling finger, \u201cthat the mayor took some action on the hooligans that are running loose in our streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose hooligans,\u201d Ethan bit out, \u201care not vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think about the charges the city used inappropriate force against Mr. Grey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInappropriate force? He\u2019s a predator. They all are. Rioting, plucking victims here and there, probably grab you right off the street if they had a mind to. \u2019Bout damn time, if you ask me.\u201d He smiled with gusto at the camera, clearly happy about his forty seconds of fame.</p><p>There would never be a moment\u2019s peace, I realized. Not as long as human civilization had its own problems, not when vampires made such an easy target. Not when blaming us was easier than addressing deeply rooted social ills.</p><p>This was Celina\u2019s doing, the result of her outing vampires, the mess she\u2019d made by announcing their existence to the public. It had been more than a year since she\u2019d made the decision, held a press conference, brought vampires into a light they hadn\u2019t asked for. And now we were paying the price. This wasn\u2019t the age of the Inquisition or the Salem witch trials, but it was proving to be different only by mechanism and degree. Technology didn\u2019t make humans less blind; it only made it easier for hate and ignorance to spread.</p><p>\u201cThe mayor maintains the city\u2019s supernaturals are little better than domestic terrorists. What are your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re violent,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cCreating chaos. Making good people afraid to go out at night. Isn\u2019t that terrorism? She should put \u2019em away or take \u2019em out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the death penalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes, yeah. If it\u2019s good enough for humans, ain\u2019t it good enough for vampires?\u201d</p><p>My blood chilled. His voice stayed casual, like it was nothing at all to suggest our deaths.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Fowler,\u201d said the reporter, looking straight into the camera again. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with a number of individuals here outside the precinct. Although not all of them support the mayor\u2019s actions, it\u2019s clear they are concerned about the presence of vampires in their community.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The shot switched back to the studio, where the anchor, every strand of platinum blond hair in place, nodded. \u201cThank you, John, for that report.

The mayor also has not yet identified a replacement for the head of the Office of Human Liaisons, who was arrested a few days ago for his role in the riots that have racked the city this week.\u201d</p><p>The camera shifted to the man who sat beside her, a brunette with thick eyebrows and a long, straight nose. \u201cThank you, Patrice. And now to sports.\u201d</p><p>Ethan flicked off the television.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually think we\u2019re threats to the public welfare?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe mayor thinks I\u2019m a threat to the public welfare,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd Scott is the bait they\u2019re using. And they\u2019re using him, well and thoroughly, after all we\u2019ve done for the city. The times we\u2019ve pulled it back from the brink. Assimilation didn\u2019t work. Living in public doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not sure what our remaining options might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappearing,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cJust like the elves.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cHave you heard from Jonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even had time to look.\u201d I went back to the bedroom and grabbed my phone, found three missed calls from Jonah, and sent a message.</p><p>WE\u2019RE WATCHING THE REPORTS, I sent. I\u2019M SORRY GREY HAS GOTTEN DRAGGED INTO THIS.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t immediately respond, so I kept the phone in my hand, went back to the living room, and wished him strength.</p><p>Ethan glanced back at me, the line of worry between his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t let them be punished on my behalf. Seeking shelter here to avoid a fight with the CPD was one thing. But others being targeted in my stead is something completely different. This isn\u2019t Scott\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut he was at the House when Monmonth was killed. They\u2019d have seen that on video.\u201d When rioters firebombed Grey House, we sheltered the Grey House vampires, a direct violation of the GP\u2019s blacklist. Monmonth had come to Cadogan House to enforce it, to force Scott and the rest out of their sanctuary, when he attacked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a witness,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cbecause you did him a favor and let him into your House. But it hardly matters. Whether or not you\u2019re there wouldn\u2019t matter. If she thinks she can beat a witness with impunity, there\u2019s no act on your part that would stop her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it would be dangerous,\u201d Mallory said, fear in her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s willing to do all this when you clearly acted in self-defense. She\u2019s not operating within the bounds of the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that matters to her,\u201d Ethan said, putting his hands on his hips. \u201cThe law applies to humans, which we are not. I\u2019m sure she has advisers, lawyers on staff who are promising her that she\u2019s doing nothing illegal, nothing that\u2019s not sanctioned by vague and antiquated laws. Add in her argument that we\u2019re domestic terrorists, and she has a license to abuse her powers. Goddamn her.\u201d Furious magic buzzed around Ethan, filled the room. \u201cGoddamn her and her narcissism.\u201d</p> <p>My phone buzzed; it was Jonah again.</p><p>WE\u2019RE MANAGING, he said. RG HELPING. LAWYERS TALKING TO SCOTT. ALL GUARD CAPTAINS COMMO\u2019ING.</p><p>That was something, at least. The Houses would never be as strong apart as they would be together.</p><p>But Jonah had one more message to share: BEWARE\u2014KOWALCYZK MEANS TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF ETHAN.</p><p>I could face down a harpy or an elf. But the thought of Ethan in trouble curled my stomach with fear.</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I said, passing the phone to him when he glanced back at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d he slowly asked, handing it back. \u201cSit here twiddling my goddamn thumbs while they take the punishment she means to give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cand keep the situation from getting worse. Scott has lawyers, and he\u2019s immortal just like you. And frankly, it\u2019s time the other Houses get beat up instead of Cadogan.\u201d</p> <p>When Ethan opened his mouth to argue\u2014probably with cursing\u2014Catcher lifted his hands. \u201cStop. Just wait a minute. Let me play the asshole, and you can be pissed at me if you want. We go back a long way, Ethan. You know I don\u2019t bullshit you. Not on purpose anyway,\u201d he said, slanting a glance at Mallory. \u201cFor once, take my advice\u2014let the others do the heavy lifting. If you go back, she\u2019ll crucify you. That won\u2019t do you, Merit, Malik, or anyone else any good. So Scott got a little bruised; he\u2019ll heal. This is not the first time or the last time authorities in Chicago have roughed up a witness or a suspect. Christ, how many times have you both been injured?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in air, let it out again, looked between us. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Chicago isn\u2019t great. But you knew when you came here that \u2018not great\u2019 was a pretty strong possibility. And in the meantime, an entirely new crisis has dropped into your life. Let\u2019s deal with that crisis first, before we run back to the arms of the other one.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent for a moment with the weight of Catcher\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cBeen saving up that monologue for a while, have you?\u201d Ethan asked, a hint of a smile at one corner of his mouth.</p><p>Catcher humphed. \u201cLonger than I should have. We all have improvements to make.\u201d He looked at Mallory. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make mine.\u201d</p><p>I caught Mallory swiping tears from under her eyes, love flooding between them. I looked back at Ethan, and the look he gave me was similarly deep. And surprising, as it often was. The fact that this four-hundred-year-old immortal, this Master of vampires and men, needed me was still occasionally bewildering. And awesome.</p><p>\u201cSentinel?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou stay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cLet our people do their thing in Chicago. And in the meantime, we try to fix what\u2019s broken here.\u201d I stepped forward and took his hands, knowing now the time was right. \u201cWe have to find the person who\u2019s attacking supernaturals. Because if we don\u2019t finish this now, there\u2019s a pretty good chance the Houses will be on their radar.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to my brow. \u201cYou\u2019re wise beyond your years.\u201d He glanced at Catcher and Mallory. \u201cI wasn\u2019t certain I would ever have an opportunity to say this\u2014but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re part of the team again.\u201d</p><p>Mallory grinned, a smile breaking like sunrise across her classically pretty face, now framed by blue waves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped being a pain in my ass,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mallory said, pulling back her hair. \u201cNow that we\u2019re temporarily hunky-dory, maybe we should get some work done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd coffee,\u201d Catcher said, walking back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou might also want to find some pants,\u201d I helpfully added.</p><p>Considering the one-finger gesture he offered, he didn\u2019t much appreciate the suggestion.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Luc agreed with our plan, as did Ethan\u2019s lawyers, who assured him Scott was fine and would have a glorious civil suit against Mayor Kowalcyzk when the time came. The lawyers had very particular concerns about Ethan\u2019s welfare should he fall into Kowalcyzk\u2019s hands, and weren\u2019t willing to turn him over. In the meantime, they promised to check with their contacts in Washington, alert the Justice Department to the mayor\u2019s acts, and, in the interest of clearing the air, invite the Homeland Security folks to come to Chicago and interview Ethan themselves.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with that course of action\u2014it seemed to me like inviting the wolves into the henhouse\u2014but we didn\u2019t have to worry about it now. We had larger concerns.</p><p>Ethan directed Luc to give Grey House anything they needed and asked Malik to make his own diplomatic phone call. We waited while he made the communication and reported back that Scott, too, agreed that Ethan should stay away.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Scott,\u201d Malik said, calling back from the Ops Room, \u201cKowalcyzk is on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know where I am?\u201d Ethan asked as we sat together on the couch, mugs of coffee Catcher had distributed in hand.</p><p>\u201cShe does. Her goon squad told Scott she received an anonymous tip.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced at me, eyebrow arched. \u201cAny bets on Michael Breckenridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the most likely candidate,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut every shifter out there knows we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t moved on the information,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAt least not directly. Pulling in Scott reads to me like a ploy. As we predicted, she doesn\u2019t want to move on the Brecks, so she\u2019s trying to lure me back to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she had any cause at all, she wouldn\u2019t need the lure,\u201d Malik said. \u201cShe\u2019d head down there and arrest you. But she doesn\u2019t have evidence of anything but self-defense, which isn\u2019t enough to arrest you in Chicago, much less cross jurisdictional bounds and convince the officers of Loring Park to go up against the city\u2019s biggest taxpayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like the game playing, and I certainly don\u2019t like her using others to get to me. She knows she has no case. Why not drop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause riots,\u201d Luc said blandly. \u201cThe city\u2019s still reeling, and her popularity is in the toilet. She\u2019s got to come across as being hard on crime\u2014and the perceived root of that crime\u2014if she wants to survive a real election. Seth Tate being thrown out of office was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I imagine she knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so we are the playthings of the fates once again,\u201d Ethan quietly said. \u201cBut we carry on and nobly endure. Thank you for the reports,\u201d he added, then glanced at me. \u201cOh, and Merit\u2019s grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing well,\u201d Luc said. \u201cThey\u2019re working on managing his pain, getting him prepped for rehab. Long road ahead, but his spirits are good. I debated what to tell him about your current shenanigans but opted for the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he appreciated that,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was surprised\u2014said he didn\u2019t know of any conflicts between the Pack and other groups. Was stunned about the harpies and the elves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him about my heroism? Laud my bravery? Extol my fighting virtues?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told him you fainted at the first sight of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be an obvious stretch considering the fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows you did well,\u201d Luc assured. \u201cOh, and your father called, Merit. He wanted to offer whatever assistance he could in the troubles facing the House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . noble,\u201d Ethan said, flicking me a glance. I simply rolled my eyes. My father might very well have wanted, on some level, to help the House. But that desire would have been significantly dwarfed by the financial and political hay he thought he could make of it. He was an opportunist, and he\u2019d already expressed an interest in becoming a financial sponsor of Cadogan House. There was no denying his power or money\u2014being the city\u2019s chief real estate mogul had its advantages\u2014but the cost of cashing in that chit would be much too great. And I already owed favors to too many bloodsuckers.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d think so,\u201d Luc said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you apprised of any developments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo that,\u201d Ethan requested, and ended the call. He looked at me, humor in his eyes. \u201cIf I had a dollar for every time your father sought to buy his way into our favor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d be as rich as my father,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cJust so,\u201d Ethan agreed, then nodded at the door. \u201cLet\u2019s get out there and see what the night brings.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The guards were gone when we opened the door, apparently satisfied that we weren\u2019t going to run and that we could care for ourselves now that the sun was down again. We walked to the house, found the front part of the house completely empty of shifters or staff.</p><p>Ethan put his hands on his hips, surveying the empty parlor and kitchen, then glanced back at us, brow raised. \u201cThoughts?\u201d</p> <p>I could sense the flow of magic from other parts of the house, moving toward us. \u201cFollow the magic,\u201d I said, pointing to the hallway.</p><p>I led the way, the others falling into step behind me. The magic grew in intensity as we neared the eastern wing of the house.</p><p>\u201cBallroom,\u201d I murmured, pointing to the double doors up ahead. One door was closed, the other open a few inches. I moved toward it to peek inside.</p><p>Gabriel, wearing a long-sleeved Henley-style shirt and jeans, stood at one end of the ballroom, hands tucked casually into his pockets. He stood alone, the rest of the Pack standing before him, watching him speak. I didn\u2019t see any other Keenes but assumed they were part of the crowd. Their mood was grim, the magic strong but banked, like a thousand hummingbirds in place, but wings in motion, waiting for the call to move.</p><p>I pushed open the door just wide enough so we could slip inside. We lined up in the back, where Damien offered a mirthless smile.</p><p>\u201cNormally,\u201d Gabriel said, looking across the members of his Pack, \u201cwe would cast our votes. You would speak, and as Apex of the Pack, I would be your voice.\u201d</p><p>He looked down for a moment, considering, then up again. \u201cTonight, I am also the words. Lupercalia is hereby canceled.\u201d</p><p>That was the call to arms they needed.</p> <p>Sound erupted\u2014shifters hissing and screaming out, accusing Gabe of cowardice, of giving in to intimidation, of lacking certain portions of the male genitalia. Magic filled the air: angry, peppery, biting. No longer banked, but swirling around the room like whirlpools and eddies in a river.</p><p>Considering what he\u2019d faced down this week, they undoubtedly knew there was no basis to call the Apex a coward. But this wasn\u2019t about truth. This was about anger and frustration. The Pack had been wronged by someone\u2014and they were taking it out on Gabriel.</p><p>He let them rant for a full minute, his expression blank, his shoulders square. He stared ahead as if their jeers couldn\u2019t touch him, were utterly meaningless, and couldn\u2019t change his mind. His body language told the tale: The decision had been made, and anyone with a mind to the contrary could go fuck themselves.</p><p>It took me a moment to realize his play, to figure out why Gabriel Keene, usually so attuned to what the Pack did and did not want, was suddenly playing dictator.</p><p>He was giving them an excuse.</p><p>They were shifters\u2014their senses of self built upon the notion that they were braver than everyone else, with fuck-it attitudes and the power to back up the attitudes with action. If they\u2019d voted to cancel Lupercalia, they\u2019d have taken another psychic blow. Not just two showdowns, but three, the last a clear defeat. Gabe didn\u2019t want them to feel they\u2019d taken an easy out, given in to fear. By making the decision, by being dictatorial, he put the weight of that decision on himself and himself alone.</p><p>It was, to them, an act of cowardice.</p><p>It was, in fact, the ultimate bravery. He would sacrifice himself for the good of the Pack, for their safety and longevity. But he would do it with cost.</p><p>He glanced at Berna, and she whistled, quieting the crowd immediately. I really needed to learn how to do that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Apex of this Pack,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any of you want to challenge me for that position, you know where I\u2019ll be. Until that time, the decision stands.\u201d With that, he turned and walked forward, the crowd dividing to let him through. He walked toward the door, a slant of his eyes the only indication that he\u2019d seen us. If the rest of his family had been there, they didn\u2019t follow him now. Maybe this was part of his larger plan\u2014to let the Pack have its moment to vent, and keep them out of the argument.</p><p>\u201cDifficult to be the Master of any house?\u201d I quietly murmured to Ethan.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Sentinel. One quickly learns the meaning of sacrifice.\u201d He glanced at the crowd, still unsure whether it should revolt or walk away and let the battle lie. \u201cAnd the costs of it.\u201d</p><p>With Gabriel gone, we looked at each other, not entirely sure where to go. Should we follow Gabriel out of the room or stay here and keep watch?</p><p>\u201cWe all know this is bullshit,\u201d said one of the shifters\u2014a hard-bitten, meaty man with long, braided hair that glinted with age. He wore an NAC jacket, with LETHAL stitched onto the front, and his eyes looked bloodshot and haggard.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we become? Pussies? Humans? Canceling a party because things might get rough? We do not cancel Lup. The entire point of fucking Lup is to show off our cojones.\u201d He grabbed his crotch, smiled at the crowd. I presume he meant to show himself a virile shifter, but he only succeeded, at least in my mind, in looking like an entirely different kind of predator.</p><p>\u201cWhat a moron,\u201d Damien whispered, his voice mild and faintly disgusted, which raised him even more in my estimation.</p><p>\u201cAnd this harpy and elf bullshit? You know who attacks us when we\u2019re strong? Nobody. We were attacked because Keene can\u2019t hold our shit together. His old man was a fucking shifter. A fucking wolf. And now? We\u2019re cavorting with vampires, with sorcerers. The Packs don\u2019t cavort! We are shifters!\u201d He beat a fist against his chest. \u201cWe eat. We ride. We fuck. We fight.\u201d</p><p>The magic in the crowd began to rise, buzzing louder. He was ramping them up, riling them up, preparing them for something.</p><p>Ethan firmly believed we needed the Pack as allies in this volatile time, but frankly I couldn\u2019t think of a group more volatile than shifters. We shifted from allies to enemies in the span of days, and sometimes over the course of a single day. They couldn\u2019t seem to make their mind up about us, and their fair-weather friendship was beginning to grate on me.</p><p>Lethal scanned the crowd, locked his gaze on Mallory.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the fucking sorcerers,\u201d he said. \u201cWas Gabe a pussy before he started playing with girls and their magic? Would he send us all home like whelps, tails between our legs? The elves show their faces, kidnap two of our own, and we don\u2019t fight them? We don\u2019t stand and deliver?\u201d He barked out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. Part of that hippie nonsense he\u2019s always spouting. \u2018We\u2019re all part of the universe,\u2019\u201d he said in a mocking voice. \u201cShe\u2019s making him soft.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel did have a holistic view of shifters, seeing the Pack as a crucial part of the natural world. It wasn\u2019t unlike the sorcerers\u2019 belief that they funneled magic through their bodies, although he hadn\u2019t voiced it that way. Regardless, he\u2019d been talking about nature before Mallory went bad, and certainly before he became her tutor.</p><p>But Lethal wouldn\u2019t have cared about that. He was pissed and looking for an excuse to do some damage. And as he stared down at Mallory, a disturbing glint in his eyes, it seemed clear whom he\u2019d picked as a target.</p><p>He began to stalk toward us, the rest of the shifters moving out of his way just as they had when Gabriel passed. I wasn\u2019t impressed that they stood by while a bully attempted to cower a guest, especially someone he could easily overpower\u2014at least in terms of pure physicality.</p><p>Wordlessly, Ethan and I moved together and formed a barrier around Mallory and Catcher. Damien did the same.</p><p>My heart began to race with the possibility of a fight, and I let my irritation shine in my eyes.</p><p>Lethal emerged through the crowd in front of us, maybe ten feet away. The shifters closest to us\u2014all in NAC jackets and with the look of bikers who\u2019d been riding hard for a few days\u2014looked between us, not entirely sure which side they\u2019d bet on, but happy to see some action either way.</p><p>I\u2019d been a victim yesterday; I preferred to be a perp today.</p><p>I stepped in front of all of them, flipped off the thumb guard on my katana, and lifted the handle just a bit, letting them know that I\u2019d be happy to roll if that\u2019s how they wanted to play it.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a big, burly shifter who wanted to talk.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Emma, Tanya\u2019s petite sister, stepped out of the crowd on the other side of the room, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. She looked the opposite of Lethal in nearly every way\u2014petite and fragile, wearing a simple cotton top and jeans, her eyes wide and face flushed with anger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are facing crises\u2014several, at once\u2014and the only thing you can think to do is blame other supernaturals for our issues?\u201d</p><p>There were mumbles in the crowd.</p><p>Any pretense of shyness was gone now. However quiet she might have seemed, she\u2019d found her voice.</p> <p>She looked at Lethal and made a sarcastic noise. \u201cYou want to challenge Gabriel? Then do it, you cowardly asshole. Don\u2019t stand up in here and cause trouble for the rest of us, and for these people, who\u2019ve done nothing but try to help. I\u2019m pretty sure you spent yesterday sleeping off a hangover.\u201d</p><p>The crowd snorted with laughter. I bit back a grin, deciding conclusively that I liked Emma. I also cast a glance at Damien, saw pride shine in his eyes.</p><p>But Lethal wanted his bit of infamy, and he wasn\u2019t about to give that up to Emma. \u201cAnd who are you to talk about it? Are you even old enough to drink?\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but she did put her hands on her hips. \u201cPlenty. And I bet I can hold my liquor better than you can, Mervin.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a very shiftery name, which was probably why Mervin preferred to go by \u201cLethal.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t happy about Emma pointing that out. His face went beet red.</p> <p>\u201cYou think your sister\u2019s being married to a Keene\u2019s gonna save you? You think I won\u2019t hit you because you\u2019re one of them? Or because you\u2019re a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you won\u2019t hit me because you\u2019re a bully who talks a lot and doesn\u2019t do shit about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome over here and say that to my face.\u201d</p><p>Her courage bobbled, and for a moment there was nothing but fear in her face. But she pushed it back, squared her shoulders, and met his gaze. And then she moved toward us, hands fisted at her sides as if courage were a bird and if she didn\u2019t hold tight enough it would fly away and out of sight.</p><p>She stopped a few feet from him. Together, we formed a triangle of dissension. Or a game of rock, paper, vampires.</p><p>Ethan? I silently whispered, thinking she looked small and frail staring down Lethal and his buddies. But I didn\u2019t want to step forward if that would weaken her position.</p> <p>This is her fight, he confirmed.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Lethal said. \u201cYou wanna play?\u201d He walked forward, shoved her.</p><p>I saw Damien jerk beside me, his eyes lined with concern, but before he could even think about moving, Emma moved.</p><p>He must have had a foot in height and eighty pounds on her, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice. Emma reached out, grabbed one of his wrists to hold him, then rotated her other elbow and brought it hard against the side of his head. She released him, and he stumbled backward.</p><p>\u201cFucking bitch,\u201d he murmured, rotating his jaw, setting himself, and lunging again.</p><p>He came at her like a bull, head down and forward, apparently intent on tackling her to the ground. But she was lighter, faster, more spritely. She turned to the side, neatly dodging his dive, and lifted a knee to catch him in the gut.</p><p>Magic rose in the room again, and the rest of the shifters began shuffling, obviously eager to join the fun.</p><p>The shifter in front of me\u2014a tall woman with a long blond braid\u2014grinned wolfishly. She wore the same leather jacket as the others, and ROSIE was embroidered into the front.</p> <p>I dipped my chin, pursed my lips, and grinned at her. \u201cShall we, Rosie?\u201d</p><p>The silver in my eyes spooked her; she swallowed hard and clenched her fingers, clearly rethinking her plan.</p><p>A boom on the other side of the room drew our attention away.</p><p>Lethal hit the hardwood floor on his back, then slid ten feet backward. His eyes were closed.</p><p>We looked at Emma, who shook her right hand, the knuckles split and dotted with blood. A hank of brown fair fell over her eyes, and she blew it up and out of her face.</p><p>I was in absolute awe, and a little bit in love.</p><p>Emma looked around at the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost four people, have one missing, and you still want to fight? How stupid and stubborn do you have to be to think going forward with Lup is a good idea? So we haven\u2019t finished it this year. Who cares? Since when are we defined by whether or not we have a party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLup isn\u2019t just a party!\u201d called a smart-ass from somewhere in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAnd neither are we. We are the shifters of the North American Central Pack. And we\u2019ve chosen Gabriel Keene to lead us. Until one of you has teeth enough to step forward and take it from him, then shut the hell up about it.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she stepped forward and marched out of the room with a dignified tilt to her chin.</p><p>\u201cI really like her,\u201d Ethan murmured.</p><p>\u201cI seriously want to be her best friend,\u201d Mallory said, glancing at me. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at her. \u201cI thought the exact same thing.\u201d</p><p>Curious, I glanced at Damien. By the avaricious glint in his eyes, I guessed Damien liked her, too.</p><p>Damien lifted his head, glanced around the room, daring the shifters to step forward. \u201cI think we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>Magic hovered for a moment but dissipated, and shifters began filing out of the room.</p><p>\u201cCrisis number three?\u201d I wondered, as we watched them leave.</p><p>Catcher laughed mirthlessly. \u201cIf we start counting crises, we won\u2019t have time to do anything else.\u201d</p><p>And thus was the state of supernaturals in Chicago.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>COME ON, ALINE</p><p>We found Gabriel in Papa Breck\u2019s office, sitting on the floor with Tanya and Connor, who sat on a colorful mat and gnawed on the ear of a plastic giraffe. He wore a long-sleeved baby-sized NAC shirt and baby jeans, which were stupidly adorable. I had an urge\u2014the first, as far as I\u2019m aware\u2014to nibble his little sausage toes. I decided the urge would not necessarily be welcome from someone with fangs, and kept my place.</p><p>Gabriel looked up, scanned us. \u201cGood evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left a mess back there,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI presume that was intentional?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntentional enough,\u201d Gabriel allowed. \u201cWe had to cancel Lup. There\u2019s no sense in continuing to risk the Pack to whatever\u2019s out there\u2014or whatever presumptively extinct group of supernatural assholes decide to show up on our doorstep tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t happy about the decision,\u201d Ethan carefully said, considering Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cOf course they aren\u2019t. They\u2019re shifters. They don\u2019t give up, and they don\u2019t give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you made the decision for them,\u201d I said.</p><p>Gabriel nodded, pleased. \u201cWell done, Kitten. If the Pack can\u2019t make the hard choices, I do it for them. If they decide the choice was wrong, they can confirm someone else as Apex.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d seen that before, when Adam Keene challenged Gabriel for control of the NAC. The fight hadn\u2019t been successful, and we hadn\u2019t seen or heard from Adam since.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way of our world,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cOut of curiosity, who threw the fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA delicate flower named Lethal,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI presume the moniker was well earned.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel acknowledged that with a nod and didn\u2019t look surprised at the identity of the troublemaker.</p><p>\u201cEmma stood up for your family, for the Pack,\u201d I said, smiling at Tanya. \u201cAnd did a good job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a good head on her shoulders. Entire family does, of course,\u201d Gabriel added, smiling at Tanya. He brushed fingers across her cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also got a great right hook,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cI taught her that,\u201d Tanya said, smiling up at Ethan. \u201cWe only look delicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is truth if I\u2019ve ever heard it,\u201d Gabriel said, tickling Connor until the baby hiccupped with delight. \u201cAny leads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut we have a plan. Just need to touch base with the House. It would be helpful to get Pack feedback on anything we do find.\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped into the room, acknowledged us with a nod. \u201cNo one\u2019s put forth a challenge yet,\u201d he told Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cIt will happen or it won\u2019t,\u201d Gabriel said. He bobbed his head toward us. \u201cThey need to talk to their team in Chicago. I think you can oblige them with the technology?\u201d</p><p>It was posed as a question, but his tone made the order obvious. Nick nodded obediently.</p><p>We followed him down a long, window-lined corridor to the western wing of the house, which had never been occupied, as far as I knew. This part of the house was utterly silent, and it was easy to imagine ghosts lurking in the darkened ends of corridors and inside wardrobes.</p><p>Ethan looked at me, and I shrugged. Whatever Nick had planned was a mystery to me.</p><p>He finally came to a stop in front of a nondescript door. On the wall beside it was a small wooden plaque with a brass plate. But the plaque was a ruse. He lifted it, revealing a digital screen recessed into the wall. He pressed his palm to it, and a red line of light passed back and forth along its surface, scanning for a signature.</p><p>When the scan was finished, there was a heavy metallic click within the doorframe. Several locks disengaging, I guessed.</p><p>\u201cA biometric lock,\u201d I said, impressed by the tech. \u201cDoes Jeff know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should,\u201d Nick answered, pushing open the door. \u201cHe designed it. And the rest of this.\u201d</p><p>It was like we\u2019d stepped into a time machine.</p><p>There, in the Jane Eyre\u2013esque hallways of the Breckenridge mansion, was a room that held the highest tech I\u2019d ever seen in real life. The floors were of the same hardwood as other parts of the house, but that was where the similarities ended. The room was dark, the better to view the massive screens that covered the three facing walls. There were no visible computers, but glass panels were placed around the room, their surfaces spinning with text and images, including the travel receipt we\u2019d seen on Aline\u2019s computer. A long, gleaming white conference table and chairs sat in the middle of the room, and Aline\u2019s cardboard box was propped upon it, an anachronism amid modern technology. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeff and Fallon stood in front of the closest screen, on which two horses and riders in full armor galloped across a plain toward a huge stone tower.</p><p>This was Jakob\u2019s Quest, Jeff\u2019s favorite video game. And it seemed he\u2019d found a partner in Fallon.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d Nick asked.</p> <p>Jeff and Fallon turned back to us, both wearing headsets.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d Jeff said with a smile. \u201cFigured you\u2019d make your way in here eventually. Thought we\u2019d kill some time while you did.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Fallon. \u201cHe\u2019s convinced you to join him?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cOther way around, I\u2019m afraid. I introduced him to Jakob\u2019s Quest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Jeff said with a smile, pulling off his headset.</p> <p>I bobbed my head toward the screen. \u201cI assume Jakob\u2019s the male rider. Who\u2019s the chick?\u201d</p><p>The female character was impressively dressed in a jointed suit of armor much like Jakob\u2019s, but shaped for her curvier and more petite form. Her hair was long and golden, pulled into a complicated braid down her back, and her eyes were blue. A tattoo on her left cheek looked like a Celtic knot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Adriel,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cShe\u2019s the kingdom\u2019s crown princess, but she gave the throne to her twin brother and sister so she could keep the land safe.\u201d</p><p>Jeff reached out his hand and she took it, and they shared a look of such intimacy and love that I turned away, not wanting to intrude on it.</p><p>Ethan touched the back of my neck, acknowledging the love that swirled in the room.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve covered the software,\u201d Ethan said lightly, \u201cthe hardware looks equally impressive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she said,\u201d Jeff muttered. Love or not, he was still Jeff. I bit back a smile at Fallon\u2019s eye roll.</p><p>\u201cWe put it in a few months ago,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAfter the incident involving Jamie.\u201d</p><p>The incident had been an unfortunate attempt at blackmail that Papa Breck believed was our fault. That was at least some of the reason for the strained relationship between us.</p><p>Nick walked to a freestanding screen, swirled a hand across the glass and, when a keyboard prompt filled the screen, typed in a password. The screen shifted, throwing up images of the house, the grounds on the right side. The left side showed news channels, newspaper headlines.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impressive,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cHave you had much cause to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until this weekend,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, not until after the fact.\u201d</p><p>I heard the guilt in his voice, the regret they hadn\u2019t been able to stop the harpies or elves ahead of time.</p><p>\u201cSecurity cameras do not afford the gift of premonition,\u201d Ethan kindly said, hands behind his back as he stepped forward to review the screen. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard about Scott Grey?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThe mayor doesn\u2019t seem eager to let up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ethan agreed, sliding his hands into his pockets. \u201cShe does not, although I suppose that\u2019s not entirely surprising considering her past actions.\u201d</p><p>Jeff swiped the screen again, and Jakob and his trusty steed disappeared, replaced by a mock-up of the dry-erase board from the House\u2019s Ops Room.</p><p>\u201cYou made a whiteboard for us?\u201d I asked with a grin.</p><p>Jeff shrugged adorably. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of become a team. It seemed like the thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with that,\u201d Nick said, moving toward the door, \u201cI\u2019ll let you get to work.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cThe Brecks have a house of pissed-off Pack members,\u201d Jeff explained. \u201cThey\u2019ll be packing up, heading out, and he wants to make sure they remain calm until they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely understandable,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk business.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I was becoming a private eye. I really needed to learn more of the lingo.</p><p>\u201cThe receipt,\u201d Jeff said, enlarging it on the screen. \u201cShowing a flight to Anchorage. I talked to Luc, who talked to his connection at the airlines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-girlfriend,\u201d I murmured, and Ethan whistled low, apparently recognizing the potential drama that would cause.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So she confirmed Aline was on the passenger manifest for the Anchorage flight, but she didn\u2019t show up or call to cancel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ticket could have been a plant,\u201d Mallory suggested, but Jeff shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDamien called the Meadows,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cShe reserved a room but didn\u2019t show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Meadows is where shifters stay when they\u2019re in Aurora,\u201d I explained. \u201cSo she didn\u2019t get on her flight. And, more important, she didn\u2019t actually arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she changed her plans?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cOr she met with foul play on the way to the airport,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen anything in the news along those lines. The receipts in the storage box were dated up to three days before Lupercalia,\u201d Jeff said, showing a spreadsheet that itemized each and every one of them. He\u2019d been busy. \u201cAnd since we didn\u2019t find anything else in the locker, I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a red herring. She buys the storage locker because, literally, she\u2019s running out of space in her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was that bad?\u201d Mallory wondered.</p><p>\u201cIt was that bad,\u201d Jeff and I simultaneously agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also possible she was never going to get onto that plane, and someone went to a lot of trouble to fake us out,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of trouble to go to for a Pack outcast,\u201d Catcher said, crossing his arms with a frown.</p><p>\u201cOr it\u2019s exactly the right kind of trouble,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna take out a shifter, why not make it a troublemaker no one\u2019s likely to miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr both,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s a troublemaker. She planned to defect back to Alaska. But she didn\u2019t make it to the airport because someone intercepted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re going to intercept her, why do it with harpies and a full-on attack? Why not just grab her at home?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cFor fun and profit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a shifter,\u201d Jeff said quietly. \u201cShe may be a pain in the ass, but she\u2019s still a shifter. She\u2019d put up a fight if she knew they were coming. And if they don\u2019t have power of their own\u2014if they\u2019re using magic and other species to do the fighting for them\u2014maybe they thought the fight was necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe elves managed to grab you and Damien,\u201d Catcher pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAn army of elves,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cWith threats and promises to kill Merit if we didn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cSo the harpies were a cover, or a way to completely throw the Pack off balance and sneak Aline away. We talked to her right before the ceremony began, so she didn\u2019t leave long before the attack.\u201d He glanced at Jeff. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there are cameras in the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are not,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cJust around the house. I\u2019ve run facial recognition, but there\u2019s no footage of her returning from the woods to the house.\u201d</p><p>Catcher nodded. \u201cSo she didn\u2019t sneak back in when the fight was under way, grab a bag, leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play this out from the beginning,\u201d I said, walking closer to the screen and glancing at the timeline. \u201cShe was living in her house, running errands, saving stuff. She comes to the Brecks\u2019 house. We meet her in the woods; the ceremony begins. The harpies attack.\u201d I glanced back at the group. \u201cDoes anybody remember seeing her during the attack or afterward?\u201d</p><p>There was only telling silence.</p><p>\u201cTruthfully,\u201d Jeff said, rubbing the back of his neck, \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for her. But no, I didn\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>Ethan stepped behind me, pressed his lips to my neck. \u201cI love it when you play detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d I said, but I said it with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cNiera,\u201d I said. \u201cAn elf and a mother. She was taken during or after the glamoury magic was used on the elves. And that attack happened during the day after the harpy attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re assuming these are kidnappings, what could Aline and Niera possibly have in common? What\u2019s the motivation for taking them both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both sups,\u201d Mallory pointed out. \u201cThere are plenty of people out there who hate us. Maybe the motivation\u2019s political.\u201d</p><p>But Catcher shook his head. \u201cPolitical means proving a point. There\u2019s no evidence of murder here, nobody claiming responsibility. By all accounts, the attacks were by two completely different groups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich we\u2019ve decided is technically impossible, since vampires were the second group. If one group was doing this\u2014or one person\u2014who could it be?\u201d I glanced at Catcher, Mallory. \u201cThis is old-fashioned magic, right? The kind you do, or make. So that\u2019s sorcerer territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Catcher said, shifting uncomfortably. \u201cBut it couldn\u2019t be anyone we actually know. Baumgartner, Mallory, Simon, Paige, me. That\u2019s the entire crew within the tristate area. And you\u2019d have to be closer than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re missing someone, or ignoring them. Are there any other sups who could do this, who may or may not be extinct, or who we think are just mythological creatures?\u201d</p><p>No one answered, so I took that as a no. Frustration building, I looked back at Catcher and Mallory. \u201cOkay. So you guys can funnel the power of the universe, right?\u201d</p><p>They shared a glance that was intimate enough to make me uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes. Are there sups who can, I don\u2019t know, work spells or magic that might seem like the good sorcerer stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be sorcerers,\u201d Catcher flatly said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took that as a no.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s phone beeped, and my heart jumped nervously. He glanced at the screen, nodded, looked at Jeff. \u201cIt\u2019s the librarian. Can we conference him in?\u201d</p><p>Jeff took Ethan\u2019s phone, and when Jeff tapped a few keys, the librarian appeared on-screen, his dark, wavy hair sticking up in disheveled locks, as it usually did. He wore a polo shirt and a new pair of black-rimmed glasses that, however unnecessary, added to his debonair-scholar appeal.</p> <p>Beside him sat Paige, a woman who was almost ridiculously attractive. Vibrant, short red hair with a Marilyn-esque wave, pale skin, green eyes. She wore a heather gray Cadogan House sweatshirt that somehow, on her, looked elegant.</p><p>We\u2019d found Paige keeping a lock on the Order\u2019s archives in Nebraska until Dominic Tate burned the place down. And then we brought her home, with the last few books she\u2019d managed to pull from the flames.</p><p>\u201cLibrarian. Paige,\u201d Ethan said in greeting.</p><p>Paige offered a small wave.</p><p>\u201cLiege,\u201d the librarian said.</p> <p>\u201cHave you identified any connection between Aline and Niera?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cDirectly? No,\u201d he said. \u201cNo information on Niera beyond what you\u2019ve provided, for obvious reasons. Basic biographical information for Aline, but nothing terribly interesting there. No, the key here isn\u2019t Niera and Aline; it\u2019s their disappearances. Long story short, they aren\u2019t the only ones who are gone.\u201d</p><p>If the librarian hadn\u2019t yet gotten everyone\u2019s attention, he got it now. Even the low hum of the computers seemed to drop another decibel.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have anything in common except for the fact that they\u2019re supernaturals and they\u2019ve disappeared. So we dug through newspapers and missing persons bulletins in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and . . .\u201d He fumbled through a stack of papers on the table in front of him.</p><p>\u201cMinnesota,\u201d Paige politely finished, sliding him a smile. \u201cYou always forget Minnesota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always forget Minnesota,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe looked over those records for the last three years and cross-referenced the records with the North American Vampire Registry, friends in the community, anyone else we could think of to identify whether any of those missing persons were supernaturals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe talked to Merit\u2019s grandfather,\u201d Paige said. \u201cHe seemed very eager to offer his thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s probably ready to jump out of his skin and appreciated the distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he was,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to seeing you. I told him I\u2019d pass along his love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it passed.\u201d</p><p>The librarian cleared his throat. He wasn\u2019t much for chitchat. \u201cWe took those missing supernaturals and looked for an associated supernatural event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn attack,\u201d I said, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo harpies,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are instances of magical attacks with some of those kidnappings. One involved a sudden bout of bloodlust\u2014set off a bar brawl. Another was an indoor pixie attack. Nothing at the scale of the harpies or elf glamour, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many did you find?\u201d Ethan asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat we can confirm, six.\u201d</p><p>Ethan blinked at the screen. \u201cSix missing sups with attacks? How has no one noticed this before? Realized this was going on?\u201d</p><p>The librarian frowned. \u201cWhy would they? Supernaturals didn\u2019t used to talk to each other. Most of this happened before we were out of the closet. Some group attacks you, you lose a member, you probably aren\u2019t going to publicize it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cWhat groups did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the unusual thing,\u201d the librarian said, crossing his arms on the table and leaning forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a veritable Noah\u2019s ark: troll of the non-River variety, sylph, doppelg\u00e4nger, giantess, a suspected but unconfirmed leprechaun, and an incubus.\u201d</p><p>There was a buzz of recognition in my bones. \u201cWhat about shifters and elves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d he said. The librarian read the names of the missing in chronological order, and Jeff added them to the growing \u201cVictims\u201d list on our electronic whiteboard, which already included Niera and Aline.</p><p>I scanned the list and looked back at Ethan, dread growing cold and heavy in my stomach. \u201cHow many of these species live together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d the librarian asked, lifting his gaze to me. \u201cIn families?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamilies, clans, houses, whatever. How many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncubi tend to live alone. Ditto doppelg\u00e4ngers, trolls. The rest live in small bands\u2014usually family-based structures. But that would be maybe five or six together at most. Nothing even approaching the size of a Pack or elf clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the ferocity,\u201d Paige said, scanning a paper in front of her. \u201cMost of the creatures on the missing list are relatively peaceful, keep to themselves. Incubi and leprechauns can be troublemakers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is Noah\u2019s ark,\u201d I said, walking to the board and pointing at the top of the list of victims we\u2019d assembled chronologically. The first on the list? An incubus.</p><p>\u201cYou start with the solitary species,\u201d I said. \u201cOne supernatural at a time. Sups who live alone, who assimilate. They\u2019re easier to trap, to catch. And their human friends just think they\u2019ve moved along, or they\u2019ve been the victim of some traditional human violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you ramp up,\u201d Jeff said, moving beside me to get a full view of the screen. \u201cYou target the sups who only band together in small groups. The ones less likely to put up a fight, or the ones you can easily overcome in size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd once you\u2019ve built up your confidence, you move to the trooping animals,\u201d I said. \u201cElves and shifters are harder to grab, their magic stronger, their groups significantly larger. So you employ big magic\u2014full-on attacks to keep the groups distracted while you happily sneak away with one of their own. Perhaps you kill a few in the process, but who cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cbut they could have snatched Aline at home or alone. Why make it complicated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say Merit\u2019s right,\u201d Mallory said, crossing her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s the real motive? So you have a bunch of different supernaturals. A checklist of some kind, and you\u2019re marking them off one by one. Why? What\u2019s the reason for something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHatred of supernaturals,\u201d Ethan suggested. \u201cTaking them out one by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t found any bodies,\u201d I said. \u201cIf this was political, like something McKetrick would have done, there\u2019d be some sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe research?\u201d Paige suggested. \u201cCould be a group looking for tissue samples, scans, X-rays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of thing would probably be governmental,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cbut this doesn\u2019t really smell governmental. The feds prefer black helicopters to harpies. They might be interested in researching magic, but they aren\u2019t the types to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be ego,\u201d I suggested. \u201cSomeone working their way through the supernatural catalogue to prove that they can. To prove they\u2019re equipped and knowledgeable enough to best all kinds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike an MMA fighter working his way up the ranks?\u201d Catcher wondered. \u201cThat\u2019s weird, but we\u2019ve seen weirder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of person has that much ego?\u201d Mallory asked. \u201cWould feel a need to work over, to serially kidnap, supernaturals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he or she isn\u2019t killing them,\u201d I wondered, \u201cif these are actual kidnappings\u2014then where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the next question,\u201d Ethan said, and lifted his gaze to the librarian. \u201cSuggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>As it happened, he did have suggestions. The librarian pulled dossiers from the missing sups with whatever background information he\u2019d been able to find, and microfiche copies of local newspapers from the days of the disappearances. He sent the electronic files to Jeff, who directed them to video screens that were inset in the large conference table.</p><p>We updated Luc with what we\u2019d found, then read and scanned the materials for two solid hours, perusing coupons for white sales and new car deals, stories about sports championships of every make and model, and the local dramas that played out across the pages. And we still came up empty.</p><p>Jeff\u2019s whiteboard was littered with potential links between the disappearances, connections we hoped would lead us to the actual responsible parties. Two of the sups had disappeared on holidays\u2014Fourth of July and Labor Day\u2014but only two. The rest were scattered across the calendar like confetti. Most were taken in summer and fall, but we decided that was probably because the sups were more active, more visible, when the weather wasn\u2019t miserable. Who wanted to traipse through four feet of Minnesota snow to kidnap a giantess?</p><p>At the end of our two hours, we paused and stretched, and Jeff ordered drinks from the Brecks\u2019 staff, who seemed more than happy to deliver them to a shifter of his repute. But the man who brought them still managed to give the rest of us dour looks on the way out.</p><p>We sipped coffee and nibbled the edges of the shortbread cookies, walking around the table to scan the others\u2019 screens, just in case a fresh pair of eyes would help tag something useful.</p><p>Turns out, it was a good strategy.</p><p>Mallory, who was across the room\u2019s conference table from me, nibbled on a shortbread biscuit and scanned the screen in front of her. She smiled, looked up. \u201cYou know what I haven\u2019t done in forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSat still for ten minutes without distraction?\u201d</p><p>She gave Catcher a childish face, then tapped at the screen. \u201cThe carnival. I haven\u2019t been to the carnival in forever.\u201d</p><p>Connections tripped and triggered in my brain, and I looked up at her. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cThe carnival. I haven\u2019t been in years. I love a good corn dog. The deep-fried kind, not the fake ones you can bake at home. If it hasn\u2019t been swimming in oil, it\u2019s not a real corn dog. Who\u2019s with me on that?\u201d She lifted her hand and glanced around the room, looking for support.</p><p>But my mind was forming a connection. I held up a hand. \u201cWait\u2014what made you say that about the carnival?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pointed to the screen. \u201cThere\u2019s an article about this carnival that was in\u201d\u2014she scrolled to the top of the page\u2014\u201cClear Lake, Minnesota.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeff,\u201d I said, and without needing additional direction, he was up and moving the data on Mallory\u2019s screen to the overhead.</p><p>The wonders of the Sidusky &amp; Sons Carnival were spread in glorious color across two facing pages of the Clear Lake Anthem, advertising miraculous sights, thrilling rides, and midway games to test the strongest and cleverest of men.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2014why does the carnival matter?\u201d Ethan asked with a frown.</p><p>Jeff and I looked at each other, nodded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a carnival right now in Loring Park,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Jeff gestured to the box. \u201cAline went to it. We found tickets from the midway in her box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe carnival was here when Aline disappeared. The carnival was in Clear Lake when the giantess disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Catcher looked at Jeff. \u201cCan you scan the rest of the newspapers for carnival ads or stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Jeff said, and he was sweeping his hands across the screen, arranging files so the newspapers formed a neat grid across the screen. He entered a query into the search box. Almost instantly, matches began popping up across the screen, highlighting articles about the carnival that had visited so many midwestern towns.</p><p>The carnivals changed with every pass. Sidusky &amp; Sons. The Bollero Bros. William\u2019s Amazing Traveling Wondershow. But the stories were essentially the same, as were the photographs of the Tunnel of Horrors.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same carnival as the one in Loring Park,\u201d I said, excitement building. \u201cI recognize the ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what are we looking at?\u201d Catcher asked. \u201cA carnie with a hatred of sups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a carnie who loves them a little too much?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>Ethan slid me a glance. \u201cSentinel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re looking at a collector of supernaturals,\u201d I said. \u201cIncubus, doppelg\u00e4nger, troll, sylph, giantess, leprechaun, shifter, elf. And if they really are being kidnapped, being held, maybe they\u2019re doing it for a reason. Maybe they\u2019re being displayed somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA supernatural freak show?\u201d Ethan asked. \u201cPerhaps. Did you see an attraction like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd it was a pretty small carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes it easy to unload,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cEasy to pack up and leave again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich they clearly are doing, considering how much they move around.\u201d Ethan frowned, worried his bottom lip while he mulled the information on-screen. \u201cUnfortunately, we aren\u2019t entirely sure who we\u2019re looking for. Is the entire carnival at fault? An errant employee? If they\u2019re holding the sups, then where? Jeff, can you see what you can find about the carnival, the owners?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Jeff said. Normally, I\u2019d have heard the clack of keys in the background. But since he\u2019d upgraded his tech, his work was silent. I didn\u2019t realize I missed the sound\u2014a comforting reminder that Jeff was there and his magic fingers were engaged\u2014until it was gone.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to cringe. \u201cThis is going to take a while,\u201d he said, pointing at the screen, where he\u2019d opened a search engine but had gotten no results.</p><p>\u201cFirst run on the carnival isn\u2019t pulling up anything other than the articles we\u2019ve already seen. Not a Better Business Bureau complaint, a business filing, a single online review.\u201d</p><p>Ethan frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry impossible,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cFor a business that\u2019s been around this long, to this many states, there should at least be a review, a social media mention, if not the hard copy articles we\u2019ve already found. But there\u2019s a complete blackout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re careful about what goes online,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cLet us know if you find anything.\u201d I glanced at Ethan. \u201cWe can make this trip just informational. Spy on the carnival for a bit?\u201d</p><p>Ethan frowned at the screen again, propping his hands on his hips, mulling his options.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he finally decided. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake to risk an opportunity like this.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the estate, but you can. Go to the carnival. And quickly. Find an employee to interview, peacefully, quietly, and with no collateral damage. We need information before they move on, or we\u2019re going to be out of luck. Especially if they\u2019re so careful about their electronic trail. If Aline and Niera were their quarry, they may already be preparing to move.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the screen, where Paige and the librarian still watched our discussion after their own break for snacks. \u201cTry to identify friends, colleagues, of the missing sups. See what they remember about the carnival. Perhaps their missing friends mentioned it, made an acquaintance there, anything. Perhaps we\u2019ll get lucky. I\u2019ll stay here and get Luc up to speed.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound thrilled about the possibility, but leaving the Brecks\u2019 house wasn\u2019t an option for him right now.</p><p>\u201cCatcher, Mallory, Jeff, could you please accompany Merit on a field trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can find the time,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>Jeff and Catcher began discussing transportation options while Mallory slipped an arm through mine. \u201cIs this seriously what you guys do all night? Make like Veronica Mars and solve crimes?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, nodded. \u201cAs it turns out, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d She pulled her hair back and into a ponytail, using an elastic she\u2019d kept around her wrist. \u201cAlthough I feel like we need embroidered jackets. Like the satin ones? We could be just like the Pink Ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the boss,\u201d I said. My voice was sarcastic, my but heart thudded with excitement I\u2019d never admit aloud. I\u2019d always wanted to be a Pink Lady.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>BARNSTORMING</p><p>Catcher drove his sedan. Jeff sat shotgun, while Mallory and I shared the back.</p><p>The night was dark, the country roads essentially empty and thankfully clear of elven armies. Still, every time we neared a streetlight or floodlight, my stomach clenched with fear that we\u2019d see the outline of a battalion of soldiers cresting a hill, bows in hand and arrows ready to strike.</p><p>Catcher had dialed in Luc and Ethan. \u201cLadies and gents,\u201d came Luc\u2019s voice through the speakers. \u201cOnce again, you\u2019re enjoying an adventure without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t time them that way.\u201d Ethan\u2019s voice followed Luc\u2019s. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not there, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it should be,\u201d Luc said. \u201cAt least you had sense enough not to attempt to lead this particular away team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar Trek,\u201d I murmured, picking out one of Luc\u2019s ubiquitous movie and television references.</p><p>\u201cI have trained you well, Padawan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mixing your Wars and Treks,\u201d Jeff pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re interchangeable,\u201d Luc said, earning a horrified look from Jeff. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give us the rundown on the carnival?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to remember the layout. \u201cIt\u2019s in the corner of the shopping center parking lot. A small carnival\u2014five or six rides, a midway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemis or trucks?\u201d Catcher asked. \u201cI presume that\u2019s how they\u2019ve moved the carnival from town to town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably park the trucks off-site,\u201d Luc said. \u201cKeep them out of the public eye. Merit, what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a low fence\u2014a gate\u2014around it. Like a crowd-control barrier. Otherwise it\u2019s open. The rides are mostly along the outsides, with the games and food in the middle. The attendants were pretty well dressed. They wore full outfits\u2014costumes.\u201d</p><p>As we neared the shopping center, my nerves began to light, my blood running faster, anticipating the coming confrontation. When a rock bounced off the windshield, I nearly fell to the floorboard, my heart palpitating with tangible fear. Post-elven stress disorder was no laughing matter.</p><p>But when Catcher turned the car into the shopping center, the parking lot was empty.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d I said, hope deflating, and barely waiting for the car to stop before I opened the door and hopped out.</p><p>Everything was gone\u2014the rides, the ticket booth, the games. The tourists and the carnies. Only the detritus of the carnival remained. The scents of fried food and exhaust, puddles of dirty water, scabs of black tape where cords had been adhered to the asphalt.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have been that far behind,\u201d I said, turning back to the group, who\u2019d joined me in the lot. \u201cYou can still smell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they thought their luck was running out,\u201d Mallory said, \u201cso they decided to pick up camp and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they accomplished their goals and they\u2019re moving on to the next spot,\u201d I said, blue that we\u2019d missed our targets. Utterly.</p><p>Catcher turned back to the car. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the Brecks\u2019. Maybe Ethan can get Paige and the librarian started on where it might have gone next.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then glanced up at the shopping center. The grocery store was closest to the carnival, and it was the only shop still open. A few people milled around inside, visible between the stems and serifs of the giant gilded letters that advised passersby of sales and specials. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gestured toward the store. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I check out the grocery store? I\u2019ll ask when the carnival left, if they know where it\u2019s going next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get kidnapped this time,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cEthan gets irritable when you get kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only one of the many reasons he gets irritable,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do my best. But I make no promises.\u201d</p> <p>Considering the crimes we were investigating, that seemed best.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was late, but the grocery store glowed with light and welcome heat. Disco played on the store\u2019s sound system, and the cashier nearest the door smiled when I entered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have been more than twenty, and she didn\u2019t seem to mind the late hour or the dearth of customers. She filed her nails and hummed along with the music, a headband with fuzzy cat\u2019s ears poking from her otherwise straight jet-black hair. She looked up at me and took in the katana when I walked over. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cNice sword,\u201d she said in a whisper when I moved closer. \u201cThat\u2019s a katana, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is, yeah,\u201d I said with a smile. I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d worn it, and appreciated that she didn\u2019t feel the urge to signal the manager.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Question for you.\u201d I hitched a thumb toward the window. \u201cThe carnival that was here\u2014when did it pack up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why? Were you hoping to win a goldfish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d My prey was significantly larger, but I didn\u2019t mention that aloud. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know where they were headed next?\u201d</p><p>The front doors shushed open. A woman with short blond hair walked into the grocery store. She wore snug jeans and a short red cape with a hood. It barely reached her waist and was perfectly cut, the type of garment you\u2019d see on a New York runway. A very expensive leather handbag\u2014the kind my sister, Charlotte, might have bought in the stores on Oak Street\u2014was tucked on her arm. She looked, I thought with a smile, like a very chic Little Red Riding Hood.</p> <p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d said the cashier, drawing my gaze again. \u201cI\u2019m not really into kiddie carnivals, you know?\u201d</p><p>I took in the cat\u2019s ears, the Rainbow Brite T-shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ll appreciate them when you\u2019re older. Thanks for the help.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and went back to her nails.</p><p>I walked toward the door but caught another glimpse of the girl who\u2019d come in. She grabbed a red basket from a stack near the door and headed to the pharmacy aisle.</p><p>She looked familiar. I squinted, trying to remember the face and where I might have seen her. She wasn\u2019t a shifter. Not an elf, certainly, with that haircut or fashion sense. And she was down a bow and sense of entitlement.</p><p>I walked quietly closer, pretending to be interested in hot cocoa mix, dandruff shampoo, frozen chicken dinners. She pulled supplies\u2014bandages, rubbing alcohol, gauze\u2014into her basket.</p><p>A clerk stepped in front of me, blocking my view. He was another teenager, this time with dark skin, short braids, and suspicious eyes. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a box of soda crackers from the Willis Tower\u2013shaped display in front of me. \u201cAre these, you know, on special?\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me for a moment, gestured toward the display. \u201cThe sign says they\u2019re two ninety-nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d I perkily said. I turned to a nearby shelf and pretended to be very, very interested in wasabi-flavored popcorn. Actually, I didn\u2019t have to try that hard. It was wasabi-flavored popcorn. I was already intrigued.</p><p>I waited a beat. Apparently satisfied that I\u2019d only been nosy, and not pre-felonious, he disappeared. When the sound of his footsteps dissipated, I peeked around the end of the aisle again. The girl inspected the medical tape, and when a clerk approached and offered help, she waved him off with a smile, dimples at the sides of her cheeks. She turned just slightly, and I caught sight of her singularly gray eyes.</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew where I\u2019d seen her.</p><p>Her hair was different now, and her clothes. She was no longer a brunette, no longer wearing her uniform, no longer enticing customers into the Tunnel of Horrors. But there was no denying the smile.</p><p>She was the carnival barker.</p><p>Like a deer scenting a predator, her head popped up, her eyes scanning for trouble.</p><p>She caught my gaze, and there was a hint of a smile on her face. But she turned back to the tape, fingers skimming the boxes.</p><p>I walked around the corner, checked out a rack of plastic sunglasses while Lionel Richie crooned on the store\u2019s music system.</p><p>The girl moved forward, disappearing into an aisle that, according to the sign hanging above it, held chips and soda.</p><p>Ever so quietly, I shifted closer, and when I reached the aisle, looked around the corner.</p><p>She was gone, but the thick rubber flaps that covered the entrance to the back room were swinging, and her basket was on the floor, the contents strewn about. She\u2019d definitely made me.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t my only problem.</p><p>In her wake were scents much too familiar\u2014sulfur and smoke. Dominic Tate, Seth Tate\u2019s vanquished worse half, had smelled the same. But Dominic was dead; I\u2019d seen Seth destroy him. Seth had left Chicago, and his scent had been different\u2014lemon and sugar, like freshly baked cookies.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t known any other Messengers, as the dueling angels had once been called. And yet, here I was, standing in a grocery store that smelled like the devil\u2019s front porch.</p><p>I muttered a curse and took off, following her through the flaps and into a cold room that stank of overripe produce and cardboard. The room was large, with a polished concrete floor and office built into a corner. I ran to the office. A man in a collared short-sleeved shirt sat at the desk, munching on a sandwich. Roast beef, by the smell of it.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be back here!\u201d he yelled, over a mouthful of beef and bread.</p><p>\u201cJust passing through,\u201d I promised, then hurried down a narrow hallway to a storage area. This one held ten-foot-high stacks of boxes and wooden pallets. There was a back door across the room, but no one in sight.</p><p>\u201cCan we just talk?\u201d I asked, peering around a mountain of soda cartons, and caught a glance of blond hair hurrying away when a skyscraper of pallets rocked like a children\u2019s block-stacking game. As always, gravity won.</p><p>I jumped aside and missed the falling tower, tripped over a box behind me, and ended up on my ass one way or the other.</p><p>Footsteps echoed through the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d asked the meaty voice behind me. The back door clanged shut as the woman slipped through it.</p><p>I rose, ignoring the manager and his threats of police calls and litigation, but decided to send a little thank-you to Papa Breck in consideration for all the kindness he\u2019d shown us.</p><p>\u201cThe Breckenridges will be happy to pay for any damages,\u201d I said, jumping over the messy pile of pallets and vaulting toward the back door. I slammed through it only to see her dart across the drive that ran behind the shopping center to the chain-link fence that separated it from the next property. A scrubby and empty lot, by the look of it.</p><p>I ran to the fence, jumped up a few feet, and began to climb. There was nothing remotely movielike about it, or elegant. The chain link wasn\u2019t securely attached, and it bobbed beneath my feet like I was climbing a rope ladder. I hit the top, felt skin slice as my palm caught one of the bare prongs of chain link. Ignoring the pain, I threw my body over the top and hit the ground.</p><p>Only then did I recall the fact that I could have simply jumped over the damn thing. Maybe the House library was the place for me.</p><p>The girl was already running full out across the lot, which was pockmarked with piles of dirty snow, frozen hillocks of dirt, and construction debris. Something had been planned for this space, but considering the cracked and peeling WILL BUILD TO SUIT sign that lay abandoned on the ground, it wasn\u2019t going to be finished anytime soon.</p><p>She ran with the long-legged grace of a marathon runner. I had vampiric speed and enhanced bone and muscle, but she was the running type, with a long stride and smooth motion that made it look completely effortless.</p><p>She reached a large concrete pad, hopped onto it, glanced back, searching the darkness to see if I was still behind her.</p><p>Because I was busy watching her, and not the ground in front of me, I didn\u2019t see the ditch until it was too late.</p><p>I fell down into the three-foot-deep depression, hit my knees on the ice and inches of muddy water that had accumulated in the bottom. The fall jarred me, and it took a moment to get my brain unscrambled. I got back onto my feet and toed up a knobby dirt incline until I was at ground level again.</p><p>I spat out a curse that would have raised even my liberal grandfather\u2019s hackles, and put my hands on my knees to catch my breath.</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have just disappeared,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>We stood on the edge of the lot, surveying the darkness, eyes straining for any sign or scent of the girl who\u2019d so handily eluded me.</p><p>\u201cShe disappeared,\u201d I assured him, trying my best to squeegee mud from my leather pants. \u201cI hit a ditch, wasn\u2019t down for more than a few seconds. When I looked up, she was gone. And she\u2019s fast. I never got closer than ten feet, and that was in the building. Out here, she was like a rocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupernatural?\u201d Jeff asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, yeah.\u201d I glanced at Mallory, worried how she\u2019d react. \u201cShe smelled like smoke and sulfur.\u201d</p><p>Jeff frowned. \u201cSmoke and sulfur?\u201d</p><p>He might not have understood the connection, but Mallory clearly did. She paled. \u201cLike Dominic Tate. It\u2019s what the fallen smell like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, damn,\u201d Jeff murmured, clearly understanding.</p><p>\u201cDominic\u2019s dead,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>\u201cSeth said there could be more Messengers out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not the fallen ones,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cThey were magically bound together into the Maleficium. Seth and Dominic only separated because Claudia kept Dominic safe all those years ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or so we thought. This, I feared, was not going to help Mallory\u2019s recovery\u2014having the Messengers and Maleficium thrown back in her face again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cIf this has anything to do with me, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Catcher rubbed her back. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about what she is right now. Let\u2019s think about who she is and how we can find her.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cDid she have any other physical characteristics we can search on? Piercings? Tattoos?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. Clothes looked expensive. Hair was blond, short. She had darker hair on the midway. It must have been a wig.\u201d I glanced at Catcher and Mallory. \u201cCan you do some kind of searching spell and find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocating spells are actually pretty complicated,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cThey don\u2019t work like bloodhounds. Otherwise we\u2019d just use that box of stuff from the storage locker to find Aline. We\u2019d have to have something substantial\u2014something marked by her magical signature.\u201d</p><p>If only she\u2019d whipped that expensive purse at me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the grocery store had security cameras,\u201d I suggested, looking at Jeff. \u201cCould you do something with facial recognition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d he said, already thumbing his phone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was she buying?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>\u201cMedical supplies\u2014bandages, gauze. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo either she\u2019s a conscientious employer or a zookeeper with wounded animals,\u201d Catcher suggested.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf she\u2019s still here getting supplies, the carnival can\u2019t be too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trucks pulled out about half an hour ago,\u201d Mallory said with a smile. \u201cI followed up with the store. Pretended I had no clue why a woman had wreaked havoc in the back room. Made a few pithy comments about the state of the world, and the cashier opened right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat\u2019s ears?\u201d I wondered.</p> <p>Mallory frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She clearly hadn\u2019t spoken to the same cashier. \u201cNever mind. Continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Rhoda\u2014that was her name, Rhoda\u2014said the carnies kept to themselves, but before and after shift they\u2019d come into the store for provisions. Snacks, drinks, deli food, booze, depending on the mood. She likes to travel\u2014she and her husband have a camper\u2014so she tried to make conversation about their route, but they wouldn\u2019t talk about it. Paid for their gear and left again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if the cashier had known where they were going next,\u201d I said, \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll change their schedule. She knew we\u2019d found her. Took one look at me and bolted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where do we think they\u2019ll go next?\u201d Mallory asked.</p><p>I smiled mirthlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to add to your collection of sups, and you\u2019re an hour from the Windy City, which has the largest proportion of vampire Houses in the nation, not to mention nymphs, trolls, and God knows what else. I\u2019ll give you one guess: You aren\u2019t going to Disneyland.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We drove sullenly back to the Breckenridge house, none of us thrilled that we\u2019d been so easily thwarted.</p> <p>As we neared the house, we began to pass cars. A single car here and there, and then groups of four or five in succession. It was more traffic than I\u2019d ever seen on the rural road that led to the estate.</p><p>\u201cThe shifters are going home,\u201d Catcher said, as we pulled into the driveway. There was something sad about that\u2014it was morose that they\u2019d departed under such unfortunate circumstances. Or maybe it was just the magic in the air, or the growing absence of it.</p><p>Gabriel met us at the door, Ethan beside him. We migrated into the front parlor, now empty of shifters, and out of the cold.</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire carnival was packed up, moved out,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cMerit found one of them in the grocery store, chased her down, but wasn\u2019t able to nab her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifted slightly amused eyes to me. \u201cThat true, Kitten? Did you actually miss your prey?\u201d</p><p>I decided not to tell him that I missed her because I fell in a ditch, as that would only add a thick layer of humiliation to the existing regret. I settled for glum.</p><p>\u201cI missed her,\u201d I confirmed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I might have found her,\u201d Jeff said, rocking proudly on his heels. \u201cI was busy on the ride back.\u201d</p><p>I thought the backseat had been quiet. \u201cGrocery store footage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He pulled out a sleek square of glass that looked like a miniature version of the screens in the Brecks\u2019 operations room, began to skim his fingers across it. The glass went smoky and nearly opaque, and images and text began to scroll across the front.</p><p>\u201cAnother new toy?\u201d I asked. I wasn\u2019t much for gadgets, but it looked so deliciously tactile.</p><p>He kept his eyes on the screen, but a corner of his mouth perked up. \u201cA portable to match the rest of the hardware. And here we are.\u201d He held up the glass, swiveling it so the rest of us could see.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d I said immediately, recognizing the light hair, dark eyes, dimpled cheeks. The shot, remarkably clear, was taken at the front entrance of the grocery store.</p><p>\u201cThe grocery store was robbed about a year ago, and they invested in some quality hardware. I told them we were investigating the dark-haired girl with the leather jacket\u201d\u2014that was me\u2014\u201cand the manager was more than happy to pass the photo along.\u201d He lifted his gaze, grinned full out. \u201cHe also asked about billing Papa Breck for the damages. Said they\u2019d agreed to pay.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel flicked a glance my way.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, we were there on Pack business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay the store,\u201d Gabriel dourly said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll remember this incident the next time we hire vampires to do our dirty work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd consider paying us next time instead of extortion. But back to the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name,\u201d Jeff said, flipping the screen back and typing furiously, \u201cis Regan, and I only found that because she\u2019d been interviewed in one of the older articles about the carnival we uploaded. No last name, no date of birth, no last known address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch like the carnival,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cher history has been wiped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cShe\u2019s now a ghost. Except for the grocery store footage, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhost may not be too far off,\u201d I said. \u201cShe smelled like Dominic Tate.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s and Ethan\u2019s reactions were pretty much the same as ours had been\u2014surprise, doubt, concern.</p><p>\u201cDominic Tate is dead,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cHe is. And there shouldn\u2019t be any other fallen angels out there. But I know what I smelled.\u201d I\u2019d been held by Dominic Tate in a prison of sunlight; I wasn\u2019t likely to forget the smoky stink of it.</p><p>Gabriel crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cEthan\u2019s told me about this menagerie theory, if that\u2019s what we\u2019re calling it. But Merit said she didn\u2019t see an attraction like that at the carnival. What\u2019s the point of having a menagerie if you aren\u2019t going to show it off?\u201d</p><p>Mallory raised a hand. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been thinking about that. It\u2019s like an invitation-only sample sale.\u201d</p><p>I got the comparison immediately, but the men just blinked with obvious befuddlement.</p><p>\u201cIs this a food thing?\u201d Catcher asked, earning a dramatic eye roll from Mallory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fashion thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s when designers sell their samples for a very large discount. Very exclusive.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned in Ethan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting the public who attend the carnivals are not the target audience.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cExactly. So maybe the menagerie is also exclusive. They bring the carnival to town but you don\u2019t get in without an invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they also bring the sups,\u201d Gabriel said with a nod. \u201cNot as a carnival attraction, but a traveling menagerie. Same town, but separate location. Secret location, available only to certain well-heeled clientele.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cThat could fit. The motive, perhaps, isn\u2019t about the sups. It\u2019s about the ego, or perhaps the money. Impressing the hard to impress with an attraction they can\u2019t see anywhere else in the world.\u201d</p><p>Puzzle pieces fell into place. \u201cAnd with every attack.\u201d</p><p>They looked at me.</p><p>\u201cSentinel?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cHaving a menagerie is one thing. But when you\u2019ve got powerful magic, it\u2019s not exactly a great story to just pluck someone off the street using it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike they might have done with Aline,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cExactly. But if, to get the supernaturals, you have to fight for them? You set up an attack, claim your prey that way? Much more interesting story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a supernatural safari,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it demands a higher ticket price,\u201d Catcher said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt would make sense, based on what we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re right, we\u2019d be looking for someone insecure, or someone with a desire to impress,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who needs to be needed,\u201d Mallory added, \u201cbut doesn\u2019t feel any obligation to follow the rules in doing it. Being popular is better than being good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Ethan said, \u201csomeone who believes they\u2019ll find that fame or fortune in this fashion.\u201d</p><p>We stood there silently for a moment, contemplating that somewhat pathetic, but entirely believable, profile.</p><p>Gabe looked at me. \u201cI assume you haven\u2019t yet determined where in Chicago the carnival might set up next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Catcher suggested we get the House on it. Maybe we can look at the carnival\u2019s previous stops? See if there\u2019s a pattern?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Luc.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll dig further into Regan\u2019s ID, see if I can shake something loose there.\u201d He looked to Catcher. \u201cI\u2019ll send you the photo. Maybe you can send it to Baumgartner, any other contacts you have, see if she looks familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p> <p>The fierce wail of a frustrated infant rang through the house. Gabriel smiled.</p><p>\u201cKid\u2019s got some lungs.\u201d</p><p>Ethan smiled. \u201cSo he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I believe that\u2019s probably my cue to exit stage right. What\u2019s on your agenda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Mallory said, sharing a glance with Catcher, who nodded, \u201cwe\u2019d like to go home.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a chance the carnival is headed back to Chicago,\u201d Catcher said, \u201cI\u2019d like to be there, on the ground, and get the word out to sups, the Houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came for Lup,\u201d Mallory said, \u201cand unfortunately that\u2019s over. But considering what went down, we didn\u2019t want to leave without checking with you first. We don\u2019t want to make things worse.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cGo home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thank you for your service. You did good out there. You stuck to your guts, to your heart, and you did that thing you do.\u201d</p><p>She beamed with obvious delight at the praise. \u201cThank you, Gabe,\u201d she said, laying a hand on his arm. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll see you at the bar when you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you will,\u201d Gabriel said.</p> <p>Mallory and I exchanged hugs. \u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d she said, rubbing my back before she released me again.</p><p>Catcher did the manly head-bob thing with the guys. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye and ear out in the Windy City. Talk to the supernatural community, see what I can find out. I\u2019m going to have to give them a warning\u2014tell them, at a minimum, to stay away from the carnival. We don\u2019t know that\u2019s how they do their targeting, but it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. We can\u2019t exactly tell them to avoid harpies and elves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough that\u2019s also good advice,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d Catcher agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I hear anything in the ether. And keep us posted.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cSafe travels,\u201d he said, and they walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer will she work for you?\u201d I asked Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she\u2019s not quite there yet. She will be tested again.\u201d</p><p>I slanted him a glance. \u201cIs that prophecy or guesswork?\u201d</p> <p>He made a throaty laugh. \u201cIs there a difference?\u201d</p><p>You tell me, I thought. Gabriel had prophesied there was another set of \u201cgreen eyes\u201d in my future, eyes that looked much like Ethan\u2019s. It seemed like a reference to a child, but since no vampire had successfully carried a child to term, that wasn\u2019t actually a possibility.</p><p>But still.</p><p>\u201cTwo down, two to go,\u201d Gabriel said, glancing at Ethan, a grin pulling up a corner of his mouth. \u201cAs you two have not yet solved this particular mystery, I presume you\u2019ll be staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying,\u201d Ethan flatly said, \u201cbecause the mayor still wants my hide and the Brecks have offered us shelter. In the meantime we\u2019ll continue to investigate the menagerie.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cBut at the moment, I think we\u2019ll return to the carriage house. I need to check in, and we need to get the House started on research.\u201d He glanced at my muddy pants and jacket. \u201cAnd I presume my Sentinel would appreciate a change of clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCadogan\u2019s Sentinel, if that\u2019s what you meant to say, would appreciate a change of clothes. And a shower.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel grinned. \u201cShe has your number, Sullivan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my heart, for better or worse.\u201d He looked at me and smiled, ignoring the mixed company, and sent blood rushing to my cheeks.</p><p>Jeff cleared his throat. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to head to the Brecks\u2019 ops room,\u201d he said, tucking away his toy again. \u201cFaster processors in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor searching, or for Jakob\u2019s Quest?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>It was Jeff\u2019s turn to blush. \u201cA little work, a little play, makes Jack a happy boy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel held up a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t need the details of how you and my sister spend your playtime, whelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to give them to you,\u201d Jeff assured him. \u201cTalk to you all later.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and I said our good-byes, but before I could turn to follow Ethan to the door, Gabriel took my arm. I looked up, found his eyes intense and swirling.</p><p>\u201cThe future I once shared with you, Kitten. Do you think that\u2019s prophecy or guesswork?\u201d</p><p>I presumed he meant his green-eyes prediction, and my heart thudded against my chest.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My voice was barely a whisper. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you think,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there will be tests for you, as well.\u201d</p><p>And with those words hanging in the air like so much ripe fruit, he disappeared, leaving me, heart pounding, standing in the hallway.</p><p>A child, with Ethan.</p><p>Gabriel had as much as confirmed it, even if he hadn\u2019t said the words aloud. My heart blossomed with hope and love and possibility . . . and also fear. What had he meant by \u201ctests\u201d? I\u2019d been attacked, seen my city nearly destroyed and my grandfather nearly killed, and I\u2019d watched Ethan die to save my life. Was it the GP? Was it Ethan\u2019s challenging Darius, or some injury he\u2019d have to endure? And if a child was in our future, was our being together an inevitability? Or was Gabriel\u2019s prophecy the shifter version of a devil\u2019s bargain? Would I get exactly what I wanted, but with some horribly ironic twist?</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Ethan asked as we walked back to the carriage house. \u201cYou seem tense.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Gabriel\u2019s words hung thick around my neck; once again, I was too unnerved to voice them to Ethan. I\u2019d kept secrets from him before. Secrets I thought weren\u2019t mine to tell, like my membership in the RG. Revealing that fact had put Jonah at risk as much as it did me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said as we stepped to the threshold and he turned the key, opened the door. The carriage house was empty, the pillows on the sofa bed tidy again. They\u2019d already gone, leaving the two of us alone.</p><p>Ethan closed the door, locked it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not fine,\u201d I said, the words bursting out of me like air from a pricked balloon. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>JUST A BITE</p><p>He looked at me, face carefully neutral, his hands tucked casually into his pockets. It was an expression of mild attention, or would have been if his gaze hadn\u2019t been crystalline, his shoulders set. He was a Master vampire, and he was prepared for bad news.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad news.\u201d</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d I insisted. \u201cBut I think we should sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m definitely worried.\u201d But he moved to the sofa and sat, leaning forward, elbows on his knees, as I took a spot across from him. I wanted to see his face, his eyes.</p><p>It all went together\u2014the green eyes and the prophecy and the GP. It was about us, about vampires, about shifters. It was tangled together in my head like a ball of twisted wire. And that made it hard to get out.</p><p>\u201cThe RG has friends,\u201d I said. \u201cPowerful friends. Including one who did something that helped the House. And to whom I now owe a favor.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went flat. He didn\u2019t care to be reminded of my RG membership, and especially not when he thought I\u2019d be confessing something he didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cThat friend has come to collect. That friend has asked that I convince you to do something that would be dangerous. Potentially deadly, and potentially magnificent.\u201d</p><p>Ethan blinked, sat back, crossed one leg over the other. But his eyes stayed cool and on me. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me this because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the deadly and dangerous parts.\u201d I dropped the bravado and put it out there. \u201cBecause it would pull you away from me. Inevitably.\u201d</p><p>His expression softened, just a bit. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet for a moment, magic\u2014fearful and tentative\u2014swirling in the air around us.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you want to tell me what the dangerous and deadly parts are?\u201d</p><p>Only if I could make you swear that you wouldn\u2019t do it, I thought. And swear that you would.</p><p>And that, at its heart, was the dilemma I faced. That he would do, and would not do, the thing that I anticipated as much as I feared it.</p><p>That was when I realized the truth: Either way, I would win. And either way, I would lose. Telling him didn\u2019t matter. Telling him wasn\u2019t the point.</p><p>Trusting him with the telling of it\u2014that was the point.</p><p>And so I trusted in him, and in us. \u201cThere are members of the GP who want you to challenge Darius for his position. Who want you to be their king.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s lips parted, and his eyes widened in shock, but he didn\u2019t make a sound. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was surprised by the idea or that I had connections powerful enough that I could give him information about the GP, instead of the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, gave him time to process it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve certainly thought about it\u2014what it might be like to hold that position if Darius resigned. The good that could be done. God knows there\u2019s sufficient room to maneuver there. But to challenge a living member? That decision could be deadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to encourage you,\u201d I told him. \u201cTo convince you to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the person who told you this wants me to hold the position\u2014or they want me out of the way?\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from my face. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to me that Lakshmi\u2019s motives might not be pure. I considered our conversation, thought about the hope in her eyes, and dismissed the possibility she was being less than earnest. She was honest that Ethan\u2019s challenge might not be successful. But that didn\u2019t mean she wished him dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe the friend wants you to hold the position,\u201d I said. \u201cThey respect you and your alliances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want me to do it. Why? If I was successful, it would be a profound opportunity for vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be successful. You have powerful enemies. And even if you were\u2014I\u2019ve already lost you once. I don\u2019t want to lose you again.\u201d</p> <p>His expression softened. \u201cYou think I would have to choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you? And wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, precisely, would you be choosing between, Sentinel?\u201d His expression was still mild, but there was a bite in his words.</p><p>\u201cBetween London and Chicago. Between you and the House? Between you and the RG? Being part of the RG while you\u2019re Master is one thing. Being part of it while you\u2019re the king of all goddamned vampires is something entirely different.\u201d Theoretically, an honorable GP meant a quiet RG. But just because I believed in Ethan didn\u2019t mean the rest of the RG wouldn\u2019t want to keep an eye on him. Absolute power, after all, corrupted absolutely.</p><p>His eyes narrowed dangerously. \u201cYou cannot shake me loose, Sentinel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to shake you loose,\u201d I assured him. I was just trying to be practical.</p><p>Hell, I thought. If we\u2019d already gotten the GP bit out there, I figured I might as well tell him the rest.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever talked to Gabriel about prophecies?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been staring at the floor, but he suddenly lifted his gaze to me. \u201cProphecies? No. Why?\u201d</p><p>I imagined voicing the words would be like confessing you\u2019d found a guy\u2019s secret engagement ring. It was a confession of intimacy I hadn\u2019t yet earned.</p><p>\u201cHe said in my future\u2014there would be someone with green eyes. Like yours. But not yours. A child.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cOur child. Because of some favor I\u2019d do for Gabriel.\u201d</p> <p>The color drained from his face, even more than you\u2019d expect from a four-hundred-year-old vampire.</p><p>Part of me found it gratifying that he\u2019d have the chance to enjoy the same kind of shock I\u2019d been carrying around for months. Part of me found it terrifying, that he\u2019d regret the possibility he\u2019d be permanently attached without having made the choice on his own.</p><p>He stood up, paced to the other end of the room.</p><p>\u201cCould you maybe say something?\u201d I asked and, as my stomach roiled with nerves, braced myself for the worst. That was part of who I was, part of how I\u2019d been raised. There was always a punishment to bear, a condition attached to the love I was granted.</p><p>But when he turned, his eyes were green fire. \u201cHe said . . . you\u2019d carry a child?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy child? Our child?\u201d</p><p>Another nod, as I contemplated what I thought wasn\u2019t fear, but awe, in his eyes. He strode back to me, pulled me up from the couch, and kissed me brutally.</p> <p>His lips were firm, his tongue insistent, sending my blood racing even as my body and mind slipped down and into the kiss.</p><p>He pulled back and cupped my face in his hands, rested his forehead against mine. \u201cA child. A child.\u201d It was easy to hear the miracle in his voice, and even when he pulled back, my face still in his hands, there was doubt in his eyes. \u201cTell me precisely what he said.\u201d</p><p>And I did. Twice, and about the prediction that I\u2019d be tested first. But none of it dulled the wonderment in Ethan\u2019s eyes. He put his hand on my stomach like I was already in the full blossom of pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cA child. The first vampire child. Do you know what a miracle that would be? Or what a strength? What a boon to the North American Houses?\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to take a step back, as a frisson of anger turned up my temper. \u201cOr to the GP, if you were to lead it.\u201d</p><p>He apparently missed the tone in my voice, or he ignored it. \u201cFrankly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re excited about this? Because it would give you a political advantage? Can we put aside strategy for the purposes of this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSentinel,\u201d he said, and I caught a warning tone in his voice.</p><p>I marched over and stuck a finger into his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me \u2018Sentinel.\u2019 I am not your Novitiate right now, not when we\u2019re talking about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a unique event in vampire history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about bringing a child into the world.\u201d My head began to spin. Saying the words aloud actually made me light-headed, and I groped for the closest chair, then planted myself in it before my vision went completely black.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Sentinel,\u201d Ethan said, with a hint of amusement in his voice.</p><p>I was not amused. Not at all. Not by the realization that I\u2019d be gestating the only vampire child in history. That we\u2019d be the only vampire parents in history.</p><p>Ethan bent to one knee in front of me. \u201cAre you having a panic attack about a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, head swimming. \u201cThat would be cowardly and ridiculous. I want to have kids. Kids are great. But I would be the first and only vampire mother. Every other vampire in the world would be armchair-mothering me.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the hair from my face. \u201cDid Gabriel say this miraculous event was going to happen tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. There\u2019s the testing first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I presume you have a bit of time to prepare,\u201d he flatly said. \u201cAs do I.\u201d He looked up at me, one knee on the ground, one knee propped up. The perfect position for that certain pre-matrimonial deed. A slow smile began to cross his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare do it,\u201d I warned him with a pointed finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare fake propose to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says it would be fake?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cLike you just happen to have a ring in your jacket pocket.\u201d</p><p>Much to my surprise, and terror, he didn\u2019t answer with a joke. His eyes sparkled, which made my stomach roll with nerves. Surely he didn\u2019t actually have a ring in his pocket. We hadn\u2019t known each other long enough. Hadn\u2019t been together long enough.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ethan.\u201d I punched him on the arm. \u201cNo. You do not have a ring in your pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor, worried Sentinel.\u201d He pulled me to my feet, embraced me. \u201cThe weight of the world on her shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat weight is entirely on my uterus,\u201d I corrected. \u201cOr will be, after the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you may have mentioned that,\u201d he dryly said. \u201cAnd he gave you no indication of what, precisely, that meant?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, put my hands on his chest, looked up at him. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s you? What if you decide to challenge the GP and you\u2019re injured? Or killed? Or what if you win and you end up in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen either you\u2019re scheduled for an immaculate conception, or we\u2019ll still see each other occasionally.\u201d That sparkle was back in his eyes. He was really and truly enjoying this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping. Seriously\u2014what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the possible child? I can think of several things, Sentinel. Most of them require nudity. Several are illegal in the more conservative states.\u201d</p><p>I elbowed him in the ribs. \u201cAbout the GP.\u201d</p><p>His expression sobered. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He ran his hands through his hair. \u201cHow solid is the support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolid,\u201d I said. \u201cEnough to guarantee GP votes. Not enough to guarantee a win or a bloodless coup.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true of most things worth doing, I\u2019ve found. They\u2019re rarely guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>Then he looked at me with a slanted gaze. \u201cSentinel, exactly how long have you been holding all of this in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor too damn long. On both counts.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and, with a hand at the back of my neck, pulled me forward again. \u201cI love you, Caroline Evelyn Merit,\u201d he said, pressing his lips to mine.</p><p>He kissed me gently, his mouth needy and insistent, tongue tangling with mine and lips nipping gently as he pressed his body against mine. His hand slid along my rib cage, cupped a breast, and thumbed my nipple, inciting and arousing. My body sang with desire, blood humming with the need he was creating, the blinding want that began to demand action.</p><p>He moved forward, pushing me against the back of the couch, his erection solid between us. \u201cYou won\u2019t shake me,\u201d he said, his lips against my neck, trailing kisses over the spots he\u2019d bitten me before, a promise of things to come.</p><p>\u201cThe carnival?\u201d I managed to murmur, thinking of the work we needed to do.</p><p>\u201cWe are allowed to live,\u201d he said. \u201cTo take a moment for us.\u201d He took that moment, unzipped my muddy jacket and tossed it to the floor, then did the same with the shirt I\u2019d worn beneath it. His gaze found my breasts. His hands followed, and all rational thought exited my premises. With impressive speed.</p><p>I hummed, equally revved and drowsy from the movement of his hands and the cant of his hips against mine. There was little doubt what he wanted, or what he\u2019d take.</p><p>His mouth still on mine, the intensity near brutal, as if he might simply devour me, he stripped the fabric from my breasts and covered them with his hands, tongue tangling with mine, a hint of what he had in mind. He moved my hand to his erection, ground his body against me, releasing my mouth to heave out breaths, arching his back to watch my hand move against him.</p><p>He made a sound as much growl as word, then pulled off his shirt and the rest of my clothes, leaving me naked before him.</p><p>His eyes were silver, his fangs needle sharp, his body nearly quaking with anticipation and desire.</p><p>Without taking his eyes from me, he unzipped his jeans, dropped them to the floor. The silken boxers offered little guard against his impressive erection, and he dropped those, too, leaving nothing but his naked form before me, his eyes swirling with magic, his body obviously ready.</p><p>He took his arousal in hand, wetting his lips as he stared down at me. Eyes narrowed and glinting, his body taut and golden skinned and there for the taking, he stroked, toying with me, daring me not just to touch him, but to brave the intimacy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dare, I would.</p><p>I pushed him backward, steering him toward the low French chair in the corner of the room. He sat down, his hand still busy, his eyes on my breasts.</p><p>I straddled him, and his lips found my breasts, toying and nipping until my blood burned with need.</p> <p>He offered no more preliminaries, which would have been wasted. I was ready, my body eager for him. With a grunt and a brutal curse, he plunged upward, filling me, bowing my body and leaving no boundaries, tangible or otherwise, between us. His hands found my waist and he held me against him, forcing me down with each plundering stroke.</p><p>He put his hand on my face, holding my chin, forcing my gaze to his as he pumped. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was committing my face to memory or ensuring that I committed his face to mine. The act was brutally intimate, allowing neither of us to hide behind closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMerit,\u201d he said, his voice ragged. \u201cI need you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Forever, he silently said. Regardless.</p> <p>Forever, I said to him.</p><p>He lifted me, rose with me in his arms, and stalked toward the bedroom like a pirate with his treasure. He placed me on the bed like I was delicate, fine boned or porcelain, and immediately covered my body with his. With the force of a man long denied, he plunged between my thighs, his strokes as hard and fast as they\u2019d been before.</p><p>Before, he\u2019d sought to relieve his own ache, to find his own release. This time, his demands were all for me. Every muscle in his toned body worked for my pleasure, to send me over the edge, to send my mind and body and soul reeling. He found my mouth and plundered it as well, his tongue hot and welcoming, teeth at my lips as ferocious as his body.</p><p>And then he flipped my body over, and I moaned with pleasure, fistfuls of sheets in hand as he thrust without hesitation, filling me, devouring me. Ethan took without quarter, gave without pretension. He moved with a harsh rhythm, demanding, insistent, daring me to take my own pleasure, and doing his damnedest to send me there.</p><p>I screamed out his name, felt the building shudder from the release of magic, pushed any embarrassment that might have caused to the back of my mind.</p><p>I paused for breath, wet my parched lips, then rolled over and looked at him. His eyes quicksilver, his body hard, quivering with want.</p> <p>I cupped my breasts, offered myself to him again.</p><p>His lips curled in animal pleasure and he pushed between my thighs again, my body offering no resistance.</p><p>\u201cTeeth,\u201d he demanded when he was inside me. \u201cI want your teeth on me.\u201d</p><p>Drunk with passion, I obeyed the command, sinking my teeth into the skin at his neck, the rush of blood\u2014hot and powerful\u2014sending my body into immediate overdrive. Ethan growled out my name as my body shook with the force of the pleasure, and he gripped the headboard with white knuckles, straining to hold back as pleasure rocked him, too.</p><p>Now, I demanded, forcing him to drop his own barriers, to hold back nothing from me, not the man, not the soldier, not the vampire, not the Master.</p><p>\u201cMerit,\u201d Ethan groaned out, pushing upward with a final thrust, emptying himself with a cry that sounded equally anguished and fulfilled at the same time my body arched with pulsing pleasure.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Minutes later, we stood together beneath the spray in the room-sized shower in the carriage house bathroom, his body behind mine.</p> <p>It was such a simple thing for him to massage shampoo into my hair, to slick soap across my back. And it was probably the most intimate thing we\u2019d ever done.</p><p>\u201cSwitch,\u201d I told him when my hair was squeaky clean. He dunked his head beneath the spray, pushed his fingers through it while water slipped down the arch of his back and across his very bitable ass.</p><p>I felt my body stir to life again but ignored it. I\u2019d had my fun for the evening. We were getting clean, and then we were getting back to work.</p><p>I squeezed shampoo into my hand, rolled it in my palms, and reached up to run it through the golden locks of his hair. He dropped his head back, braced his arms on the sides of the shower, and let me care for him.</p><p>And when the shower was done, when we pulled on the thick white robes that hung in the bathroom, I sent the message that, I hoped, satisfied my favor to Lakshmi:</p><p>I\u2019VE TOLD HIM. THE DECISION IS IN HIS HANDS.</p><p>I hoped it would be enough and, when our phones began to simultaneously ring, thought she was so pissed by the response that she\u2019d called me and Ethan both. But the communications weren\u2019t from Lakshmi.</p><p>I grabbed mine first, scanned the screen, found a message from Luc: NAVARRE 911. RAID. MAYOR\u2019S THUGS. INJURIES.</p><p>\u201cMerit,\u201d Ethan said, and I glanced back, found his phone in hand, as well.</p><p>\u201cDomestic terrorism?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and called Luc, got an answer on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m outside Navarre with Lindsey,\u201d Luc said, the wind howling behind him. It was Chicago, after all. \u201cWe\u2019re out of sight but keeping an eye on things. Jonah\u2019s got a few Grey House folks around, too.\u201d</p><p>Probably not just Grey House, I thought, but members of the RG keeping an eye on things, ready to step in if the need arose. I wasn\u2019t taking all their work.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t entirely sure. We only got a little from Will.\u201d Will was Navarre House\u2019s very green guard captain. \u201cApparently the mayor\u2019s thugs showed up to take Morgan in to interview, and he refused. They surrounded the House, went inside. They\u2019re still in there. The vampires are all outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering where we are, and the fact that we ran, I can\u2019t exactly blame Morgan for refusing the interview. How\u2019s Malik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn full alert,\u201d Luc said. \u201cWe pulled all the temps onto duty, have them outside. We\u2019ve also offered asylum to any Navarre vamps who need a place to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cGood. Keep an eye on things, and make contact with Jonah. Offer whatever assistance you can provide. And in the meantime, call the lawyers. We\u2019re coming home.\u201d</p><p>Fear bloomed cold in my chest. Ethan hung up the phone, tossed it on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go back so you can be Kowalcyzk\u2019s next victim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter me than them in my place,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI can\u2019t let any more vampires take my punishment. I\u2019ve stood by too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s baiting you. Escalating to scare you back to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Ethan began to get dressed, pulling a shirt over his head, his hair still damp and tucked behind his ears. \u201cQuite possibly.\u201d He zipped up his jeans. \u201cAnd I did as everyone asked. I waited her out. But no more.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t made Kowalcyzk\u2019s decisions, but I still felt like I\u2019d failed. If Harold Monmonth hadn\u2019t made it so far into Cadogan House, if I\u2019d taken him out first, if the GP had been more afraid of the House\u2019s Sentinel, Ethan might be out of danger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for this.\u201d</p><p>Ethan looked at me, danger in his eyes. \u201cAre you under the impression this has something to do with you, Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to protect you, protect the House. And look where that\u2019s gotten us. The mayor thinks we\u2019re enemies of the state, and she\u2019s not above beating a Master vampire. I should have killed Harold Monmonth when I\u2019d had the chance.\u201d</p><p>He strode to me, took my chin in hand, forced my gaze to his.</p><p>\u201cThat woman\u2019s personal failures are not your responsibility. Nor would the death of Harold Monmonth by your hand have changed anything. Except that it would be you heading to prison, rather than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father could have kept me out.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyes cooled. \u201cPerhaps. Perhaps he would have. Perhaps he\u2019d have bribed Kowalcyzk to keep you out. And if he had? And assuming she\u2019d actually accept it, he\u2019d consider the bribe a loan, and he\u2019d exact payback, come hell or high water. You\u2019ve owed a favor to a very powerful individual, Merit. You know how oppressive that feels.\u201d</p><p>He was right, but that only made it worse. There was no knight in shining armor who could rescue him, no trick of Chicago politics\u2014and there were a lot of tricks in that particular bag\u2014that would keep him out of prison. We\u2019d already used the chit in our possession, the fact that Detective Jacobs didn\u2019t blindly follow the mayor\u2019s dictates, and the reprieve had been only temporary.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know you\u2019re right. I just want things to be different.\u201d</p><p>He put his forehead against mine. \u201cWe cannot change the world, Merit. We do what we can in our small corner, and we act with honor. We rise to the occasion, and we do our best.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me. \u201cThat is what we will do for now. Our best. Get dressed. Message Catcher and make sure he knows what\u2019s going on. Message Jonah and let him know we\u2019re coming back. I\u2019ll talk to Gabriel. This is going to require some finessing.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll pack, get our stuff together.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, considered. \u201cActually, I think I\u2019d prefer you go with me. You are his kitten, after all.\u201d</p><p>I humphed. I was nobody\u2019s kitten.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We found him in the kitchen with Tanya and Connor, who sat in a high chair with bright orange goo smeared across his face. He gargled happily when we walked in.</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d Gabe said, offering Connor another spoonful of orange goo. \u201cWhat brings you by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Tanya asked, gesturing toward the kitchen. \u201cThe staff\u2019s asleep, but we could find you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, thank you. We actually wanted to talk to you about leaving. Things have come to a head in Chicago\u2014and we believe the carnival is headed there anyway. We\u2019d like to return, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA head?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cThe mayor had roughed up Scott Grey. Tonight, they raided Navarre House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not playing around to get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she is not. And others have taken the brunt of this particular experiment long enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cYeah, running isn\u2019t really your style.\u201d He smiled at Connor, who mawed the mouthful of goo with bright and happy eyes. \u201cKid loves carrots. Craziest thing. Tanya and I both hate them.\u201d</p><p>He used the rubber edge of the spoon to clean up Connor\u2019s mouth, then passed the utensil to Tanya and wiped his hands on a kitchen towel.</p><p>\u201cThe Pack is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou upheld your deal to investigate while they were here. And when the elves were attacked in daylight, they knew it wasn\u2019t your doing. The Brecks haven\u2019t left, obviously, but solving a mystery isn\u2019t going to change their minds about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI imagine it will not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still have the elves to sate,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cYou owe them Niera, or we\u2019ll all have hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>I imagined Chicago overrun with androgynous bow-and-arrow-wielding elves. Considering the state of their technology, couldn\u2019t the military handle them easily?</p><p>Ethan looked at me. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Sentinel. That they\u2019d be no match for black helicopters. But locusts do not need weapons to constitute a plague. They only have to be themselves.\u201d</p><p>A potent metaphor.</p> <p>\u201cSafe travels and good luck,\u201d Gabriel said, standing and offering each of us a hand. \u201cYou do your species proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me the next time you\u2019re in the city,\u201d Ethan said, then slid his gaze to me. \u201cI believe we have some things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled wolfishly. \u201cSo we do, Sullivan. So we do.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I let Ethan drive back to Chicago. Considering his looming incarceration, it seemed only fair.</p><p>I also let him select the channel, and he found a station playing hard-driving Chicago- and Delta-style blues. The songs were grim, their lyrics telling tales of love and love lost, of heartache and adversity. He kept his hands on the steering wheel and his gaze on the road, but he seemed buoyed by the music, by the reminders that hard times were universal, but time always marched on. Usually in twelve bars.</p> <p>Ethan pulled directly into the House garage and parked the car in the spot he\u2019d given me\u2014but solely for the protection of Moneypenny. Ethan keyed us into the House but paused before ascending the stairway to the first floor, clearly contemplating what he was about to do.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should take the back stairway,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWe can put down our bags, and you can have a few minutes to collect yourself.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at me, smiled. I caught a brief flicker of gratitude in his eyes, as if he\u2019d had the same thought but wasn\u2019t sure how to broach the subject without appearing cowardly.</p><p>We walked to the other end of the basement and the service stairway, climbed to the third floor, and then walked down the hallway to our apartments. The House smelled faintly like cinnamon and flowers, and none of the faint animal tang that permeated the Brecks\u2019.</p><p>We found the apartments just as we\u2019d left them. Cool, dark, beautifully appointed. The furniture was European, the ceilings high, the walls painted in warm colors. A vase of hothouse peonies sat on a side table, filling the room with the smell of flowers and the spring that would soon be approaching.</p><p>Ethan put his bag on the bed and walked to one of the windows, then pulled back the lush silk and velvet drapes that covered it. I dropped my bag and followed him, let him gather me into his arms as he stared out into the night. Unlike at the Brecks\u2019 estate, there was light aplenty in Chicago. We were in the middle of a residential neighborhood, with the lights of downtown in the distance. Snow still covered the grounds that surrounded the House, giving it an ethereal glow.</p><p>Ethan sighed, embraced me tighter.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hold you forever. There\u2019s no evidence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t try. Especially if she\u2019s squawking about domestic terrorism and ignoring the city\u2019s other problems in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as she doesn\u2019t mess up your pretty face.\u201d</p><p>Ethan leaned back and peered at me. \u201cMy pretty face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dating you because you make good arm candy.\u201d</p><p>He made a dubious sound, squeezed me one more time, and then let me go. \u201cWe have the city\u2019s best lawyers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll hope that will be enough.\u201d</p><p>I hoped he was right, but hope wasn\u2019t going to bring him home again.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>PARTING IS SUCH (BITTER)SWEET SORROW</p><p>Ethan changed from his jeans and shirt into a button-down shirt, black pants, and a suit jacket with modern lines and a fashionably snug fit. He pulled back his hair, then glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredibly handsome for a felon and terrorist,\u201d I told him, hoping to get a smile. I got an arched eyebrow, which was good enough.</p><p>We descended the stairs together, fingers linked. The foyer was full of vampires, and I had a sudden sympathy for the wives of discredited politicians who\u2019d made similar appearances, trying to maintain a pleasant smile while lawyers and vampires mingled at the bottom of the stairs like sharks preparing to feed.</p><p>The magic in the air was frazzled and nervous, flitting about the room like stinging bolts of lightning. Ethan\u2019s vampires were nervous, and understandably so.</p><p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d Ethan said, extending a hand to the man in the very well-cut black suit who stood beside Malik and Luc. He had dark skin, short hair, and a French-cut goatee that joined the moustache above his lip. His eyes were dark and set beneath a dark brow. His expression was serious.</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d he said, and they shook hands heartily. \u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded, put a hand at the small of my back. \u201cAndrew, my significant other. Merit. She stands Sentinel for the House. Merit, this is Andrew Bailey of Fitzhugh and Meyers.\u201d</p><p>Andrew and I shook hands as he gave me an efficient appraisal. \u201cA pleasure to meet you, although I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s under these circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d I said.</p><p>He glanced at Ethan. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk for a few minutes? I\u2019d like to explain how this will proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy office,\u201d Ethan said, then glanced back at the other vampires in the foyer, who\u2019d gathered a second time in just a few days to ensure his safety and see him off.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave without saying good-bye,\u201d Ethan said with a smile, which made them chuckle in relief. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss the details and be back shortly.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shined in times of crisis. He knew when others needed him to be strong, and he filled that role with aplomb.</p><p>I followed Ethan, Andrew, Luc, and Malik to the office, squeezing Lindsey\u2019s hand as we passed her on the way.</p><p>\u201cGlad you got home safely,\u201d she whispered, and I nodded.</p><p>The d\u00e9cor in Ethan\u2019s office matched the rest of the House. European furniture, careful accessories, built-in shelves of beautiful wood, and vases of flowers. His desk filled the front right side of the room, a conversation area the left. There was a conference table across the back.</p><p>Luc headed directly for the bar tucked into the built-in bookshelves on the far side and poured amber liquor into a short glass. He downed it immediately.</p><p>\u201cRough week, Lucas?\u201d Ethan asked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Luc said, drinking another finger of Scotch before putting the bottle away again.</p><p>\u201cNavarre\u2019s status?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires are back in the House, but they\u2019re basically under House arrest. Grey took in six vampires\u2014folks who were away when the raid happened and didn\u2019t want to go back.\u201d</p><p>Ethan looked at Andrew. \u201cThey\u2019ll release Navarre House if I go in? And please take a seat, or have a drink if you\u2019d like. The bar is open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, and I\u2019d rather stand if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded, and we all stayed standing. This didn\u2019t seem like the time to get comfy on the couch. I certainly wasn\u2019t in the mood to relax.</p><p>\u201cTo your question, yes: Kowalcyzk\u2019s representatives have advised the units will have no further interest in Navarre if you go in.\u201d</p><p>I guess that confirmed Kowalcyzk\u2019s extortion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re communicating with Navarre\u2019s lawyers, so we can ensure she actually keeps her promise. They\u2019re relieved that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAnd when I go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be interviewed about the death of Harold Monmonth,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cBut not by the CPD. They still have a warrant for your arrest, but the mayor is using her domestic terrorism task force to conduct these interviews. That takes them outside the purview of the CPD, which is unfortunate, as I understand you have allies there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAlthough likely enemies as well.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nodded. \u201cThe firm has contacts in Homeland Security, and I\u2019ve contacted them, requested they make contact with the mayor\u2019s office, provide some oversight. I don\u2019t know how far that will go, but I prefer to have the protections in place rather than leaving an ambitious politician with no evidence and less foresight in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur opinions align,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cThe interview will take place at the Daley Center,\u201d Andrew continued. That building held the city and county offices. \u201cI won\u2019t be in the interview room with you\u2014no right to a lawyer as a suspected domestic terrorist\u2014but I\u2019ve arranged for the room to have two-way glass. I\u2019ll be outside. They\u2019ll keep you there until they\u2019re satisfied they\u2019ve gotten the answers they want, even if it means the sun\u2019s in the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a dark room?\u201d Malik asked.</p><p>\u201cThey do. They understand you\u2019re essentially unconscious, not by choice, when the sun comes up. They\u2019ve arranged for a room without windows so you can bed down. And the interview room doesn\u2019t have windows, either, just in case they decide to get creative around sunrise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were capable of being conscious during the day, but it wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience. I\u2019d been kept forcibly awake once and preferred not to repeat it.</p><p>I started to speak, found my voice trembled, and started again. \u201cAnd if they assault Ethan?\u201d</p><p>Andrew leveled dark eyes at me. \u201cThen we take the city for everything they\u2019re worth, and we have evidence to expose Chicago for the tragedy that\u2019s occurring here.\u201d</p> <p>We looked at each other for a moment. He was giving me, I realized, time to consider him, to evaluate him, to trust that he would care for Ethan as I did. I wasn\u2019t eager to give Ethan up to anyone, but I was immediately glad he had this man in his corner.</p><p>I nodded, breaking the spell and offering my trust. \u201cHow long will they hold him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder current law, until they\u2019re satisfied he isn\u2019t a threat. There\u2019s an obvious self-defense argument here, especially considering Monmonth\u2019s violence against the humans before he even got inside the gate. And we have the security video of all the above, although Kowalcyzk\u2019s office has rejected it.\u201d The flat tone of his voice left little doubt about how much he respected that particular decision.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll push to get him released after twenty-four hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the entire firm is on call, so if the House needs anything, wants an update, they can contact us. I think that\u2019s everything for now, unless you have other questions?\u201d</p><p>Ethan blew out a breath, shook his head, stiffened his shoulders. \u201cI believe that\u2019s it.\u201d He looked at Malik. \u201cLakshmi?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill standing by,\u201d Malik said. \u201cConsidering her willingness to delay presenting the GP\u2019s demands, I\u2019m beginning to wonder if they\u2019ve actually made any.\u201d</p><p>I worked studiously to avoid looking at Ethan, afraid my expression would give something away. I hadn\u2019t actually told him that Lakshmi was the vampire to whom I\u2019d owed a favor, or the one who supported him, but it probably wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to ferret that out. Especially if he could read it in my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt she has her own agenda,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut there seems little doubt she\u2019s also here as an envoy. If they hadn\u2019t sent her, they\u2019d have sent someone else.\u201d He frowned, scratched his temple absently, glanced at Malik.</p><p>\u201cIf she gets impatient, meet with her. Better to give her a meeting of some type than have her declaring war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Ethan asked, glancing around, but no one said anything. \u201cIn that case, Malik, you have the House,\u201d he said. As often happened, something quiet passed between them, a ceremonial transfer of power, or perhaps a quick, silent prayer for the safety of themselves, the House, and the Novitiates who dwelled within it.</p> <p>Ethan buttoned his suit jacket, adjusted his pocket square. \u201cI believe we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Ethan emerged from the room as he had three days ago, to nervous looks of vampires waiting outside his office. Last time he was running from the very thing he\u2019d committed to do tonight.</p><p>He took my hand in his, and together we walked down the hallway, Cadogan\u2019s vampires sharing their support.</p><p>\u201cWe love you, Liege,\u201d they said as we passed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe House will get through this, Liege.\u201d</p><p>They patted his back, touched his arm. Two offered embraces, then quickly stepped back into line. They\u2019d lost him a few months ago and had miraculously gotten him back. They weren\u2019t eager to give him up again.</p><p>When we reached the foyer, the crowd thinned to give him access to the front door. He squeezed my hand, and I couldn\u2019t hold back the tears that filled my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready?\u201d Andrew asked, opening the door to escort him out.</p><p>\u201cA moment,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>And there in the foyer, with half the House\u2019s vampires looking on, he put his hands on my face, and he kissed me. The kiss was soft but insistent. Ethan Sullivan did not hesitate to demonstrate to the House exactly how he felt about me.</p><p>The magic in the room transmuted, became less about fear than hope. Somehow, because they\u2019d seen Ethan kiss me, they calmed. Perhaps because of the reminder that he had every incentive to come back healthy and whole.</p><p>After a moment he pulled back, his hand on my cheek, his thumb stroking my jaw.</p><p>Be careful, Sentinel, he silently said. The kiss had been for the House; the words were just for us. Guard Malik, the House, yourself.</p><p>You be careful, too.</p><p>I\u2019ve every intention of it, he said with a smile. He pressed another kiss to my lips\u2014softer, sweeter\u2014before releasing me and walking toward the door.</p><p>There, with his hand on the frame, he turned back and faced his vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens outside these doors is not relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is how you respond to them, how you move forward, that reveals your character.</p><p>\u201cYou are Cadogan vampires. You are honorable, brave . . . and more stylish than most.\u201d He got the chuckle he\u2019d undoubtedly wanted. \u201cTo that end, and to remind you who you are, we have something to share.\u201d</p><p>Malik walked forward with a box in hand, one that I recognized from our apartments. He opened it, pulled out a silver pendant on a chain, which gleamed like quicksilver beneath the foyer chandelier. Our previous House medals, circular disks inscribed with our positions and the House\u2019s GP registration number, were outdated since we\u2019d ditched the GP. These pendants, silver droplets with the House\u2019s name and our positions etched into the back, would be the new reminders of our vampiric family.</p><p>There were sparks of excitement in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d hoped our provision of these medals would be in a slightly more formal occasion,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut it is the symbol that matters, not the pomp and circumstance.\u201d</p><p>Ethan leaned forward, and Malik clasped the first pendant around Ethan\u2019s neck, which shined like a droplet of silver blood at the base of his throat. There was something nearly sensuous about the curve of it and the way it settled perfectly there.</p><p>Helen, the House\u2019s den mother, appeared at Ethan\u2019s side in her typical tweed suit, a basket of small crimson jewelry boxes on her arm. She began handing out the boxes to the Novitiates in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cBe strong,\u201d Ethan said, glancing across the room and meeting my gaze with a short and decisive nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon enough.\u201d He stepped outside and pulled the door closed, disappearing from view.</p><p>Fear tightened my chest.</p><p>Lindsey stepped beside me, put an arm around my waist. Luc took point at my other side.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come through this,\u201d Luc assured me. \u201cHe\u2019s a soldier. He is trained and can endure much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to endure anything. I don\u2019t want his life, his well-being, to be fodder for someone else\u2019s political career.\u201d Keep him safe, I thought, pleading to the universe and whatever gods inhabited it. Please keep him safe.</p><p>\u201cWe know you don\u2019t,\u201d Luc said, patting my back tenderly and a little awkwardly. \u201cBut he is Master of this House, and he does what he must to protect it. It\u2019s the life he chose to lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he can handle it,\u201d Lindsey said.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely can. There are stories I could tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour stories are always disgusting,\u201d Lindsey said, reaching around me to poke him in the shoulder. \u201cAnd they usually involve bordellos. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really going to help Merit.\u201d</p><p>It actually did help Merit, and I chuckled a little in spite of myself. \u201cBordellos? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago had its share once upon a time,\u201d Luc said with a shit-eating grin that earned an eye roll from Lindsey. \u201cThere was this one, Ruby Red\u2019s. Every single girl was a redhead, natural or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I held up a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t need the specifics. I just want Ethan to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Luc looked earnestly at me. \u201cMerit, of all the vampires in the world, who else is stubborn and pretentious enough to stand up to a self-righteous prig like Diane Kowalcyzk?\u201d</p><p>He had a point there.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Since there was no use in spending the hours of Ethan\u2019s incarceration staring at the door like loyal hounds waiting for him to return, we received our House medals, clasped them on, and walked back downstairs to the basement, where the Ops Room was located. Much like the Brecks\u2019, Cadogan\u2019s Ops Room was where Luc and his guards held court and monitored security. It was also, appropriately enough, where we planned operations against House enemies, and it was home to the whiteboard we used to work through our investigations.</p><p>Like the ops room in the Breck house, it was all about tech. A conference room where we could plan, a large screen on the back wall for videos, monitoring, considering evidence. Computer stations lined the walls, where vampires could keep an eye on the House\u2019s security cameras or do research.</p><p>I walked to the conference table, prepared to take a seat, but stopped, trying to make sense of what I saw on the tabletop.</p><p>A bag of kettle-style salt-and-vinegar potato chips had been slit down the middle and lay in the middle of the table. The chips had been pushed to one side, and the other bore a puddle of ketchup. I had, as I assumed did most people, a love-hate relationship with salt-and-vinegar potato chips. But the ketchup was new. And, frankly, a blasphemy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked, swirling a finger in the air above what I assumed was intended to be a \u201csnack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Luc said, \u201cis a bit of a miracle. Brody introduced us. Say hi, Brody.\u201d</p><p>Brody, blond, thin, and as tall as a skyscraper, sat at one of the computer stations that lined the room. He was one of the Novitiates Luc had temporarily hired to help with House security since we were down a couple of full-time guards. He\u2019d been a member of Cadogan House for fourteen years, a Yale graduate and former Olympic swimmer whose athletic career had been ended by a drunk driver. He\u2019d applied for House membership in the hopes of finding a new kind of team. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brody turned and waved with a charming smile. \u201c\u2019S\u2019up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about bringing him on board full-time,\u201d Luc said, gesturing toward the snacks. \u201cHe shared this little nugget in his interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Brody said. He stood up\u2014I nearly winced at the possibility he\u2019d knock his head on the ceiling\u2014then walked over and dipped two chips in the ketchup, popped the concoction in his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out.\u201d</p> <p>I was an adventurous eater, but pairing potato chips and ketchup was going to require a paradigm shift I wasn\u2019t currently prepared to entertain.</p><p>I sat down at the conference table, put my hands flat on the tabletop. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the carnival.\u201d</p><p>Luc and Lindsey joined me. Luc dipped a chip into the ketchup, ate it with a grin while I looked on. \u201cMmm,\u201d he said, earning an elbow from Lindsey.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll want to skip the noshing and ask the rest of the gang to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun, Sentinel,\u201d he said, but pushed the dials on the phone and conferenced them in.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Luc in the Cadogan Ops Room,\u201d he said with faux gravity, \u201cdialing you in to discuss the carnival investigation by direct order from the Sentinel of Cadogan House.\u201d</p><p>I glanced mildly at Lindsey. \u201cDid you spike his blood with caffeine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie Hard marathon was on TV last night,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been weaponized since then.\u201d</p><p>Jeff, Catcher, and Paige offered their hellos through the conference phone.</p><p>\u201cNo librarian?\u201d Jeff asked, when he didn\u2019t say hello.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in the stacks looking through newspapers,\u201d Paige said with amusement. \u201cAnd not to be disturbed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better woman than I am, Paige,\u201d Luc said, earning curious glances from all of us. Thankfully, he moved on. \u201cLet\u2019s talk carnival, folks.\u201d</p><p>As if optimism and preparation would be enough to make developments happen, I moved to the whiteboard, marker in hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve identified not so much a pattern, but a path,\u201d Paige said. \u201cThe carnival basically treks back and forth across the upper Midwest once a season. They go out as far as Montana, then come back as far east as Ohio. They ignore the seasons\u2014hold carnivals year-round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose the hunt for supernaturals doesn\u2019t have a season,\u201d Luc grimly said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like,\u201d Paige agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Chicago?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey hit it once every season, and it\u2019s always after Loring Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Luc said. \u201cGood find. Where do they go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve identified four possible spots so far. Two of them don\u2019t exist anymore. They were parking lots, but they\u2019ve been built over. They also camped near Prospect Park and the grounds of St. Athenogenus\u2014it\u2019s a Catholic school in West Town. Arthur\u2019s looking for any additional stops in Chicago. But since they aren\u2019t online, he has to go through the actual papers and microfiche.\u201d</p><p>I held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014Arthur?\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a moment as we all leaned eagerly toward the phone, awaiting confirmation that the librarian actually had a name.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap,\u201d Paige said, and I could imagine her wince through the phone. \u201cI was not supposed to say that. He prefers to go by his title, for the respect, you know. He\u2019s \u2018the librarian.\u2019 But I\u2019ve gotten so used to calling him Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stick with \u2018librarian,\u2019\u201d Luc said, smiling at the rest of us. We\u2019d all heard the name; there\u2019d be no unringing that particular bell.</p><p>I added Prospect Park and St. Athenogenus to the whiteboard. \u201cWe need to get folks out there right now to check those locations,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need people,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cGot satellites.\u201d The familiar clack of keys echoed through the receiver. He must have been back with his computers, although it occurred to me I wasn\u2019t exactly sure where that was. The Frankensteinian computer he\u2019d used at my grandfather\u2019s house had been torched in the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you working?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cMy own equipment. Which makes for a change. Differently tactile than the Brecks\u2019 stuff.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me that I had no idea where Jeff actually lived. \u201cAnd where is home?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI have a condo in the Loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s in the Fortified Steel building.\u201d</p><p>He said it so quietly the words were garbled, and it took my brain a moment to unscramble them. Fortified Steel was one of Chicago\u2019s most historic buildings, built when the city was a commodities powerhouse. It sat beside the Chicago River, a tall, square column of symmetrical windows with a famous copper dome on top. It was one of the many prestigious addresses in the Loop.</p><p>I\u2019d had no idea Jeff had those kinds of resources. And since he\u2019d barely mumbled the address, he apparently didn\u2019t want to discuss it.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, changing the subject. \u201cI\u2019m pulling satellite images for those locations, popping them up to you.\u201d</p><p>The screen behind us turned on with a glow and hum, and two photographs filled it. One was a parking lot, the other a park field still covered in snow. Neither held a hint of a carnival.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Luc said. \u201cThat\u2019s a strikeout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be they haven\u2019t set up yet,\u201d Brody said. \u201cThey only left Loring Park a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thought from the new guy,\u201d Luc agreed, scanning the photos. \u201cBut the equipment has to go somewhere, even if they aren\u2019t open to the public yet. Jeff, can you zoom out? Maybe there are semis parked in a lot nearby.\u201d</p><p>Jeff zoomed out both images, giving me an odd sense of vertigo. And it didn\u2019t help substantively, either. Neither image showed anything more than we\u2019d seen before.</p><p>\u201cThey could be at a different location, or they broke pattern,\u201d Luc said. \u201cMaybe they realized they\u2019d been tagged, decided to go somewhere else. Or maybe they\u2019re lying low for a few days until the heat\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe they\u2019re lying low for a few days because they\u2019re planning the next kidnapping,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking,\u201d Paige said. \u201cAnd let you know if we find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat brings us to the next point,\u201d Luc said. \u201cCatcher, have you had a chance to talk to sups?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cCatcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Sorry. I\u2019m here. I was being bugged by a sorceress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bugging anyone,\u201d Mallory, the aforementioned sorceress, said in the background. \u201cI just want you to keep your damn feet off the coffee table. And I don\u2019t care that I don\u2019t sleep here right now. That\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, supernatural love,\u201d Luc said, giving Lindsey a baleful look, which made her roll her eyes. But she still smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cSups,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cTalked to Grey House, asked Jonah to get a message to Navarre, considering. Called the nymphs, River trolls. They haven\u2019t been invited by anyone to a carnival. They didn\u2019t even know one would be going on, especially in February. They\u2019re also on the lookout for unusual magic. They know to call us if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Regan?\u201d I asked. \u201cJeff, any luck there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found anything else,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cNot even a couple of levels down. She\u2019s completely off the radar, or at least under her current name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have something,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cBaumgartner recognized the photograph. He didn\u2019t have a name, but he thought she looked like a woman who\u2019d come to the Order four or five years ago looking for membership. Said she had magic, wanted to join up. He did some initial testing, determined she wasn\u2019t a sorceress, and rejected her.\u201d</p><p>Luc whistled. \u201cAnd that, my friends, is what we call a motive. She gets rejected by the Order, decides to start targeting sups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of the people rejected by the Order become serial kidnappers,\u201d Catcher dryly said.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t rejected,\u201d Luc said. \u201cYou got kicked out for bad behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s definitely not a sorceress.\u201d I\u2019d half hoped the sulfuric smell of her had been a coincidence, or malfunctioning HVAC at the grocery story. I guess that was not to be. \u201cThat means we have to consider the possibility she\u2019s connected to the Messengers.\u201d And given her skills, the presumptive ringleader of these particular shenanigans.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d Mallory said.</p><p>\u201cOnly in the traditional sense,\u201d Luc said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s not one of them per se. But she could be a student, a pretender\u2014a kid with magic who wants us to believe that magic is ancient and prestigious. Hell, as little as we know, she could be Seth Tate\u2019s kid, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Catcher snorted. \u201cIn this day and age, any kid of Seth Tate\u2019s would have announced it to the world already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019d have told us,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe not pre-Maleficium, but after it, certainly. If he\u2019d known he had a kid\u2014or a fourth cousin\u2014who could cause trouble for us, he\u2019d have told us.\u201d</p><p>Or so I hoped.</p><p>Still, I added the possibilities to the whiteboard. \u201cWe have to find her,\u201d I said. \u201cOr both of them\u2014Regan and the carnival\u2014before she targets someone else.\u201d And we needed to do that while finding a way to get Ethan out of lockdown before Mayor Kowalcyzk decided to make an example of him.</p><p>Luc checked his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to do that,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut we\u2019re nearing sunrise, so it\u2019s not going to happen tonight. Let\u2019s pack it in for now, touch base at sunset. Paige, let us know if the librarian finds anything else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d she said, and there was a click as she dropped from the call.</p><p>We said good-bye to the others, and they dropped off the call as well. Luc\u2019s personal phone rang almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cLuc,\u201d he said, lifting it to his ear.</p> <p>He nodded, listened, spoke quietly with the caller, and after a moment, hung up the phone and looked at us. \u201cThat was Will, the guard captain at Navarre. The terrorism squad is packing up at Navarre House.\u201d</p><p>That meant Ethan was officially in interview, or in custody, depending on how the mayor\u2019s office was spinning it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news,\u201d Lindsey earnestly said, catching my gaze. \u201cIt means she\u2019s sticking to her word. That\u2019s exactly what we want.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but the clenched ball of worry in my stomach didn\u2019t unknot much.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take some personal time tomorrow at sunset?\u201d Luc said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a chance to see your grandfather yet. Take an hour\u2014go say hello.\u201d</p> <p>It was a good idea. I hadn\u2019t had a chance to visit the hospital since he\u2019d been admitted. We\u2019d gotten home too late tonight, but if I went after sunset tomorrow, I could probably catch him during visiting hours. Still, we were in the middle of an investigation.</p><p>\u201cIs that a good idea right now? Considering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a break,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you need to visit your grandfather. Run the carnival bit past him. See if he has any ideas.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow about a movie tonight?\u201d Lindsey asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for a full run before sunup, but we could fit in half a show, maybe some snacks?\u201d</p><p>I thought about the offer. While I wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea of going back to the apartments alone and spending the entire evening obsessing about Ethan, I also wasn\u2019t up for another night of entertainment. A bottle of Blood4You, roaring fire, and good book seemed like a much better option.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019ll pass. I\u2019ve been surrounded by sups for a few days now. I need a little quiet time.\u201d</p><p>Luc chuckled, fingered the new pendant around his neck. \u201cSentinel, you live in a literal house of vampires. You\u2019re going to be surrounded by sups regardless.\u201d</p><p>For better or worse.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I added what we\u2019d discovered to the whiteboard, said my good nights, and headed upstairs to the first floor. I heard sounds coming from the front parlor and walked toward it.</p><p>A dozen Cadogan vampires stood around the television mounted above the fireplace. The TV was tuned to a news station and the coverage of Ethan\u2019s arrival at the Daley Center.</p><p>Ethan climbed out of a town car and then walked, Andrew at his side and four officers surrounding him, into what looked like an underground entrance. Reporters who\u2019d staked out the door yelled questions and accusations, wondering why Ethan had killed Harold Monmonth, where he\u2019d been for the last three days, and why he\u2019d finally come back to Chicago. He kept his eyes clear and stared straight ahead, ignoring the questions. But the line between his eyes tightened with each new volley, and it was clear he had plenty of things to say to them.</p><p>After a moment, Andrew directed him to stop and faced the camera. With his broad shoulders and intense expression, Andrew looked more like a soldier or bodyguard than a lawyer. But either way, and whatever the reason, he commanded their attention. They quieted immediately.</p> <p>\u201cEthan Sullivan is innocent of the various accusations\u2014political, criminal, and otherwise\u2014that have been leveled against him. He is being targeted because he is a vampire, and the mayor\u2019s office, respectfully, is targeting him because she\u2019s looking for a scapegoat. The citizens of Chicago know better, and I\u2019ll be glad when we can put this entire matter to rest.\u201d</p><p>The tension in my chest eased just a little. Thinking I\u2019d seen as much as I needed to, I turned to walk away, but the sudden gasps behind me had my heart pounding, and I turned back to look.</p><p>\u201cAltercation at Daley Center,\u201d read the screen now, and the footage showed Ethan being escorted into a small room, a table and chairs visible through the door. But there was a bright bruise blooming across his left cheekbone.</p><p>Sometime between his arrival at the building and his reaching the interview room, he\u2019d been assaulted. Punishment, maybe, for his refusal to come in earlier, to acquiesce to Kowalcyzk\u2019s request that he sacrifice himself for her political agenda. And if they were knocking him around before he even got into the room, what more did they have planned?</p><p>Fear bubbled and spilled over, and I strode from the room before the tears tracked down my face. I made it as far as the stairway, stopping to knuckle away the tears, hoping no one had seen my quick exit or the reason for it. The last thing they needed was to see their Sentinel bawling in fear. There was a place for tears; it wasn\u2019t here, when the House needed its officers to be strong.</p><p>An arm wrapped around my shoulder. I looked up, surprised, into Malik\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>He was so quiet, so reserved, I wouldn\u2019t have expected him to offer physical solace, which made the fact that he had offered it even more meaningful. I had, over the last year, gathered up an assemblage of weird and wonderful friendships. They all had their ups and down, and some of the downs were pretty miserable. But sometimes, times like this, I could just be grateful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said with a half smile, still swiping at tears. \u201cLong night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument there,\u201d he said, but his eyes continued to track my face, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure I was telling him the entire truth.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I asked. \u201cThis can\u2019t be easy, this back-and-forth Masterdom.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his green eyes crinkled with amusement. \u201cMusical chairs aren\u2019t my preferred method of serving this House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you get to keep your rooms,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t have to move in and out of the Master\u2019s suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is some consolation,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAlthough you have better closets.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t actually seen Malik\u2019s closet, but as Ethan\u2019s was the size of a room in itself and outfitted with lush wood and thick carpet, he was probably right.</p><p>\u201cEthan would be lost without his suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would,\u201d Malik agreed, and patted my arm. \u201cHe would be lost without many things, including you. Go upstairs. Get a good day\u2019s sleep. This will be over tomorrow, and you and Ethan can enjoy a reunion.\u201d</p><p>I thanked him, walked upstairs, and hoped he was right. But I feared in my heart of hearts that we were all underestimating the depth of Kowalcyzk\u2019s ignorance.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I kept to the plan I\u2019d laid out for Lindsey, snagging a bottle of blood from the tray Margot had left in the apartments and both of the cellophane-wrapped Mallocakes, my favorite processed snack. Chocolate and blood didn\u2019t sound appealing, but it might have been the pinnacle of vampire comfort foods.</p><p>I changed into pajamas, nabbing one of Ethan\u2019s button-up shirts, the trace of his cologne lingering even after a wash, and buttoning it on. I turned on the fire in the onyx fireplace with the flick of a switch, and sat down on the rug in front of it, the bottle in hand.</p><p>My phone beeped, and I snatched it up greedily, hoping for good news about Ethan. It was Lakshmi, with another favor to ask.</p><p>KEEP HIM SAFE, she messaged.</p><p>I wanted to call her back, rail at her for standing by while Ethan bore the blame for acts by her colleagues. But vitriol would do no better now than tears. I put the phone aside, but the sting of her words stayed with me.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t I trying to keep him safe?</p><p>I stared at the fire until the sun rose, watching the forks and tendrils rise and shift and move, letting it blank my mind and send me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>THIS MAGIC MOMENT</p><p>The sun set again, and I awoke on the floor beside the fire, curled into a ball with the crook of my elbow as a pillow, the fireplace still crackling, the empty bottle beside me. I sat up and stretched, working out the kinks of spending ten hours asleep on a hardwood floor, then flipped off the fire and put the bottle on the tray the kitchen staff would eventually collect.</p><p>\u201cAnother night in paradise,\u201d I mused, and turned to the shower.</p><p>As part of the miracle that was Cadogan House, I found my leathers clean and shiny and ready to wear again. I dressed for war, belting on my katana, my hair in a ponytail, and the new Cadogan pendant around my neck. It felt differently than the last one had, the medal colder and thicker. But no less meaningful, and I was glad the tradition was under way again.</p><p>Now that I was back in Chicago and back on the clock, I grabbed my phone, texted Jonah. ALL WELL AT GREY HOUSE?</p><p>SO FAR, SO GOOD. MORGAN ON A TEAR ABOUT NAVARRE RAID.</p><p>That thought actually made me smile. Although Navarre was the origin of most of our troubles, the House rarely had to deal with the unpleasant consequences. Maybe now Morgan would appreciate the spot Celina had put us in all those months ago by announcing our existence to the world.</p><p>WORD ON ETHAN? he asked.</p><p>NOT YET. I\u2019M ABOUT TO HEAD DOWNSTAIRS. ALSO GOING TO VISIT GRANDFATHER. MAY NEED YOU ON MISSING SUP CASE.</p><p>ROGER, Jonah responded. KEEP ME POSTED.</p><p>Taking Luc\u2019s advice, I called the hospital, confirmed visiting hours, and prepared to head out. But I had two quick stops to make before I left.</p><p>The first was to the Ops Room. It seemed only fair that I\u2019d check in with Luc before leaving campus, even though he\u2019d given me permission the night before.</p><p>I made my way downstairs, and Helen stopped me on the first floor, a scrap of paper in hand. She extended it with perfectly manicured fingers, a silver charm bracelet dangling from her wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>\u201cYour garage code,\u201d she said, smiling mirthlessly. I guessed she wasn\u2019t thrilled that a peon so far down the chain of command had won access to the garage. Helen was adept and capable at her job. But she was the growly sort, and she had very specific opinions about who deserved the spoils of Cadogan House . . . and who did not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I wasn\u2019t going to look a gift Helen in the mouth.

Juliet, the last of the permanent guard crew, was gone, still taking it easy after her run-in with McKetrick.</p><p>The television wasn\u2019t on, but the mood was as grim as it had been in the parlor last night.</p><p>My stomach flipped. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing in particular, Sentinel. Just the usual bullshit. City\u2019s on our case. Shifters are on our case. GP\u2019s on our case. I\u2019m knee-deep in complaints and I\u2019m running out of fucks to give.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Lindsey.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not from Die Hard,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just improvising.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, took a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so chipper this morning?\u201d Luc asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not. But I had my first day of sleep in three days without sups pounding on my door or alarms ringing me awake. It made a nice change. Did you see Ethan\u2019s bruise last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn his cheek? Yeah,\u201d Luc said. \u201cWasn\u2019t thrilled with it, but he\u2019s in Andrew\u2019s hands now.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him in action. And trust me\u2014Law &amp; Order has nothing on this guy. I will guarantee you he\u2019s making a note of every time Kowalcyzk\u2019s people so much as look at Ethan the wrong way. And he\u2019ll nail them for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have a long list by the time Ethan gets released. Did he give you an update on when that might be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did not. Said they put him in the dark room during the day, but they kept him up after sunrise and roused him before the sun set again. Rendition tactics\u2014they\u2019re trying to make him slip up, change his story, give them some doubt to pin an arraignment on.\u201d</p><p>Grim as that sounded, it made me smile. As Luc had noted yesterday, there were few as stubborn as Ethan Sullivan. And while he did his unenviable job as Master, I had to do mine.</p><p>\u201cDo we have anything on the carnival?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else so far.\u201d He took in my zipped-up jacket, my belted sword. \u201cYou going to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I have my phone if you need me. And I checked in with Jonah\u2014he said things are calm at Grey and Navarre, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>Luc nodded. \u201cSo we have a momentary lull, at least until we come up with something.\u201d</p><p>I took that as a dismissal. \u201cDo me a solid,\u201d I said, heading for the door. \u201cFind me a carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>The amount of grinning I did at the basement door as I typed in my code, heard the hearty click of the tumblers shifting, was probably inappropriate. But I was from Chicago, and I had not only an off-street parking spot, but a heated, indoor parking spot. It was a luxury few of us even bothered to imagine. Like Moneypenny, it was another silver lining from the rioters\u2019 beating of my poor, departed Volvo.</p><p>Moneypenny sat, sleek and silver, in her appointed spot. The \u201cVisitor\u201d designation had been painted over, and \u201cSentinel\u201d stenciled over the white rectangle in vibrant blue.</p><p>\u201cThis does not suck,\u201d I murmured, and pulled Moneypenny into the cold Chicago night.</p><p>The Ops Room had been my first stop en route to visit my grandfather, but I had one more errand before heading south. My grandfather had a sweet tooth and a favorite cookie, and I could only imagine that the food he was served by the hospital didn\u2019t offer much in the way of sugary treats. I grabbed a bag of Oreos from a quick shop along the way and drove to the south side hospital where he was being treated.</p><p>I was half surprised my father hadn\u2019t yet transferred my grandfather to their home in Oak Park, the neighborhood where my parents lived. That\u2019s where he\u2019d recuperate when he was discharged. But they hadn\u2019t moved him yet, so I pulled into a visitor\u2019s spot in the garage and followed the stream of families with balloons and flowers into the hospital.</p><p>The hospital smelled the same as it had when he\u2019d been admitted a few days ago: like disinfectants and flowers.</p><p>My grandfather was muttering when I stepped into the doorway, a remote control in his hand, his eyes on the small television that hung on the opposite wall. He looked like I expected many grandfathers did\u2014caterpillar eyebrows and a halo of hair that didn\u2019t quite cover the bald spot on the top of his head. He usually preferred plaid shirts and thickly soled shoes, but tonight he wore a blue hospital gown.</p><p>At the sound of my knock, he glanced up and smiled, then held out his arms. \u201cCome on over, rover.\u201d</p><p>I did, offering him a gentle hug. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re up and awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwake, anyways,\u201d he said. \u201cUp\u2019s going to take a little longer. My gams aren\u2019t going to be the same.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cProbably no stilettos for you for a while. But you\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>I sat down on the edge of the bed, atop white sheets, and put a hand over his. His skin was thin and bruised, although I wasn\u2019t sure if that was from his injuries or the tubes and wires that still ran from his body to machines at his sides.</p><p>\u201cI brought a present.\u201d I presented the bag of Oreos and loved the sudden, wide pitch of his eyes.</p><p>He slid open the drawer on the nightstand beside the bed. \u201cHide \u2019em,\u201d he said at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. \u201cNurse\u2019ll be in here to check in, in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, a nurse peeked in\u2014ponytailed, fresh faced, and wearing blue scrubs.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Chuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, Stella. Thanks,\u201d he said, with a little wave.</p><p>She smiled and wandered off, and my grandfather sighed.</p><p>\u201cShe seems nice,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all nice. But they\u2019re nice constantly. Every hour when they check in, every time they open the door in the middle of the night and let the light in. And I\u2019m a cop. Former, maybe, but still a cop. I don\u2019t need to be checked on like a child.\u201d His tone was growly and irritable, and it made me feel infinitely better. Growly and irritable seemed like a stop on the journey toward healing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to a night\u2019s sleep in a dark and quiet room.\u201d</p><p>Noise erupted from the television set, drawing our gazes.</p><p>\u201cNews,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping to catch the Blackhawks score.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know much about hockey; the only time I\u2019d been to a game was when Grandpa had gotten tickets from the family of a grateful citizen. He\u2019d been a fan ever since.</p><p>\u201cDid they win?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He used the bedside remote to turn the volume down. \u201cNot even close. Three to one.\u201d</p><p>That seemed close enough for me, but hockey was its own weird world, and I didn\u2019t feel qualified to point out the difference.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, a little achy.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cDo you need something for the pain? I could call Stella.\u201d</p><p>He gestured to the electronic drip at the side of the bed. \u201cGot it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to use it. Dulls the mind.\u201d</p><p>And a cop, former or otherwise, would not want a dulled mind.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going to have to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc thinks forty-eight more hours. They want to make sure everything\u2019s in the right place\u2014and going to stay there\u2014before they send me to Oak Park. Your father has hired a slew of nurses and doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound resigned,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being very generous,\u201d my grandfather said, very diplomatically. He might not have agreed with the decisions my father had made, but he wasn\u2019t much for criticizing.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about where you\u2019ll live when you\u2019re up and running again? Will you stay on the south side?\u201d</p><p>Chicago wasn\u2019t a city without problems or violence, and the south side bore much of the weight of those issues. As a cop, Grandpa decided the south side needed him more than the north, so that\u2019s where he and my grandmother had made their home. That was undoubtedly part of the reason for my father\u2019s lifetime quest for money and power.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t quite gotten that far,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m done with stairs for a bit.\u201d He put a hand on mine. \u201cCatcher told me about Ethan. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dealing with a lot lately. The riots, now the mayor. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d actually resort to violence. If I didn\u2019t think another demonically possessed mayor was seriously unlikely, I\u2019d say she was under the control of darker forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was odd enough when the first mayor split into two. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s got enough brains to make two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish there was something I could do. A call I can make. But she\u2019s pulled this one away from the police department, probably because she knows they have sense and pay attention to rules of evidence. But these terrorism folks?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey have to justify their existence. Vampires are a new threat? Great. They now have a basis to request a budget for next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have a lot of pieces to play in this one. We can\u2019t use magic against her. She\u2019ll just call us enemies of the state, and we\u2019ll never see the light of day again. Figuratively,\u201d I added. We already were biologically barred.</p><p>\u201cYou could always ask your father,\u201d my grandfather carefully said, which earned him a look.</p><p>I certainly could ask my father to put in a word, to use his significant capital to convince Kowalcyzk to back off. I was sure it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a bribe was offered or taken in Chicago. But I didn\u2019t trust my father\u2019s motives, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to owe him a debt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But my father was still my grandfather\u2019s son, and I actually respected him. So I answered politely. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you one thing,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care to be in here when this city is falling down around us.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, being out there wasn\u2019t proving all that helpful, either.</p> <p>\u201cIs it time for you to think about slowing down?\u201d I asked the question out of obligation, even though I knew the answer\u2014and predicted the flatness of his expression.</p><p>\u201cCaroline Merit. You know better than that. I\u2019m a cop. Always was, always will be.\u201d He looked down at his blanket-covered legs. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to take more than a bump to make daytime television look good by comparison. Especially when you\u2019re out there. You\u2019re still mine to protect, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over, pressed a kiss to his forehead. \u201cI love you, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Merit. And now that you\u2019ve cleared your conscience,\u201d he said with a grin, \u201cwhat did you really want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. He read me better than nearly anyone. \u201cAline and Niera,\u201d I said, and he nodded.</p> <p>The librarian and Paige had given him the details. So when he nodded, I gave him an update, telling him about Regan\u2019s involvement, the other disappearances, and the magical attacks.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to find her or the carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think there\u2019s a link between her and Dominic Tate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t really fit what we know about the Messengers and the breakup of the Maleficium.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about finding Tate.\u201d</p><p>I blushed. I hadn\u2019t actually considered it as a tactic\u2014why invite trouble?\u2014but I was running out of options. Chicago\u2019s vampires were potential targets, and the longer it took to find Niera, the higher the risk the elves would consider the truce breached. And that was unacceptable to me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an idea,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe\u2019d know better than anyone what she is\u2014and how to stop her. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cHis history was, as you know, inconsistent. I know he\u2019s fashioned himself as a different man after the Maleficium. Do you believe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI know Seth Tate, and I knew Dominic Tate. Seth was a different man after the split. Not just personality-wise. He\u2019s still a politician,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cBut magically. Psychically, I guess. You could tell he was different. And he\u2019s the key to this. I\u2019m just not sure how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes you have to follow your gut.\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cAnd in this particular case, I\u2019d check with chain of command. Follow your gut, but cover your ass.\u201d</p><p>Advice didn\u2019t get any better than that.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to end on such a dark note, so I turned the conversation to something lighter and we chatted a little while longer, sneaking Oreos from the drawer after ensuring the coast\u2014and hallway\u2014was clear. We apparently hadn\u2019t been in Loring Park long enough to miss any important family events. My brother\u2019s wife was still very pregnant, and my father still had money coming out of his ears.</p><p>Supernatural events were slightly more interesting. Four of the city\u2019s petite and busty River nymphs had visited my grandfather, bringing jars of \u201chealing\u201d River water that were confiscated and emptied by my grandfather\u2019s nurses\u2014and bringing a fight over which segment of the River had the most beautiful architecture. Apparently there wasn\u2019t much to do during the frozen winter months.</p> <p>When my grandfather yawned and barely managed to hide it, I decided it was time to go. I gave him a kiss, left the rest of the embargoed cookies in the drawer, and promised to keep him updated if anything interesting happened.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Traffic was an ugly snarl, and Moneypenny and I practically crawled our way north again. The House was quiet when I walked in, the energy tense and subdued. I\u2019d have expected to get a call if Ethan had been released, but the tension in the air was sign enough.</p><p>I found Luc, Lindsey, Brody, and Kelley around the table in the Ops Room. Kelley twirled a lock of her straight black hair while staring at the overhead screen, which was once again tuned to an all-news channel.</p><p>What would it have been like, I wondered, to have been a vampire in an age before the Internet, twenty-four-hour news channels, social media, text messages? Before technology provided a constant assault of drama, bad news, and Things You Should Be Worrying About.</p><p>Tonight, the news showed Diane Kowalcyzk posing in front of a poster propped on an easel. Shots of Ethan, Scott, Morgan, the Masters of the three Chicago Houses, were pictured beneath a headline that read ENEMIES OF CHICAGO?</p><p>The question mark, probably the brainchild of some lawyer who thought it would protect the city against a libel charge, was laughable. Who\u2019d see the photographs, read the headline, and think she was posing a question?</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be fucking kidding me!\u201d Luc said, pushing back from the table with enough force to rattle the entire twelve feet of it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s made a Wanted poster,\u201d Lindsey said, eyes wide as she stared at the screen. \u201cPeople will want his blood. All of their blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelley, get in touch with Jonah and Will,\u201d Luc ordered, eyes still on the screen. \u201cMake sure they\u2019re seeing this.\u201d Kelley nodded, plucked up her phone from the table, started dialing.</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something,\u201d Lindsey said, looking back at Luc with obvious fear in her eyes. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let this go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are doing something,\u201d Luc said, but he didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cWe\u2019ve hired lawyers, and we\u2019ve connected with reporters. That\u2019s what we can do right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lawyers and reporters aren\u2019t helping,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave him in there. He\u2019s an enemy of the state and he\u2019s surrounded by law enforcement officers and felons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, exactly, would you like me to do, Merit? Beg the mayor to release your boyfriend because you\u2019re afraid for him?\u201d</p><p>I flinched from the heat of his words; Luc wiped a hand over his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was uncalled for. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re right. They think he\u2019s an enemy of the state; there\u2019s no begging we can do that will release him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d Brody asked me, drawing groans from the rest of the room.</p><p>\u201cNot an option,\u201d Luc said. \u201cSo don\u2019t even consider it.\u201d He blew out a breath, ran his hands through his hair. \u201cWe have to let Andrew do his job.\u201d But he sounded just as frustrated as I felt.</p><p>I put my head on my folded arms. \u201cWhy does my father have to be such an asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we all have our burdens to bear. And if you\u2019re even thinking about making that call,\u201d Luc said, pointing a warning finger at me, \u201cput that thought out of your head immediately. Ethan would lose his shit if he thought you asked your father for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, lifting my head. \u201cAnd I know I can\u2019t run in there with a sword or two. But I sure would like to.\u201d I thought of what my grandfather had said about magic, about the darker forces that had affected the last mayor. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s got her own Dominic. A little evil twin who lives in her helmet hair and makes her do evil, dirty things.\u201d</p><p>Luc laughed. \u201cThat is both perfectly absurd and perfectly appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of evil twins, it was time to offer up the plan I\u2019d been considering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to find Seth Tate.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at me. \u201cSentinel, have you lost your damn mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and since the tone didn\u2019t sound convincing, I said it again with feeling. \u201cNo. I have not lost my mind, damned or otherwise. Look\u2014Regan\u2019s either a Messenger or she\u2019s got a connection to Dominic Tate. Either way, Seth\u2019s the only person we can ask about it. He can help us identify her\u2014and tell us how to take her down.</p><p>\u201cAnd, while I\u2019m there, maybe I can talk to him about the mayor. Maybe he has an idea about how we can bring her around.\u201d</p><p>That, he looked interested in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I offered. \u201cBefore he left, he told us he was looking for contrition. He sounded earnest and Ethan trusted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespectfully, Sentinel, Ethan isn\u2019t here, and I\u2019m not one to invite trouble while he\u2019s gone. Tate\u2019s demonic half was stripped from his body, so sure, he shouldn\u2019t be evil. But he\u2019s still powerful. And we can\u2019t exactly account for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think she\u2019d be okay,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cSeth Tate has the hots for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does not,\u201d I protested, but I could feel the burn skimming up my cheeks. We had a history, yes, but it wasn\u2019t romantic. At least not from my end.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cSo you all think this is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the worst idea I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s at least one or two up from the very bottom.\u201d He scratched his head. \u201cBut I\u2019m not thrilled about sending you to play with Seth Tate while Ethan\u2019s incarcerated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan will live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say. If you\u2019re hurt, he\u2019ll come after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth is our best option to figure out what Regan is\u2014how she exists.\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cEven if I said yes, you still have to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI have an idea about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may not want to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably won\u2019t want to. It\u2019s my job to convince him.\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s phone began to ring, and he glanced at the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s Jonah. Grey\u2019s seen the ad.\u201d He lifted it to his ear, glanced at me. \u201cFind him first. Then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I called Mallory first to confirm her location. She was still in Wicker Park, didn\u2019t plan to head back to Little Red until Gabe returned to the city.</p><p>I didn\u2019t show up empty-handed. Just as Mallory had brought me raspberry donuts, I showed up with a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, which had been legal tender for much of our relationship.</p> <p>Catcher opened the door, looked down at the goods and then up at me again. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re friends again?\u201d</p><p>Normally, he\u2019d have accompanied that statement with a solid dose of sarcasm. But this time, there was a kind of softness.

The basement was where she\u2019d \u201cstudied\u201d for her magical exams\u2014and where she\u2019d prepared the magic that led her to Nebraska.</p> <p>Once again, Catcher\u2019s smile was understanding. Maybe he was evolving, too. \u201cChecks and balances,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve warded the basement, and alarms go off if the magic she works reaches a certain threshold. I\u2019ve also put a baby monitor down there.\u201d</p><p>He must have seen the shock on my face, as he snorted gleefully. \u201cShe\u2019s not pregnant. It helps me keep track when I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>I peeked into the living room, saw a half-empty bowl of cashews and a bottle of 312 on the coffee table, and a Lifetime movie on the television.</p><p>\u201cBusy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled lazily. \u201cWe all have our hobbies. Now, come in or not. You\u2019re letting in the cold air.\u201d</p><p>Catcher Bell. Twenty-nine going on sixty-five.</p> <p>I walked inside, and Catcher closed the door behind me and immediately went for the couch. I moved through the living room and dining room to the kitchen, where the basement door was located. I stuck the ice cream in the freezer and headed downstairs.</p><p>And then I goggled.</p><p>What before could have been the setting for a horror movie\u2014all dark corners, cobwebs, jars of questionable substances, and magical miscellany\u2014had become Martha Stewart\u2019s own bright and shiny craft studio. The walls has been painted cheery white, and the floor had been covered in long planks of honey-gold wood. The ceiling had been finished, and recessed lighting installed. The space was now lined with white cabinets and bookshelves, and the bookshelves were lined with matching glass jars with hanging labels. Foxglove, wolfsbane, St.-John\u2019s-wort, and hundreds of others.</p><p>In the middle of the room there was a giant white island, the countertop balanced on shelves covered in old-fashioned books. Mal, wearing a T-shirt and long, feathered earrings, her hair in a messy blue bun, sat on a stool behind the island, crushing something green and fragrant with a marble mortar and pestle that rested beside the baby monitor Catcher mentioned. Mal smiled and whistled as she worked, earbuds in her ears, occasionally glancing at a sleek tablet while she mixed ingredients. It was very suburban, which wasn\u2019t a term I associated with Mallory. And yet, somehow, it seemed to suit her perfectly.</p><p>Finally realizing she wasn\u2019t alone, she glanced up and pulled the earbuds from her ears, dusting her hands on a gingham apron tied around her waist.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cWelcome to the new abode.\u201d</p><p>I twirled a hand in the air to indicate the space. \u201cWhat the hell happened down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatcher happened,\u201d she said conspiratorially. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel like he\u2019d done a very good job mentoring me during, you know, the unfortunate period. So he did this. Isn\u2019t it phenomenal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s astounding. It looks like a completely different place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that was the point. Clean beginnings and all that. But that\u2019s not even the best part.\u201d She rose and leaned over the table, picking up a clipboard that had been decoupaged with magazine clippings. A piece of paper was stuck beneath the aluminum clip. \u201cGood deeds,\u201d read the title, with bullet points for a list not yet filled in.</p><p>\u201cGood deeds?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my to-do list,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was Tanya\u2019s suggestion, actually. That I learn to use magic\u2014this time for real\u2014with a charitable aim.\u201d</p><p>I had a momentary stab of jealousy that Mallory and Tanya had become friends. Not that I begrudged her friendships, or the empathy that undoubtedly came with her exposing herself to other supernaturals in the world. I guess I was, as Ethan often accused, more human than most.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of good deeds?\u201d</p><p>She put the clipboard back on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re currently trying to figure out. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to offer my services up to Chuck when he\u2019s one hundred percent. Maybe the nymphs could use help? Or the River trolls? I don\u2019t know. This is all very early in the planning stage. The point is, though, if I have this power, I should be doing something with it. Something good.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe just have to work out the mechanics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me know how I can help.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI had this sudden memory of that yard sale you offered to help with a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you call a \u2018yard sale\u2019 was two ponchos and a pair of worn Birkenstocks from your hippie phase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Bob Marley rug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a Bob Marley rug,\u201d I allowed with a grin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need my help. Besides, you had your crusty boyfriend. What was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAkron.\u201d</p><p>I snapped my fingers and pointed at her. \u201cRight! Akron, named because he considered Akron the jewel of American cities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun as this walk down memory lane is, it\u2019s not why you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, smiling curiously. \u201cYou said something about a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I need to find someone. Magically.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWe talked about that. Decided it wouldn\u2019t work for Regan or Aline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I think the\u2014what did you call it? magical signature?\u2014will be different here. I have something you can use. Something good, I think.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the velvet pouch from my pocket and emptied it onto the table. The gold glinted in the light, and Mallory\u2019s smile slowly faded.</p><p>Silently, she looked at the medal for a moment, as if she could sense its magic and it scared her. I immediately regretted that I\u2019d brought it. I reached out a hand to snatch it up again, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI just need to get Catcher.\u201d</p><p>The baby monitor crackled. \u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said. Seconds later, he trotted down the basement stairs. He really was paying attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, looking back and forth at us in search of the trouble he expected had brought him downstairs.</p><p>Mallory pointed to the medal. Catcher looked momentarily confused, but the magical signature must have been enough for him, too, to understand the gist. He looked at Mallory, then at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Tate\u2019s magic all over this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he was imprisoned, I gave him my medal\u2014used it to pay for information. He didn\u2019t give it back until he left. By then, I\u2019d already gotten a new House medal. And when we left the GP and turned our medals in, I kept this one. I just had a feeling about it.\u201d I looked at both of them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think it would have that much magic left in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have much,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cJust memories, yes?\u201d he asked, turning to Mallory.</p><p>She blew out a breath, clearly trying to compose herself, then nodded. \u201cMemories. Very clear ones. Very\u201d\u2014she rubbed her hands over her arms, where goose bumps had lifted\u2014\u201ctangible memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is it here?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cMerit wants to find him,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cAlthough we hadn\u2019t gotten to the why of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our best bet to learn about Regan\u2014to figure out what she is and what to do with her. And I was also hoping he might be able to talk some sense into Mayor Kowalcyzk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll play along?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe was contrite when he left. Wanted to redeem himself. I\u2019m hoping he still does and that he\u2019ll consider this a favor to the city of Chicago. And me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think he\u2019d be able to change her mind?\u201d Catcher asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut Ethan\u2019s not exactly accessible. And even if we wanted to owe my father, I don\u2019t think Kowalcyzk would roll over for a bribe. Not when she thinks she\u2019s making political hay. I can\u2019t fight him out, or the city will destroy us. As long as she calls him an enemy of the state, the evidence is irrelevant. And God knows she isn\u2019t going to listen to me. I was hoping she\u2019d listen to Tate.\u201d</p><p>Catcher looked back at the medal, blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s not a horrible idea.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I felt a sliver of hope. \u201cI can take \u2018not horrible.\u2019 But not if it will hurt either one of you or endanger Mal\u2019s recovery. He\u2019s alive.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cI won\u2019t trade his life for yours. If you can\u2019t safely do this, then you don\u2019t do it. The risk isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me for a long time, then Catcher.</p><p>\u201cYour call,\u201d he said. \u201cThese decisions have to be yours.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then put her hands flat on the table on either side of the medal and looked down, her eyes scanning back and forth as if she was reading a magical text. And maybe she was.</p><p>\u201cBoth of them are in there. A bit of Seth, a bit of Dominic.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cHe sees you as his, in a way.\u201d</p><p>I started. \u201cHe\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cSeth, not Dominic. He\u2019s been part of your life for a very long time, and that\u2019s meaningful to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, romantically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mary Sue. Not romantically. You\u2019re just . . . there. Like an achievement, maybe because he was searching for something. Fame. Power. Popularity. In reality, of course, he probably wanted to rid himself of the parasitic demon that he didn\u2019t know was attached to his soul. But, you know, details.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou got all that from my medal?\u201d</p><p>She gestured offhandedly toward it. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of jewelry, not a memoir. But I can get a little. The issue will be the mechanism. We\u2019ll have to link the medal to a map if we want to get anywhere with this.\u201d</p><p>She spun on the stool and looked at Catcher, arms crossed. \u201cWhat do you think? Compass in water? Map on a dart board? Google Maps?\u201d</p> <p>Catcher\u2019s eyes shined. \u201cDamn, I love it when you talk shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when destroying the world isn\u2019t the side dish,\u201d Mallory murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat helps,\u201d Catcher admitted.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>They decided on their tools, and Catcher cleaned off the table while Mallory prepared the magic and the spell.</p> <p>It was both more and less complex than I\u2019d imagined it would be.</p><p>Less, because it involved such mundane materials. A map of the U.S. torn from a road atlas, the front cover of which bore a smiling insurance agent with perfectly coiffed brown hair. A large glass baking dish of water, which held a sliver of cork, the House medal stuck to the top with a thin sewing needle. The map was submerged in the water, the make-do magical compass bobbing above it.</p><p>Humble materials, but the magic was profound.</p><p>When her station was prepared, Mallory stretched and shook out her wrists and arms, rolled her shoulders like a swimmer preparing for a sprint. She was surprisingly calm, her movements reverential. Instead of making her anxious or manic, the preparations seemed to soothe her. Her hands, once chapped from the aftereffects of black magic, looked healthy again, although they were still marked by faint, crisscrossing lines from the damage she\u2019d already done.</p><p>She looked up at me, smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. I mean, not the magic per se. But the preparations. They remind me why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing, force me to calm myself, to approach it logically.\u201d</p><p>I smiled a little. \u201cKind of like doing dishes?\u201d</p> <p>She chuckled. \u201cExactly like doing dishes. The North American Central Pack isn\u2019t perfect, any more than the Keenes are perfect. But they know magic. A healthy kind of magic. A useful kind of magic. I couldn\u2019t have gotten better without him. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be kind of like dousing,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cWater witching. Except we aren\u2019t looking for water. We\u2019re looking through it.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her legs up, sitting cross-legged on a stool too small for it, which made her look a little like she was floating like a meditating yogi. She put her hands flat on the table and looked down at the water and the cork that bobbed inside it.</p><p>\u201cAnd away we go,\u201d she quietly said.</p><p>The buildup was so slow, so smooth, that I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d begun spooling magic until the other objects on the table began to vibrate. The room had warmed, just a bit, not uncomfortably, but like I\u2019d just moved a little closer to a roaring fire on a chilly day. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be able to tell the difference, but this was obviously good magic. There was no uncomfortable edge, no angry itch. It was calmer. Smoother, rippling the air in smooth waves that rolled across us instead of crashing into us like Mallory\u2019s magic had once done.</p><p>By the expression on Catcher\u2019s face, he was feeling it, too. He generally had three moods\u2014bleak, pissed, and sardonic. (He might have been three of Snow White\u2019s rejected dwarves.) But here, in this rehabbed basement with his rehabbed girlfriend, he actually looked . . . content. Proud and thoughtful, a little bit smitten, and generally satisfied with his lot.</p><p>Good for him. And her. They could use a little smitten and content.</p><p>Mallory drew the magic to a crescendo and pointed her index finger at my House medal. A blue spark sizzled from her finger to the cork. The medal heated, the edges glowing orange at first, then heating to white-hot, the metal warm enough to boil the water around it. The cork shivered and began to spin, whirling like a top in the middle of the water, then zigging across the surface like a bug, back and forth as it tried to find its target.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Mallory whispered encouragingly. As if in answer, like a child itching to please its mother, it dove and disappeared.</p><p>As fast as it had begun, the magic dissipated again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Mallory said, standing to peer over the water.</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d I asked, stepping carefully closer.</p><p>\u201cIt picked a spot,\u201d Mallory said, wincing as she dipped her fingers into the edges of the dish.</p><p>\u201cHot, hot, hot,\u201d she murmured, almost to herself, carefully lifting the map from the bottom of the dish.</p><p>The cork, still quivering, was neatly pinned to the near center of the map. Mallory let the rest of the water drain, then placed the map on the table.</p><p>Catcher stepped forward, peered over Mallory\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPortville, Indiana,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find your man.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>THE BANKER</p><p>Portville, Indiana, was gritty, a hard-bitten industrial town on the southern tip of Lake Michigan, just across the Indiana border. Portville had a reputation as a crumbling, blue-collar city abandoned by industry, its remaining vacuum filled by gangs, poverty, and violence.</p><p>Seth Tate, a fallen angel with contrition on his mind, had taken up residence there. If he\u2019d really been serious about making amends for his past bad acts, the location was entirely appropriate. It definitely seemed like a city that needed help. On the other hand, during his less angelic days, when he\u2019d been under Dominic\u2019s influence, he\u2019d been a drug kingpin and a befouler of vampires. A dirty city was just the type of place for him to work some dirty magic.</p><p>Either way, I had nothing more than the town\u2019s name, which the Internet told me had nearly one hundred thousand residents. Not an address, a workplace, a church, or a precinct\u2014but a name. This was going to be a challenge.</p><p>This was a big task, and I was going to need a partner. Unfortunately, both my official partners were under wraps. Ethan was in custody, and Jonah was captain of a House whose Master had been called an enemy of Chicago. He was going to have his hands full keeping his people safe.</p><p>That meant I needed to look elsewhere. So when I was in the car again, I pulled out my phone and called Jeff.</p><p>\u201cHey, Merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I got to the point, and quickly. \u201cCan you get away for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning a trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, actually. What do you know about Portville, Indiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. Should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where Seth Tate\u2019s currently living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cSulfur and smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yeah. If she\u2019s connected to the Messengers, he\u2019s the best person to tell us how. I still have to check with Luc and Malik, but I think they\u2019ll say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t mind as much if you go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know when I\u2019ve been beat. Where should I meet you?\u201d</p><p>Since I was already on the south side, I gave him the address of the convenience store I\u2019d pulled into to make my calls. \u201cI\u2019ve got to cover my bases. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as it\u2019s a go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d he said, apparently convinced I\u2019d get the okay.</p><p>I was glad Jeff was on my side. Now I had to make sure the rest of the pieces aligned.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>That alignment took phone calls. Plural.</p><p>I called Luc, told him Mallory and Catcher had found Tate, and Jeff had agreed to go with me to see him.</p><p>Luc hung up, and while I blasted Moneypenny\u2019s heat and sipped the soda I\u2019d grabbed at the convenience store\u2014heavy on the ice and cherry flavoring, \u2019cause I was in that kind of mood\u2014I waited.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I got a call back. My stomach buzzed with nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Malik,\u201d said the temporary Master of the House.</p><p>\u201cLiege,\u201d I acknowledged, a word I\u2019d gotten used to during Ethan\u2019s demise.</p><p>\u201cVisiting him is a risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. And so is waiting for Regan to strike again, risking the elves attacking, and pissing off the Keenes. I was in Dominic\u2019s prison, Malik. I know what he was capable of. But Seth Tate is not Dominic. The man we saw after the split was a good man, an earnest man, and he meant to make amends for the things he\u2019d done. He stayed at the House, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan authorized him to say at the House,\u201d Malik quietly said, his tone making clear that he hadn\u2019t agreed with that decision.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll live up to that in the long run. But who else can we ask?\u201d</p><p>Although I wasn\u2019t entirely sure talking to Tate was a great idea, I was willing to stand behind it\u2014and take the fall if necessary. I tried to pour that confidence and bravado into my voice.</p><p>\u201cThe idea is not without risk,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to take that risk on. We don\u2019t have a lot of good options right now, and we\u2019re stalled on Regan. I think it\u2019s time to use the alliances we\u2019ve created. He\u2019s within driving distance, and he owes us a pretty big favor. Let me and Jeff drive down there. One conversation with him, and we see how far we get.\u201d</p><p>Silence, while I gnawed the edge of my thumb.</p><p>\u201cYou go down tonight, you come back in one piece,\u201d Malik said. \u201cIf he seems even remotely unstable, you abort the plan. If the situation seems dangerous, you abort the plan. If anything happens to you, you\u2019ll have Ethan and me on your ass, and you don\u2019t want that, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Liege,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI definitely do not.\u201d</p><p>I did a happy dance. Not because I was thrilled to see Tate, but because I was thrilled to be doing something. Standing around the House and watching more footage of Ethan in trouble wasn\u2019t going to help me at all.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking for Regan and the carnival,\u201d Malik said. \u201cFind us a guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>It was my primary goal.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>At first, I waited for Jeff outside the car, leaning against it like I was the baddest vampire in the modern age. Or certainly the vampire with the sweetest ride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it was February\u2014in Chicago\u2014and I quickly rejected that idea, climbed inside, and turned up the heater.</p><p>Jeff arrived a few minutes later, parked his car at the edge of the parking lot, and climbed in. \u201cThis is a damn fine automobile,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I gestured toward the forty-four-ounce Mountain Dew in the cup holder, and the sticks of beef jerky I\u2019d wedged between his cup and mine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProvisions. And a thank-you gift. That\u2019s what gamers use for fuel, right?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me with a mix of pity and adoration and my heart melted a little. \u201cThat was really nice, Merit.\u201d He opened a stick of jerky, dug into it. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell Fallon. She\u2019s not a fan of processed food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just between us,\u201d I promised, and we headed south.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>The city lined up along the edge of Lake Michigan, with industrial ports and brick smokestacks reaching into the sky on the lake side, and dilapidated buildings on the other.</p><p>The main street was flat-out depressing, half the shops\u2014still marked by their antique cursive signs\u2014boarded up and closed. When manufacturing moved out, it took time for anything else to move back in. The Midwest and Rust Belt had dozens if not hundreds of towns proving that very point.</p><p>I found a cluster of new businesses close to the freeway, and pulled into the lot of a store that carried animal feed and farming supplies. You didn\u2019t have to go very far outside Chicago to reach farmland.</p><p>\u201cNeed a snack?\u201d Jeff asked with amusement.</p><p>\u201cNeed recon,\u201d I said, pulling the photograph of Tate from my pocket. \u201cWe know he\u2019s in the city. We don\u2019t know much more than that.\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward the photograph. \u201cThis is your big plan? You\u2019re going to wander from store to store asking if anyone has seen him?\u201d</p> <p>In fairness, it sounded much more logical in my head. \u201cHe was the mayor of Chicago, and he\u2019s looking for redemption. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to lay low. I think he\u2019s going to get out there. Mix it up. Mingle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t still look like that,\u201d Jeff said, pointing at the photo. \u201cHe\u2019d be recognized. We\u2019re not that far from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of that,\u201d I admitted. But we had to start somewhere. \u201cI\u2019ll try this. In the meantime, work some of your computer magic and see what you can find in the ether. I\u2019ll be right back.</p><p>\u201cNo backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to scare them,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I go in alone, I\u2019m asking questions. If both of us go in, we\u2019re ganging up.\u201d</p><p>When he finally nodded his agreement, I walked inside, a bell ringing on the door to signal my entry. The store smelled of leather and grains, and I lingered in the doorway for a moment, enjoying the fragrance. It smelled earnest, like hard work and chores.</p><p>The store was empty of people at this late hour, and a man, probably in his forties, stood behind the counter in a collared shirt and pants and a bright green vest with a name tag that read CARL.</p><p>He looked up at me, smiled. \u201cEvening. Help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, actually, although I have kind of a strange request.\u201d I walked toward the checkout line and pulled the photograph from my pocket. \u201cI\u2019m looking for this man.\u201d</p><p>I held out the picture. He glanced at it for a moment, then back at me.</p><p>\u201cSorry. He doesn\u2019t look familiar.\u201d His eyes narrowed with interest. \u201cDid he do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I frowned, realizing I hadn\u2019t come up with a cover story, and opted for the truth. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of the family who disappeared. We\u2019re trying to find him.\u201d</p><p>As if sympathetic, he looked at the photograph again, shook his head. \u201cSorry. But good luck.\u201d</p><p>I thanked him, tucked the photograph away again, and climbed back into the car. Jeff had pulled out that slick little square of glass, and he was tapping the screen busily.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014you\u2019ve already found his address and favorite Chinese place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I just increased my mage to level forty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaming has a lot of math, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d He put the screen away again. \u201cI found nothing, but of course I\u2019m using mobile equipment, which isn\u2019t quite as nice as the box I had at home when you called me and I could have looked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rehearsed that speech for a while, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jeff grinned. \u201cI take it you weren\u2019t successful, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a little. He didn\u2019t recognize the picture.\u201d</p><p>The next guy and the girl that followed also couldn\u2019t give me anything. In the end, it was the fourth stop and floppy-haired shifter who got it done.</p><p>\u201cLet me take this one,\u201d he said, climbing out of the car with me as we walked inside a twenty-four-hour diner that had seen better days\u2014and cleaner linoleum.</p><p>He scoped out the waitstaff, spied a pretty, delicate-looking blonde behind the cash register, and walked up. Her hair was pulled into a dank ponytail, and there were bags of exhaustion beneath her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt your night, but could I maybe ask you for a favor?\u201d His eyes were bright and blue, his smile completely guileless. I\u2019d have done a favor for him. As long as it wouldn\u2019t have gotten me in trouble with Fallon.</p><p>\u201cA favor?\u201d she asked, blinking. \u201cFrom me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jeff winced, all apologies. He held out the photograph he\u2019d borrowed from me in the car. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find this man. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve seen him?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cFather Paul? Is he in some kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>So Tate hadn\u2019t just shed his identity; he\u2019d changed his name and apparently taken on religion. Although I guess that wasn\u2019t hard to believe. He was an angel, after all.</p><p>Jeff smiled almost foolishly. \u201cOh, not at all. We\u2019ve actually just been trying to find him. We heard him speak\u2014and really liked what he had to say. But we haven\u2019t been able to find his Web site or anything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cFather Paul\u2019s not one for technology.\u201d She checked her watch. \u201cYou can probably find him at the food pantry. He works late nights sometimes, helping stock shelves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s near here?\u201d Jeff asked with a beaming smile.</p><p>\u201cHalf a mile up the road. And tell him Lynnette said hello.\u201d</p><p>Jeff smiled. \u201cWe absolutely will. Thanks a lot for the help.\u201d</p><p>Lynnette waved a little, and we walked outside again.</p><p>\u201cYou were tremendous,\u201d I said, stealing a glance at him. \u201cAnd a damn good actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grow up around sups,\u201d Jeff cryptically said, \u201cyou learn to finesse the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>According to the gospel of Lynnette, Seth Tate, former mayor of Chicago, was now Father Paul, and he worked at a food pantry in Portville, Indiana. Considering the havoc he\u2019d wreaked in Chicago, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was incredibly ironic or perfectly appropriate that he\u2019d apparently dedicated his life to service.</p><p>The food pantry was unmistakable, several large steel buildings up the road, a pretty green, leafed logo painted along one side of the largest. I parked Moneypenny in a visitor\u2019s spot and glanced at Jeff.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>We walked inside and found a pretty woman with curly hair at the front desk, typing on a computer keyboard. She looked up and smiled when we entered. \u201cHello. Can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cSorry to bother you, but we\u2019re looking for Father Paul. I understand I can find him here?\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, and she picked it up with one hand, pointed down the hallway with the other. \u201cHe\u2019s in the warehouse. Down the hall, to the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jeff said with a smile, punctuating his appreciation with a chipper tap on the counter as we walked down the hallway. It was a clean and happy place, the walls covered in children\u2019s drawings and signs for previous holiday canned-food drives. The hallway led directly into the warehouse, which was impressive.</p><p>The space was huge, with a polished concrete floor, and was filled with twenty-foot-tall shelves of food in boxes, some wrapped in cellophane to keep them together. Smiling employees and volunteers walked the aisles with clipboards and moved pallets with forklifts into trucks that waited in three open bays.</p><p>A man with a scruffy beard and plaid shirt walked up to us, befuddlement in his expression. \u201cAre you Laurie? The new volunteer? With a friend, maybe? We could use someone in the sorting room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. We\u2019re actually looking for Father Paul. The front desk said I could find him in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. He\u2019s in diapers.\u201d The man gestured toward the other end of the warehouse, and I stifled an immature laugh at his inadvertent joke.</p><p>The warehouse was chilly, cold air blowing in through the open bays. But the staff looked happy to be at work, buoyed, maybe, by the fact that they were helping others.</p><p>We did, indeed, find Seth Tate in diapers. But not literally.</p><p>He was tall and handsome, with blue eyes and wavy black hair. His hair was neatly trimmed, but a tidy black beard covered his face. If you hadn\u2019t known Seth Tate, hadn\u2019t been looking for him, you wouldn\u2019t have seen the resemblance. It helped the disguise that he also wore a neck-to-ankle black cassock, the type of garment worn by priests. Seth Tate was hiding in plain sight, only thirty miles from Chicago.</p><p>He had a box of newborn diapers in hand but glanced up suddenly and met my gaze. His eyes widened with pleasant surprise, which calmed my nerves a bit. I\u2019d been afraid he\u2019d see our arrival as an unpleasant reminder of what he\u2019d done in Chicago.</p><p>\u201cCould I have a minute?\u201d I whispered to Jeff.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be here\u201d\u2014he scanned the shelves\u2014\u201cin toilet paper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth put the box on a nearby table, and we walked toward each other, meeting in the middle. I could see he wanted to reach out, to greet me with an embrace, a kiss on the cheek, and a whispered \u201cHello, Ballerina,\u201d as he\u2019d greeted me as a teenager. I\u2019d been a dancer, and I\u2019d been photographed meeting Tate, a friend of my father\u2019s, in a tutu.</p><p>But he held himself back, stopping three feet away. He clasped his hands behind his back as if he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the temptation of human contact. Still, I caught the smells of lemon and sugar.</p><p>\u201cMerit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFather Paul,\u201d I said, with a knowing glance. \u201cYou\u2019re looking well.\u201d I gestured toward the rest of the warehouse. \u201cThis is an impressive operation.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his gaze scanning the shelves and boxes. \u201cIt is a temple to generosity. All of this is donated to those in need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been here long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I left Chicago. It\u2019s my current mission, I think.\u201d He tilted his head at me. \u201cAnd I think I\u2019m not the only one on a mission. What brings you here, Merit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mystery. And politics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said. He looked at me for a moment without even so much as a breath. \u201cPerhaps we should speak somewhere more private?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and Jeff and I both followed as he walked toward the door, the cassock\u2019s thick fabric swishing as he moved.</p><p>People offered greetings and shook his hand as they passed, apparently unaware of his history or the fact that he was an angel and could sprout wings large enough to carry us both out of the building.</p><p>We headed out into the chilly night and toward a picnic table that had seen better days, its wood faded and cracked.</p><p>Tate sat down on the bench, back to the table, skirt swirling as he moved. Jeff and I stood by, watching as Tate stared silently at the men and women coming from and going to the warehouse\u2019s busy shipping bays.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Merit?\u201d</p> <p>I gave him Regan\u2019s history, detailed the kidnappings and attacks, explained that we\u2019d yet to find her and were risking a truce with the elves. And then I got to the point.</p><p>\u201cI chased her in Loring Park. She smelled like sulfur and smoke.\u201d</p><p>His expression stayed the same, but I saw the tiny hitch in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has power\u2014a lot of it. She\u2019s not a sorceress. And she smells like Dominic did. We thought no other twins had separated when the Maleficium was destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t. Or shouldn\u2019t have. I was the only one touching it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a chance you have children?\u201d</p><p>His eyes went wide. \u201cDo I have children who are kidnapping supernaturals, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Irritation was beginning to rise. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to you because we need help. Because you\u2019re the expert in this area. That\u2019s not an insult\u2014it\u2019s a magical fact. You know more about Messengers\u2014fallen or otherwise\u2014than anyone else we know. We need you.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, rubbed his temples. And then he looked at me, apology in his eyes, and I felt lost. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Merit. But I truly don\u2019t know anything that could help.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jeff, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cIn that case, maybe there\u2019s something else you can help with. Long story short, Mayor Kowalcyzk\u2019s off her rocker. She\u2019s arrested Ethan for a death he committed in self-defense, beaten Scott, raided Navarre, and put together a goon squad because she thinks we\u2019re domestic terrorists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want me to do about that?\u201d</p><p>I bit back cross words. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Can you talk to her? Explain to her that supernaturals aren\u2019t her enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t listen to me, Merit.\u201d</p><p>I felt hope draining. \u201cYou know that for a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFact enough. She thinks I\u2019m a felon. And even if she listened to me, she doesn\u2019t appear that willing to use reason or logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking you to try.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, worrying the inside of his cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t return to that life, Merit. Not when there\u2019s so much to do here. So much good I could do. So much good I am doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s good to be done everywhere,\u201d I said. \u201cBut the good in Chicago is the kind only you can do. I don\u2019t know where else to turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago isn\u2019t my home anymore. It is lovely to see you, though. Would you like to stay? Work for a while? I think you\u2019ll find it feeds the soul.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, mystified by the naive cheer in his voice. He couldn\u2019t have missed the panic and fear in mine.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my town,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t really yours.\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped back to mine, and I saw the spark in his cold blue eyes. He wasn\u2019t unaware of my panic.</p><p>He was in denial.</p><p>\u201cChicago is troubled,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect. But it moves forward, and it fights. Its people and its vampires fight.\u201d</p><p>He made a sarcastic sound. \u201cFor what? There will always be another monster around the corner, Merit. And I know. I was one of them. People will always be afraid of the monster. And that fear will win every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourage has nothing to do with winning,\u201d I quietly said. \u201cCourage is about fighting the good fight. Stepping forward, even when stepping forward is the crappiest of all possible options.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jeff, saw the appreciation in his eyes, and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me a long time to understand that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I do now.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the people who moved behind us, hauling pallets, reviewing clipboards, and preparing shipments.</p><p>I looked back at Tate, the furrow of his brow as he looked at them, and the distance that I saw there. He wanted to be part of what they were\u2014of lives that were simpler than his own. I understood that perspective; I\u2019d shared it for some of my nights as a vampire. But like me, he knew it wasn\u2019t to be. He just wasn\u2019t ready to admit it yet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge anyone their recovery,\u201d I said, thinking of Mallory. \u201cBut there\u2019s something to be said for redemption. And right now, you have a perfect opportunity.\u201d</p><p>I kept my gaze on his, hoping against hope that he\u2019d change his mind, spring up, go with us back to Chicago.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t speak a word, and my chest tightened with fear and frustration.</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind, you know where to reach me.\u201d I turned my back on him, began to walk with Jeff toward the parking lot again.</p><p>\u201cMerit,\u201d Tate said, filling me with hope.</p><p>But when I looked back, there was nothing but regret in his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The apology made me feel even worse.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I didn\u2019t text the House that I\u2019d been unsuccessful. I wasn\u2019t ready to admit how utterly useless our trip had been or how resistant Tate had been to helping us. I wasn\u2019t ready to face the degree of his denial about how he\u2019d shaped the city, helping make it what it was today, for better or worse.</p><p>Of course, I still hoped he\u2019d come to his senses and appear outside Cadogan House, holding a radio above his head, contrition in his eyes and stern words for Diane Kowalcyzk on his lips.</p><p>Unfortunately, and much to Luc\u2019s chagrin, life wasn\u2019t a movie, and Seth Tate wasn\u2019t interested in our concerns. I empathized with him. It was undoubtedly easier to make good for your past bad acts in a tidy, cheery warehouse miles away from the mess you\u2019d made, than on the ground in Chicago and in the middle of the trouble. In Chicago, he was the defrocked mayor, the man with the nasty past. In Portville, he was Father Paul. A man with a mission to help others.</p><p>Maybe that was what irritated me most\u2014that he\u2019d gotten a clean slate, free and clear. Tate hadn\u2019t stayed in Chicago to face the consequences, to tell his tale, or to pick up the pieces. I had to give Mallory props for sticking around, fessing up, and trying to make it right.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d Jeff asked as I focused on the road ahead of us, which was marked by billboards for outlet malls, chiropractors, attorneys.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s making me irritable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I had some advice to offer,\u201d he said, glancing out the window. \u201cOr some strings to pull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>My phone beeped. I was a careful driver, so at my nod, Jeff checked the screen.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEthan\u2019s free?\u201d It was easy to tell what was on my mind.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, because there are a hundred supernaturals picketing in front of the Daley Center demanding his release.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>OCCUPY CHICAGO</p><p>I dropped Jeff off at his car and raced back to Cadogan House. Car keys still in hand, I joined Malik, Luc, and a dozen other Cadogan vampires in the front parlor, where the television had been tuned again to the drama at the Daley Center.</p><p>In the time it had taken me to get back to the House, the crowd of protestors had grown to several hundred, many of them carrying FREE ETHAN! and SUPERNATURAL JUSTICE signs. I didn\u2019t see anyone I recognized, but most were bundled up against the frigid night air.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d Luc asked, when I sidled next to him in the crowd of vampires whose gazes were trained on the screen.</p><p>\u201cIn finding him, yes. In convincing him to talk to the mayor, no. He\u2019s started a new life, and he wants to stay that course. He\u2019s working at a food bank. Noble work, but not exactly helpful here. Any news from Andrew?\u201d</p><p>The question made his brow furrow, which made my stomach turn uncomfortably. Luc was usually unflappable. If he was concerned now, we had problems.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t released Ethan, and they haven\u2019t allowed Andrew to speak with him. He hasn\u2019t had blood since he arrived. Just water. They\u2019re saying they think blood will turn him into some kind of supervampire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d It was also worrisome. A blood deficit would weaken him, and eventually that need would drive him to find blood wherever\u2014and however\u2014he could.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bureaucracy. And never mind that you can buy Blood4You at every supermarket in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the feds? Andrew thought he might have some luck there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve declined on jurisdictional grounds,\u201d he mockingly said. \u201cThey\u2019ll send in troops if there\u2019s a \u2018legit\u2019 threat to public safety, but they don\u2019t feel that\u2019s happened yet.\u201d He turned back to the screen. \u201cThat might change, now that Ethan\u2019s fan club has taken the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee anyone you know?\u201d I asked Luc, who squinted at the screen.</p><p>\u201cNot that I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure. Rogue vampires seem like the best bet, but we haven\u2019t heard anything from Noah suggesting this was going on or asking us to participate.\u201d</p> <p>Noah was the unofficial leader of Chicago\u2019s Rogue vampires. \u201cAnd are we participating?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>Before he could answer, a crowd of vampires in jeans and parkas tromped down the stairs and paused in the foyer, checking in on us. I recognized the ringleader, a sable-haired vampire named Christine, whose father was a famous Chicago criminal defense attorney. Not Ethan\u2019s attorney, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to learn they\u2019d been in contact.</p><p>She pulled down the hood, revealing sharp cheekbones, sharper eyes, and a lovely face. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the protest,\u201d she said, meeting Malik\u2019s gaze. He stood on the other side of the arc of vampires in the parlor and watched her mildly.</p><p>\u201cSpeak now or forever hold your peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you do on your time, including supporting our woebegone Master, is your business. But don\u2019t get yourselves arrested.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, nodded. \u201cLiege,\u201d she said, and her troops left the House.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t make more trouble,\u201d I murmured. Christine had always been the boisterous sort.</p><p>\u201cThey want to support their Master,\u201d Luc said, \u201cand unlike you, they don\u2019t get many chances to do it.\u201d</p><p>He had a point there. How many times had I had the opportunity to wield steel for Ethan and the House? Too many, by my count.</p><p>\u201cIt warms the cockles of my heart to see all those sups stepping out in support of our Master. And probably some of that support is legit, and not just because they want to sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>I goggled, stared at him. \u201cThey what?\u201d</p><p>Luc snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s not my type, but there are plenty of folks out there who appreciate your vampire boyfriend for more than his strategic mind.\u201d He tapped a finger against his temple.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cAnd where is this coming from?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the screen and the gaggle of teenage girls who grinned and smiled at the camera, holding signs bearing glittery hearts and professions of love for one Ethan Sullivan. The girls, who had pink cheeks and infatuated smiles, couldn\u2019t have been more than fourteen or fifteen.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are their parents?\u201d I murmured, thinking I wasn\u2019t thrilled that my \u201cvampire boyfriend\u201d had a fan club.</p><p>On the other hand, they had excellent taste.</p><p>\u201cAnything new on the carnival?\u201d I asked him, lest we forget about the other supernaturals potentially in danger.</p><p>\u201cActually, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe librarian found one more location\u2014Paul Revere Park. Carnival was there last year. But it\u2019s empty again. They appear to be laying low.\u201d</p><p>Which meant we had no other leads on where Regan, the carnival, or the missing sups might actually be\u2014assuming our theory was correct and they were still alive. It was beginning to look like we\u2019d have to wait for them to make a move, which didn\u2019t thrill me. A harpy attack in the woods beside Loring Park was one thing; a harpy attack at Soldier Field would be something altogether different.</p><p>My phone beeped, a message from Jonah. NEED BODIES AT PROTEST. WEARING MIDNIGHT HIGH SHIRT?</p><p>It was an RG assignment, signaled by the reference to the Midnight High School T-shirt. The school was fake, but the T-shirts were real, worn by RG members to secretly signal their membership.</p><p>I glanced at Luc and the others. I could get away, but I was going to have to explain to him why I was leaving and where I was going. The odds I\u2019d end up arrested or on television by the end of the night were too high otherwise.</p><p>I tucked the phone away again, leaned toward Luc. \u201cCan I talk to you outside for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Luc\u2019s brows lifted, but he nodded and followed me to the foyer.</p><p>We stopped in a quiet spot beyond the staircase, where he crossed his arms, looked down at me with chin tipped down. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>I moistened my lips nervously. \u201cI have to go to the protest. For reasons I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss. But I didn\u2019t want to sneak out of here without telling you I was leaving.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, then leaned closer. \u201cThis have something to do with that secret project Ethan has you working on?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, closed it again. I wasn\u2019t working with Ethan on a secret project, at least to my knowledge. I was only aware of two real secrets: Lakshmi\u2019s GP challenge invitation, and my RG membership. Maybe Ethan had prepared Luc for the inevitable fallout of one or both of those things.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I offered.</p><p>That must have been the right answer, because he nodded. \u201cBe careful, and keep your phone on.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I messaged Jonah, arranging a meeting place, a spot two blocks north of the Daley Center, where we could find each other before we reached the chaos of the plaza and protestors.</p><p>Even from two blocks away, the sound was deafening. Much like during the human riots that had plagued the city last week, there were chants of protest, supernaturals demanding Ethan\u2019s release, demanding rights for the city\u2019s preternatural population. And like the humans, they weren\u2019t especially subtle about what they\u2019d do if their demands weren\u2019t met. \u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d was a common refrain.</p><p>But unlike the human demonstrations, this protest carried the signature sensation of magic. A lot of it\u2014chaotic and unfocused, like eddies of water swirling in the rapids of a rocky stream.</p><p>Jonah rounded the corner, walked toward me. There was no denying it: The Grey House guard captain was a looker.</p><p>Tall and trim, with shoulder-length auburn hair that framed clear blue eyes. He\u2019d gotten his fangs in Kansas City, but he looked more like a warrior from a windswept cliff in Ireland, with his honed cheekbones and chiseled chin. Tonight he wore jeans and a navy pea coat, which only added to the effect. I half expected him to speak with a lilting accent but probably would have enjoyed it too much if he had.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, a little shyly. I hadn\u2019t seen Jonah in a few days, and I spent so much time dealing with drama on behalf of Cadogan House that I didn\u2019t have much time to serve as his partner in the RG.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s the House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous. They don\u2019t like Ethan being out of reach. How\u2019s Scott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Pissed. There are a few Grey House vamps out there tonight. He didn\u2019t want them to come but didn\u2019t bar them outright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto at Cadogan.\u201d</p><p>Jonah nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get moving.\u201d</p><p>We walked down the street and toward the plaza, each step bringing us closer to the noise and magic.</p><p>\u201cWho organized this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWord of mouth, I assume.\u201d</p><p>It was a completely rational assumption, but that didn\u2019t make me feel any better about walking into it.</p><p>\u201cPlan?\u201d I asked him, now forced to raise my voice to account for the noise.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re monitoring. We\u2019re here as peacekeepers, and we\u2019ll stay on the perimeter. Help anyone who looks like they\u2019re in trouble, or help disperse the crowd if things get dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d left my katana in the car\u2014all the better to keep the CPD from harassing me about it\u2014but the dagger was tucked into my boot. It was the only weapon I\u2019d have if things got ugly. On the other hand, if things got ugly here, even a sword might not have helped.</p><p>Daley Plaza was open on three sides, bounded by Clark, Dear- born, and Washington streets and the Daley Center. It was a large expanse of concrete, punctuated by an insectlike metal Picasso sculpture reaching fifty feet into the air and a square fountain currently closed for the winter.</p><p>The plaza was packed with people, the crowd thick and heavy like deep water, so that each person was leaned or shoved into his or her neighbors, sending the wave forward.</p><p>Cops in black gear were visible on the edges, as were a few journalists with video cameras on their shoulders, and a few vampires standing in pairs outside the main crush. RG members, I thought, trying to keep the city\u2019s supernaturals safe.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of people here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere are. And a lot of magic.\u201d It was rising and falling like the movement of a symphony, raising uncomfortable prickles on my arms. \u201cItchy magic,\u201d I said, scratching absently at the back of one hand.</p><p>It occurred to me that I was probably within telepathic distance of Ethan, and I called out to him silently but could practically feel the words bouncing back to me. Too much magical interference, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk the perimeter,\u201d he said, and I nodded, fell into step beside him. The night was cold, but the crush of bodies in front of us worked like a furnace to push heat in our direction.</p><p>The crowd was diverse, from obviously smitten teenagers who grinned with excitement at the cause to vampires and shifters I didn\u2019t recognize, wearing bleak expressions and repeating their pleas for Ethan\u2019s relief over and over and over again.</p><p>\u201cYour man has a lot of support,\u201d Jonah said.</p><p>\u201cThe cause has support,\u201d I corrected, stopping short when two twentysomethings in coats and scarves bounded out of a cab and into the fray with neon posters demanding supernatural rights and Ethan\u2019s release. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how many of them know who Ethan is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe has fan sites, Merit.\u201d</p><p>I stopped, looked at him, and found a bemused expression on his face. \u201cHe does not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time you\u2019re online, look up EthanSullivanIsMyMaster-dot-net. It has fan fiction. You\u2019re not doing a very good job of keeping up with Ethan\u2019s many admirers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no such place, and there is no such fan fiction.\u201d</p><p>This time, he stopped and looked at me, his expression flat.</p><p>My mind whirled at the possibility of hordes of human women lusting over my very vampiric boyfriend. I decided I found it endearing, since I wasn\u2019t worried about his fidelity. Although my Internet research was clearly lacking. I made a mental note to catch up when I had some free time.</p><p>Still, the reminder of Ethan dimmed my mood. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll release him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his lifetime? Yes. Unfortunately, that lifetime may last an eternity.\u201d</p> <p>Not exactly the most inspiring of thoughts.</p><p>We passed a man and woman who wore Midnight High T-shirts beneath unbuttoned coats. The man was tall and gaunt, with pale skin and thick sideburns; the woman was petite, with dark skin and curls. He was Horace, a Civil War volunteer and member of the Red Guard. I hadn\u2019t yet learned her name.</p><p>Horace exchanged the slightest of nods with Jonah as we passed. An acknowledgment of our membership, our partnership, our vampiric fence around the plaza.</p><p>We edged around the perimeter and turned to the other side of the crowd just as a woman, petite and dark haired, walked up the sidewalk in a satin coat and four-inch platform shoes, a red dress visible beneath and a cloak of magic flowing around her.</p><p>She was barely five feet tall, but with each step, another man or woman in her vicinity trained their eyes on her, awestruck. Like all nymphs, she had the big-eyed beauty of an anime character.</p><p>I glanced at Jonah, saw the same glazed expression on his face.</p> <p>\u201cRiver nymph approaching,\u201d I warned, a little late. \u201cAlthough I forget which part of the river she controls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth Branch,\u201d he said, then cleared his throat. \u201cHer name\u2019s Cassie.\u201d</p><p>Cassie looked up, discovered us standing there, and rushed over in her platform heels, her coat swirling behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Chuck\u2019s granddaughter!\u201d she said as she batted her lashes. But when she looked at Jonah, her smile turned pouty. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jeff?\u201d</p><p>I winced sympathetically for Jonah and for any other man in Chicago who was not Jeff Christopher. Geek or not, he had a way with the nymphs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here tonight. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tears bloomed in her large eyes, and her lower lip quivered.</p><p>I did not have time for a nymph on a crying jag. \u201cJeff mentioned you,\u201d I said. \u201cJust last night. Said he thought you were terribly pretty.\u201d</p> <p>She clasped her hands together with obvious glee. \u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d I assured her, then glanced cautiously at the roaring crowd. I wasn\u2019t sure that was exactly River nymph territory. \u201cAre you here for the protest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cThere\u2019s a party tonight. I got a gorgeous invitation!\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have called it a party, but before I could protest, she launched forward and slipped into the crowd.</p><p>I glanced at Jonah. \u201cA \u2018gorgeous invitation\u2019? To a protest?\u201d</p><p>That sounded suspicious. And manipulative.</p><p>\u201cRegan?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>\u201cI think we should keep an eye on her,\u201d Jonah said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cStay close. If we get separated, meet at the fountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d he said, and I moved into the crowd.</p><p>Cassie was small, but the crowd parted to let her move forward, as if they were the river she controlled. I kept my gaze on her spot in the crowd as she moved deeper.</p><p>\u201cYou got her?\u201d Jonah yelled out behind me, the crowd growing thicker and tighter as we advanced, the decibels higher.</p><p>\u201cI see her!\u201d I yelled back, holding out my hand behind me so he might grab it and keep us connected in the crowd.</p><p>Our fingers brushed just as shoving erupted to my right side, elbows pointing into my back and hips. I pulled back my arm, keeping my gaze on the divot Cassie had made in the crowd, and pressed my feet into the asphalt, trying to gain purchase. But the shoving grew stronger.</p><p>My irritation began to rise.</p><p>I pushed in the direction I thought she\u2019d gone, panicking when I couldn\u2019t see the shine of her satin jacket or feel the bubble of magic around her.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I murmured, wincing as a foot stomped on mine. The crowd tightened, contracted like a heartbeat. I breathed out slowly through pursed lips as bodies snugged against me, magic and smells and sounds crowding me on all sides.</p><p>After a moment, the press of bodies moved in the other direction, freeing me up enough to stand on tiptoes, scan the crowd for Cassie.</p><p>I found her, ten or twelve feet away, her arm on a man\u2019s shoulder as she smiled and strained to see over the crowd.</p><p>I had only an instant of relief.</p><p>She turned around to look, her expression pained, as if she\u2019d been surprised. And her eyes, wide and innocent, went blank. I\u2019d seen those eyes before. The same dead expression, the absence of will. The harpies had worn it well.</p><p>Things were about to get very, very bad.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d I called out over the crowd. \u201cCassie! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn, but her eyes rolled back, and her head began to loll. And there, only feet away from her, was a girl in a red cape.</p><p>I swore, began pushing through the crowd. Regan had found a perfect spot to disappear another supernatural, and she was doing it right before my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d I screamed out, wedging my body in an effort to push through the crowd, but the people around me were wedged in tight and looked around in irritation as I used elbows and knees to shove through them.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d I pled, looking over the top of the crowd for her hair or the barker\u2019s, trying to trace where they\u2019d gone. \u201cStop! Stop those girls!\u201d</p><p>The man beside me threw out an arm, catching me in the stomach. I sucked in breath and swore out a curse that widened his eyes and had him moving back.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d I told him, and the sight of my silvered eyes had him raising his hands and giving me what little room he could.</p><p>I scanned the crowd but saw nothing. No dark hair, no nymph and captor sliding quickly through the crowd to make their getaway.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I yelled, loud enough that the people around me gave me nasty looks. I ignored them, just as they ignored my panic and pleas for assistance.</p><p>I needed higher ground, so I ran to the Picasso and scrambled up the incline that marked its base, then jumped onto the next ridge of metal, which put me just above the crowd. I surveyed the bodies, looking for Regan.</p><p>After a moment I found her, the cape\u2019s hood still lifted, slithering through the crowd, dragging the nymph behind her. They were headed toward Dearborn. If they got clear of the crowd or jumped in a cab, I\u2019d lose them. I didn\u2019t have time to find Jonah. I only had time to haul ass.</p><p>I jumped down, hit the ground in a crouch, and took off.</p><p>This ended tonight.</p><p>She got to the edge of the protestors before I did and slowed her jog to a walk, Cassie walking awkwardly behind her, her wrist in Regan\u2019s hand. To anyone paying attention, it would have looked like Cassie\u2019d had a little too much fun at the protest. But not many were paying attention. The crowd was growing, their calls for Ethan\u2019s release louder with each round.</p><p>I reached the perimeter just as she reached the street and took off to the north, toward the River. Appropriate location for a nymph, but not when the nymph was being dragged while under the influence of drugs or magic.</p><p>I spied a woman in a red T-shirt as I ran to the sidewalk and yelled, \u201cFind Jonah!\u201d as I passed her, hoping she was an RG member and actually knew who Jonah was.</p><p>Regan and Cassie were nearly a block ahead. They dodged the entrance to the Daley Center\u2019s underground parking lot and crossed the street, Cassie jogging along awkwardly behind.</p><p>\u201cRegan!\u201d I yelled out, dodging a speeding cab and the curses of the driver, who lowered his window to make sure I\u2019d heard them. \u201cStop right now!\u201d</p><p>She ignored the demand and darted across Dearborn, barely missing the front end of a CTA bus. She hopped the curb but lost her balance in the frozen mountain of ice on the other side and hit the ground, Cassie behind her.</p><p>Regan glanced behind, then took off, leaving Cassie in the snow.</p><p>I\u2019d gained half a block but stopped at Cassie\u2019s side, taking in her dilated pupils and vague expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, Merit!\u201d Jonah said, running across the street and signaling me onward. \u201cGo get the girl!\u201d</p><p>I took his word for it and took off. Regan kept running north, dodging people and disappearing into the shadows of an El track that covered Lake Street. I quickened my pace as she began to climb one of the vertical supports that kept the train tracks in the air.</p><p>She climbed clumsily, was five feet in the air when I reached her, jumped up, and grabbed her ankle. She kicked it off, catching me in the shoulder. I ignored the shot of pain and grabbed again.</p><p>Arms pinwheeling in the air, she fell, pushing me down behind her and landing on top of me with enough verve to leave me momentarily breathless.</p><p>She turned, began pummeling me with her fists. A train rushed by overhead, the roar blocking the dull thud of her fist against my breastbone, the crack of her knuckles against concrete when I dodged a second blow.</p><p>I reared back, pulled up my legs, and made contact with her abdomen. With a whoop of air, she fell backward, hit the ground, and skidded a few feet behind her.</p><p>I climbed to my feet, hobbled toward her, and reached down to pull back the cape\u2019s hood.</p><p>The girl who blinked back at me was definitely not Regan.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>REDEMPTION SONG</p><p>The girl also wasn\u2019t entirely in our plane of existence.</p><p>She sat on a chair we\u2019d placed in the middle of the Cadogan training room, completely unmoving. She was approximately Regan\u2019s height and build but had short, dark curls in place of Regan\u2019s shock of platinum hair. Her eyes were deeply brown, and at the moment, open and blank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t spoken at all, hadn\u2019t even acknowledged where we were or how we\u2019d gotten there. I\u2019d driven Moneypenny home; she\u2019d been in the back of Jonah\u2019s car.</p><p>Cassie had snapped out of her trance and was upstairs in the foyer, where Lindsey had volunteered to entertain her with fashion magazines while they awaited Jeff\u2019s calming presence.</p><p>The training room door opened, and Paige walked inside, her vibrantly red hair set off by jeans and a long-sleeved, pale blue shirt with a V-neck. Even in jeans, she had a smoldering sensuality, like a magical, rusty-haired version of Marilyn Monroe.</p> <p>Eyes mild, she surveyed the room, nodding at me and Luc before her gaze fell onto the girl. She stared at her for a moment, tilting her head at the girl with obvious fascination.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t spoken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d I said. \u201cNot the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she tried to grab a nymph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid grab her,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we grabbed her back before she could make it to wherever she was going.\u201d</p> <p>Paige dropped to one knee, looking into the girl\u2019s eyes, then leaned forward and sniffed delicately at the cape. Sniffing out magic wasn\u2019t unusual among sups; it had, actually, been the way Malik had first figured out Mallory\u2019s sorcery.</p><p>Her nose wrinkled and she jerked back, looked at me. \u201cSulfur, as we suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d I wondered.</p><p>\u201cNo, not this girl,\u201d Paige said. She took to her feet again, fisted her hands on her hips. \u201cIt\u2019s in the fabric. The girl\u2019s been ensorcelled, but I use that term loosely. This isn\u2019t Order magic. It\u2019s\u201d\u2014she frowned, pursed her lips\u2014\u201csomething else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you bring her out of whatever this is so we can ask her some questions?\u201d Luc asked.</p><p>\u201cI can certainly try.\u201d She glanced at us, wiggled her fingers. \u201cMove back, please. Behind me.\u201d</p> <p>We did as she directed without objection. I knew what magic sorcerers could make\u2014and the balls of light and fire that usually accompanied it\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to be downwind of it.</p><p>Paige stood, shimmied her hair from her shoulders, and looked down at the girl. \u201cOn three, you\u2019ll awaken. Refreshed, perhaps a bit confused, and ready to talk.\u201d She lifted curled fingers in front of the girl\u2019s face. \u201cOne, two, and three.\u201d Paige snapped her fingers.</p><p>Like she\u2019d flicked a switch, the girl looked up, around, and blinked back confusion.</p><p>\u201cThat was it?\u201d I asked, not disappointed exactly, but certainly surprised by the lack of flash and magic.</p><p>\u201cRecall,\u201d Paige patiently said, \u201cthat you don\u2019t see everything. Every sorcerer has their own style. In situations like this, I try to keep the physical manifestations as mild as possible. She\u2019ll remember what she saw; it\u2019ll be better for her if it wasn\u2019t traumatic.\u201d</p><p>The girl focused glazed eyes on Paige, then us. There was fear in her eyes; if she\u2019d had a run-in with Regan, I didn\u2019t find that surprising. On the other hand, she could be an accomplice. Just as guilty, but a very good actor.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>She swallowed thickly, nodded, her eyes still darting around the room, hesitating as she took in the antique weapons that hung on the walls. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. It wasn\u2019t me. It was her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hold on,\u201d Paige said, voice smooth and calm like a supernatural therapist. \u201cOne step at a time. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Harley. Harley Cutler. Harley Elizabeth Cutler.\u201d With each repetition of her name, her focus became sharper. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in Chicago, with vampires. Allies,\u201d Paige said, lest she not think better of us. \u201cYou\u2019re at Cadogan House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan,\u201d she said, glancing nervously around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Regan?\u201d</p><p>Luc stepped forward, crouched in front of her. \u201cWe were hoping you could tell us that. Do you remember what happened tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember?\u201d She looked down at her body, her clothes, seemed to realize she was wearing the cape. She began clawing at it, peeling it off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Regan\u2019s,\u201d she said, voice suddenly frantic. \u201cThis is Regan\u2019s.\u201d She managed to get it off, threw it to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Harley looked up at me, and the fear in her eyes transmuted to anger. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Recognition dawned in her eyes. \u201cYou chased me\u2014at the plaza. You saw me grab the girl, and you chased me down the street.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat was me. You were going to take her back to Regan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because I wanted to!\u201d Her eyes went frantic, scanning each of us as if she had to prove to us she was innocent. I\u2019d seen her eyes; I believed her.</p><p>\u201cShe set it up,\u201d Harley insisted. \u201cMade me wear the cape. Said you\u2019d seen her in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she want to make you look like her?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to get caught. She didn\u2019t think you\u2019d consider the plaza a target. But just in case . . .\u201d</p><p>Regan had been right. We hadn\u2019t considered it a target until we\u2019d seen that damn Little Red Riding Hood getup. But it fit her MO\u2014create a chaotic, magical situation and use it as a distraction to lure out a sup.</p><p>\u201cThe protesters weren\u2019t real,\u201d Harley said. \u201cNot all of them, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey certainly looked real,\u201d Jonah said, glancing at me. \u201cThe magic felt real.\u201d</p><p>He was right, but he hadn\u2019t seen the harpies. Didn\u2019t know the extent of Regan\u2019s ability to mold magic.</p><p>\u201cThe magic was real,\u201d I said, getting a nod from Harley. \u201cBut the bodies were magic. Solidified magic, but still magic.\u201d I turned back to Luc and Jonah. \u201cThere were at least three hundred sups at the Daley Center, all makes and models. Getting sups to do anything together is like herding cats, and suddenly hundreds of them show up at the Daley Center?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were like the harpies,\u201d Harley confirmed. \u201cShe knew she only needed to seed the plaza\u2014get enough fake bodies in there to make it seem like a real protest, and folks would join in.\u201d</p><p>And they had, I thought. Vampires. Nymphs. Even human teenagers.</p><p>\u201cYou were one of her victims?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a sylph. And a waitress\u2014I was a waitress\u2014in Madison. Most sylphs stick to their trees, but I was curious. Wanted something more, you know? I went to college, which nobody did, got a crappy job. Tried to save up some money. My parents haven\u2019t talked to me in a really long time. Because I was trying to pass.\u201d</p><p>Pass as human, she meant. Pretending to be human instead of a supernatural. If she\u2019d been separated from her family, it would have been that much easier for Regan to take her without commotion.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been kidnapping supernatural creatures? Keeping them together?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Harley nodded. \u201cShe calls it the collection. I was part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has an elf and a shifter now?\u201d</p><p>Harley nodded. \u201cYeah. They\u2019re new.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded me\u2014not that Regan had taken Niera and Aline, but that we\u2019d confirmed their kidnapper. One step closer to solving our elven problem.</p><p>\u201cWe were with the Pack when the harpies attacked,\u201d I explained. \u201cAnd the elves kidnapped us, thinking we\u2019d hurt them. We learned about Regan after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley, where\u2019s the carnival?\u201d Luc asked.</p><p>\u201cHumboldt Park. But that\u2019s not where she keeps the collection\u2014always somewhere else. It would be too easy for the regular humans to find otherwise. And she doesn\u2019t want the regular humans to find it. That\u2019s what she calls them\u2014the regular humans. She only caters to the fancy ones. Good names, old money.\u201d</p><p>Guess that ruled out using my father to help find her. His money was substantial but new. Likely too gauche for Regan.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she says. She has a network\u2014people that come to see the collection year after year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where will we find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I never know. It\u2019s two train cars\u2014big ones. The carnival travels by train, and then semis pick up the cars and transport them to the locations. We stay in the cars. And even when we\u2019re allowed out, we don\u2019t get to go far. We never know precisely where we are unless we happen to see a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the supernaturals are in two cars?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Harley nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re not much more than cages. She keeps them sedated with magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many supernaturals does she have?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cRight now? I think eighteen,\u201d she said, eliciting a low whistle from Luc. \u201cThe nymph would have been nineteen.\u201d Harley smiled nervously. \u201cShe was really excited about getting closer to twenty. She thinks it\u2019s a milestone.\u201d</p><p>For a woman who collected supernaturals, twenty would have been a nice, big number. Unfortunately, it was nearly twenty kidnappings in the span of three years, of supernaturals whose friends, lovers, and parents still had no answers.</p><p>\u201cWe can help you get back to your tree, your family,\u201d Luc said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do. But we\u2019d appreciate any help you can give us to find the rest of them, so we can reunite them with their families, as well.\u201d</p><p>Harley nodded, her eyes filling with tears, which she knuckled away. \u201cI\u2019ll help however I can. I would like to see my mom and dad. I don\u2019t know if they missed me, but . . .\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, and I put a hand on her arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure they missed you and will be thrilled to know that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we move to the Ops Room?\u201d Luc asked, apparently no longer believing Harley a threat. \u201cWe can get comfortable, maybe get you something to eat?\u201d</p><p>Harley nodded shyly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Luc said with a nod. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what else we can figure out about where Regan might be. I\u2019m going to just check in with Malik. Merit, you want to get her settled?\u201d</p><p>Harley stood, glancing around the room. \u201cWhat is this place? Like, some kind of vampire fraternity house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you only knew,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>According to Harley Cutler, the cars used to transport and hold the supernaturals were long and silver, like old-fashioned trains or Airstream trailers. The edges were round, the surfaces shiny and reflective. Unfortunately, they did not have KIDNAPPER or ILLEGAL SUP COLLECTION screened atop them in screaming red paint that would have made them visible from the ground.</p><p>Still, as Harley ate a sandwich from a tray Margot had pulled together, we passed the information along to Jeff, who\u2019d popped down after calming Cassie and helping her get situated at her home along the River.</p><p>\u201cI can check yesterday\u2019s satellite images of the city,\u201d Jeff said, \u201cbut a silver train car\u2019s not exactly going to stand out. It could take time\u2014if we\u2019re able to find it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you can,\u201d Luc said, then glanced at Harley, who stuffed Cheetos into her mouth like she hadn\u2019t eaten in a month.</p><p>She covered her mouth as she chewed. \u201cShe fed us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut organic stuff. Gave us lunch boxes like we were kids. I miss Cheetos.\u201d</p> <p>I imagined I\u2019d have felt the same.</p><p>\u201cAssuming we do find her,\u201d Luc said. \u201cAnd speaking of which\u2014and I apologize for interrupting your meal, Harley\u2014but can you tell us anything else about Regan that might help us find her? Where she\u2019s from? Her last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harley said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her name. She just went by Regan. And I didn\u2019t know her history. One of the other sups told me Regan\u2019s mother was dead, and she didn\u2019t know her dad. But she had this sense, you know, that she knew she was special. That she had a lot to share.\u201d Harley shook her head nervously. \u201cSorry, that probably doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very helpful. Please\u2014keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well.\u201d Harley pushed a tight curl behind her ear. \u201cShe had some insecurities, I think. Issues about the fact that her dad left. I mean, she didn\u2019t talk about that stuff with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made all the magic?\u201d</p> <p>Harley nodded, crossing her arms, more comfortable now. \u201cDid it all herself. Not with us\u2014she has a separate place where she stays, sleeps. Most of the carnies just stayed in cheap hotels, but that wasn\u2019t for her.\u201d She nodded again, leaning forward. \u201cShe thought of us as family. And I think the collection was a family for her. A way to say, \u2018Look at this amazing thing I built, this family I made from scratch. Look at me, world.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Luc nodded, put a hand on Harley\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s very helpful. We appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, but her eyes clouded again. \u201cI guess I should think about going home or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay here for a day or two if you\u2019d like to get settled,\u201d Luc said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already gotten permission from the boss. Or we can get you back to Wisconsin now.\u201d</p><p>Harley considered, looked up at us. \u201cI think I want to go home. How many chances do you get to start over, right?\u201d</p><p>That, I thought, depended entirely on whether you were a vampire.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Jonah, Luc, and I stepped into the hallway, where Luc closed the door behind us, looked at me.</p> <p>\u201cGo to Humboldt Park. Check it out, just in case. Could be Harley\u2019s right, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing there relating to the collection. But I don\u2019t get the sense Regan trusted her quarry with the details, so you might find something Harley doesn\u2019t even know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we might find Regan,\u201d I said. \u201cShe was a barker at the first carnival. Pimping the Tunnel of Horrors.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Jonah. \u201cYou got time for a ride along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Scott clears it, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magic that Mallory used to find Tate,\u201d Luc said. \u201cWe have Regan\u2019s cape. Can\u2019t we go that route again?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that specific. It got us to a city, but not an address. We still had to find him on our own.\u201d And in a city as big as Chicago, that was going to take time, even with satellite images and a description.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the protest?\u201d I asked Luc.</p><p>Luc nodded. \u201cCatcher\u2019s keeping an eye on it. He still has your grandfather\u2019s contacts at the CPD, and they\u2019ve reached out to him for advice on the sup angle. Fortunately, the CPD still has domain outside the halls of the Daley Center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ethan?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cAndrew\u2019s calling with updates. He\u2019s got a libel and slander complaint against the city ready for filing based on the public enemy list. He\u2019s just waiting for Scott\u2019s lawyers to look it over. No word from Morgan, of course, but that\u2019s not unusual. He prefers to ignore problems while we deal with them.</p><p>\u201cStill no word on a release time, but Andrew says they let him visit Ethan a couple of hours ago. He\u2019s looking worse for wear\u2014the terrorism hounds are apparently using this unique opportunity to test the boundaries of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d</p><p>Since that one, I remembered from a lone history class in college, involved cruel and unusual punishment, it didn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>I braced myself. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruising, broken cheekbone. The goons believe they\u2019re saving the world. In many cases, they might be correct. But not in this one.\u201d Luc patted my arm. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if anything happens. Go check out the park. We take this one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Humboldt Park was a large, slightly L-shaped expanse of grass, trees, walking paths, and baseball fields between the Humboldt Park and Ukrainian Village neighborhoods. The grass was still covered with snow, except in the bottom corner of the park, where Jack Frost\u2019s Winter Wonderland had set up shop. Regan had changed the name again, but the rest of the carnival looked and smelled the same.</p><p>Jonah parked along the street. \u201cKatana?\u201d he asked as we climbed out of the car and over the hillock of snow that still marked the curb.</p><p>\u201cI think not tonight. Too suspicious. I have a dagger. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. Plus a couple of extra toys.\u201d</p><p>It was generally considered d\u00e9class\u00e9 for vampires to carry concealed weapons. The katana, roughly three feet of honed steel, was difficult to hide, which made its use more honorable among the vamps who actually cared about such things. I understood the sensibility, but in twenty-first-century Chicago, one needed to be a little more practical.</p><p>\u201cAnd what toys are those?\u201d I wondered, stuffing my hands into my jacket pockets to protect against the chill, as we walked toward the carnival entrance.</p><p>\u201cShuriken,\u201d he said. \u201cNinja stars, in American parlance.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSure. I look forward to seeing those in action.\u201d It was late, and there weren\u2019t many humans around. But the occasional couple wandered past us, so this probably wasn\u2019t the best time for shuriken.</p><p>We walked inside, started at the midway. We could buy tickets for the ring toss, duck shoot, baseball throw, or water gun game, or funnel cakes with any number of toppings.</p><p>My stomach began to growl. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d eaten.</p><p>\u201cNeed dinner?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cNot from here.\u201d And not now, when there was a chance we\u2019d end up pushing and shoving an unidentified sup around. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t object to a drive-through on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted. Hey,\u201d he said, brightening as he saw the pirate- ship ride, the boat swinging back and forth while a few brave humans raised their arms victoriously. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to ride one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed a ticket?\u201d I slyly asked.</p><p>Jonah humphed, and while he watched the ride\u2019s pendulum motion, I checked out the man working the controls. Thin, dark skin, bored expression. Human, with a giant wad of gum in his mouth. Not obviously a part of any magical scheme, which meant we needed to move on.</p><p>Regan, not surprisingly, was nowhere in sight. She\u2019d probably have known by now that Harley wasn\u2019t coming back, and she\u2019d lost her nymph. The rest of the ride and game operators were human, and there was no other scent or feel of magic in the air.</p><p>We made a full circle around the block and were about to start a second pass, when I caught a pop of red through the trees.</p><p>\u201cJonah,\u201d I said, stepping off the path and onto the snow beyond it. He stepped beside me, peered into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I pulled the dagger from my boot and, when I caught the glint of silver in his hand, moved forward.</p><p>It sat beneath the bare and stretching branches of an ancient tree, a wooden wagon atop large wooden wheels. The wheels, spokes radiating from a center hub, were probably three feet across. The wagon itself was a long, rectangular base with a tall, rounded top, nearly circular, painted vibrantly red. The back end had two small windows, covered by curtains, with a short, narrow door between. A yellow scalloped ladder ran down to the ground. There wasn\u2019t a single sign of life.</p><p>I\u2019d seen pictures of tinkers and travelers, of families who lived in wagons outside the strictures of normal society. This was nearly too picture-perfect to seem real.</p><p>\u201cA vardo,\u201d Jonah quietly said.</p><p>I glanced over at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA traveling wagon. Often used by the Romani in Europe. Not often seen in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, dropping the defenses that kept my sensitive vampire senses from overwhelming me, and listened for any sign of life. I heard nothing, felt nothing, magical or otherwise.</p><p>I opened my eyes again, glanced at him. His eyes were focused on the wagon, gaze intense. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Jonah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I climbed the short wooden staircase, which squeaked beneath my feet, and peeked inside. It was dark and silent, with no sign of life. I tried the doorknob, found it unlocked, and glanced back at Jonah, ensuring he was ready.</p> <p>When he nodded, I pushed it open.</p><p>Light spilled into the small space from the open door behind us. It was a single room, cozy and luxurious, with a small velvet settee and blankets and rugs on nearly every surface. Candles were scattered here and there, and a wooden trunk with brass strapping sat in front of the settee like a coffee table.</p><p>There was a hanging bar of clothes in one corner, and I recognized the ensemble I\u2019d seen in Loring Park. The tiny hat she\u2019d worn hung atop a small antique bureau topped by an oval mirror. Pots and bottles of makeup littered the surface.</p><p>And under it all were the scents of smoke and sulfur.</p><p>\u201cShe lives here,\u201d I said, and Jonah nodded his agreement. \u201cHarley said she stayed in her own place. Although it\u2019s odd that she doesn\u2019t stay with the collection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe she goes back and forth,\u201d Jonah suggested. \u201cStays here when the carnival\u2019s open, goes there when it\u2019s closed. This gives her an office, a home base.</p><p>\u201cPapers,\u201d he said, moving toward a small folding table with X-shaped legs on the other side of the room. Two neat stacks of paper sat atop it.</p><p>While he checked out the table, I moved farther inside, running delicate fingers over the knickknacks and trinkets. A small Limoges box in the shape of a Scottish terrier. Foreign coins. And atop the trunk, inside a beautiful gilt frame, a photograph of a woman. She had hauntingly pale eyes and curls in perfect, thick spirals that framed her pretty face. MOTHER was printed in gold script across the bottom corner of the frame.</p><p>\u201cRegan\u2019s mom?\u201d Jonah asked, stepping behind me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my phone, took a picture of the photo, sent it to Jeff with a request: PHOTO MAY BE REGAN\u2019S MOM. SCAN AND MATCH?</p> <p>ON IT, he immediately messaged back.</p><p>I figured I might as well take the opportunity to check on her whereabouts. We were already out and about, after all. ANY REGAN UPDATE?</p><p>CHICAGO IS BIG.</p><p>I took that as a mild rebuke and put my phone away again, then propped the picture on the trunk again. \u201cWhat about the papers? Anything there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just maintenance logs for the rides. She might have another agenda, but it looks like she takes care of the day-to-day stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something. I just hope she takes care of her sups.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Neither the wagon nor the carnival offered us anything more. While Jeff continued his search for Regan, her collection, and the woman in the photograph, we drove back to Cadogan House. Jonah, thankfully, made good on his promise of food, driving through a local burger joint and springing for a cheese-and-bacon-laden burger greasy enough to require a handful of napkins, and utterly delicious.</p> <p>We returned to Cadogan to find Harley gone, Luc, Lindsey, and the temps in the Ops Room.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Luc asked, looking up.</p><p>\u201cJust the photograph,\u201d I said, skipping the explanation since Jeff sat at the table beside him. I sat down, too, and Jonah took the seat beside me.</p><p>\u201cShe has a wagon,\u201d he said, \u201ca vardo, but she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other sign of magic or Regan. That\u2019s a dead end for now.\u201d I glanced at Jeff, who was busily scanning images on his tablet. \u201cAnything new on your end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in the city, or with the picture,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve found an image-comparison algorithm, and I\u2019ve applied it to satellite images of Chicago, but every reflective set of windows on a skyscraper looks like the top of a silver truck trailer. Ditto the photograph. But I\u2019m pushing it along. Moving as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as tired as Luc looked. It had been a long week, with political and supernatural drama, and it looked like we were all beginning to feel the fatigue.</p><p>My phone rang, and I pulled it out. The number was unfamiliar, although the caller had a Chicago area code.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ballerina.\u201d</p><p>I sat up so quickly the chair knocked the edge of the table. \u201cSeth. It\u2019s good to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>All eyes in the room turned to me. Luc gestured toward the speakerphone, but I shook my head. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what this would involve, and it seemed better to handle it quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about our conversation.\u201d</p><p>I was immortal, and a predator, and Sentinel of my House. And I still crossed my fingers under the table.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about Diane Kowalcyzk.\u201d</p><p>My heart began to thud against my chest. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recruited her, Merit. She was a young alderman, fit right into my team. She worked hard, put in a lot of long hours. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s taken the right path since then, but she was loyal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why are you defending her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I feel guilty for not coming clean earlier. It\u2019s occurring to me, a little late, that doing good deeds isn\u2019t going to be enough for me to wipe the slate clean. I still have a lot of baggage to unload.\u201d</p><p>I understood his need to confess, but I\u2019d latched on to the first thing he\u2019d said. I leaned forward, gestured for pen and paper. \u201cCome clean about what?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cDiane Kowalcyzk\u2019s real name is Tammy Morelli.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cThe mayor of Chicago has an alias?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does. And if you employ your tech-savvy friend, I believe you\u2019ll find plenty of information to provide leverage for you and the other sups to use.\u201d</p><p>I wrote down the name, slid it to Luc, who immediately handed it off to Jeff. But that didn\u2019t ease the greasy feeling in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cBlackmail\u2019s a little off-color for an angel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother with denial. \u201cIt is. And it\u2019s easy for me to stand on a pedestal and talk about doing the right thing. But sometimes doing the right thing means getting your hands dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruer words,\u201d I muttered, thinking of all the times I\u2019d fudged the truth to keep my people safe and happy, including recently. \u201cThank you, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ballerina. Oh, and about the girl\u2014I\u2019ve racked my brain, but I can\u2019t think of anything helpful. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It took me a moment to switch mental gears. \u201cActually, I have something specific for you there. Hold on\u2014I\u2019m going to send you a photograph.\u201d I forwarded the picture we\u2019d found in the vardo. \u201cDo you recognize the woman?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, long enough that my blood began to hum in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he finally said, his voice hoarse with emotion.</p><p>That hum turned to a full-on roar.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Annalissa Purdey. He met her years ago.\u201d</p><p>I scribbled that name, too, and passed it to Jeff. \u201cHe?\u201d I asked Seth.</p><p>\u201cDominic.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What do you mean he met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shared a body,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it at the time, of course. But looking back now, I realize there were times when he . . . when he was in control, with all his ego and self-righteousness. He was stronger at some moments than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was stronger with Annalissa Purdey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had a romance. It must have lasted five months, or perhaps six? I only vaguely remember. She was a young lawyer. A litigator. Smart. Bright. Very driven, and her ethics were, let\u2019s say, flexible.\u201d He chuckled mirthlessly. \u201cShe was right up his alley.</p><p>\u201cHe was driven by the attraction\u2014strengthened by it\u2014and he used that to push past me. It\u2019s been\u2014what\u2014nearly two decades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d put Regan at twenty-three or twenty-four, so, yeah, about two decades. You\u2019d have been so young.\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckled. \u201cWhen one is immortal, age is negotiable. But what does Annalissa Purdey have to do with the girl you\u2019re seeking?\u201d</p><p>I thought of the inscription on the photograph. \u201cWe think Annalissa Purdey is her mother.\u201d</p><p>He went stone silent, as did everyone else in the room. I could feel the weight of their stares, the tension as they waited for someone to voice the obvious implication.</p><p>\u201cRegan is . . . Annalissa\u2019s daughter?\u201d Seth asked. \u201cBut that means she\u2019s . . . Jesus,\u201d he said again, and I heard the shuffling of fabric. He was sitting down, I imagined, and deservedly so. I probably should have advised him to do that in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr Dominic\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Yes? I mean, we shared the body, but he was the one who had the affair. Is she his daughter? Is she my niece? I don\u2019t know. Does it even matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters if it helps us find her. And we need to find her, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I don\u2019t know how to help you do that.\u201d Frustration was clear in his voice. \u201cCan you find her mother? Trace her that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know if we find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have\u2014he had\u2014a daughter.\u201d This time, he sounded awed. \u201cIf you find her . . . ,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d I promised him. \u201cThank you for calling, Seth. It means a lot to us. To me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have given me a family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means a lot, too.\u201d</p><p>We ended the call, and I rubbed my hands over my face. \u201cI swear to God, the sups in this city could have their own reality show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex happens,\u201d Luc said. \u201cWith demons, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I glanced at Jeff, who was squinting at his tablet, tongue peeking from the right side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnnalissa Purdey is deceased,\u201d he said, sending a photograph of an obituary to the screen. The story used the photograph, MOTHER still engraved at the bottom. They must have borrowed Regan\u2019s picture.</p><p>Luc grabbed his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the librarian to look into her background. Maybe something will help us locate Regan.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, glanced at Jeff. \u201cTammy Morelli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTammy Morelli,\u201d he said, swiping the screen, \u201cis a con artist.\u201d Another photograph replaced Annalissa\u2019s, and the woman could hardly have been more different.</p><p>Tammy Morelli had a hard-bitten look. Her hair was permed, a curly halo around a face I didn\u2019t immediately recognize. Her nose was a little bit thicker, her chin a little bit smaller. But her eyes were the same.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Diane Kowalcyzk,\u201d I said. \u201cWho was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA grifter,\u201d Jeff said, tapping the tablet again and pulling up a series of newspaper articles. \u201cScam\u201d figured prominently in most of the titles.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears she had a fondness for art and insurance fraud,\u201d Jeff said.</p><p>Luc whistled, stretched back in his chair, and kicked his feet on the table. \u201cNow, that, my friends, is something I can work with.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We had a wish list, and now we had information to bargain with. It was time to use it.</p><p>With Ethan out of pocket and Malik in charge of the House, Luc was designated as the official House negotiator. He coordinated with Andrew and left for the Daley Center with the hope of reaching a deal with the mayor.</p><p>However unethical that deal would be.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t bother going back to the Ops Room. Jeff brought his screen upstairs, and vampires filled the rest of the parlors on the first floor to wait for news. Malik sat beside me on a couch, reading through a contract, one leg crossed over the other.</p><p>Lindsey paced the hallway, afraid Luc would get wrapped up in the city\u2019s political nonsense and he\u2019d suffer Ethan\u2019s fate.</p><p>One hour and thirteen minutes later, I received a message from Luc.</p><p>WE\u2019RE ON OUR WAY HOME.</p><p>I closed my eyes and breathed.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Everyone was excited. But most were smart enough to stay indoors and out of the cold, which sat heavy across the city.</p><p>I sat on the front stoop, my hands tucked between my knees to keep them a hairsbreadth from frostbite.</p> <p>A car door slammed, and my head popped up like an animal sensing her mate. Slowly, I rose from the step.</p><p>He strode through the gate as if in slow motion, golden hair streaked with blood, a fading purple bruise across his cheekbone. His jacket was off and fisted in his hand, and his eyes burned like fiery emeralds.</p><p>Sentinel, he silently said. You are a sight for sore eyes.</p><p>I ran like the hounds of hell were behind me, jumping into his arms and wrapping my arms and legs around him. Thank God, I said. Thank God. I said it to the universe, to him, for him.</p><p>He embraced me with bone-crushing strength, buried his head in my neck.</p><p>I fisted my hands in his hair, tears flowing over. Tears of relief, of love, of grief. Tears of gratitude that I\u2019d been granted yet another chance with him.</p><p>He\u2019d told me once he wasn\u2019t certain how many of his lives he\u2019d already given up, or how many he had yet to give. I didn\u2019t know, either, and didn\u2019t much care, as long as he still had one for me.</p><p>When clapping emerged from the front door, I dropped my legs and slid down his body, averting my eyes with embarrassment.</p><p>Ethan smiled, tucked a lock of hair behind my ear. \u201cI believe they were applauding you, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar,\u201d I said, dropping my hot cheek to his shirt. \u201cBut I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>Vampires came forward, embracing him, shaking his hand, and grinning with delight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be home,\u201d he told them. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll request those particular accommodations again.\u201d</p><p>There were good-natured chuckles from the vampires.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to sit. It\u2019s been a long night.\u201d</p><p>While Malik and Luc helped him inside, and the rest of the vampires followed, I pulled out my phone.</p><p>Ethan was home and safe, even though he\u2019d stepped into danger to protect others from violence he believed was his responsibility to bear. He\u2019d trusted his instincts and the skill of the people he\u2019d gathered around him. It was time to set him free, to let him fly and hope that he returned again.</p><p>I texted Lakshmi. HE\u2019S FREE AND HOME. HE SHOULD CONTROL OUR DESTINIES.</p><p>To the casual observer, the message would have read like I was asking her to do me a favor. But really, it was a receipt. An acknowledgment that Lakshmi had been correct, that Ethan was the right man for the job.</p><p>The rest of it was up to fate.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He made his rounds through the House, greeting his vampires, checking with Malik. By the time he found his way upstairs, I was in pajamas, in front of the fire, and his bruises were nearly healed. He closed the apartment door, placed his suit jacket across the back of a desk chair.</p><p>\u201cAnd here we are again, Sentinel.\u201d He walked forward, nearly stumbling with exhaustion, and grabbed the chair to steady himself.</p><p>I jumped to my feet. \u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d he quietly said, but he accepted the arm I put around his waist and let me guide him to the bed. He winced as he sat down, as if every part of his body was beaten and sore.</p><p>And from the look of it as I unfastened buttons and pulled the shirt from his shoulders, it was.</p><p>\u201cThey did a number on you,\u201d I quietly said, unsure whether I should be screaming or crying at the outrage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heal,\u201d Ethan said, gaze on me as I dropped his shirt to the floor, flipped off his shoes, and helped him unbuckle his pants. Under any other circumstances, his gaze would have been demure and seductive. But tonight, he looked exhausted.</p><p>I turned off the fire, flipped off the lights, and climbed into the cool sheets beside him. The pain be damned, he pulled me against his body.</p><p>\u201cThank you for rescuing me, Ballerina,\u201d Ethan drowsily said. \u201cAnd if he ever so much as lays a hand on you, I will break it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled against his chest, fell asleep to the sound of the slow and steady beating of his heart.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>THREE-RING CIRCUS</p><p>The sun fell, and my eyes snapped open. Ethan, golden and beautiful, stood beside his bureau, already dressed and pressing cuff links into place. He\u2019d showered and cleaned up and looked perfectly healthy.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Sullivan. Sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cAfter the last twenty-four hours, that was glorious enough.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my phone from the nightstand, hoping for a message or update from Jeff about Regan\u2019s position or the collection. But I found nothing.</p><p>\u201cThe kidnappings?\u201d Ethan asked, and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cLuc filled me in on the details last night. It was a good idea, calling Tate.\u201d</p><p>I felt a tingle of relief. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure you\u2019d see it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d hurt you, I\u2019d have killed him myself. Fortunately, all is well. And he has a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago has become a very unusual world now that you\u2019re in it, Merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it to become a smaller world. We still don\u2019t know where Regan is.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cKeep at it. You\u2019ll find her eventually, and when you do, I want to know about it. I\u2019d also like to address the House before everyone begins their days.\u201d</p><p>A bolt of nerves shot through me. Discussions in the ballroom meant serious matters. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future of the House,\u201d he cryptically said. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a salute and toddled to the shower.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I dressed in leathers and wore my katana, which made me the odd vampire out in Cadogan\u2019s lovely second-floor ballroom. Most everyone else wore their black standard-issue Cadogan suits, their new teardrop medals winking atop pale skin. Luc, who wore jeans, and Helen, who wore a pink tweed suit, were exceptions to the general rule. I moved to Luc, stood beside him and the rest of the guards.</p><p>The mood of the vampires who filled the room was nervous but excited. Those who\u2019d missed Ethan\u2019s arrival were obviously glad to see him back, and I could hear the whispers about how their Liege had fared in custody, and if he was as healthy now as he\u2019d been when he left.</p><p>Ethan stepped to the dais in the front of the room, Malik beside him. Thunderous applause filled the air. Ethan smiled, letting his gaze scan and catch the eyes of the Novitiates who stood before him.</p><p>Ethan allowed the applause to go on for a moment\u2014he still had his ego\u2014before lifting his hands. The room quieted instantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be home again,\u201d he said, which set off another round of hoots and applause.</p><p>\u201cThe city acted unfairly toward us, toward Grey House, toward Navarre. We have helped this city over the last few months with issues they were unable or unwilling to address, and they have done us no service by accusing us of wrongdoing.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cI can affirm, for better or worse, that they believe they are doing the right thing for Chicago. This is no political ploy or attempt to win votes. They, the mayor included, have been advised by many\u2014and wrongly\u2014that supernatural creatures are the enemy. Frankly, much of the trouble we\u2019ve seen in the last few months can be laid at the feet of supernaturals. That fact is undeniable. But we also are the solution. And the vast majority of us are trying to do right by the city that we love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to announce the mayor has agreed to begin peace talks with the city\u2019s supernaturals. The mayor also has agreed to engage Merit\u2019s grandfather once again as supernatural liaison on a probationary basis.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were happy cheers and several friendly pats on my back. I would, of course, have preferred my grandfather become a fan of daytime television instead of dealing with more supernatural drama. But he was who he was. And it wasn\u2019t my place to deny him that.</p><p>\u201cBut there is another issue we should discuss,\u201d he said. This time, my stomach curled into a tight knot.</p><p>\u201cLakshmi Rao has traveled to Chicago to meet with us as a representative of the Greenwich Presidium to set forth the GP\u2019s demand for retribution in the death of Harold Monmonth. As you may imagine, I don\u2019t believe their demands have any basis in reality. But the GP is what the GP is. We will hear her offer, and we will act accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me. \u201cThe world is changing. Our world is changing. We will do our best to meet the challenges we face with honor, with bravery, with respect for those around us. That,\u201d he said, looking across the sea of vampires again, \u201cis what makes us Cadogan vampires.\u201d He raised his fist into the air. \u201cTo Cadogan House!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Cadogan House!\u201d shouted his vampires in unison.</p><p>I loved Ethan Sullivan. Lusted for him, in many instances. But I respected him most of all. And just like my grandfather, he was who he was.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t my place to deny Ethan, either.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Ethan excused the House, and the vampires filed out the door, heading off to their jobs or assignments. Ethan and Malik lingered in the front of the room.</p><p>I glanced at Luc. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the Ops Room.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDo that, Sentinel. We\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>I walked toward Ethan, nodded at Malik as he clasped Ethan\u2019s hand, then filed out with the rest of the vampires.</p><p>He still stood on the dais, a foot above me, looking down with hands on his hips. \u201cHello, Sentinel. I recall we\u2019ve been in this position before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have. When you named me Sentinel.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped down, touched a finger to the medal at my neck. \u201cAnd much has passed since then.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, ignored my fear, and spilled out what was in my heart. \u201cWe need a change. Vampires need a change, solid leadership, and a new direction. You could provide all that. You should challenge Darius. Make the GP respectable again.\u201d</p><p>Shock and pleasure in his eyes, he stepped forward, wrapped his arms around me, and pressed his lips to my forehead. \u201cThere is much to be gained. And much to be lost.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounded with sudden fear that he\u2019d included me in the latter category.</p><p>\u201cThe future of the House is uncertain,\u201d Ethan said, but he didn\u2019t seem worried. He kissed me again. \u201cFor now, Sentinel, get down to the Ops Room and see about its present.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I found Jeff tucked in with Luc and Lindsey at the conference room desk.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the search going?\u201d I asked, taking a seat on the other side of the table.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Jeff said, with unusual irritation. \u201cDo you know how long it takes to search every square block of the city looking for trailers one block at a time?\u201d He winced, ran his hands through his hair. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just frustrated. This is taking for-freaking-ever.\u201d He looked up at me, and even Jeff\u2014Jeff of boundless energy and good humor\u2014looked tired. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have any basis to narrow this down. We have no bio information, no personal information. I even looked online to see if Regan might have sent invitations electronically, and found nothing.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath, looked at the whiteboard. The information about Regan was limited. Extremely limited. \u201cShe lost her mom,\u201d I said. \u201cDidn\u2019t know her dad. Has some insecurities about that. Considers herself a kind of nomad, if the vardo is any indication. But what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her at the grocery store,\u201d Luc said. \u201cDid she buy anything that might provide a hint?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, imagined her standing across the room, a grocery basket in hand. She\u2019d looked at medical supplies, but that was all I could remember.</p><p>\u201cShe had good fashion sense. Jeans, red cape.\u201d I glanced at Lindsey. \u201cCome to think of it, it was an outfit you could have pulled off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesigner handbag, too. If she likes fancy, maybe she likes fancy neighborhoods.\u201d I glanced at Jeff. \u201cCan you search neighborhoods based on per capita income? Maybe we can narrow down the search that way?\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded, was already busy tapping on his portable.</p><p>Helen appeared in the doorway, looked at me. \u201cThere\u2019s someone here to see you,\u201d she said. \u201cA man.\u201d With that announcement, she disappeared again.</p><p>I frowned, looked at Luc, who shrugged. \u201cIf she thought he was dangerous, she\u2019d have kneed him in the balls. A fierce fighter, is Helen.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure about that, but I understood his larger point and trotted upstairs to the first floor.</p><p>Damien Garza\u2014tall, dark, and sleek in his leather jacket\u2014stood in the Cadogan House foyer.</p><p>\u201cDamien,\u201d I said, ignoring the looks of interest from the vampires in the foyer. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe I can find her. But I need a team.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He looked uncomfortable at the conference room table, his head four inches higher than anyone else\u2019s. The fact that we were staring at him probably didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Boo?\u201d I asked, breaking the ice.</p><p>Damien broke into an endearing smile. \u201cGood. Likes his kibble. Sleeps on an old T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is adorable,\u201d I decided, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he was bare chested while the kitty borrowed his shirt.</p><p>Apparently wondering too loudly. Luc kicked my foot under the table, smiled at Damien. \u201cTell us what brings you into the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a cousin, a human, who lives in Lincoln Park. I\u2019ve asked my friends, family, to keep an eye out for the carnival or anything else suspicious. She called me earlier tonight. There\u2019s a new development in Lincoln Park called Briarthorne. Gated community, very exclusive. She lives across the street. Said she saw two big silver trailers pull through the gate last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Luc said, eyes wide and excited. \u201cRegan\u2019s trailers.\u201d</p><p>Damien smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s what it sounds like to me. And I want in on the op.\u201d</p><p>Luc reached out, offered Damien a hand. \u201cSir, that won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve scoped them out,\u201d Jeff said, the overhead screen zeroing in on Lincoln Park and the Briarthorne development. He ducked to street level so quickly my stomach flipped as if I\u2019d actually been diving toward it, and then he began to scan the neighborhood.</p><p>The houses were luxe, with large pools and enormous garages, both rarities in Chicago. Jeff panned the shot through the gate and up the street, past one large lot after another. The neighborhood was huge; they must have razed a lot of real estate to fit it in. Streets gave way to a small park crisscrossed by sidewalks.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Damien said, pointing at the two sleek trailers that sat at the end of the park.</p><p>\u201cBallsy of her to put down in the middle of the city,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cAnd in the middle of the money and power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the money and power,\u201d Luc snarked. \u201cMerit\u2019s parents live in Oak Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar-har,\u201d I said. \u201cNot ballsy if it\u2019s a gated community,\u201d I added. \u201cThat gives her protection.\u201d</p><p>Luc nodded. \u201cAnd the cost of admission gives her resources and makes them believe they\u2019re seeing an exciting and exclusive safari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Malik and Ethan we\u2019ve found her,\u201d Luc said, picking up his phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Catcher and Mallory,\u201d I offered, opting to give Jonah the night off. After all, we had an extra shifter.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>By the time the entire crew was assembled, the Ops Room buzzed with energy and magic. Several vampires, two sorcerers, and two shifters. Jeff called Gabe to advise the Pack we\u2019d found Regan\u2019s menagerie, but they were still in Loring Park; waiting for them would have slowed us down. The longer we waited, the longer we risked she\u2019d move again. And next time, we might not get so lucky.</p><p>The map of Briarthorne was still on-screen, giving everyone a sense of the location.</p><p>\u201cTwo trailers,\u201d Luc said, pointing to the screen. \u201cNorth end of the park, end to end. Jeff, Damien, Catcher, Mallory, Ethan, and Merit will go. We\u2019ll stay here to keep an eye on the House just in case Regan decides she has a unique opportunity to test our security.\u201d The idea was undoubtedly a good one, but he didn\u2019t look thrilled about the idea of staying behind.</p><p>\u201cHelen is preparing the ballroom for triage and shelter,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAny sups who wish to come to the House can do so. We\u2019ll have transportation at the park in order to get them here. We\u2019ll also assist in reuniting them with their friends and families, wherever that might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Regan?\u201d Jeff asked. \u201cAt the risk of being grim, there are many, many people who will want a piece of her when all this is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d Ethan agreed. \u201cBut our job is not to decide her fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019ve secured the sups,\u201d Luc said, \u201cwe\u2019ll call Detective Jacobs and advise she\u2019s a suspect in the kidnapping of several supernaturals. That will keep her behind bars long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got magic. He may not want the responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mayor created mechanisms to deal with Tate once upon a time,\u201d Ethan pointed out. \u201cThey\u2019ll deal with her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a deal with the elves,\u201d Damien said. \u201cTaking Niera home, safe and sound. We\u2019ll deliver her when they\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>Luc nodded. \u201cYou get in, you free the sups, you contain Regan. And when it\u2019s all done, you get a groovy sense of accomplishment, and we get Gabe and the elves off our backs. And probably dinner. I think Helen\u2019s ordering pizza.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luc stood, braced his hands on the table, and looked us over one by one. \u201cBe careful out there. And set phasers on awesome.\u201d</p><p>Crickets chirped in the silence.</p><p>Lindsey shook her head and patted Luc\u2019s hand. \u201cBetter luck next time, hon.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was late, and the neighborhood was mostly dark. We parked on the side opposite the trailers and made our approach, quietly, in the dark. The gates were black wrought iron, cresting to a point between two stone pillars. The streets beyond were quiet, dotted with ornate streetlamps.</p><p>I looked up at the gate, which had to be twelve feet tall. I was better with down than with up and didn\u2019t want to fudge an ascent in front of my colleagues.</p><p>But a wrought-iron gate was no match for a Jeff Christopher. While we huddled in the darkness beside one of the pillars, Jeff pointed his magic tablet at the card reader notched into the stone until the light above flashed green and the gates swung open.</p><p>\u201cAchievement unlocked,\u201d I said with awe, and caught his flashing grin.</p> <p>\u201cI knew you were a gamer at heart,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>We crept quietly through the gates and into the neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cThe park\u2019s up the street and around the curve,\u201d Jeff whispered, tucking the tablet away again. We stuck to the median that separated the parkway. The trees on the hillock were still empty of leaves, but they gave us a bit of a shield in case anyone bothered to look.</p><p>The road curved, and we followed it to a pretty park that took up a long ellipse between two sets of houses.</p><p>There, beneath the limbs of winter-bare trees, were two silver, gleaming trailers.</p><p>The faint vibration of magic hummed in the air.</p> <p>\u201cWe do one trailer at a time,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cMerit, Mallory, Catcher, and I will go inside. Jeff, Damien will wait here; keep an eye out.\u201d</p><p>When everyone nodded, we crept to the closest one, found the door at the end. Ethan hopped onto a step at the back of the truck, pulled down a giant silver handle, and pulled open the door.</p><p>Steps descended, and Catcher and I followed Ethan inside.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ethan muttered, making a motion across his chest as if to ward off the evil.</p><p>The car was divided in half by a passageway, with fluorescent lights running above. It was clean and white and smelled faintly of pine-scented cleaner. Each side of the car had been divided into containers arranged like small sleeping pods. Each pod held a supernatural. I recognized a harpy, a leprechaun, his skin faintly green, a giantess sitting in the largest of them. They wore clean blue scrubs and looked to be in good health, but their eyes were blank and they stared absently.</p><p>Tears pricked at my eyes, but I pushed them back. Now wasn\u2019t the time to grieve for the years they\u2019d lost. It was time to give them the rest of their lives.</p><p>I looked over the cases, realized who was missing. \u201cNiera and Aline aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another trailer yet,\u201d Catcher reminded me. \u201cThey could be in there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get started,\u201d I said. I moved to the first cage and put a hand on the lock\u2014a long silver pin inside a complicated twisting mechanism\u2014but Catcher slammed a hand against the door before I could open it.</p><p>I looked at him, bewildered. \u201cWe have to let them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he calmly said. \u201cBut unlocking the doors right now won\u2019t help. If they\u2019re charmed into this kind of oblivion, they aren\u2019t going to be able to run out of here when we open the doors. And they might be spelled to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Catcher looked at Ethan. \u201cI\u2019ll take this trailer. Mallory can take the other. We\u2019ll unwind the spells, get them ready for release.\u201d He looked at Mallory. \u201cYou remember how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d she said, crossing her arms to hide the tremble in her fingers. But I\u2019d rather have her afraid than cocky and dangerous any day.</p><p>Ethan nodded and we walked outside again, explained what we\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cDamien, stay with Catcher. Jeff, stay with Mallory. Keep them safe while we find Regan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing,\u201d Catcher said, when Mallory and Jeff had left for the other train car. He pulled a set of connected silver hoops from his pocket. \u201cHandcuffs, magically enhanced. It\u2019s what we used on Mallory. They should hold her.\u201d He tossed them into the air, and Ethan caught them neatly with one hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cGet them free.\u201d</p><p>With a nod and a spark of magic, he got to work. Ethan and I surveyed the park.</p><p>\u201cOdds are better if we separate,\u201d I told Ethan.</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019ll take the east side. You take the west.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, adjusted the tension on my belt. \u201cWill do. I\u2019ll call if I find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that.\u201d Before I could leave, he wrapped an arm around my waist, pulled my body against him, and pressed a hard kiss to my lips. \u201cDo protect what\u2019s mine, Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>I made a sound at the possessive tone in his voice but still reveled in it. That I was strong enough to take down a foe didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t enjoy Ethan\u2019s alpha male attitude every once in a while.</p><p>\u201cSame to you, Sullivan,\u201d I said, and headed off down the sidewalk.</p><p>The night was chilly, but this was Chicago, gated or not, and Chicagoans were used to the chill. A few people were out and about, walking dogs or returning late from work with quick steps around the edge of the park. Including one girl with platinum blond hair.</p><p>I\u2019ve got her, I told Ethan. East side of the park, moving south.</p><p>I\u2019ll circle behind, he said. You intercept, and carefully.</p><p>Without killing civilians or myself, he meant. Not unreasonable advice.</p><p>I stepped off the path, watched while she moved closer. She wore a long black coat, nipped at the waist and buttoned up, and a large glossy shopping bag hung off her shoulder.</p><p>As she neared, I caught the unmistakable scents of smoke and sulfur.</p><p>When she was four feet away, I stepped in front of her. \u201cHello, Regan.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, eyed me curiously. \u201cMerit, I presume. Sentinel of Cadogan House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. I understand you have wings.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hoped to catch her off guard with the reference to something I bet she showed very few people.</p><p>The ploy worked. Her eyes widened, and her hands whitened around her bag. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, actually. At least, I think I do. Your mother told you your father was special.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw twitched, and her voice was controlled fury. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know a lot about Annalissa. And your father was special, as it turns out. Magical and talented and very unique. I\u2019m sorry to say that he\u2019s no longer with us, but his twin brother is alive. Your uncle.\u201d At least, that was the relationship I\u2019d decided on. We were in the fuzzy territory where magic and genetics collided, and I wasn\u2019t really sure of anything.</p><p>\u201cOh, and your uncle\u2019s an angel.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, she looked genuinely flummoxed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn angel, and a very good man, Regan. I can help you meet him, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to trust you? You want to put me in a cage.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to get the irony. \u201cYou\u2019ve committed crimes in several states,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cKidnapping, primarily.\u201d</p><p>She looked disgusted by my ignorance. \u201cThey weren\u2019t kidnapped. They are my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are in cages. Drugged and stuffed inside cages like animals while you\u2019ve been out shopping.\u201d She flinched, proving I was on the right track.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you treat family? You keep them safely locked away so they aren\u2019t gone when you return home? So they don\u2019t leave you like your father did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me or my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know too much,\u201d I said, the honest truth. \u201cAnd I know you can\u2019t force a family with magic just because you\u2019re pissed off at the real one.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d pushed her over the edge. She let out a scream, whipped around the shopping bag, and slung it at me. I put up an arm to dodge it, wincing when the weight of it hit my arm. Using my hesitation, she took off across the park.</p><p>And so the chase began.</p><p>She\u2019s heading for the trailers, I told Ethan, running full out and trying to close the gap between us. She hurdled a bench and I followed, thrilled when the vault put me five feet closer to her.</p><p>I paused long enough to pluck the dagger from my boot and send it spiraling, end over end, in her direction.</p><p>Regan yelped when it bit into her shoulder, stumbled forward but caught herself, yanked it out with a scream.</p><p>The scents of smoke and sulfur grew stronger. When she turned back to me, the dagger glinting in her hand, there was murder in her eyes. \u201cDo you know what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I assured her, unsheathing my katana and settling my fingers around the handle. I kept my gaze on hers, and my expression just as haughty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the daughter of Dominic Tate. The niece of Seth Tate, former mayor of Chicago, and an angel. You\u2019re also a spoiled brat. But that\u2019s just my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Regan launched herself forward, swiping the blade in a shot I neatly dodged.</p><p>I sliced horizontally, and she ducked to avoid the blow, bringing up the dagger with a clean shot that nicked my shin. A line of pain burned hot, but I ignored it, finished my spin, and attacked downward.</p><p>She rolled across the ground, popping up a few feet away. We circled each other, and as we turned, I caught movement from the corner of my eye\u2014Ethan stood nearby, his sword still sheathed but his eyes cold and calculating.</p><p>Feel free to join in, I told him, jumping back to dodge her advance and the tip of the blade.</p><p>You seem to be managing fine on your own. The sups are unspelled and released. You might mention that to her.</p><p>\u201cThe gig\u2019s up, Regan. The sups are gone. It\u2019s just you and me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She cursed, moved forward, dropping the blade and using the weight of her body to send me to the ground. My katana skidded away, and snow seeped into the gaps in my leather, sending wet trickles down hot skin.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my family,\u201d she yelled, trying to pummel me into submission.</p><p>\u201cThey have . . . their own . . . families,\u201d I reminded her. I grabbed her fist, twisted, and pushed her over, pinning her to the ground.</p><p>I was faster, but she was stronger. Regan screamed, threw me off and away. I flew back six feet, skidding across the ground.</p> <p>I believe now I might join you, Ethan said.</p><p>Too late, I told him, wiping blood from my eye. She\u2019s mine.</p><p>I put my hands behind me, flipped to my feet, and snatched my katana from the ground, spinning as I turned to face her again.</p><p>She flew out an arm and a crackle of magic that sent the tree behind us to the ground with an enormous crack. I jumped as it fell to the ground a foot away, branches swaying with the force of the movement, and a sizzling, chemical scent in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little old for tantrum throwing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, jumping atop a branch and rolling the katana in my fingers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you a tantrum,\u201d she said, holding out her palms, a fiery sword appearing between them. She immediately swung it at me, and I neatly dodged and sliced again.</p><p>\u201cOf course she has a flaming sword,\u201d I murmured, dodging another slice. Regan didn\u2019t have the training\u2014her movements made that obvious\u2014but she had strength and magic enough to wield her flaming steel like a champion.</p><p>Sirens rose in the distance, and I caught my chance. I dodged, sliced, and moved gradually toward the sidewalk and the blue and red lights that were racing up the street.</p><p>She let out a low growl, my hair standing on end as she prepared to throw out another blade of magic.</p><p>I ducked and hit the ground as a sizzle lit the air. But it was Regan who crumpled, the sword in her hand disappearing with a puff of smoke.</p><p>We looked behind us, where Detective Jacobs stood beside a squad car, a Taser in hand. He smiled, his smile a deep crevice in his dark skin.</p> <p>\u201cJust thought I\u2019d offer you a hand,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>I\u2019d always liked him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ethan applied the cuffs, and Catcher helped transport Regan into the back of Detective Jacobs\u2019s vehicle.</p><p>When possession was transferred to him, they walked back to where Ethan and I stood by, just close enough to ensure she\u2019d been taken into custody.</p><p>\u201cThat will hold her,\u201d Catcher said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to use the same dampening magic they used on Tate. Apparently the corrections departments across the U.S. have developed some pretty good skills in that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact Gabriel,\u201d Damien said, nodding toward Niera and Aline, who sat on opposite ends of a nearby bench. Even in crisis, there was no friendship between these particular clans.</p><p>Aline stood and walked toward us, looked at me and Ethan.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I trust you. But I know how to give thanks where thanks are due.\u201d</p><p>She held out a hand. Dumbfounded, I accepted it. The deed done, she turned and walked back to the bench, where she sat sullenly again.</p><p>\u201cWell, that happened,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that moment of friendship will stick, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cthat\u2019s the best we can hope for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of hope,\u201d I said, glancing at Niera, \u201cwe have a truce to make good on.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>They stood in long, precise columns that stretched across the field near their village. They\u2019d traded their simple tunics for gleaming armor and open helms with thin guards that covered their noses, and each held a bow and arrow. There must have been thousands of them, and they stood with robotic precision, ready for action.</p><p>Perhaps not so unlike the metaphorical locusts.</p><p>We stood in front of them, a smaller group than the last time we\u2019d met. The Brecks, the Keenes, Ethan, and me. More vulnerable to the elves without an army behind us, and trusting that they\u2019d stand by their word.</p><p>But not so trusting that we didn\u2019t have our swords unsheathed and at the ready.</p><p>And at my side stood Niera. She made no sound, just as during the trip to the Brecks\u2019 estate. But she\u2019d stared at the sights with a mix of wonderment and fear that sent magic through the car. It seemed the elves had avoided all contact with the metropolis that lay at the edge of their territory.</p><p>The elf who\u2019d presented us after the kidnapping\u2014or so I thought, as like the fairies, they looked fraternally similar\u2014stepped forward, a standard-bearer at his side.</p><p>\u201cA truce was called,\u201d he said, \u201cpursuant to the terms of our pact. What say you now?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stepped forward. \u201cYour clanswoman Niera was taken against her will, by a creature of immense power. We identified the creature. Tracked her. Obtained Niera\u2019s release. And we bring her back to you today.\u201d</p><p>He gestured toward Niera, who stepped forward.</p><p>The elf\u2019s expression stayed mild, controlled, but there was relief in his eyes.</p><p>Niera walked toward him and into his embrace. There were shouts of joy and relief from the elves, and a burst of fresh magic, until the army swallowed Niera into its ranks once again.</p><p>\u201cThe pact has been fulfilled,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d the elf agreed. \u201cWe will see what the future holds.\u201d They turned on their heels and began the silent march back to their wood.</p><p>We watched in silence until they\u2019d disappeared completely, until the trees no longer shook from the army\u2019s intrusion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d Gabriel said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s time for a drink.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK</p><p>At dusk the next evening, Lakshmi arrived to discuss the GP and its variety of issues, looking gorgeous in a sleek black dress with an asymmetrical neckline and stiletto heels. I stood in the foyer with Luc, Malik, and Helen, nodding politely as she arrived, and then directing her to Ethan\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, once again, we wait,\u201d Luc said with a grumble. \u201cI swear to God, I spend half my time doing that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t disagree. But I\u2019d already arranged a way to spend the time.</p><p>An hour later, I stood at the tall fence outside the former brick factory where the CPD had held Seth Tate once upon a time, and where they now held his niece.</p><p>And now, thanks to Detective Jacobs, Regan and her uncle were going to have their own reunion.</p><p>A taxi pulled up the long drive, and after exchanging bills, a man emerged. He had short sandy hair and a thick nose, and he wore khakis and a button-down shirt.</p><p>Seth Tate could have passed for an accountant, but he still smelled like freshly baked cookies.</p><p>\u201cNice disguise,\u201d I said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey\u2019ll have the building warded, so I had to go old-school.\u201d</p><p>Headlights appeared in the darkness, and a golf cart pulled up to the gate. A young, fit woman in a black uniform climbed out and walked to the gate.</p><p>\u201cCaroline Merit and John Smith?\u201d</p><p>I waved a little bit. \u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>She nodded officially, unlocked the gate, and held it open for us.</p><p>\u201cMind the gap,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the bench on the back of the cart.</p><p>\u201cJohn Smith?\u201d Seth murmured as he took a seat beside me.</p><p>\u201cThe alias wasn\u2019t really the key component of the plan,\u201d I said, as the guard accelerated and we bobbled down the gravel road. The factory was actually a set of several large buildings used to mold and fire bricks during wartime. Seth had been held in a small stand-alone building, but we passed it as we headed toward a long single-story building on the other side of the compound.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d I quietly asked, as his gaze settled on his former prison cell.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a niece before. Or a relative of any kind other than Dominic. And I\u2019m not sure he counted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore a supernatural parasite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet he was sentient enough to control me. To connect with a woman and father a child.\u201d</p><p>But Dominic had been a lover in his time. He\u2019d seduced Claudia, the queen of the fairies. It had been her love that bound Dominic to Seth and kept him out of the Maleficium.</p><p>The guard stopped in front of the entrance and escorted us into the building. It was a large empty space but for the series of small square rooms that dotted the concrete floor. Guards were stationed here and there, and they had the look of well-seasoned military types.</p><p>The mayor wasn\u2019t taking any chances with Regan. And she now had a facility to hold a small supernatural army. Not a comforting thought.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the first one,\u201d the guard said, gesturing us forward. The rooms were made of concrete, with a window and door on the front side. \u201cYou can go ahead.\u201d</p><p>We walked toward the window, peered inside.</p><p>Regan sat at an aluminum table, and she\u2019d exchanged her designer clothes for an orange jumpsuit. She moved nervously in her chair, kept nervously touching her hair. She might have been a badass in her element, but here she looked small and insecure.</p><p>I glanced at Seth.</p><p>He watched her, head angled, eyes wide, for a long moment. \u201cThere\u2019s more of him in her than I\u2019d have imagined,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things considered, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s capable of contrition. But maybe you can give her peace. Maybe you can ensure she doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. There weren\u2019t many times I\u2019d seen him nervous. But here, facing the family he hadn\u2019t known he had, he looked absolutely bewildered.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd right now, I don\u2019t think you even have to be good at it. You just have to be there.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cYou are wise beyond your years, Ballerina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmortality tends to do that,\u201d I murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth blew out a breath, put a hand on the door, and walked inside.</p><p>Regan looked up as Seth walked in and sat down in the chair across from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201d the guard asked, moving closer to the door.</p> <p>\u201cA family reunion.\u201d</p><p>Maybe a little family would do them both some good.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>They talked for nearly an hour, which was all the time Jacobs could eke out of the mayor considering the multiple charges against Regan.</p><p>I stood by watching from the window with the guard until Seth\u2019s hour was up and the guard knocked on the door again.</p> <p>Seth squeezed Regan\u2019s hand, rose, and came to the door.</p><p>When he stepped outside, his gaze found mine. There was a disconcertingly familiar intensity in his eyes that scared me to the bone. Had I made a mistake, bringing him here? Putting the two of them together?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and a smile blossomed. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for this. For arranging this reunion after everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t expected thanks, and it flustered me. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It went okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did,\u201d he said, scratching his head nervously. \u201cShe\u2019s got issues. Many of them involve Dominic; others, magic. But I think there\u2019s a chance for her, Merit.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced back at Regan and thought about what Gabe had said at Lupercalia, there with Mallory in front of the totem before things had gone so wrong. About those brave enough to crawl back from their wrongs and try to make things better.</p><p>\u201cThe supernaturals in her menagerie were well cared for. She told me she thought of them as family. Maybe that\u2019s what she needs now. Maybe she is capable of contrition; maybe she isn\u2019t. But she\u2019s yours, and you deserve the chance to help her try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I intend to,\u201d he said, and before I could respond, he pulled off his wig and the plastic that had covered his nose. He ran a hand through his dark hair, smiled at the guard.</p><p>The guard, whom Tate had finally managed to shake, swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re the mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormer,\u201d Seth said with a soft smile. \u201cNow I\u2019m just a man, and I believe you\u2019ll find there are warrants out for my arrest. I\u2019ve been avoiding my punishment. But I\u2019ll take it now.\u201d</p><p>The guard looked at him for a moment, then back at me, clearly unsure what to do. It couldn\u2019t have been every day that she was faced with a felon who offered himself up to incarceration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trick,\u201d Seth said. \u201cI\u2019m just finally\u2014after too long\u2014doing the right thing. I\u2019d like to serve my time honorably.\u201d</p><p>Another moment passed, but the guard relented. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said, gesturing two more guards forward. While they watched Tate with weapons drawn, she cuffed his wrists with zip strips she\u2019d pulled from a pouch on her belt.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a right to talk to a lawyer,\u201d she said, putting a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you might want to call the mayor.\u201d</p><p>When the guard gestured toward the second room, Seth looked back at me and smiled magnanimously.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, still completely dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cNeither Dominic nor I protected her before. But if I\u2019m here, I can protect her now. At least in some way.\u201d</p><p>And he let the guard lead him away.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The House cafeteria was located in the back of the first floor, the large windows looking out over the beautiful grounds that surrounded the House. Snow still glistened magically there. It was between meals, so the cafeteria was empty but for the bustle of staff who worked to prepare the next round of meals for the vampires.</p><p>Ethan wasn\u2019t yet done with Lakshmi, so I sat at a wooden table in a wooden chair beside one of the windows and stared out across the lawn at the banks of trees and hillocks of undisturbed snow. A rabbit darted into view, paused and looked around for predators, then dashed away to safety again.</p><p>At the sound of footsteps, I looked up. Ethan walked into the room, then over to a glass-doored cooler on the opposite wall. He grabbed two bottles of Blood4You, brought them to the table.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d he asked, popping the tops on both and handing one to me.</p><p>\u201cHaving some quiet time. I don\u2019t get that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou do not. Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncarcerated,\u201d I said. \u201cTurned himself in so he\u2019d be in prison with Regan.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHe\u2019s made quite a turnaround.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement. But it\u2019s also kind of perfect.\u201d</p><p>I made myself wait a beat, gave him an opportunity to take a drink, before asking him. \u201cWhat did Lakshmi say? What is the GP demanding of the House?\u201d</p><p>He took another drink, set the bottle on the table. \u201cThe GP believes, as we have killed one of their vampires, they have a right to the same.\u201d</p><p>My blood chilled. \u201cThey want to kill a member of Cadogan House?\u201d The GP had made ignorant and thoughtless moves before, but none as heartless as that. None that were as conniving or, frankly, stupid.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bluffing,\u201d I said, and Ethan smiled back faintly.</p><p>\u201cBluffing or not, that was their offer, delivered here by Lakshmi Rao. I understand you\u2019re well acquainted.\u201d</p><p>I kept my expression as neutral as possible, but I was sure he saw the hitch in my eyes. \u201cOh?\u201d I innocently asked.</p><p>He gave me a dubious look. \u201cShe is supportive of the idea of challenging Darius for the GP. She suggested I should do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. And are you?\u201d I realized my hands had begun to shake, and I tucked them between my knees. Even if I accepted the notion that Ethan loved me unconditionally, that didn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t fear for his safety if he decided to challenge Darius.</p><p>He looked at me for a long, quiet moment, took my hand. \u201cI believe, Sentinel, that I am.\u201d</p><p>I felt like I\u2019d been pushed off a cliff, suddenly dizzy, suddenly worried. \u201cAnd the House? Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be protected,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a long road before the leadership of the GP is settled. A potentially dangerous road,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut a long road nonetheless. All things can be worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd London?\u201d I asked. \u201cCan it be worked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Ethan murmured, and before I could move, my hand was in his, and we were moving. He led me up and out of the cafeteria, down the hallway, and up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked as we rounded the third-floor landing and headed down the hallway to a room I knew was empty except for the pull-down ladder that led to the attic and the House\u2019s widow\u2019s walk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showing you something,\u201d Ethan said, pulling down the ladder. He gestured toward it. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>I knew when to obey without sarcasm. I climbed up and into the attic, which wasn\u2019t much to see. Mostly rafters and insulation. The window that led to the roof was closed. I unlatched it and pushed it open, assuming that was what Ethan had intended me to do. As he climbed the ladder behind me, I stepped outside.</p><p>The widow\u2019s walk was a narrow ledge around this part of the roof, marked by a short wrought-iron barrier. Lake Michigan was a dark stain to the east, and downtown Chicago shined to the north.</p><p>The roof creaked as Ethan stepped beside me. He put one hand around my waist and used the other to point at the blinking lights of the city.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I take power, that is the new seat of the Greenwich Presidium.\u201d</p><p>It took me a moment to understand what he\u2019d said, the scope of the change he\u2019d just proposed. \u201cYou want to move the GP to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will move the GP to Chicago,\u201d Ethan said, filling those words with every bit of pretention and egoism I knew him capable of.</p><p>He tilted my chin to meet his gaze. \u201cYou are my soul, Merit. But vampires are my body. To be whole, I must respect both. And the GP has held court too far from the American Houses for far too long. It\u2019s time the GP came home to roost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll fight to keep the seat in Europe,\u201d I said. \u201cDanica and the others won\u2019t let you move it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they do not control the GP, they will have no choice.\u201d He touched a fingertip to my lips. \u201cI made my choice, Merit, many months ago. There is no turning back. Not now.\u201d</p><p>His lips so soft, yet so stern, he pressed his mouth to mine.</p><p>\u201cI will have both of you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Sentinel and my city. And the GP will learn exactly how stubborn we both can be.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
