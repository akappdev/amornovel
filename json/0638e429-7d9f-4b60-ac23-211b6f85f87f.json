Despite my appreciation of how she\u2019s willing to spend that time, I don\u2019t want to be confined to my house with Dori. She\u2019s like a new toy that I can\u2019t show off \u2013 which was a dick thing to slip and say, but she just rolled her eyes at me for it.</p> <p>As it is, John is the only friend I have who knows about my new relationship status, although my co-star on my last film \u2013 Chelsea Radin \u2013 smirked perceptively whenever she saw us together during the last few cast volunteer days at the Habitat house. I\u2019m guessing she knows. Especially after she caught us emerging from an alcove on the side of the house, Dori\u2019s ponytail loose and her face flushed, me wearing a shit-eating grin.</p><p>John and I are hanging courtside when he decides to bring up my clandestine affair, because his concern for timing is identical to his regard for tact \u2013 non-existent.</p><p>\u2018So when are you revealing this so-called relationship to the world already?\u2019</p><p>The level of noise in Staples Center keeps our exchange confidential, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to discuss Dori in the middle of eighteen thousand people \u2013 never mind several hundred cameras broadcasting the game to millions more. Plus, he pronounces relationship in a tone most people reserve for STD. When I shoot him a look, he blinks innocently. I suspect this guise worked on his father for years before he figured out that John really was a next-generation version of himself.</p><p>\u2018What? Reid Alexander has a girlfriend.\u2019 His voice dips at this last word \u2013 not like he\u2019s obeying my gag order \u2013 more like this fact is too appalling to divulge at full volume.</p> <p>I stare at the three-point shot, lined up and missed. We both curse.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Perez-worthy news, bro! What\u2019s with the containment?\u2019</p><p>If John is waiting for my answer, he can fucking keep waiting.</p><p>Kobe gets penalized for travelling \u2013 which never happens \u2013 and I slump back in my seat, crossing my arms tightly over my chest. \u2018Shit.\u2019 That expletive defines my current feelings for the Lakers and Dori, both of whom I love, both of whom are pissing me off.</p><p>Elbowing me, John smirks. \u2018C\u2019mon, man, you know I\u2019m the soul of discretion.\u2019 Oddly enough, that\u2019s true. When I don\u2019t spill immediately, he starts guessing. \u2018So it\u2019s over? Is that it? Dude, I said it wouldn\u2019t la\u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018She hasn\u2019t told her parents yet.\u2019</p> <p>From the corner of my eye, I watch him frown in confusion and peer at me like I\u2019ve just spoken a foreign language and he\u2019s waiting for the translation.</p><p>Staring at the game, I add, \u2018I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a fucking teen drama.\u2019</p><p>John arches a brow. \u2018Wait. You\u2019re serious. That\u2019s the reason? Because she hasn\u2019t told her parents? I could line up a hundred girls who\u2019d be jacked as hell to go out with you \u2013 once. You\u2019ve made this girl your girlfriend, and she\u2019s not telling everyone she knows?\u2019</p><p>I shrug, but it stings when he puts it like that. Like I said \u2013 tact is not John\u2019s thing.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u2018Never thought I\u2019d see the day some girl got Reid Alexander pussy-whipped \u2013 Ow! Dude!\u2019 Glaring, he rubs his arm where I punched him. \u2018What is it about this girl that makes you so fucking violent?\u2019</p><p>I laugh, because now we\u2019re on the screen over centre court. Time to appear as if we\u2019re screwing around rather than beginning a private brawl that would unseat the Lakers and the Jazz as tonight\u2019s primary entertainment. \u2018Camera.\u2019</p><p>At that word, John switches gears and plays along with the horseplay ruse, shoving me back.</p><p>\u2018That was your last warning, man.\u2019 My on-camera smile doesn\u2019t conceal the sharp threat in my voice. \u2018Don\u2019t talk about her like that.\u2019 He\u2019s lucky I gave him a deep bicep bruise instead of rearranging his face.</p> <p>\u2018I was talking about you,\u2019 he growls in return, his fake smile mirroring mine.</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>\u2018Ms Cameron? Bethany Shank here. I\u2019ve located him.\u2019</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have answered her call in the middle of a pedicure, but when I saw her name pop up on the screen, my curiosity was overpowering. No way that was going to voicemail. When I hired a private investigator, I expected her to find my kid. I mean duh \u2013 of course I expected her to find him. Even so, this news floors the hell out of me. My heart is thrashing like I\u2019m mainlining espresso.</p><p>\u2018That was ... fast.\u2019</p><p>The woman currently patting my feet dry is pretending she isn\u2019t listening to my side of this conversation, and I wonder if she can hear the thundering slam of my heart.</p><p>\u2018Yes, well, I told you it would go quickly once you gave me the go-ahead to conduct the search.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what\u2019s next?\u2019 I\u2019ve found him. Despite my superficial confidence, my hands start to tremble. I wish I was at home, alone, so I could lie down or pace in circles \u2013 anything but sit here with my foot on some stranger\u2019s knee, shaking like my mother\u2019s inbred Pekinese, which pees if someone sneezes.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a lot of sensitive information here. Too much to relay over the phone. Would you prefer to come by the office tomorrow, or would you prefer that I come to you?\u2019</p><p>Okay ... he\u2019s four. How much information can there be? He finally stopped wetting the bed. Throws an occasional shit-fit tantrum. Learned how to write his name in preschool. Has a normal life. That last bit is all I care about: I just want to hear that he has a normal life, so I can go back to mine in peace.</p><p>Part of me feels like a hundred kinds of idiot for doing this at all. Except that for months now, I\u2019ve had a recurring nightmare about the baby I\u2019d refused to see or hold before my attorney and the social worker transferred him to the adoptive parents. In the dream, I\u2019m holding him and he\u2019s staring up at me. And then he bursts into tears, crying like his heart is breaking, and I wake up buried in a landslide of guilt.</p><p>There\u2019s no reason for me to feel guilty \u2013 no reason. Why the hell am I dreaming of him crying? And why do I wake up with tears on my face?</p><p>I just want closure, finally. Closure, and maybe a photo.</p><p>\u2018I assume he\u2019s fine. Right?\u2019</p><p>If she provides that one syllable of reassurance, I can stop here. If he\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t need details. A photo is probably a bad idea, even. I don\u2019t really want to know if he looks more like me or Reid.</p><p>\u2018It would be best for us to meet in person. I\u2019ll just transfer you to my admin to set up an appointment.\u2019 Bethany Shank is all detached and impersonal \u2013 typical for her. But her clipped demeanour is more grating \u2013 and alarming \u2013 than usual. There\u2019s a small thread of something unsaid, and I can\u2019t help but tug at it.</p><p>\u2018Is something wrong?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s an unexpected pause in place of the quick denial I expected, and suddenly I need privacy. Like now. I direct a scowl towards the pedicurist\u2019s head \u2013 because how goddamned long does it take to dry a foot for chrissake?</p><p>Glancing up as though she feels my eyes bore into her, she blanches.</p><p>I slide my fingers over the phone. \u2018Could you give me a moment? Thanks.\u2019</p><p>Once she shuffles away, I ask Bethany Shank to repeat herself.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d advise an office meeting for this exchange, Ms Cameron.\u2019 Her keyboard clicks in the background. \u2018I believe I have an open spot tomorrow afternoon at three ...\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t like this at all. She\u2019s not answering my question, which means there is something wrong. Now my brain is off on a new loop: mental disability ... terminal illness ... dead?</p><p>\u2018No. Today. And come to my apartment.\u2019</p><p>My PI sighs into the phone as though I give a shit that I\u2019ve just disturbed her Very Important Schedule. I wait, silent, until she concedes defeat. \u2018I won\u2019t be free until seven this evening \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seven\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you then.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s mid-sigh when I click off. If I wasn\u2019t in the middle of a Beverly Hills spa with the nosiest pedicurist on the planet, I\u2019d have forced her to tell me what the hell she found out right now instead of having to wait three hours.</p><p>\u2018Ready for the oil massage?\u2019 The pedicurist returns, a little cowed.</p><p>\u2018Sure. But I changed my mind about the French tips. French tips are for summer. It\u2019s almost February. I want red. Blood red.\u2019</p><p>She nods. \u2018Yes, of course, Ms Cameron.\u2019</p><p>2</p><p>REID</p><p>\u2018Stay.\u2019 I roll Dori beneath me and pin one wrist above her head, kissing her deeply so she can\u2019t tell me no right away \u2013 though I know she will. Which makes how ticked off I feel when she does that exact thing a bit unreasonable.</p><p>\u2018Reid,\u2019 she groans into my mouth, \u2018you know I can\u2019t stay.\u2019</p><p>I stare into her very dark eyes, the frustration leaping into my throat, ready to do battle. \u2018You\u2019re not a child, Dori. You\u2019re almost nineteen. So yes, you can.\u2019</p><p>I release her wrist and she raises her hand to my face, pushes her fingers into my hair, curls them against my scalp.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll tell them. I will. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u2019</p><p>Of course then my temper goes and fucks everything up.</p><p>\u2018No, actually. I don\u2019t. Because you\u2019re leaving for Berkeley next week. And because the last time I trusted you about your parents and us, you bailed on me.\u2019</p><p>Her hand falls away and the faintest crease appears between her brows. \u2018This isn\u2019t like last time.\u2019</p><p>I roll off her and on to my back, because I want to believe her, but right there in the back of my mind \u2013 and none too far back, either \u2013 is the fact that I recently spent one of the most miserable months of my life thinking I\u2019d never see her again. I\u2019m not willing to accept that again. \u2018Right,\u2019 I say.</p><p>And yeah, it does occur to me that being an asshat isn\u2019t the best way to get what I want with her. Realistically, nothing with Dori fits the mould of what usually works for me with the rest of the world \u2013 one of the things I love about her \u2013 but I can\u2019t think logically when I\u2019m this pissed off.</p><p>She slides from the bed and straightens her clothes, which are gratifyingly askew from our interrupted make-out session. Damn my temper to hell, too, because she would stay at least another half-hour, which I\u2019m blowing by acting like a clingy chick. That thought sparks another round of useless anger. I can\u2019t seem to make it stop.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s late. I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 she says then, standing next to the bed while I stare at the ceiling.</p><p>My new more-perceptive alter ego is pleading with me to just let it go already, but the arrogant prick inside is sulking. I\u2019m not wrong. She is. She knows it too \u2013 that\u2019s why she sounds like she\u2019s crying when she turns and leaves.</p><p>Ah, fuck.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I\u2019m calmer and admitting to myself that I\u2019m a self-absorbed dumbass. I call her but she doesn\u2019t pick up, and I hang up when the call goes to voicemail. Fantasizing about confronting her parents and getting this all out in the open \u2013 just getting in my car and following her home \u2013 I can\u2019t help but chuckle. The way she drives, I\u2019d beat her there, even with her ten-minute head start. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After grabbing a snack from the kitchen, I screw around on the internet, effectively wasting at least forty-five minutes, and then try her again. Voicemail number two \u2013 click. I answer an email from George and check out my fan page, where John appears to be correct about the amount of girls who\u2019d chop off a limb to go out with me even once. But none of them know me. I\u2019m just a pretty face, a hot body, a fantasy stand-in, and though I appreciate their support, such as it is, I couldn\u2019t care less about the shallow praise.</p><p>Listening to Dori\u2019s cheerful, musical voice telling me to leave a message for the third time, I hang my head and wait for the beep, one hand gripping the phone and the other gripping the back of my neck as if I could shake some sense into myself.</p><p>\u2018Dori, I\u2019m sorry. I told you we\u2019d go at your pace, and I broke that promise. Just ... I trust you more than I\u2019ve ever trusted anyone. Maybe that\u2019s not saying much \u2013 or enough \u2013 but I do.\u2019</p><p>My jaw clenches. What I mean by trust and what she means by it are two different things. We\u2019re quite a pair, trying to find the middle ground between our temperaments, our beliefs, our lives. While she tries to repair her broken faith in everything, I\u2019m stumbling over learning to trust at all.</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t give up on me.\u2019 I press end and lie back in the middle of my bed, wishing I could just learn to shut the fuck up when I\u2019m that pissed off.</p><p>Barely resisting the urge to pitch the phone across the room, I focus and count silently. My therapist (another novelty) is adamant about using the focus-and-count thing to uncoil my temper instead of acting on impulse. He insists it\u2019s a habit that requires persistence. It works sporadically, at best \u2013 especially when I forget to use it. Like when Dori was lying next to me minutes ago. Dammit.</p><p>When the phone rings, relief floods through me. \u2018Hey.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have some news. Are you alone?\u2019</p><p>It takes me a second to catch up. Familiar voice, not Dori. \u2018Brooke?\u2019</p> <p>She sighs heavily. \u2018Don\u2019t you ever look to see who\u2019s calling before answering? Are you alone or not?\u2019</p><p>I close my eyes and restart the mute therapeutic counting. So not working.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m alone.\u2019 Teeth clamped, I wait for her to say whatever she\u2019s going to say. I\u2019m not in the mood for Brooke Cameron. A reserve of composure is essential to my ability to tolerate her, and at the moment I\u2019m all tapped out.</p><p>\u2018My PI found him.\u2019</p><p>Him?</p><p>Oh, shit. The kid.</p> <p>\u2018That was fast.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. We need to talk. Can you come over?\u2019</p><p>Brooke has always put the high in high maintenance. I swallow a retort \u2013 my theory on the real reason phones were invented \u2013 namely, the avoidance of in-person meetings with people we don\u2019t want to see. Ten to one Alexander Graham Bell had a problematic ex or an overbearing mother-in-law.</p><p>\u2018When?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now?\u2019</p><p>I glance at my watch. \u2018Brooke, I\u2019m tired.\u2019 More importantly, I\u2019m hoping Dori will call me back any minute. \u2018Can\u2019t you just tell me whatever it is over the phone?\u2019 I\u2019m not used to us speaking amicably \u2013 or as amicably as Brooke and I are capable of. That\u2019s bizarre in itself.</p><p>\u2018Well, shit, Reid. Never mind, then.\u2019 I hear the drawl creeping into her words and know that despite efforts to avoid setting her off, I have anyway.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be that way.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What the hell does that mean?\u2019 She huffs out a breath. \u2018This is important and you\u2019re blowing me off. I should have expected as much. Are you really alone or just saying you are?\u2019</p><p>I shove a hand through my hair and close my eyes. There\u2019s not enough focus-and-count in the world to deal with Brooke Cameron. \u2018Why would I lie about that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why won\u2019t you answer the question?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I already did answer it, goddammit.\u2019</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t snap back right away, I get my first clue that something has her pretty freaked out.</p><p>\u2018Fine. Here it is.\u2019 Her voice sounds off \u2013 now that she\u2019s speaking more quietly, and I realize she\u2019s been crying. What the hell? Is there something in the air today? \u2018He\u2019s in foster care.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I sit up, the gears in my brain catching and stalling.</p><p>\u2018Apparently, the people I chose to give him to transformed into shit-for-brains tweaker meth-addict losers and CPS removed him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quit saying that! Don\u2019t you have anything else to say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well no, actually. Give me a minute, Jesus, I mean \u2013 CPS? As in child whatever \u2013 the people who take kids away from parents when they\u2019re being abused?\u2019</p><p>I imagine the exaggerated eye-roll I thankfully can\u2019t see.</p><p>\u2018Yes, Reid. That\u2019s what I mean.\u2019</p><p>My life flashes before my eyes \u2013 what\u2019s left of it. Because it hits me right then that I\u2019ve not told Dori about this yet. Not any of it. There hasn\u2019t been an appropriate time in the past week to bring up the fact that Brooke and I had a son four and a half years ago. A son I\u2019d denied was mine to Brooke\u2019s face and in my own head until a few weeks ago. A son she gave up for adoption right after she had him.</p><p>With what happened to Dori in high school, this wasn\u2019t a piece of my past I could disclose offhandedly, and I\u2019ve never been the king of insightful situation management. Not to mention the fact that I\u2019ve never told a living soul about this. Not John, not my parents, no one.</p><p>\u2018God-fucking-dammit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Brooke says. She has no idea.</p><p>Into the silence of our mutual shock, my phone beeps, and this time, I check the display. Dori is calling me back. \u2018Look, I have to go. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 Brooke hangs up, and I flash over, shelving our conversation for later.</p><p>\u2018Dori, I\u2019m sorry \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m telling them tomorrow, first thing. Please try to understand \u2013 this is difficult for them, especially after Deb\u2019s accident. It\u2019s not about you, really. They don\u2019t know you. They\u2019re only afraid I\u2019ll be hurt, and that\u2019s all this response is based on.\u2019 She blurts her words like a practised speech, defensive and placating. \u2018They may ... want to talk to you.\u2019</p><p>Parents who want to talk to me. Huh. And I\u2019m not only considering it, I\u2019m determined to do it. This is the stuff of alternate universes.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going to hurt you, Dori,\u2019 I say, meaning it. \u2018And I shouldn\u2019t have pushed you to tell them,\u2019 I add, half-meaning it.</p><p>\u2018Yes, you should have. I haven\u2019t kept my promise to you, either. I told you I would never be ashamed of you \u2013 and I\u2019m not, Reid \u2013 but this must have seemed that way to you. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized until the moment she verbalizes it that this was exactly how it felt to me. She can hurt me in places I didn\u2019t know I was vulnerable, soothe aches I didn\u2019t know existed. How does she manage this sort of empathy?</p><p>\u2018I wish you were here right now,\u2019 I say, unable to concentrate on anything but the need to pull her under me and shut the entire world out.</p><p>\u2018I was just there, you know,\u2019 she retorts.</p><p>Smartass. God, I want her.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I know. Jesus, I\u2019m a fu\u2013 uh, idiot.\u2019</p><p>Her hoarse little laugh at my interrupted curse yanks at my heart.</p><p>\u2018What if I sneak over to your house and climb into your bedroom window?\u2019</p><p>Laughing again, she says, \u2018You can\u2019t sneak anywhere in that car \u2013 certainly not in my neighbourhood. And there\u2019s no tree or trellis for you to climb to my second-storey window ...\u2019</p><p>I chuckle softly. \u2018But you\u2019re thinking about it, aren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>Her exhalation sounds like a smile. \u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Want me to tell you what I\u2019d do, if your dad had been more obliging and installed a trellis or planted a tree just under your window?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe,\u2019 she says softly, and I imagine her sucking that fat lower lip into her mouth.</p><p>\u2018Maybe?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay. Yes. Tell me.\u2019</p><p>This is the thing about her \u2013 this, right here. She doesn\u2019t play coy. That\u2019s why the thought of her pushing me away is unacceptable. It wouldn\u2019t be a play for attention like it always was with Brooke. Goodbye is goodbye to Dori, and I won\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u2018Close your eyes and imagine those perfectly situated branches, right outside your window.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um, okay.\u2019</p><p>I lie back, relaxing, breathing in the subtle trace of her still on my pillows. \u2018You\u2019ll leave your window open \u2013 the one the fish are swimming towards. It\u2019ll be late, and try as you might, you can\u2019t stay awake waiting for me. I\u2019ll slip quietly across the room in the dark, following bars of moonlight to your bed.\u2019 I entertain the thought of her, curled up under the covers, and my fingers twist a knot into the unmade bedding beneath me. \u2018What do you wear to sleep?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just a T-shirt,\u2019 she whispers.</p><p>Air hisses through my teeth and I take a slow breath while my body riots. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m hoping the new will wear off soon \u2013 just a bit, at least \u2013 because whenever I think of touching her and how she responds when I do, I can\u2019t think of anything else.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll pull my shirt off before peeling back your covers. Run my fingertips over you, carefully. Wake you so, so, slowly.\u2019 Every nerve in my body is wide awake. \u2018What will you do then?\u2019</p><p>Her voice is so quiet that I strain to hear her. \u2018Reach for you. Take your hand and pull you into my bed.\u2019</p><p>The hot-factor of this conversation just vaulted up several notches. \u2018Ah, I like the sound of that ... but I\u2019m still wearing my jeans, and you\u2019re wearing that shirt ...\u2019 I wonder if she\u2019s brave enough yet to continue this sort of game, though six months ago I would have had to be high to think she\u2019d ever do this. Or that I\u2019d end up wanting a committed relationship with her.</p><p>After last weekend, all bets are off on what either of us is capable of.</p><p>\u2018Are you \u2013 are you wearing the ones with the button-fly?\u2019 Breathy and soft, her words are like a caress.</p><p>\u2018If that\u2019s what you want, then yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then ... um ... I\u2019ll unbutton your jeans ...\u2019 Her voice husky and sweet, she hesitates, and I picture the blush spreading across her face.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll shove them down with your foot, grazing my leg as you go ...\u2019 I say, helping her out \u2018... while my hands are sliding under that T-shirt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 She sounds almost breathless, and I\u2019m completely turned on.</p><p>\u2018Your MADD T-shirt,\u2019 I qualify, pausing when she laughs. \u2018It\u2019s a little threadbare, you know. I\u2019ll stroke your breasts with my fingertips ... and then lean down and taste you right through that thin red knit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah ...\u2019 she breathes.</p><p>\u2018One hand will drift down, over your ribcage, across your hip, nothing between us ... what then?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn if she\u2019s not panting. So am I.</p><p>\u2018Are you ... are you wearing boxers, or briefs?\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018In the interest of fairness, let\u2019s say no.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, fudge.\u2019</p> <p>I repress a laugh.</p><p>\u2018Um ... what about ...?\u2019</p><p>I chuckle softly. \u2018Dori, Dori \u2013 so responsible, even in the middle of our little fantasy. I\u2019ll bring a whole strip of them. You\u2019re protected. Now what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reid ... I want you.\u2019 Her voice is pure frustration, and I love it.</p><p>My groan echoes her longing. \u2018Baby, let me give your gifted little fingers a few suggestions to follow while I tell you the many, many ways I want you ...\u2019</p> <p>BROOKE</p><p>Despite the fact that Reid had nothing useful to say, it helps to have someone to talk to about this. About him. Who better than his sperm donor?</p><p>I may have to stop referring to Reid like that, assuming he means to be a part of this, which isn\u2019t a given. I can\u2019t imagine him stepping up and admitting to anyone that he\u2019s the father of this kid. Not really.</p><p>Earlier tonight, I learned my son\u2019s name. River. Identical to the up-and-coming young actor who powerballed his way to a flatline on the sidewalk outside an LA club. A promising life cut short \u2013 by drugs, no less. Fabulous.</p><p>Bethany Shank brought an eight-by-ten print of the photo I\u2019d been longing to get my hands on, rather than sending me a jpeg. I fully believe she just wanted to witness my reaction. That flagrant intrusion wasn\u2019t a point in her favour with me. When she slid the photo across the glass tabletop in my kitchen, I stared, but couldn\u2019t touch it. My first thought was No. This can\u2019t be him. Hours later, that kneejerk reaction hasn\u2019t changed, even though I know it\u2019s wrong.</p><p>Staring at his likeness again now, alone, I don\u2019t have to worry about my visible reaction. I can study every detail of him. He squats just inside a cyclone fence marred by patchy streaks of rust. There\u2019s a stick in his hand, held like a tool, not a weapon \u2013 used, I think, to dig or draw in the dirt. In the background there are a couple of other children, a few pieces of ancient playground equipment, and a mousy middle-aged woman talking on a cell phone.</p> <p>Compared to my stepbrother, who\u2019s a few months older, this child looks slight. Undersized. His clothes are mismatched and his face is dirty, as are his small hands. His hair is shorn so close to his scalp that I can barely make out the colour \u2013 though given his DNA, it must be blond. Light brows endorse that guesstimate. His nearly bare head makes him look even more vulnerable than his size.</p><p>When I was young, I hid behind my hair. Tilting my chin forward, I watched the world slide by between the pale strands, pretending indifference to the resentful body language of my increasingly miserable parents and their half-heartedly cryptic conversations, so easily decoded. I anticipated their end before they saw it, and made plans to go with my father when they finally split.</p><p>But I was missing a few crucial pieces of the puzzle, and stupidly, so was my mother. Neither of us predicted that other woman \u2013 the soon-to-be third wife. The son she would give my father, beginning his third tiny empire, negating the second. Negating me.</p><p>Now, from the static image in my hand, River stares straight into my eyes as though he knows a high-powered zoom lens is trained on him. As though he knows I am on the other side of it. His eyes aren\u2019t the ice blue I share with my father. They\u2019re Reid\u2019s deep blue. Dark, like the sky at dusk in that split second after the sun disappears for the day. His mouth, too, is Reid\u2019s. His button nose is mine.</p><p>What an unfair trick God decided to play on me. This dirty, scrawny, ill-clothed child is mine, and the vision I\u2019ve carried of the life I gave him \u2013 when I\u2019ve thought of him at all \u2013 was a lie. I thought he\u2019d be cared for. Wanted. Loved.</p><p>Sitting across from Bethany Shank four hours ago, I refused to cry no matter how my eyes stung. \u2018I want to see him.\u2019 I heard the words I said aloud, followed by her intake of breath. She was no more shocked at me than I was at myself.</p><p>\u2018Well, let\u2019s not make emotional dec\u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I. Want. To. See. Him,\u2019 I said, my sub-zero gaze freezing her in place. \u2018Find out what we need to do to make that happen.\u2019</p> <p>She cleared her throat and smiled blandly. \u2018Arranging meetings is not a function of my investigative services, Ms Cameron.\u2019</p><p>A good decade older than me, Ms Shank is yet another woman who wrongly imagined me to be a vaporous young Hollywood plaything. I tend to allow the world to think I\u2019m spoiled and gullible. Not only is it mildly amusing most of the time, it makes for satisfying expressions of shock on the opposite side of the table during contract negotiations. Behind closed conference-room doors, I am my father\u2019s daughter. My agent and manager know this. A handful of studio execs know this too.</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow. \u2018I suggest you make it part of your services, Ms Shank.\u2019</p><p>She drew herself up in the chair, her mouth falling open slightly.</p><p>Leaning forward, I fixed her with a concentrated stare. \u2018You\u2019re an investigator. I\u2019m asking you to investigate. Are you concerned about further compensation? Do you require an advance of some sort? I was assured you were the best in the business. I would hate to have to report otherwise to potential clientele.\u2019</p><p>Her face took on the mottled appearance of someone newly disabused of unjustified superiority. Ten minutes later, she left my apartment after assuring me that she would be in touch tomorrow with more information.</p><p>Once she took off, I fell on to the sofa and dredged up memories I\u2019d never intended to exhume.</p><p>I went to live with my stepmother in Texas for the six months it took to get from the blue stick to the birth. My parents were irate and disbelieving when I refused to get an abortion, as though I was staging a rebellion for the sake of extra attention.</p><p>\u2018What do you want, Brooke?\u2019 My mother threw her shoes across the room \u2013 yet I was the one being accused of throwing tantrums. \u2018Whatever you\u2019re trying to prove, it\u2019ll backfire. This will ruin your life. Ruin it.\u2019 A beat of silence followed, the dots connected with little effort.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say Like I ruined yours? Too easy. I\u2019d long since learned not to offer up my vulnerabilities like a senseless sacrifice.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to keep it,\u2019 I sneered. \u2018I\u2019m not stupid.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. She was as proficient at reading the antipathy threaded through our words as I was. \u2018Where are you planning to live as a single, pregnant teenager? Because you\u2019re not living here in my house.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019d intended to deliver a jarring dose of reality, and I felt it, along with the sting of threatened consequences. I was more scared than I let on, but that was nothing new.</p><p>Lifting my chin, I said, \u2018I\u2019m staying with Kathryn.\u2019</p><p>I hadn\u2019t talked to Kathryn yet, hadn\u2019t thought my mother would go this far.</p><p>Nothing drained the colour from my mother\u2019s face faster than a reminder of my relationship with my stepmother, the woman my father ditched when my mother got herself pregnant with me. She\u2019d begged him to leave his wife and two daughters, and he had.</p><p>He fulfilled his visitation duties to Kelley and Kylie \u2013 but elsewhere. His other daughters never came to our house, so my father\u2019s previous family skated on my peripheral awareness for the first few years of my life, not quite real. I was too young to comprehend that my mother was a home-wrecking twat until kindergarten.</p><p>Kelley, then eleven or twelve, won a statewide writing award, and Kathryn insisted that her father \u2013 my father \u2013 attend the ceremony to show how proud he was of her. My parents fought bitterly over this atypical plea from his ex. Moving from room to room, my mother proclaimed her rights as his current wife while his guilt \u2013 heavy and sticky as only overdue remorse can be \u2013 compelled him to dismiss her demands.</p><p>In the end, all three of us attended a programme that had nothing to do with my mother or me. Mom took me to her salon that morning and we had our hair and nails done, as though we were attending a gala event. At the mall, she chose coordinating outfits for the two of us, giggling into the dressing-room mirror that we\u2019d look like sisters instead of mother and daughter.</p><p>My father and his ex-wife sat next to each other, more congenial than my parents were with each other. We sat in a tense row, a phoney testament to post-divorce cooperation: me, Mom, Dad, Kathryn and Kylie, who leaned up to give me dirty looks until her mother leaned down and said something that made her face go scarlet.</p><p>The final straw, I think, was my father\u2019s exuberance when Kelley\u2019s name was called and she crossed the stage. Sticking his fingers in the sides of his mouth, he whistled as he did on the soccer field when I hijacked the ball from an opponent or kicked a goal. I hadn\u2019t known he could feel that way about anyone but me.</p><p>\u2018Kenneth,\u2019 Mom hissed, yanking his arm down.</p><p>They began to argue, first in softly spat words and heated scowls, and then louder until my father gripped her by the elbow and steered her into the aisle and out of the auditorium. Kylie\u2019s wide eyes told me that she wasn\u2019t used to witnessing the sorts of outbursts that were commonplace to me. Kathryn worried her lip, glancing back towards the exit three times as the programme came to a close and my parents had not returned.</p><p>Kelley appeared at the end of the row with a wooden plaque in her hands, her name and accomplishment carved into the brass plate affixed to the front. \u2018Look, Mama, they spelled my name right! Where\u2019s Daddy? Can we get milkshakes now?\u2019</p><p>Kathryn glanced at me, the two empty seats between us, and the aisle where neither of my parents was visible. \u2018I\u2019m not sure where your father is ... but we can\u2019t leave Brooke here alone ...\u2019</p><p>Kelley and Kylie stared at me and I stared back. Their clear blue eyes were the same colour as mine. The same as my father\u2019s eyes. Our father\u2019s eyes. For the first time, I realized I had sisters. Kylie glared, out of her mother\u2019s sight.</p><p>I had sisters, and they hated me.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just bring her!\u2019 Kelley said, shrugging.</p><p>Thus began my odd relationship with my father\u2019s former family.</p><p>Eleven years later, it was Kathryn I begged for help. It was Kathryn who took me in, hired an attorney to oversee the adoption, and helped me leaf through scrapbooks made by prospective adoptive parents \u2013 all white teeth, spotless homes and financial portfolios, and promises of a future full of love for some lucky infant.</p><p>I chose wrong, didn\u2019t I? I couldn\u2019t have chosen more wrong.</p><p>Refusing to read up on post-pregnancy, I didn\u2019t know what to expect after he was born. Kathryn tried to warn me about the possible physical and psychological side effects, but I ignored her warnings, insisting that my personal trainer and I would deal with the physical issues, and as for the so-called mental distress \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t miss a baby I didn\u2019t want, because that would be crazy.</p><p>After I signed the forms the next day, my attorney and the social worker left with the baby. I lay in the birth-centre bed, my hands kneading my sore, once-flat stomach like bread dough, feigning indifference to what that new emptiness signified. I hadn\u2019t wanted to see or hold him, but I\u2019d grown accustomed to him moving around inside me. Only a week before, I\u2019d seen the shape of a foot pressing out just under my ribcage, plain as day. Fascinated and horrified, I\u2019d poked at it with my finger and it had pressed back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears stung my eyes and tracked down my face, and I gave myself that one time to cry over the loss of a child who would be better off without me, along with the cold-hearted boy I was better off without. Staring at the unused rocking chair in the corner of the homey little room, I swore I would leave that place and put it all behind me. I would go live my life and establish my brilliant career. I would forget all of it, starting the moment I stepped out of the hospital.</p><p>Two days later, my breasts were swollen and leaking. The doctor had mentioned this probability, but I didn\u2019t count on the reality of it. My stupid body assumed it had a baby to feed. Or a dozen babies, from the looks of things.</p><p>\u2018What the hell?\u2019 I wailed to Kathryn. \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 I felt like someone had shoved soccer balls beneath the too-stretched skin of my once-perfect breasts.</p><p>\u2018Honey, your body doesn\u2019t know you don\u2019t have him.\u2019</p> <p>I sputtered with indignation. \u2018This is disgusting! Make it stop!\u2019 My nipples dripped painfully, soaking my T-shirt, and I sat on the floor and cried, all previous strength vanishing under hormonal shifts I couldn\u2019t bring under control. My body was betraying me.</p><p>Kathryn called the doctor, who refused to prescribe anything but painkillers, which I refused to take. For three weeks, we bound my comic-book giant boobs, and Kathryn gave me packages of frozen veggies to hold against them while I watched television and read scripts.</p><p>Observing this, Kylie, home for the weekend, suggested I think of it as a bizarre sports injury. \u2018Basically, your tits are on injured reserve,\u2019 she said, and we laughed hysterically as Kathryn just shook her head at us and brought me two new bags of frozen peas.</p><p>\u2018I will never be able to look at peas the same way,\u2019 she observed, pressing the cold bags to my chest and carrying the thawed, squishy bags to the trash.</p><p>Kathryn. She\u2019s who I need now. Without another thought, I grab my phone.</p> <p>\u2018Brooke, how are you, honey?\u2019 Just those words from her and I\u2019m bawling. Dammit. \u2018I\u2019m here,\u2019 she says, waiting while I give up the search for a box of tissues and use a decorative hand towel to soak up the spontaneous tears and stop up my runny nose. Good thing I wasn\u2019t planning on going out tonight.</p><p>\u2018I found him, Kathryn. I found him, and I think maybe ... he needs me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Slow down, Brooke. You found who?\u2019</p><p>I sniffle into the phone, unprepared to speak just yet.</p><p>\u2018Oh. Oh.\u2019</p><p>This is why I called my stepmother. She\u2019s so perceptive, and always so attuned to me. I hadn\u2019t even told her I was searching for River, but I tell her I found him, and she knows.</p> <p>3</p><p>RIVER</p><p>I am small. I am quiet. I wish I was invisible.</p><p>In my old house, I hid when people came. One time, I was asleep on the couch next to Mama when her friend Harry came over. Harry is mean and loud, and I hate him the most. I pulled my blankie over my head. I held my breath and didn\u2019t move.</p><p>But he pulled the blankie away. \u2018This worthless critter\u2019s still here?\u2019</p><p>When he grabbed my arm, I shook my head until he was blurry. I\u2019m not a critter. I\u2019m not.</p><p>He laughed, and his mouth smelled like the trash under the sink. \u2018Critters like this are even scrawnier when you skin \u2019em.\u2019 His hand was like a claw, and I couldn\u2019t make him let go even though I tugged hard as I could.</p><p>\u2018Harry, let him be.\u2019 Mama\u2019s eyes were squinty, but her lips weren\u2019t pressed together, like when she was about to yell or hit. She never hit me very hard, but I didn\u2019t like her to be mad. Sometimes she hugged me after and said she was sorry.</p> <p>Harry squeezed my arm harder, like he wanted to snap it into two pieces. I wondered what sound it would make if he did.</p><p>His fingers looked like bones from a skeleton.</p><p>I found bones in the yard one time, under some old boards. They were a bird shape, but flat. I was real careful when I dug it loose and took it to show Mama, but her mouth made a flat line and she squinted and yelled to get that dirty dead thing out of her kitchen. I dug a hole in the dirt and put the bones in and covered it, because you\u2019re supposed to bury dead things in the ground.</p><p>Skeletons are a lot of bones that make up a whole thing. I saw a person skeleton once, at Halloween. It was sitting in a chair, like it was waiting for somebody. There were big holes with no eyes, but it looked like it was smiling. No guts or brains or heart, either. It was empty.</p><p>Harry was like a skeleton wearing a skin T-shirt stretched over his whole body. Mama told him all the time he didn\u2019t have a heart. When he wasn\u2019t around, she told me he didn\u2019t have a brain. I don\u2019t know if he had guts.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t he ever talk?\u2019 Harry stared at me like I was a bug. Like he was thinking about squashing me.</p><p>\u2018Not really.\u2019 Mama sighed, because I made her sad.</p><p>\u2018A boy his size that won\u2019t talk? So he\u2019s a retard? You should give him to me for a week or so. I\u2019d learn him to talk.\u2019</p><p>I stared at Mama, telling her no with my eyes. My eyes promised her that I would be good every day. I would do everything she said.</p><p>\u2018This little shit don\u2019t even look like you. You sure he\u2019s yours?\u2019 When he laughed again, I tried not to breathe in the stink.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s adopted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You adopted him? Why the fuck would you wanna do that?\u2019</p><p>Mama looked at me and shrugged her shoulders. \u2018I wanted a baby, I guess. A family ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit, woman \u2013 you better not start whining about your old man again, because I will up and leave right now \u2013\u2019</p><p>Mama\u2019s eyes got wide. \u2018I won\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t.\u2019 Her voice was shaky.</p><p>\u2018Uh-huh.\u2019</p><p>Harry\u2019s fingers let me loose a little bit and I yanked my arm away and ran to the stairs. My heart was bouncing inside me like it wanted out. It swished so loud in my ears that I couldn\u2019t hear my footsteps or his. I got to Mama\u2019s room and her closet door was open. I slipped into the dark and pulled the door shut behind me. I fell down on my hands and knees and crawled through the shoes and clothes and trash on the floor.</p><p>I found my spot in the corner and pulled my knees up to my chin. I wanted my blankie, and my stomach growled that it was hungry, but I wasn\u2019t going back downstairs. Not until Harry was gone. Not until Mama came to find me.</p><p>Wendy never forgets to make dinner. I eat until my tummy\u2019s full, but I hide food in my napkin and take it to the room that I share with Jerry and Sean. Sometimes I look in the kitchen trash can and find food in there too. I hide it all in my room. In a box under my bed, or in my closet inside my shoes.</p><p>Wendy breathes out a big breath when she finds it. She almost always finds it, but sometimes not for a few days. \u2018Phew, what a horrible smell! Good Lord almighty. River, you don\u2019t need to hide food any more. You get three squares a day here. Don\u2019tcha know that?\u2019 She pinches her nose and throws the chicken sandwich into a trash bag. I had to tear it into three pieces to hide it in my shoes.</p><p>I nod and stare at the floor.</p><p>Wendy doesn\u2019t squint, and she never hits me, but she looks sad when she finds the food. When I have bad dreams, she shakes me a little to wake me up. She always says, \u2018You\u2019re safe here.\u2019 I don\u2019t say anything back. I don\u2019t say anything ever. She\u2019s sad about that too.</p><p>But I still hide food, and cry at night, and miss Mama, even if I feel bad for making Wendy sad. Just like I made Mama sad.</p><p>DORI</p><p>I just told my parents what Reid did for Deb last fall. They\u2019re shocked, and grateful, but it hasn\u2019t changed their opinion of him where I\u2019m concerned.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s using his money to buy you.\u2019 Mom shakes her head, aghast. \u2018He has an endless supply of financial resources \u2013 as impossible as it would have been for us to pay for that private room, how is it a sacrifice for him? He\u2019s not stepping out on to any limbs for you.\u2019</p><p>I peer at her. \u2018What do you expect him to do to prove himself to you?\u2019</p><p>Her arms crossed over her chest like a shield, she slumps back into her chair and scowls at the tabletop. \u2018I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, to be honest. We\u2019re always going to be worried that you\u2019ll end up hurt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mom, horrible things happen, and we can\u2019t prevent them. There isn\u2019t some grand destiny controlling it all \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Dori.\u2019 Dad has tears in his eyes. \u2018Have you lost your faith? Have you really?\u2019</p><p>I stare at my hands, because I can\u2019t look at him and answer truthfully. \u2018Maybe what I have faith in right now is the fact that Reid loves me, and that I love him. And maybe some day that, too, will no longer be true ... But we all had faith that Deb would become a doctor. We had faith that Bradford and she would get married, and they would be happy together. She had faith in those things too. I always thought that some day, when I lose you and Mom, I would have Deb to lean on. We\u2019d share each other\u2019s grief. And now, I\u2019ll go through that alone. Or maybe tomorrow someone will run a stop light and you\u2019ll lose me too \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dori!\u2019 Mom gasps, and I glance up and see the shock on her face. \u2018Don\u2019t say that. Please don\u2019t say that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? Deb just slipped and fell, and now her life is basically over.\u2019 At the agony painted on their mirrored faces, I amend, \u2018She\u2019s not who she was, and I can\u2019t pretend she is. Nothing is certain. Nothing is preordained.\u2019 Dad closes his eyes, and I hate knowing I\u2019m causing him pain. But I have to make them understand how I feel, so they can learn to accept who I am. \u2018All I know is this \u2013 I\u2019m loved by my parents, and my dog.\u2019 I lay a hand on Esther\u2019s wizened head and she nuzzles into my hand. \u2018And I\u2019m loved by Reid. I don\u2019t want to think about ten years from now, or two years, or next week.\u2019</p><p>They exchange a glance, and I know they\u2019ve already discussed their united reaction should they fail to talk me out of him. Their Parental Plan B.</p><p>\u2018Okay, Dori. Okay,\u2019 Dad says. \u2018What do you \u2013 what do you expect us to do?\u2019</p><p>I know that any compromise reached will be strained, but I\u2019ll take it.</p><p>\u2018I want you to give him a chance. You wouldn\u2019t object if everything else in this relationship was identical, but it was with Nick instead of Reid.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nick doesn\u2019t have a worldwide reputation for womanizing!\u2019 Mom says, her blurted words finding a too-easy target.</p><p>My answer is subdued, because of course it hurts to think of all of the girls he\u2019s been with, and all he has access to. \u2018Reid didn\u2019t love those girls. He loves me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re darn right he didn\u2019t love them. Or respect them.\u2019 My father shades pink, but doesn\u2019t stop there. \u2018How do you know what lies he may have told them to get them into bed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I only know what he\u2019s told me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exactly,\u2019 he huffs.</p><p>\u2018He wouldn\u2019t have to lie, or say an untrue thing, to get girls into his bed.\u2019</p><p>Mom eyes me. \u2018And that doesn\u2019t worry you just as much? If not more?\u2019</p><p>Esther\u2019s muzzle sits lightly on my thigh, her eyes staring up at me, anxious. I reassure my dog with careful strokes, but I can\u2019t convince my parents that their fears are misguided. The atmosphere is unbearably tense, and their protectiveness \u2013 a shield behind which I\u2019ve always moved freely \u2013 has become a thick bridle. Even as I try to relax within it, I\u2019m pulling against the restraint. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I believe what he\u2019s told me. I believe what he says he feels. And when it comes down to it ... what he says he does or feels is mine to believe or not. No one else\u2019s.\u2019 My voice strengthens with these declarations, and I see that this is how rebellions of all kinds gain strength \u2013 inside the avowals.</p><p>My mother narrows her eyes, and I know her question before she articulates it fully. \u2018Dori. Are you and he \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mom. Please don\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want answers to, because I won\u2019t lie to you. Not any more.\u2019</p><p>Her face is a picture of defeat, individual features downturned in surrender. \u2018So you expect us to sit by while you begin a sordid relationship with a ... a celebrity.\u2019 Her voice cracks, but wobbles on. \u2018A young man who\u2019ll use you and cast you aside when he tires of you \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018If that\u2019s what you want to believe. If that\u2019s what you think I\u2019m capable of.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re capable of any more, Dori,\u2019 she snaps.</p><p>I sigh. \u2018I see that. But maybe you never did.\u2019</p><p>Those are perhaps the truest words any of us have just spoken.</p><p>When I open the door, he pulls off his sunglasses and steps inside, as beautiful as always. He\u2019s toned-down \u2013 as regular-boy as possible, for him: beneath his favourite Lakers cap, brim pulled low, wisps of blond hair fall across his forehead and curl around his ears and temples. He\u2019s wearing his button-fly jeans. His navy T-shirt isn\u2019t too closely fitted, but even still, it can\u2019t hide the solid curve of his wide shoulders and sculpted torso.</p> <p>I press my face to his chest. Pulling me close, he wraps his arms around me and takes a deep, easy breath as I curl into him. I know that nothing is static. Nothing remains the same forever, no matter how much I wish it would. But in this moment, I love this boy, and I know he loves me, and I don\u2019t care if at some point that will no longer be true.</p><p>But my parents? I recall the words we exchanged and all the ones we held back, and I can\u2019t picture them ever coming around to accepting him \u2013 accepting us.</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 He turns the brim of the cap backwards and tips my chin to examine my eyes. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019</p><p>I duck my worried face back to his chest, muffling my words. \u2018I can\u2019t believe I thought this would work.\u2019</p><p>He cups my shoulders in his palms, angling me away from his chest and peering into my eyes. \u2018So little confidence in my charm, Dori? I won you over, didn\u2019t I? Although I suppose we\u2019d fare better if we don\u2019t reveal a few of my more appealing attributes to your parents ... Your obsession with my button-fly jeans, for example, might lose something in translation.\u2019</p><p>I choke an incredulous laugh. This is never going to work. Without loosening my grip on him, I chew my lip and he quirks an eyebrow, waiting. \u2018Can we just run away from home?\u2019</p> <p>His mouth breaks into a grin, eyes flashing mischief. \u2018Sure. Where to? Paris? Madrid? It\u2019s summer in Melbourne, you know.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m so not used to these surreal sorts of conversations. I know he\u2019s playing along with my apprehension, giving me an out he knows I won\u2019t take, but if my request was serious, none of these are impossible destinations. A couple of days ago, he asked me about my birthday, which is a month away. In a humorous attempt at subtlety, he brought up cars a half-hour later, quizzing me about transmission types and favourite colours.</p><p>Not quite believing he was seriously considering such an outrageous gift, I mentioned that I won\u2019t need a car at Cal. \u2018Hmm, yeah,\u2019 he said, preoccupied with a video game. I thought that was the end of it until later, sitting at his kitchen table, he asked me how I intended to get around in Berkeley without a car.</p><p>\u2018Awesome public transportation. And I\u2019m taking my bike.\u2019</p><p>He paused, a forkful of pasta halfway between his plate and his mouth. \u2018A bike, as in a bicycle?\u2019</p><p>I laughed. \u2018No \u2013 the other kind of bike. I\u2019m actually a closet Hell\u2019s Angel. Wanna go for a spin on my Harley?\u2019</p><p>I squeaked when he pulled me from my chair on to his lap.</p><p>Hands gripping my waist, he bowed his mouth to my ear and breathed, \u2018Yes. Yes, I do.\u2019 And then his father strode into the kitchen, announcing his presence by clattering dishes on to the butcher-block island while feigning ignorance of our PDA-laden presence at the table.</p> <p>Now, I tap a finger against my chin and pretend to consider running away from home to Melbourne. If only. \u2018I guess I should pack my swimsuit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmm. Better and better. Do you own a bikini?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, no.\u2019</p><p>That single dimple appears at the edge of his lopsided smile. \u2018Then I guess we have some shopping to do first.\u2019 He lowers his mouth to mine just as my dad \u2013 who refuses to pretend he doesn\u2019t see us \u2013 emerges from the hallway to his study and clears his throat.</p><p>\u2018Well, that went well.\u2019 Sarcasm is a favourite line of defence for Reid.</p><p>I knew Mom and Dad might be inflexible. I couldn\u2019t very well expect them to feign delight when they\u2019re so opposed to the notion of Reid and me together, but I never thought they\u2019d be openly prejudicial. My altruistic parents urged their daughters to reject racism, bigotry and intolerance, and our entire lives, Deb and I learned by following their examples. Now I\u2019m facing the fact that their broad-mindedness only exists so long as the individuals aren\u2019t famous and affluent.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid to look up at him \u2013 to see how he\u2019s dealing with the short, denigrating interview my parents just put him through. He seems remarkably unperturbed by what they said and how they said it \u2013 more so than I am. I\u2019m livid and embarrassed.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know it would be that ... unpleasant.\u2019</p><p>He chuckles. \u2018Unpleasant, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Understatement?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A bit, yeah.\u2019</p><p>My parents have gone to their room, leaving the brightly lit living room to us. The soft mumble of their voices signals their open door at the top of the staircase \u2013 an unspoken edict that Reid is not to set foot on the stairs, let alone into my bedroom.</p><p>They weren\u2019t this watchful four years ago, when I was dating Colin, who pretended to be trustworthy and decent, not that I blame them for failing to see through his fa\u00e7ade. I just wish they could understand that one of the things I respect about Reid is \u2013 oddly enough \u2013 the fact that he\u2019s honest about who he is and what he wants, no matter what it is. I guess that\u2019s why I believe him when he says he wants me. When he says he loves me.</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 He bumps my knee with his, and then turns to draw my legs over his and pull me closer. \u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you?\u2019</p><p>He half-smiles. \u2018C\u2019mon now. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d let a little parental reproach stand in my way, do you? You know me better than that. I live for disapproval. It\u2019s expected of me. My fans would think I was dying or something if parents started randomly approving of me.\u2019</p><p>4</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Travel is nothing unusual for me. Though getting from one place to another via various airports is tedious as all get-out, it\u2019s just something to endure. It\u2019s not panic-inducing, for chrissake. Even so, my flight leaves in three hours, and every time I think about landing in Austin, I feel like I\u2019m going to puke.</p><p>One wheeled Louis Vuitton bag waits by the front door, and in ten minutes the other will join it, ready for the car service to transport me to LAX. I\u2019ve put off calling Reid back, still unused to voluntarily sharing information with him. Doing so borders on trust \u2013 something altogether unnatural in conjunction with Reid Alexander. But I said I\u2019d keep him posted, so I dial his number, fully expecting to go to voicemail.</p><p>Instead, he answers, annoyingly cheerful. \u2018Hey, I was just about to call you.\u2019</p><p>Balancing the phone between my shoulder and ear, I sweep a load of cosmetics from the vanity counter into a travel bag and zip it shut. \u2018You know this is Brooke, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I looked this time. Aren\u2019t you proud?\u2019</p><p>What right does he have to be so fucking happy? Oh, yeah. Because he\u2019s Reid Alexander, who checks out of any sense of responsibility over anything ever. \u2018Glancing at your screen before answering your phone is a debatable source of pride, Reid, though I guess you have to take it where you find it.\u2019</p><p>He ignores the barb. \u2018So what did you find out?\u2019</p><p>Am I actually talking to Reid, or has some alien taken over his body? He\u2019s too happy to be ill. Though I sure as hell know crazy people can be irrationally happy. \u2018Uh, well, Bethany brought a photo of him \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really? Wow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2013 and like I told you, he\u2019s in foster care. Long-term foster care.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean \u2013 \u201clong-term\u201d?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The parental rights of his adoptive mother were officially terminated months ago. Her husband died a couple of years ago \u2013 Bethany\u2019s checking on how, not that it matters. It looks like she started using meth after that and didn\u2019t care who she took down with her. She\u2019s been through court-ordered treatment twice and blew it both times, so she\u2019s never getting him back.\u2019 I think about a two-year-old River, left with no father and a drug-zombie of a mother \u2013 and I stuff two pairs of jeans into my case with more force than necessary. \u2018I don\u2019t know where she is now \u2013 jail, crack house, on the streets hooking for daily hits \u2013 and I don\u2019t care.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus. Wow.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes at his second wow. I\u2019m so not in the mood for his incredulity. Not when I\u2019m damned sure he\u2019s going to drop this cold as soon as he knows what I\u2019m about to do.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to Austin.\u2019</p><p>If question marks were audible, I\u2019d have just heard one from his end.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s where he is \u2013 just south of Austin.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019re going to go to Austin to \u2013 what?\u2019 Suspicion laces his tone, not so glib now, like he\u2019s finally getting it.</p><p>I told Kathryn and Bethany Shank that this trip was part responsibility, part curiosity, but that was stretching the truth. This child I\u2019ve never seen or held exerts a deep, gravitational sort of draw. Against all odds, I feel a bond between us that has for four years surfaced on his birthday only. It isn\u2019t mere curiosity pulling me to Texas and I know it.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to check on his situation. I\u2019m going to find out ... if I can get him back.\u2019</p><p>Silence. Dead silence. I wish I could reclaim the words and leave them unsaid. It figures that Reid would be the one I blurt the whole truth to.</p><p>\u2018Brooke, the kid\u2019s not a pair of Lanvin slingbacks. You can\u2019t just put in an order at Barney\u2019s and pick him up later. You gave up your rights to him. He can be adopted by someone else now, right? You gave him away \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know that, Reid. Don\u2019t you think I fucking know that?\u2019</p><p>I hate that he put it that way \u2013 gave him away. As if I sacrificed nothing to do it and traipsed off scot-free, like he did.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, okay, okay \u2013 but no one\u2019s going to let you disrupt his life now just to \u2013\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Disrupt his life? He\u2019s in foster care. And I\u2019m his mother.\u2019</p><p>More silence, and I think I\u2019m as stunned as he is by my declaration. It\u2019s clear that he doesn\u2019t feel the same obligation I feel, but this has never been his burden. It has only ever been mine. His twelve-step apology, no matter what it stems from, doesn\u2019t extend that far.</p><p>\u2018Look, I don\u2019t expect you to be involved or anything, okay? I didn\u2019t claim that you were his father four and a half years ago, and I won\u2019t now \u2013 not that there might not be some media speculation \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brooke. You can\u2019t seriously mean to go to Austin and bring him back to LA? What about your career? Or the fact that you\u2019re twenty? And single?\u2019</p> <p>I should have known he wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u2018What, like there\u2019s no such thing as a single mother? Besides which, I can\u2019t think that far ahead right now. All I know is he needs me and I\u2019m going and I don\u2019t give a shit who thinks what about it, including you. Just deny you\u2019re his father, if it comes to that. I\u2019m sure Graham and Emma won\u2019t tell, and they\u2019re the only ones who know. I have to go now. Later, Reid.\u2019</p><p>I press end and toss the phone on to the bed.</p><p>I still hate saying Graham\u2019s name. Or thinking about him. I press my fingers to my sternum, hard, because it hurts. It always hurts when I think about him.</p><p>The weather in Austin is close to that of Los Angeles this time of year, though it\u2019s a bit more volatile. I roll up a jacket and cram it alongside the jeans. And then I stop dead, thinking about River. He\u2019ll need clothes. And toys. And soap. And ... whatever else kids his age need. Special food? A nanny? I have no idea. I have no idea. The enormity of this decision swirls around me and fills the room, insinuating that I can\u2019t possibly do this.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to fail. One way or another, I\u2019m going to fail.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard those same sorts of prophecies inside my own head my entire life, and I learned long ago to ignore them. At fifteen, I decided to become a movie star, and now I am. I run my career and my personal life as I see fit, and no one \u2013 no one \u2013 tells me what to do. I screw up occasionally \u2013 like I did with Graham. That failure cost me my best friend, and I\u2019ll never come to terms with it. \u2018Dammit,\u2019 I mutter, yanking the second case from the bed and shoving Graham Douglas from my mind. Again.</p><p>If I get to Austin and believe there\u2019s a viable alternative to me taking my son back, I\u2019ll consider it. Otherwise, I\u2019m just going to have to figure this single parent shit out.</p><p>REID</p><p>Shit. Shit, shit, shit.</p><p>Tonight, Dori and I have our first public date. We have literally days until she leaves for Berkeley, which is an ass-numbingly boring five-hour drive from LA. The last thing I want to do is drop Oh by the way \u2013 I\u2019m a father ... sort of on her right before she goes.</p> <p>The longer I don\u2019t tell her, the worse it becomes that I haven\u2019t.</p><p>Unless she never finds out.</p><p>The probability of Brooke actually bringing the kid home with her like he\u2019s a puppy from the pound is doubtful. Aside from the legal implications of her having relinquished her rights to him, there\u2019s the simple fact that Brooke Cameron doesn\u2019t voluntarily interact with children. Even Graham\u2019s kid seemed like no more than a means to an end to her \u2013 an inconvenience she knew she\u2019d have to tolerate to be with him. She\u2019s got a younger half-brother, I think, born after we split, but I\u2019ve never seen a single photo of her with him. Although that could have as much to do with avoidance of her father, whom she loathes.</p><p>Would Dori do that for me? Though I don\u2019t plan to claim paternity publicly, no matter what I plead guilty to privately.</p><p>Christ, I can\u2019t even go there right now. Dori was abandoned by that guy in high school, and on the surface, what happened between Brooke and me looks no different. Except that Brooke told me she was pregnant ... and then I abandoned her.</p><p>Fuck. If I was religious, I would cross myself.</p><p>Life was so much easier before I had a conscience.</p><p>Brooke has complete control over what happens now, and I\u2019m never fond of that scenario. She\u2019s volatile and impulsive \u2013 not a safe combination, though she said she wouldn\u2019t tell. Graham and Emma aren\u2019t going to out me, either, though I can just imagine their united disapproval, if I happen to run into them.</p> <p>Once I find out what Brooke plans to do, I\u2019ll tell Dori.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Good plan.</p><p>Dori: What are we doing? A hint, please? Or just tell me? I don\u2019t know what to wear.</p><p>Me: A casual dinner, then a party at my friend John\u2019s place.</p><p>Dori: A party??</p><p>Me: It\u2019s not a big deal. If you don\u2019t want to go, we don\u2019t have to.</p><p>Dori: No. If this is how you want to do it, then let\u2019s do it. What should I wear?</p><p>Me: Whatever you want</p><p>Dori: You always say that!</p><p>Me: And I always mean it.</p><p>5</p><p>DORI</p><p>There\u2019s been no change in my sister in the five months since her accident, and according to her prognosis, none is expected. Locked in a persistent vegetative state, she continues to exist, but nothing more. My parents finally stopped asking God for a miracle with every dinner-table prayer, so I no longer have to bite back words that keep my stomach twisted into knots. Now, they simply request God\u2019s care of her \u2013 a prayer that still swells from the last traces of faith in my heart, even as I deem it incompatible with the fact that she\u2019s in this condition at all.</p><p>I\u2019m spending time with Deb this afternoon, killing time before meeting Kayla and Aimee for another of their Cinderella transformations. While trimming the stems of the tulips I picked up on the way over, I relay the latest developments in my life. I\u2019m getting better, but these one-sided conversations still feel contrived. When Mom, Dad or Nick comes with me, I\u2019m silent except for replies to something they say. I\u2019ll stroke Deb\u2019s arm, help feed her, sing her favourite songs, brush her hair \u2013 but I only speak to her when we\u2019re alone, like we are now.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going out to dinner with Reid tonight,\u2019 I tell her, followed by the clip-clip of my scissors pruning an inch from each stem.</p><p>The day after Reid\u2019s return to my life just days ago, I\u2019d confided the truth of our newfound relationship into Deb\u2019s silent room. I felt like such a coward \u2013 confessing secrets to my mute, unresponsive sister and no one else. Now, my parents are aware of it, but their biased judgement of Reid means my sharing stops there. Deb, once again, is my confidante.</p><p>What I would give for her fair-minded advice instead of this silence. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019d think of Reid, or our relationship, but she would tell me straight up, without any candy-coating. And in the end, she\u2019d support whatever decision I made. Instead, I hear only the views of distraught parents and celebrity-awed friends. Neither feels credible.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re also going to a party. Crazy, right? Me, at a Hollywood party ... His friend John isn\u2019t a celebrity, but he sounds like sort of a social climber.\u2019 A sobering thought hits me then, as if Deb had stated it. \u2018I guess I shouldn\u2019t judge, though \u2013 most people are going to think the same of me. Or worse.\u2019 Gold digger.</p><p>I straighten the soft blanket on Deb\u2019s bed and perch next to her. \u2018I have no idea what to wear tonight, so I invited Kayla and Aimee to come over and do their worst.\u2019 Laughing softly, I recall my friends\u2019 doubly silent response when I phoned to tell them about Reid and our impending debut. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever known either of them to be stunned into silence \u2013 certainly not both of them at the same time. Five seconds later, they erupted into a breakneck dialogue about designers, colour palettes, shoe trends and hairstyles, and all the reasons I\u2019d been reluctant to tell them came rushing back.</p><p>The last time I\u2019d allowed them free rein with my clothes and make-up, I\u2019d woken up in Reid\u2019s bed with the worst hangover imaginable.</p><p>There were worse alternatives than that, though, one of which almost happened. I almost left a nightclub with a possibly psychotic stranger due to my alcohol-compromised state. Instead, I woke up to the beginnings of a fairytale love. One I still can\u2019t quite believe is real.</p><p>After arguing with each other for ten minutes as though I\u2019m not standing there, Aimee and Kayla settle for a turquoise silk top with beading around the hem and neckline (Kayla\u2019s), a pair of dark, pressed jeans in an unfamiliar brand (Aimee\u2019s), and fuzzy chocolate boots (also Aimee\u2019s, and flat-heeled, thank the Lord). Naturally, they refuse to consider any of my clothing for more than half a second.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Aimee says. \u2018Noooooo. You should never wear your clothes when you go out with him. I\u2019m not kidding. Never.\u2019</p><p>I decide to panic about that later. Right now, I don\u2019t have time.</p><p>Trying to talk Kayla out of using her mammoth case of cosmetics on me is futile, but we compromise with a semi-natural look when I remind her that Reid has only ever seen me with next-to-no make-up. \u2018Except for the hangover night,\u2019 I add, and they both avert their eyes, each reproached for letting me out of her sight at that club.</p><p>\u2018You guys, stop with the guilty faces!\u2019 They peer back at me, sheepish, and I shake my head, insisting, \u2018I made my own foolish decisions that night. I got luckier than I deserved when Reid spotted me. I don\u2019t blame you and I never did. I\u2019m just not used to a lot of make-up, and I want to feel comfortable tonight.\u2019</p><p>Did I just say comfortable? What a totally unrealistic request.</p><p>\u2018Did you notice how she just went, \u201cReid,\u201d like you\u2019d say, \u201cClark\u201d or \u201cJosh\u201d?\u2019 Aimee asks Kayla, who nods. They both sigh, and I struggle to resist an eye roll.</p><p>From the moment Aimee and Kayla arrived and even when Reid arrives to pick me up, Mom is conspicuously absent. She vanished behind my parents\u2019 closed bedroom door before I came home from Deb\u2019s and hasn\u2019t come out. Dad does his fatherly duty, opening the door and uttering his unfailingly polite, if clipped, \u2018Good evening, Reid.\u2019</p><p>I hear Reid\u2019s response as I reach the top of the stairs, Kayla and Aimee at my heels. \u2018Good evening, Mr Cantrell.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reverend Cantrell,\u2019 my father corrects, not meanly, but not in the playful manner in which he\u2019d have spoken to Nick \u2013 whom he directed, Call me Doug.</p><p>\u2018Reverend Cantrell,\u2019 Reid parrots, unfazed, releasing my father\u2019s hand as I come into view. I soak up the sight of him, despite having seen him yesterday. His blue button-down and jeans seem understated, but I\u2019d bet twenty dollars he knows exactly what wearing that particular shade of blue does to his eyes.</p><p>I\u2019ll be lucky if Kayla doesn\u2019t press so close to my back that I end up in a heap at the bottom of the staircase. \u2018Aimee,\u2019 she squeaks. \u2018That\u2019s. Really. Him.\u2019</p><p>Reid\u2019s eyes sweep over me from head to toe and back, unhurriedly, with no care of his rapt audience \u2013 my father or either of my star-struck friends. \u2018Beautiful,\u2019 he says, taking my hand, and I\u2019m immediately thankful for my friends and their fairy-godmother skills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>REID</p><p>\u2018Ready?\u2019 I ask her, and it won\u2019t be the last time tonight I do so. We\u2019re in a short line of cars waiting for the valet.</p><p>Unhooking her seat belt, she takes a deep breath and squares her shoulders, as if she\u2019s preparing for a challenging Olympic performance instead of a night out. Her huge brown eyes turn to me as she nods. \u2018Ready.\u2019</p><p>I suppress a laugh and lean to kiss her temple. \u2018This will all be over soon, and we\u2019ll be old news. I promise.\u2019 These words have a fifty-fifty chance of becoming truth. Same chance of turning out to be entirely false ... but I prefer to be optimistic about my promises.</p> <p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 she says, so very serious. And trusting. Which is why tonight, I chose one of the places celebrities go when we want to feel a bit like ordinary people \u2013 ordinary, wealthy people who don\u2019t have to endure being photographed everywhere they go: Chateau Marmont. Paparazzi aren\u2019t allowed into the long bricked drive, let alone up the steps or inside. Cameras are completely prohibited in the restaurant, in fact \u2013 and unlike some Hollywood spots, that decree is strictly enforced. Not that obsessive fans don\u2019t ever break the rules and get away with it \u2013 but dinner on the patio is a dark, candlelit affair. Good luck getting off a perfect shot with a cell phone and no flash.</p><p>The valet exchanges keys and a ticket with the driver in front of us and I slide my fingers down Dori\u2019s arm, taking her hand. \u2018Have you been here before?\u2019</p><p>She laughs as though that\u2019s the most ridiculous question ever posed. \u2018Uh, no. I\u2019ve heard about it, though. Does that count?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm. I\u2019ll allow half a point for knowledge of it. Sounds like we might need to schedule a weekend in the penthouse, though. Or maybe you\u2019d prefer one of the cottages.\u2019</p><p>She smiles up at me. \u2018A cottage?\u2019 Of course she\u2019d be more intrigued by a creaky, cloistered 1930s bungalow than a sumptuous, high-ceilinged suite with patio views of Sunset and the West Hollywood hillside. \u2018That sounds like a storybook suggestion. Should I bring my red hoodie and a picnic basket?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Only if you\u2019re going to say, Oh, Reid, what a big \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 she laughs, pressing her hand to my mouth. \u2018Don\u2019t you dare finish that thought!\u2019</p><p>I run a finger over the curve of her ear, knowing it would be bright pink if I could discern the colour in the dim confines of the car. \u2018I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late for that ...\u2019</p><p>Adorably prim, she purses her lips and changes the subject. \u2018Staying at a hotel in the city where you live seems like an impractical thing to do, though I guess that\u2019s normal for celebrities.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve never done that?\u2019 My last in-LA hotel stay was at Brooke\u2019s insistence, when her whole convoluted plan to lure Graham away from Emma blew up in her face.</p><p>Dori shrugs lightly, glancing forward as I pull up to the valet stand and remember that her high-school jerk of a boyfriend took her to a motel when she turned fifteen, and then dumped her a month later \u2013 when he turned eighteen and she became jailbait.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to beat the shit out of that guy, even if it has been nearly four years.</p><p>\u2018Looks like I have a new goal: teach Dori to be impractical.\u2019</p><p>She shakes her head, bemused. \u2018I don\u2019t know, Reid \u2013 that sounds like an unattainable goal.\u2019 The valet opens her door and she starts before taking another deep breath and accepting his hand. She\u2019s a bundle of nerves. I doubt she\u2019s going to relax all evening, and God knows I probably won\u2019t be able to talk her into loosening up the Reid Alexander way \u2013 with a shot of something old and expensive.</p><p>\u2018Challenge accepted, Dorcas Cantrell,\u2019 I murmur, jumping out of my side of the car and coming around to encircle her shoulders and lead her inside. Challenge accepted.</p><p>I order the chilled crab and avocado for an appetizer, and a bottle of Torront\u00e9s. Dori asks for a glass of water. At my nod, the waiter fetches a trendy bottled water, decanting and pouring it into her glass while maintaining a perfectly blank expression. Dori arches a brow and mouths impractical at me with a smirk. I smirk back. She has no idea what impractical things I can come up with where she\u2019s concerned.</p><p>By the end of the meal, she\u2019s more relaxed. Despite the crush of people, the lush vegetation and flickering candles render the patio cosy and intimate instead of congested. There\u2019ve been no camera flashes, of course, and no one\u2019s paid us any particular attention, other than the waiting staff \u2013 all of them serving us with the same pleasant but impassive expressions. It won\u2019t be this way in other LA haunts. At some point soon, Dori will be fully initiated into the public scrutiny that comes with being or dating a celebrity. She had a minor taste of it last summer, after the patio incident \u2013 but that was nothing.</p><p>Not that I\u2019m telling her that.</p><p>John\u2019s high-rise apartment is bursting at the seams by the time we arrive, which wasn\u2019t exactly what we agreed on when he begged me to let him host Dori\u2019s coming-out party. (Another thing I\u2019m not telling her \u2013 that John and I devised the party specifically to introduce her to our crowd in a less public venue.)</p> <p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 Dori murmurs, leaning close. \u2018Your friend has lots of friends.\u2019</p><p>John doesn\u2019t have friends as much as he has a network of useful acquaintances, and those acquaintances are all not-so-slyly eyeballing us the moment we hand our jackets to the girl at the door and begin to make our way through the crowd. I follow the sound of John\u2019s laughter over the music, feeling Dori\u2019s hand clamped to mine like our palms are permanently bonded.</p><p>\u2018Reid \u2013 hey, dude. Where\u2019s \u2013? Oh, there she is,\u2019 he smiles, spotting her behind me. \u2018Even smaller than I remembered.\u2019</p><p>Dori has only the vaguest of memories of John, since their only meeting occurred during the most inebriated night of her life \u2013 if not the only inebriated night of her life. She smiles back at him, but her grip on my hand doesn\u2019t loosen. I bend that arm behind her back so I can pull her closer. She may be curvy and strong, but John\u2019s right, she feels small tucked to my side.</p><p>\u2018Hey, John. Lots of people here,\u2019 I say pointedly. We\u2019d agreed on twenty or so, and there\u2019s easily two or three times that many wandering around his place and spilling on to the balcony.</p><p>He shrugs and grins. \u2018What can I say? I\u2019m a popular guy.\u2019 Snatching two champagne flutes from the bar\u2019s countertop, he hands them to us. \u2018Welcome, Dori. I hear you\u2019ve made an honest man of my bro, here.\u2019</p><p>I take one glass while Dori shakes her head infinitesimally. \u2018Oh \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>Deftly separating her from me, John smiles and leans close, pressing the glass into her hand. \u2018Just hold it. You can sip it. Or not.\u2019 His hand at her lower back, he says over his shoulder, \u2018I\u2019ll return her in a bit, dude. Maybe.\u2019 His brows waggle and I glare at him.</p><p>\u2018John ...\u2019 My voice has an edge, but he\u2019s set on ignoring me, damn him.</p><p>Stopping at the first huddle of people, he asks, \u2018Claude and Nichole \u2013 have you met Reid\u2019s girlfriend? This is Dori. LA native, Cal undergrad, way too smart for him. I\u2019m just waiting for her to wise up so I can swoop in.\u2019</p><p>Eyebrows rise, eyes widen, and a couple of mouths fall open. I hear my name whispered, along with the repetition of the word girlfriend and speculations of Who is she? John is strategically blocking Dori\u2019s view of a couple of girls whose eyes run over her, one whispering to the other, their joint scorn palpable. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve slept with at least one of them. Shit.</p><p>The couple he addressed, though, smile and recover quickly. They\u2019re both semi-working actors, each patiently awaiting a turn in the spotlight, and it\u2019s standard John to keep his eye on up-and-comers like that. Just as he did with me.</p><p>\u2018Oh! Dori? So nice to meet you,\u2019 Nichole says.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Dori smiles, holding that glass of champagne like an ornamental shield. John\u2019s still got her opposite arm tucked into the crook of his elbow.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know Reid had a girlfriend,\u2019 Claude says, addressing her with curiosity. \u2018This is recent?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not only recent, but virtually unprecedented,\u2019 John answers, proud to be the one to divulge this newsflash. As he escorts her to the next group, she throws an amused glance over her shoulder, and I\u2019m convinced she can handle just about anything.</p><p>6</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Kathryn offered to drive in and pick me up, but the flight is due to land close to midnight, and I have a downtown appointment at 9:00 a.m. There\u2019s no reason to trek out to the sticks just to turn around in a few hours and come right back, in rush-hour traffic, no less. I set up car service and a hotel with an open-ended checkout instead \u2013 something my agent or manager would normally do, but I\u2019m not even telling either of them I\u2019m leaving LA, let alone the reason why. They\u2019d freak out and blow up my phone with all the reasons I shouldn\u2019t go.</p><p>What\u2019s that thing they say about apologizing later instead of asking permission now? That could be the official Brooke Cameron motto.</p><p>My favourite part of flying first class is that I\u2019m first on and first off \u2013 which means little to no interaction with my fellow passengers. That\u2019s a luxury I\u2019m happy to pay for. Tonight, my rowmate is some musician\u2019s kid. I vaguely recognize him, but can\u2019t recall which legendary lead-man-whore fathered him. He ogles me with interest, but I\u2019m not sure if he recognizes me. I check him out while he\u2019s engrossed in an argument with the flight attendant over whether or not he can be served alcohol (\u2018But this is first class!\u2019 he whines, as if she isn\u2019t aware of that), and my short perusal leads to the conclusion that he can\u2019t be a day over sixteen.</p><p>I slip my earbuds in, stare out the window and ignore him. Soon he\u2019s playing an all-boobs-and-blood video game on his laptop, confirming his probable age.</p><p>By the time we land, all the airport shops are closed and the linked seating outside every gate is empty, the wide expanse of polished floor reflecting the methodical dots of yellow lighting in the main concourse. A large metal sign under a colourful collection of guitar art declares my hometown the \u2018Music Capital of the World\u2019. Pieces of this collection stand watch over empty baggage carousels, all but one of them motionless \u2013 probably my flight. I didn\u2019t check a bag, so I don\u2019t have to stop. I\u2019m creeped out in such a huge, nearly unpopulated place, and my absurd imagination \u2013 courtesy two hours\u2019 worth of gory video game imagery \u2013 suggests a zombie apocalypse.</p><p>I hightail it through the nearly deserted airport to the appointed exit, where a car waits at the kerb to transport me into the city I used to know so well. I\u2019ve only been back three times in the past six years \u2013 the first to give birth to River, the second to film School Pride and the third to do a photo shoot promoting the film. Austin and I have grown and changed since I lived here, whether we welcomed those transformations or not.</p><p>I might be able to retrace my steps, but I can\u2019t go back and choose an alternate path. Far too late for that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was fifteen when I went on location without parental supervision for the first time. Reid, a year younger, was the only cast member near my age. As minor characters, we had few scenes and were too often left to our own devices. We quickly formed an alliance against being bored out of our minds.</p><p>One afternoon during the first week, I sat on my trailer steps and watched as he attempted to perform a routine trick on the longboard he\u2019d brought along. Over and over, he glided across the concrete, hooking the edge of the board and jumping simultaneously, but never quite landing it. He was so pretty. So cocky. So determined. So doing it wrong.</p><p>The fifth time he screwed up, he fell on his ass and I chuckled. Scowling, he swiped blood from his elbow and dared, \u2018Why don\u2019t you try it, if you think it looks so easy?\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell him that my stepsister Kylie was a skilled skateboarder, and I\u2019d known how to pop-shove it like a pro since I was ten. Pretending ignorance, I listened as he explained the how-to. When I got a running start before jumping on to the board and pumping it even faster, he looked startled. With a practised flick of my foot, I flipped the board, landed it smoothly and glided by him wearing a cocky grin of my own.</p> <p>As he walked up, I stepped off the board and popped it up and into my hand to give it back. Placing his hand atop mine instead of taking the board, he pushed right into my personal space, eyes bright. \u2018That was awesome,\u2019 he said. \u2018And so freakin\u2019 hot. It makes me want to, like, kiss you or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I said, heart pounding from the physical exertion, the anticipation of my first kiss, or both. If he was surprised by my instant acquiescence, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead, he stepped closer, bracketed my waist with his hands and leaned to give me a kiss that was more like several small kisses in a row, each one better than the last.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know then that he was experiencing his first kiss too. And his second. And his third.</p><p>DORI</p><p>The further I get from Reid, the more anxious I am. I don\u2019t know any of these people, and I don\u2019t know this roguish boy guiding me through the crowd with his hand at my lower back, either. I know he\u2019s Reid\u2019s best friend, but any time Reid tries to describe their relationship, he ends up shaking his head and shrugging. \u2018You\u2019ll see when you meet him. He\u2019s just ... John.\u2019</p> <p>So far, I\u2019ve concluded that John is a habitual flirt and a shameless celebrity suck-up, and his language is as atrocious as Reid\u2019s was (or more likely as atrocious as Reid\u2019s is \u2013 I have no delusions that I\u2019ve changed him, only that he attempts to abide by my limits when he\u2019s around me). Judging by tonight\u2019s spate of accolades concerning my education and social service record, John is also determined to get on my good side. Or elevate me to sainthood by the end of the night.</p><p>I clear my throat to correct the erroneous statement he\u2019s just made to a couple of girls lounging on his sofa \u2013 girls who are now appraising me curiously, as if I have extra limbs or a blue skin tone.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not actually a missionary.\u2019</p><p>He frowns. \u2018But Reid said you went to Puerto Rico or Brazil to hand out shoes or bibles or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh ... I went to Ecuador to work as a volunteer music teacher at a mission school \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mission school. Right. So you\u2019re like, a missionary.\u2019</p> <p>Oh my word. I take a breath. \u2018Well, no \u2013 missionaries usually accept long term or even lifelong assignments; they\u2019re dedicated to doing evangelical work as well as practical objectives like establishing schools or hospitals \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you just said you were helping run a school in Panama.\u2019</p><p>I sigh, recalling Ana Diaz, my programme director in Quito who fights a daily, year-round battle against poverty, crime and uneducated parents who can\u2019t imagine anything better for their children \u2013 who send them out to shine shoes or pickpocket or anything that might put food on the family\u2019s table that night.</p><p>\u2018She said Ecuador,\u2019 one of the girls says, scrutinizing my face. Like all the other girls here, she\u2019s dressed casually, but something about the way the fabrics drape over her says money. Her eyes are dark and alert. I\u2019m certain she can tell that I\u2019m completely out of my element.</p><p>John shrugs. \u2018Po-tae-to, po-tah-to.\u2019</p><p>She rolls her eyes and mutters, \u2018Idiot.\u2019 John feigns an insulted gasp, voicing his unconcern over her opinion wordlessly. Ignoring him, she asks, \u2018So, you\u2019re Reid\u2019s girlfriend?\u2019</p><p>My heart flips over at the word and I nod, absorbing the disbelief in her crooked brow and swiftly repeated head-to-toe inspection.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just \u2013 you seem really ... not his type.\u2019</p> <p>I flush and John turns me, saying, \u2018No need to be a bitch, Jo \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 She leans forward. \u2018I mean, she\u2019s totally unlike his last girlfriend.\u2019</p><p>John stops, turning back to her. \u2018I know you don\u2019t know Emma Pierce.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not her. The first one.\u2019 Her lip angles in a sneer of disgust. \u2018Brooke Cameron.\u2019</p><p>My mouth falls open. Brooke Cameron \u2013 the beautiful star of Life\u2019s a Beach with whom Kayla and Aimee have a love-and-hate-from-afar relationship. The girl who played Caroline in Reid\u2019s last movie. She was once his girlfriend?</p><p>\u2018Jesus, that flaming disaster was like a hundred years ago. And you remember it?\u2019 John laughs. \u2018Obsessed much?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck you, John,\u2019 Jo says, surging up, eyes flashing, drink sloshing on to her hand. \u2018I\u2019m not the one content to be his man-whore sidekick. No offence,\u2019 she tosses at me.</p><p>\u2018Uh ...\u2019 I glance over my shoulder, looking for Reid and fighting claustrophobia.</p><p>\u2018God, okay you two \u2013 that\u2019s enough.\u2019 The other girl pipes up, her voice as tiny as she is. She stands, hands on hips, glowering up at John. \u2018I thought you were going to be nice.\u2019</p><p>He pulls her in close with his opposite arm. \u2018Maybe you should keep your roommate on a leash, Bianca. Or muzzled.\u2019</p><p>\u2018John!\u2019 She shoves him in the chest half-heartedly, the attraction between them obvious.</p><p>\u2018C\u2019mon, Bianca.\u2019 Jo stomps towards the bar setup in the corner.</p><p>Bianca heaves a groan, shakes her head and follows her friend.</p><p>Watching them go, lips flattened, John mumbles, \u2018Well, that was nasty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is Bianca your \u2013?\u2019 I stop, unsure how to classify her.</p><p>He takes the fluted glass from my hand, quaffs half the bubbly contents \u2013 champagne, I assume \u2013 and hands it back. \u2018We\u2019re on-again, off-again. Can\u2019t stand her charming roommate, though, in case you didn\u2019t catch that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm. I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u2019</p><p>He smiles wolfishly at my sarcastic tone, and I begin to see the place where he and Reid connect. \u2018I like you, Dori.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 Reid\u2019s eyes are dark, one brow quirked as he draws me from John\u2019s side. \u2018Hands off, man. I don\u2019t want to maim you at your own party.\u2019 His threat is all for show, as is John\u2019s theatrical palms-up. Reid\u2019s voice goes softer and he angles his head in the direction taken by the girls. \u2018And, uh, what was that about? Why is Jo even here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bro, seriously \u2013 be realistic,\u2019 John scoffs. \u2018I can\u2019t just invite a bunch of guys.\u2019</p><p>The implication is unmistakable: there\u2019s no avoiding some things, like the ghosts of Reid\u2019s sexual past. There are too many girls in his social circle, in this city, in this country, for us to avoid them all. His Hollywood Lothario reputation precedes him. My friends and even my parents are all too familiar with it. I\u2019ve made it clear that I don\u2019t want or need to hear the grisly details, and I think he was grateful he didn\u2019t have to confess them.</p><p>I expect the general public to wonder what in the world he\u2019s doing with me \u2013 I got a taste of that when I tripped and fell on top of him at the Habitat project last summer, sending the tabloids into merciless speculation. I expect to run into starlets and fans who want him, who\u2019ve been with him, even, who might hate me on sight.</p><p>Pretty sure Jo is one of those.</p><p>But finding out that he was involved with Brooke Cameron for long enough that it was a known relationship? He may have loved her. That unforeseen possibility wells up, a reflux of the only fear I\u2019ve refused to face. Despite the rumours that he\u2019s bedded half of young Hollywood \u2013 and the fact that he\u2019s never refuted those allegations, I hoped his heart was mine alone.</p><p>I want to reject the jealousy and insecurity that begin to boil in the pit of my stomach. I need the truth, whatever it is, but I can\u2019t ask him. Because deep inside, I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>7</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Norman Rogers, Kathryn\u2019s attorney \u2013 more of a family friend at this point since he\u2019s been her attorney since her divorce from my dad \u2013 sputters, incredulous, when I tell him I want River.</p><p>\u2018But. Are you sure?\u2019 he asks, as if I would set up this appointment and travel from Los Angeles to Texas on a whim.</p><p>I grind my teeth. I survived the shocked reactions of Reid, my private investigator and my stepmother. What\u2019s one more? \u2018Yes. I want my son back.\u2019 On second thoughts, I should probably get used to this response. Maybe I should call Angelina and ask her how she fielded these sorts of sceptical reactions.</p><p>Eyeing me over his glasses, Norman says, \u2018All righty, then.\u2019 Tapping his gold-plated pen on the pad, he gets down to business. \u2018The first thing we need to do is get in front of a judge and get a home study ordered. I assume you plan to move him to California? If so, we\u2019ll need to get an ICPC to coordinate the case between Los Angeles County and the State of Texas.\u2019 He scrawls his lawyer chicken-scratch across a legal pad, plotting our plan of attack, I assume. \u2018It\u2019ll be up to the judge whether the adoption takes place here in Texas or is transferred to a California court ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Adoption?\u2019 I throw some incredulity of my own at him. \u2018But I\u2019m his mother. Can\u2019t I just ... have him back?\u2019</p><p>Norman stares down at the pad and underlines a couple of things, rubbing one thick finger back and forth on his forehead as if he\u2019s trying to buff away the premature creases this conversation will leave there. The silence stretches until, at last, he clears his throat. \u2018Brooke, River is in foster care. The State of Texas holds guardianship over him. There are specific procedures in place to make sure what\u2019s done now is in the best interest of the child.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019m his mother,\u2019 I whisper, repeating myself, the guilt swallowing me up like quicksand. I can barely breathe.</p><p>\u2018Technically, Brooke, you aren\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>This statement slaps me in the face, stealing the remainder of my breath. I feel my mouth fall open and watch Norman\u2019s brows draw together in contrition, his lips tightening. He\u2019s given me the blunt truth, and as much as I appreciate him doing so, I didn\u2019t anticipate this answer.</p><p>\u2018How long? How long until I can have him?\u2019 A tremor runs through my entire body, starting at my neck and shooting painfully to the tips of my fingers and toes. \u2018Or are you telling me I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t get him back?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Norman\u2019s rueful expression blurs while the rest of the room swims. \u2018Brooke, you gave him up when he was born because you believed that to be in his best interest.\u2019</p><p>I seal my shuddering lips together. I gave him up because I didn\u2019t want him. I didn\u2019t even want to hold him before I gave him away. My relinquishment was no selfless act on my part \u2013 I just wanted my life back.</p><p>\u2018The court will take that into consideration,\u2019 he continues. Overriding my buzzing thoughts, his voice is tinny, as though his words echo through a can. \u2018Best-case scenario, we\u2019re looking at four or five months \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Four or five months?\u2019 My words resound and twang and I don\u2019t care who hears or how I sound. \u2018I can\u2019t leave him in that dirty, flea-infested place for months! I can\u2019t just go back home and leave him here like I did last time!\u2019</p> <p>Like explosives detonating a dam, something cracks inside my chest and to my utter horror, I\u2019m bawling.</p><p>Norman stands and sits, twice, finally seizing a box of tissues from his tidy cupboard and thrusting it at me as Kathryn bursts into the room, dropping into the chair next to me and pulling me to her shoulder. \u2018Honey, you aren\u2019t abandoning him. We\u2019re starting a process here. Look \u2013 we want them to be meticulous. We want them to be careful. We don\u2019t know if there are grandparents who want him, or aunts or uncles who\u2019ve already started this process. Maybe he\u2019s weeks or days away from a new home.\u2019</p><p>She knew. That\u2019s why she insisted on coming along today, and why she installed herself in a chair right outside the office door. That\u2019s why she was so restrained this morning on the drive from the hotel, venturing no opinions about what Norman might say. She already knew, or at least suspected.</p><p>\u2018You want what\u2019s best for him, right?\u2019 she asks.</p><p>I nod and bury my face against her like I had as a child. How many times had I come to her when my own parents failed me? She\u2019d kept me sane when no one else cared what I thought, felt or wanted. But if River has grandparents or aunts or uncles, where the hell were those people when he was suffering?</p> <p>And where was I? Partying, or shooting another insipid Life\u2019s a Beach episode? A second wave of sobs washes over me, but I steel myself against it, like a sharp high face of rock against the tide.</p><p>What\u2019s best for my son is me.</p><p>As if I\u2019d said these words aloud, Kathryn says, \u2018Even if what\u2019s best for him might not be coming home with you right now? Even if what\u2019s best for him isn\u2019t you?\u2019 Kathryn\u2019s words light the landscape of my memory. Graham. The loss of his friendship and that sharp, buried pain in the centre of my chest. I thought I was what was best for him, but really, I hadn\u2019t cared what was best for him.</p><p>I\u2019d wanted Graham because Graham would have been best for me. I still believe that, though I see now \u2013 more clearly than ever \u2013 that I was not best for him. I wasn\u2019t what he wanted.</p><p>I want to be what\u2019s best for River. But what if I\u2019m not?</p><p>I pull myself together. Breathe. Sit up straight. Press the tissue tight under each eye. Clear my throat.</p> <p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>REID</p><p>No paparazzi shots emerge, but one shadowy fan-submitted cell-phone image pops up on one of my fan sites, and within the hour, it\u2019s on all of them, as is speculation about Dori. John texts me the link.</p><p>John: Word is out on your soooper-secret GF.</p><p>Me: Is it ok to murder some of these people? What makes them think their stupid opinions about who I date matter to me?</p><p>John: Come on dude. You\u2019ve seen this a million times before. Literally.</p><p>Me: I know. I just feel more protective of her.</p><p>John: AWARE.</p> <p>Me: Yeah yeah. I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not.</p><p>John: Are you getting her a bodyguard?</p><p>Me: I hadn\u2019t thought of that. God, she would freak. Can I do that without her knowing?</p><p>John: Probably. But then she can\u2019t tell him who\u2019s safe. He might beat up some poor fucker who\u2019s just talking to her.</p><p>Me: And that would be bad ... right?</p><p>John: Sounds like a question for Lawyer Dad.</p><p>When I show up for our second public date, I\u2019m greeted by the sight of the media camped out along Dori\u2019s street. Not many \u2013 but enough to rattle Dori and her parents. A rental van sits in the driveway, backed up to the garage and probably already loaded. Her parents are driving her upstate to Berkeley tomorrow, and I\u2019m not invited.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019ve always assumed they\u2019d take me to college, move me into my dorm, meet my roommate, suffer through the tearful goodbyes \u2013 all that stuff \u2013 just the three of us,\u2019 she told me.</p><p>I don\u2019t expect to be part of every segment of her life, but I feel like I\u2019m in a tug-of-war with them. Consenting to assume second place is not in my nature, and chucking her parents\u2019 wishes out the window isn\u2019t in Dori\u2019s. The current stalemate is a fucked-up sort of compromise, but at this point \u2013 whatever works, works.</p><p>\u2018How much do you trust me?\u2019 I ask just before we head out of her front door.</p><p>She looks up at me \u2013 a little less made up than she was last time we went out. Her friends aren\u2019t here tonight. Her outfit \u2013 pale pink button-down shirt, grey cords and generic loafers in a nondescript colour \u2013 is less hip, a more girl-next-door than her previous (no doubt borrowed) ensemble. As happened with her collection of extra-large, philanthropically mindful T-shirts, though, it turns me on knowing that I\u2019m the guy who knows what\u2019s underneath her plain veneer.</p><p>\u2018Do you need to ask?\u2019 she says.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m still getting used to it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I trust you, Reid.\u2019</p><p>Subduing a brief surge of guilt over the rather significant thing I\u2019m still withholding, I tell her, \u2018I\u2019m going to hold your hand on the way to the car, which will be interpreted \u2013 correctly \u2013 as deliberate confirmation of our relationship. Try to erase that apprehensive little frown. Have you ever been on stage? School play, class skit, anything?\u2019</p><p>She nods, the crease between her brows more pronounced and her lower lip drawn fully into her mouth \u2013 firm evidence of her anxiety. \u2018I\u2019ve done my share of class skits. Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t panic \u2013 I\u2019m not giving you any lines. You just need to try to look ... happy.\u2019</p><p>The frown deepens. \u2018I am happy.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. \u2018Very convincing, Miss Cantrell.\u2019 I trace the little furrow with my index finger, continuing down her nose and gently pinching her chin between my fingertips.</p><p>She takes a slow breath, closes her eyes and relaxes her face into my hand.</p><p>Rewarding her with a deep kiss, my thumb strokes her cheek. \u2018Perfect. Now hold that satisfied expression, and later this evening, I\u2019ll make good on the promise behind that kiss.\u2019</p><p>Before she can lose her nerve, I take her hand and we emerge into the first real shit-storm of paparazzi she\u2019s been subjected to. They call our names and a barrage of questions. \u2018Reid \u2013 are you and Ms Cantrell in a relationship now?\u2019 and, \u2018How long have you two been together?\u2019 while cameras whirr and flashes erupt into the violet twilight. She\u2019s never squeezed my hand so tightly.</p><p>Making certain she\u2019s safely locked in before circling the back of my car to the driver\u2019s door, I open the door and flash the photogs a smile \u2013 a show of gratitude that they left us enough room to manoeuvre from the front door to the car.</p><p>\u2018What about Emma Pierce?\u2019 a voice calls. \u2018Does this mean you\u2019re over her? Moving on?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head and chuckle. Man, they just do not give up.</p><p>It\u2019s been eight months since I delivered Emma right into Graham Douglas\u2019s arms. When I met up with the two of them in Vancouver last fall, they were revoltingly happy \u2013 but seeing the two of them together then only made me think of Dori, the infuriating Habitat girl I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see again.</p><p>Brooke: Call me. I have news.</p><p>Me: On a date. Will call tomorrow.</p><p>Brooke: A \u2018date\u2019? Is that what you\u2019re calling them now?</p><p>Me: Off limits topic.</p><p>Brooke: Fine. TTYT.</p><p>8</p><p>DORI</p><p>Reid is trying to talk me into sleeping over as I slide my feet into my faux leather Payless loafers and he pulls on a paint-splattered Ralph Lauren hoodie.</p><p>\u2018Did you wear that to the Habitat project last week?\u2019</p><p>Glancing down, he shrugs. \u2018Nah. It came like this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Huh,\u2019 I say. \u2018So it looks like that ... on purpose? I guess a good portion of my wardrobe is more hip than I thought.\u2019 Silly me, wearing the less-shabby stuff.</p><p>I\u2019m glad to be leaving town today for at least one reason \u2013 the fact that Kayla and Aimee will kill me when they see photos of what I wore last night. They\u2019ve both admitted to stalking Reid online now, though I suspect they were following gossip about him long before he ever wrecked his car and stumbled into my humble social circle. They\u2019ll be appalled once they get an eyeful of my drab Fashion Don\u2019t, days after their warnings that I should never wear my own clothes out with Reid.</p><p>They never told me what, exactly, I\u2019m supposed to wear in place of what I own.</p><p>He pulls me up from his bed and slides his arms around me. \u2018I don\u2019t want to hand you over yet.\u2019</p><p>Trailing one finger down the jagged, oversized metallic teeth of his hoodie zipper, I say, \u2018We\u2019ve already \u2013 you know. Twice.\u2019 His arms tighten in response and he nuzzles my face with a low hmm. Forget what people say about make-up sex \u2013 I\u2019ve decided going-away sex doesn\u2019t get nearly as much credit as it deserves. \u2018If I stay, we\u2019d probably just sleep anyway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And that would be bad because ...?\u2019</p><p>I press my head to his chest and breathe him in. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like better than to kick off my shoes and climb back into his bed. \u2018It\u2019s my last night at home, at least for a while. Plus, my dad promised to make my favourite breakfast \u2013 banana walnut waffles \u2013 in the morning.\u2019</p><p>His fingers encircle my wrist and he pushes the cuff of my shirt back to kiss the pulse thrumming there. \u2018I can get you home in time for breakfast,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>Eyes downcast, I can\u2019t swallow the lump in my throat. \u2018I\u2019ll miss you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you won\u2019t,\u2019 he says. My eyes flash up and give my misery away, and he sighs. \u2018God, Dori. You won\u2019t miss me because I\u2019m going to see you as often as I can get there or fly you here. In fact, the premiere for Mercy Killing is right before Valentine\u2019s Day. I want you to come with me.\u2019</p><p>I almost forgot about the romantic action flick he\u2019ll be promoting with Chelsea Radin over the next month. Thank goodness I met and liked Chelsea and her husband, Chad, last week. Some of the steamy film stills of her with Reid are unbearable to look at. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to take the live-action scenes. I\u2019d love to ask Chad how he copes with his wife doing scenes like that without wanting to pulverize her male co-stars.</p><p>\u2018During the week? I\u2019d have to skip at least a day of classes, Reid \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, so early in the semester.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He groans. \u2018How did I know you would be that academically conscientious type of student? Bet you got straight A\u2019s in high school too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I didn\u2019t.\u2019 When he crooks an eyebrow, I admit, \u2018I have to study incessantly to do well. Learning new things doesn\u2019t come easy for me like it does for some people, and cramming doesn\u2019t work, either. I did earn mostly A\u2019s, but I got several B\u2019s and two C\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, no!\u2019 he mocks. \u2018Two? We might have to break up. In what subjects did you make these abysmal grades?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pre-AP geometry and biology. Freshman year.\u2019 After Colin dumped me and I had an abortion. When I could hardly stomach going to school and seeing him every day. When I sank into a depression so deep that only Deb was able to reach me.</p> <p>His expression darkens. \u2018Freshman year \u2013 spring semester.\u2019</p><p>I nod, and he pulls me tighter.</p><p>It\u2019s pre-dawn dark when Dad comes into my room bearing coffee. \u2018Wake up, sleepyhead,\u2019 he says, setting a mug on my night table and gently jostling my shoulder.</p><p>I grumble incoherently, having only had four hours of sleep after Reid dropped me off. He wanted to walk me to the door, but I asked him not to because it too closely recalled our final farewell \u2013 or so we thought \u2013 before my volunteer mission to Ecuador. Before Deb\u2019s accident. Before I lost myself, dragged under by the implicit loss of my sister and my faith. I didn\u2019t even begin to resurface until Reid found me.</p><p>We kissed goodbye in his car for half an hour before I could make myself go inside. I waved once before slipping inside the darkened house, and as soon as I shut the door, silent tears began skating down my face. Treading carefully up the staircase \u2013 the last thing I needed was for Mom to get a look at my dejected expression \u2013 I chided myself for being ridiculous. I would see him again in a week or two. Three at most.</p> <p>Dad settles on the edge of my bed now and sips his coffee while I sit up and reach for mine.</p><p>\u2018Ready for a long, boring day on the road, followed by a million trips from a pint-sized rental truck to your new dorm room?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ugh. Dad, sometimes your propensity to tell the absolute truth is less welcome than other times.\u2019</p><p>He chuckles. \u2018You\u2019ll find out soon enough, once we get on the 5. Hours and hours of the opposite of a scenic thoroughfare. Although you\u2019re in luck \u2013 you\u2019ll be treated to my witty company the whole way! If you\u2019re truly fortunate, I\u2019ll bounce my Sunday sermon ideas off you. I\u2019m dithering between either the trials of Job or Hannah\u2019s unceasing plea to God for a son.\u2019</p><p>I crack an eye open. \u2018Gosh, Dad. Gloomy much?\u2019</p><p>He shrugs and says, \u2018They both came to good in the end.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Sure, after lifetimes of suffering and praying for favours that were unobtainable without a miracle.\u2019 Without waiting for his response, I shift the subject to the one we\u2019re avoiding. \u2018So ... Mom is driving the car, and I\u2019m riding in the truck with you? She\u2019s still that angry at me about Reid?\u2019</p><p>He stares into his mug. \u2018She\u2019s not angry, Dori. She\u2019s concerned.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When I\u2019m concerned about someone, I don\u2019t stop talking to them,\u2019 I counter.</p><p>He nods without replying, and I see that he agrees with me in this, at least. Giving up on me, even if he believes I\u2019m making rotten choices, isn\u2019t an option. I won\u2019t push him further, though, because my parents seldom disagree, and I don\u2019t want to be the cause of an argument between them. I just want to live my own life. Mom will either change her mind or she won\u2019t. If anyone can change it, it\u2019s my father.</p><p>REID</p><p>Me: Call me when you\u2019re ready to tell me your news. Headed to an appointment with George.</p><p>Brooke: Give me 10 minutes.</p><p>Brooke wastes no time on pleasantries when I answer \u2013 not that we\u2019ve actually been pleasant with each other even once in the past five years. \u2018I saw the attorney yesterday.\u2019</p> <p>Ridiculously, I thought I\u2019d braced myself well enough for this conversation. Wrong.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve retained an attorney already? Jesus, Brooke, what are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m applying to adopt him.\u2019</p><p>I nearly rear-end the tiny classic convertible in front of me, the Ferrari\u2019s brakes squealing and catching at the last possible second and whipping me forward in my seat. The driver turns and shoots me the finger. I grip the wheel with both hands to keep from shooting it back.</p><p>Whatever cracked idea I expected Brooke to disclose this morning, whatever I imagined her finding in Austin, whatever absurd course of action I dreaded she might try to take \u2013 this is miles beyond it.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God, Brooke \u2013 why? You can\u2019t be a mother to this kid \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why the hell not?\u2019 she retorts. \u2018I\u2019m financially sound. I can provide whatever he needs. And by the way I am his mother.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s lost her mind, though implying that probably won\u2019t do any good.</p><p>Logic? Worth a shot. \u2018Kids need more than a biological connection and money \u2013 they need attention. Two parents, preferably. A family. They need someone to be there full time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, please \u2013 attention? A family \u2013 like you or I got? I have more parents than I can shake a stick at, and most of them sucked. And your parents were so clueless they let you nearly kill yourself on multiple occasions.\u2019</p><p>She has good points, dammit, though I prefer throwing my dad under the bus to blaming Mom. She\u2019s been quietly disappearing nearly every afternoon for about an hour and a half, and I haven\u2019t seen her drink a drop in almost two months. I suspect she\u2019s attending the AA meetings Dori suggested, but I haven\u2019t asked and don\u2019t plan to.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re right \u2013 they pretty much across-the-board sucked ass as parents. And yet you think you\u2019ll do a better job than any of them? At your age? By yourself? And with your proclivity for partying and screwing around?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God-fucking-dammit, Reid \u2013 you have no right to preach at me about screwing around \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not to mention your language \u2013 and before you try to turn that around, remember that I\u2019m not saying I want to raise a kid. And I don\u2019t give a shit who you sleep with, otherwise \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I party to keep from being bored \u2013 or haven\u2019t you ever done that?\u2019 She knows damned well I\u2019ve done exactly that. \u2018We\u2019re single, young celebrities. Partying is expected. It\u2019s practically an unspoken part of my PR strategy. I\u2019ve never given an actual shit about doing it \u2013 I\u2019m more than happy to ditch it. My public relations machine will just have to switch gears. And by the way \u2013 my sex life, not that it\u2019s any of your business, is heavily fabricated. I\u2019m more particular than the media portrays me to be.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s making too much sense, and she\u2019s thought this all the way out \u2013 which is even more alarming. \u2018Okay, fine, whatever \u2013 but you have to admit that having a kid to raise will interfere with your socializing, whatever form it takes, not to mention your filming schedule.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will it? How? Newsflash \u2013 lots of actors have children.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not when they\u2019re twenty and alone.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s silent for two beats, and I think that maybe she\u2019ll be reasonable. But no.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be twenty-one in three months, and I\u2019m not without resources and support. But more importantly, you\u2019re missing the point of this call. I\u2019m not trying to convince you of the rightness of my actions or my suitability as a parent. I\u2019m informing you, not asking your permission. If you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t keep you informed, I won\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple.\u2019</p><p>Shit. \u2018No \u2013 I want to know. I mean, he\u2019s ... he\u2019s mine, right? Jesus.\u2019 My heart rate has doubled during this conversation. \u2018Brooke, I haven\u2019t told anyone about him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No kidding.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I mean no one. My parents don\u2019t know. George doesn\u2019t know. John doesn\u2019t know. God ... My girlfriend doesn\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t manoeuvring through snarled LA traffic, I would take a five-second timeout and beat my damned head on the steering wheel. While counting.</p><p>\u2018I saw that online this morning \u2013 so it\u2019s true? You have a girlfriend. An actual non-celeb, pastor\u2019s daughter girlfriend. Who you met during court-ordered community service? I was sure the whole thing was all some sort of clever public relations scam to help you dodge your recent weed-smoking, DUI-allegations image.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No scam. It\u2019s real.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus. I don\u2019t even \u2013 I\u2019m speechless. You\u2019ve actually managed to shock me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, ditto. This insane conversation is jam-packed with shocking. You want to be someone\u2019s mother, and I want to be someone\u2019s boyfriend.\u2019 I can\u2019t help but laugh, and she joins in, and soon we\u2019re both laughing so hard we can\u2019t stop. \u2018We\u2019ve come a long way, Brooke.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 she says softly. \u2018We have.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what now?\u2019</p><p>She takes a deep breath before answering. \u2018I meant what I said before \u2013 I mean to claim River as mine, but I don\u2019t intend to reveal his paternity. So if you want to keep it to yourself, you can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018River? That\u2019s his name? Did you name him \u2013 you know, before \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. The people who adopted him named him. I don\u2019t know why they chose it. Maybe they knew my name and they thought River was a play on it. Maybe they named him after someone. Maybe they named him for the colour of his eyes ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018He has blue eyes? I guess that\u2019s not surprising in a kid we\u2019d make.\u2019 I still can\u2019t wrap my head around this fact.</p><p>\u2018They aren\u2019t just blue, Reid \u2013 they\u2019re your eyes. He looks like the photos of you that your mom kept in the family room, the ones on top of that baby grand no one ever played.\u2019</p><p>My curiosity overrides any sense I\u2019ve got, and I want to know what he looks like.</p><p>Brooke, reading my mind, says, \u2018Bethany only gave me one photo of him, but I\u2019ll scan it and send it to you, if you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brooke \u2013 are you sure about this? What you\u2019re doing? It sounds like he\u2019s had a tough time. You might mean well, but ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ll send the photo in a few minutes \u2013 I\u2019ll get Kathryn to scan it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So how long will it be until \u2013 you have him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The attorney said four to six months until I can even lay hands on him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know, right? Finally \u2013 someone who gets my reaction. I about shit a brick.\u2019</p><p>This still feels completely unreal. \u2018How will that work? You have to come back to LA to film the show, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m going to have the home study done here, which means I need to establish residence here. I have to talk to Kathryn and Glenn. I\u2019ll have to travel back and forth until it\u2019s final, but I can\u2019t just ... leave him here. I can\u2019t just go back to my life, knowing he\u2019s here without me.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018But if you can\u2019t see him, what\u2019s the point of staying there?\u2019</p><p>She sighs. \u2018I\u2019m praying for a miracle.\u2019</p><p>The thought of Brooke praying for anything is inconsistent with anything I\u2019ve ever known about her.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she sends the photo to my phone. I\u2019ve just arrived at George\u2019s office when I pull it up and nearly walk into the glass door. \u2018Watch out, dude!\u2019 a FedEx guy yells, waking me from my stupor in time to swerve.</p> <p>Inside, I stop and stand motionless in the centre of the glass and chrome atrium of my manager\u2019s building. As I stare at the photo on my display, I realize one thing. This wasn\u2019t real. He wasn\u2019t real. None of it was real \u2013 not until this moment.</p><p>9</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>I\u2019ve been acting for six years and recognizable since the first season of Life\u2019s a Beach hit the small screen. So I\u2019ve had rude questions hollered at me by gossip reporters as I try to get from my car to my front door. Probing entertainment columnists have interviewed me in conjunction with co-stars from films and cast mates from the show.</p><p>In other words, I\u2019m accustomed to people asking seriously violence-inciting shit. But their most invasive enquiries don\u2019t hold a candle to the eighteen-page interrogation I just got from my case worker.</p> <p>Reading over my shoulder, Kathryn sighs. \u2018Norman said they would ask intrusive questions, but gracious ...\u2019</p><p>The topic of the current enquiry is my sexual history \u2013 first time, how many partners since, type of sex, frequency, protection, birth control, sexually transmitted diseases ... and everything I feel, think or believe about any of those things.</p><p>\u2018How many partners? Are they serious? Do I make an educated guess? Round up? Round down?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brooke,\u2019 Kathryn begins, \u2018you don\u2019t have to do \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m doing it.\u2019 Head in my hands, I want to scream. Or break down and cry. Every self-destructive decision I\u2019ve ever made \u2013 and plenty that only look bad because I\u2019m female \u2013 rears up and hisses in my ear that I\u2019m going to look as unfit as that meth-addled idiot who had the chance to be his mother and blew it. That no sane person would ever give me a child to raise, even if he is mine.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m doing it,\u2019 I repeat less abrasively.</p> <p>Squeezing my shoulder, Kathryn moves away from the kitchen table and leaves me to it, offering to make a fresh pot of coffee. I nod, pressing the heels of my hands to my eyes so tightly that no light sneaks in.</p><p>This house has been a refuge for me for so long. Half an hour west of Austin, it\u2019s surrounded by acres of scrubby hill-country; the homes here are large, set a distance apart from each other and constructed from native stone and wood. They don\u2019t tower above the native landscape so much as merge perfectly with it, as though they simply grew here along with the sage and desert willow.</p><p>Even with my eyes shut, I envision Kathryn\u2019s familiar movements from the sounds she makes: scooping coffee from the copper-lidded canister, filling the reservoir, pushing the start button. She pulls mugs from one of the glass-door cabinets and sets them on the artsy concrete countertop decorated with inset bits of china and bottle glass. Along with the coffee, she\u2019ll bring me a home-made oatmeal or macadamia nut cookie, which I\u2019ll work off with a walk to the thin creek that serves as a winding border on one side of their property.</p><p>Kathryn and Glenn have agreed to let me claim their house as a secondary residence, so part of the home study will be conducted here. That means they\u2019ll have to submit to the same sort of scrutiny I\u2019m undergoing: drug testing, criminal background checks, character references. Their home will be inspected top to bottom for safety concerns. Their pet immunizations and behavioural histories will be checked. And possibly their sex lives, allergies and what type of toilet paper they prefer will be investigated.</p><p>My agent calls when I\u2019m taking the cookie-blasting stroll to the creek, and I almost hit ignore. I\u2019m so not ready to talk to her about what I\u2019m doing, but I suppose that isn\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll have to do this week that I might not be ready to do.</p><p>\u2018Brooke! Are you sitting? I hope you\u2019re sitting but not driving. You aren\u2019t driving, are you? Be honest.\u2019</p><p>Ever since one of her clients wrecked his Jeep \u2013 breaking a kneecap and busting his forehead wide open \u2013 when she called to tell him about a big audition, she\u2019s been reluctant to pass on any news to a client who\u2019s behind the wheel.</p><p>\u2018Not driving, Janelle. What\u2019s up?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Okay, cool. First, I got a call from Stan this morning.\u2019</p><p>Stan is the executive producer of Life\u2019s a Beach. He\u2019s been perfectly professional in public, but he was less than enthused when I left the show to pursue a film career, and he seemed to take it personally \u2013 something he hadn\u2019t done when my co-star Xavier quit for the same purpose.</p><p>Unlike my film School Pride, Xavier\u2019s first film \u2013 a drama of all things \u2013 flopped like a trout in the final stages of death. My ex co-star is pretty and beefy \u2013 with absolutely zilch going on upstairs. Perfect to star as a guy who runs a beachfront bar ... not so perfect to portray a character who has thoughts. Rumour has it he\u2019s begging for a chance to get his old role back.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is totally hush-hush, of course,\u2019 she adds and I mmph in agreement. \u2018He broached the unsurprising notion of bringing you back for the season finale. I gave him a half-hearted response because hello \u2013 my girl\u2019s got one successful film out and another one releasing next month, right? So then he said \u2013 again, totally hush-hush-off-the-record-don\u2019t-spread-it \u2013 that they\u2019re planning to bring Xavier back to the show in the same episode, and the angle would be something to do with the two of you in a way that wasn\u2019t kosher before now.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s referring to the fact that when I left the show, my character was underage, and Xavier\u2019s character owned a bar. Every scene we filmed together sizzled with sexual chemistry, but they couldn\u2019t expand on it for fear of losing their family-friendly endorsements. Now, my character would be eighteen \u2013 legally able to bang the twenty-something stud.</p><p>Tastefully, of course.</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019m so not done! Are you sitting?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh, no.\u2019 I whack long strands of dry grass out of my way with the stick I picked up a few dozen feet back, which makes me think of River, digging in the dirt in that photo. \u2018But I\u2019m good. Please, go on.\u2019 The creek gurgles just ahead, where the edge of the property slopes. If it were summer, I\u2019d be kicking my flip-flops off. Instead, I\u2019m hunching into my hooded sweater.</p><p>\u2018So then I got a call from Hillary.\u2019 Hillary was Janelle\u2019s college roommate, and is now a PA for some studio exec \u2013 and Janelle\u2019s number one source of studio gossip. \u2018We\u2019re going to get a call in the next day or so. You\u2019re back up for the role of Monica.\u2019</p><p>I stop dead at the crest of the incline to the creek, unable to reply. I wanted that role so badly last fall when I auditioned. I got two callbacks, but ultimately lost it to my top rival, who\u2019d been born with two golden tickets in her bratty little hands \u2013 a movie-star mom and a rock-star dad.</p><p>At the time, three months ago, I told myself it was just one film, and there would be others, but that call from Janelle felt like a slamming door. Or punishment from a higher power for one of many transgressions.</p><p>The slow-moving water below is far too frigid for wading, but temperatures in central Texas are seldom cold enough to freeze even the edges of moving water. Soon, it will be warm enough to stake out a corner of the large, flat rock that juts into the creek. I spent most of my fourteenth summer with both feet dangling from that rock, skimming the cool, shallow water with my toes while I read or daydreamed, lying back and staring straight up into a big azure sky dissected by branches from the live oaks growing along the banks.</p><p>And then Mom remarried and relocated the two of us to Los Angeles.</p><p>\u2018Brooke? Are you there? You\u2019d better not be driving \u2013\u2019</p><p>And here\u2019s my agent, offering me the role I\u2019ve been preparing for, pining for, ever since I first set my mind on film stardom.</p><p>\u2018Not driving. Just confused \u2013 I thought I lost that role when it went to Caren \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, well, maybe Caren shouldn\u2019t have decided to go drinking and skiing. She broke both legs and her pelvis!\u2019 Janelle is comically gleeful at this announcement; my competition isn\u2019t her client, after all. \u2018She\u2019ll be in a half-body cast until at least summer, and then weeks of physical therapy!\u2019</p><p>The thought of Caren in a body cast is so sad. Not. \u2018Wow, so I\u2019m definitely in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018According to Hillary, Caren just barely edged you out in the first place. You\u2019re in. I have to wait until we get the call, of course, and do my own little \u201cacting job\u201d \u2013 pretending to be all shocked and surprised \u2013 but they\u2019ll want to set up a few meetings before filming, which is going to start in Australia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Australia?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe I forgot this factor. But then, I thought I was out of the running.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not a problem, right? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re tied down to LA \u2013 or even the US.\u2019</p><p>Well, damn.</p><p>DORI</p><p>After a week of orientations, meet-and-greets and becoming adjusted to sharing a room, I\u2019m ready for classes to begin. Entering campus mid-year has made the process more low-key, I think. I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to recognize me from the few public photos, or grill me about my connection with Reid \u2013 but so far, nothing. The first time he shows up on campus and is recognized, my mundane status will be over. But until then, I\u2019m finally here, at Cal. And for the first time in a long time, I\u2019m contemplating my future.</p><p>My roommate, Shayma, is quiet. Whether she\u2019s listening to music, studying, or watching clips or videos on her computer, she wears doughnut-sized, sound-cancelling earphones. I learned the level of sound-proofing the hard way, yesterday afternoon.</p><p>After an informal walking tour of Telegraph Avenue, I came back to the room and found her staring at her laptop, headphones in place. I gathered my things to take a shower in the bathroom we share with four other girls, and came back a few minutes later, settling on my narrow bed to read over my course syllabuses for the hundredth time.</p><p>In an attempt not to exclude her, I asked if she\u2019d like to come out for pizza later with some other people I\u2019d met. When she didn\u2019t reply, I realized she couldn\u2019t hear me. So I got up and tapped her shoulder \u2013 and she screamed like I was looming over her with a butcher knife and murderous intentions.</p><p>\u2018Barnacles!\u2019 I stumbled back, eyes wide, as she yanked the already-askew headset from her head.</p><p>\u2018OHMYGOD,\u2019 she gasped, hand to chest. \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u2019</p><p>We both jumped again when someone thumped a fist against the door four times in quick succession. \u2018Everything okay in there?\u2019 a male voice called.</p><p>Red-faced, I opened the door to find two of our suitemates and two boys from the room next door, one of whom was holding a baseball bat. \u2018Yeah. We\u2019re fine,\u2019 I said, my heart still racing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All four of them looked unconvinced, bat boy cocking an eyebrow and leaning forward to glance into the room. Shayma, giant earpads nesting under her jaw on either side, nodded. \u2018I, uh, just had the volume up too high when I started a video.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re wearing headphones,\u2019 he said.</p><p>She scowled. \u2018They weren\u2019t plugged in.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good thing, or you wouldn\u2019t have working eardrums any more.\u2019 He tapped the bat against his palm, his body flooded with unnecessary adrenalin, no doubt. \u2018Okay, well. Keep it down in here. Unless we\u2019re invited.\u2019 He winked at us before I shut the door.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 I said. \u2018I thought you\u2019d seen me come and go from the shower \u2013\u2019</p><p>She shook her head. \u2018Didn\u2019t see you. You\u2019re sure nothing like my last roommate. She was like a whole herd of elephants every time she came into the room. I\u2019ve never been around a person who made so much noise.\u2019 Gesturing to the headphones, she added, \u2018That\u2019s why I got these. Otherwise, I couldn\u2019t hear a damned thing when she was around. Not even my own thoughts.\u2019</p><p>I laughed. \u2018Well, you shouldn\u2019t have that problem with me. I\u2019m pretty unobtrusive.\u2019</p><p>Smiling, she shook her head. \u2018No shit. Me too. I think we\u2019re gonna get along just fine.\u2019 She narrowed her eyes, still smiling, which made her face look slightly squashed, like a Muppet. \u2018Um. Did you just say ... barnacles?\u2019</p><p>Reid: Last chance to come to my premiere. I\u2019m not going to beg.</p> <p>Me: :(</p><p>Reid: Okay fine I\u2019m begging. John thinks he\u2019s second in line, and it would be so wrong to make that true.</p><p>Me: What about your mom?</p><p>Reid: Hmm. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019d want to go.</p><p>Me: I would if I were her!</p><p>Reid: Then why don\u2019t you want to go if you were you?</p> <p>Me: I told you, I would love to go, but I don\u2019t want to miss class. Stop being a bad influence.</p><p>Reid: NEVER.</p><p>Me: *sigh*</p><p>Reid: I\u2019ll think about asking her. Calling you later. Be there.</p><p>Me: Don\u2019t tell me what to do, Mr Alexander.</p><p>Reid: Cut, cut, cut! You\u2019re supposed to say \u2018make me!\u2019.</p><p>Me: I forgot my lines. Sorry.</p><p>Reid: You\u2019re forgiven. Vixen.</p> <p>Me: Hahaha \u2013 no! You are so sexist.</p><p>Reid: That sounds naughty when you say it.</p><p>Me: You\u2019re impossible.</p><p>Reid: Oh, trust me. I\u2019m SO possible. Please consent to answer my telephone call later this evening and I shall show you, Miss Cantrell.</p><p>Me: That\u2019s better.</p><p>\u2018So where are you tonight?\u2019 I keep my voice low, despite the fact that Shayma\u2019s got her headphones in place and wouldn\u2019t hear a word I say if I was conducting this call in song.</p><p>\u2018New York. We have Good Morning America tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>I glance at the time, which is approaching 10:00 p.m. \u2018Isn\u2019t it getting late there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I\u2019m three hours ahead of you right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What time is your interview?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not sure what time they\u2019ll do the interview \u2013 but we head for the studio in about four hours.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Four hours \u2013 don\u2019t you need your beauty sleep?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do I? Hold on \u2013 I\u2019ve got another call \u2013\u2019 There\u2019s a pause while he checks the display. \u2018Never mind. That can go to voicemail.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not your mom, is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018Looking out for my mom now, Dori? God, you\u2019re cute. It\u2019s just Brooke.\u2019 He clears his throat. \u2018No big deal. I can talk to her tomorrow \u2013 or whenever.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brooke ... Cameron? Why is she calling you? Wait. Scratch that. It sounds like something a jealous girlfriend would say.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jealous? Rawr. I like the sound of that,\u2019 he encourages, and I wish he wouldn\u2019t. \u2018So, classes begin tomorrow? What\u2019s up first?\u2019</p><p>Outwardly, I launch into a loose explanation of my schedule: intro courses in statistics, psychology, sociology and cultural anthropology. I tested out of a number of required prereqs. Advanced English took care of reading and comprehension, and my four years of Spanish \u2013 in addition to the fact that I used it nearly daily during community service projects \u2013 dispatched my foreign language requirement. I\u2019m not as behind as I feared I would be, starting a semester late.</p><p>Internally, I\u2019m wondering why Reid is getting late-night calls from Brooke Cameron, who is exactly the sort of girl I\u2019d have imagined him with months ago, when he showed up \u2013 condescending, obnoxious and oh-so beautiful \u2013 on my Habitat project. The fact that they used to date, and I dare not even think about what else, just makes it more difficult to ignore the fear.</p><p>What competition would you be, if a girl like that decides she wants him?</p><p>\u2018I miss you,\u2019 he says then, and I mash my insecurity into a corner.</p><p>\u2018I miss you too.\u2019</p><p>10</p><p>RIVER</p><p>I don\u2019t remember Mama\u2019s face. I remember parts of it, but not all of it together. Sometimes I dream about her and I know I can see her in the dream, but when I wake up I can\u2019t remember. Even if I squeeze my eyes closed really tight and try.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember Daddy at all.</p><p>Harry told me I didn\u2019t even have a daddy and that I am a bastard. He told me that a lot of times. I don\u2019t know what bastard means, but I know it\u2019s bad because Wendy\u2019s eyes got big when Sean grabbed my shirt and called me that.</p><p>Now he has to do a time-out.</p><p>I feel bad because I took Sean\u2019s Fruit Roll-Up and hid it in my pyjama drawer. I don\u2019t know how he knows I took it, but he does. He tells Wendy, \u2018But he stole my cherry Roll-Up!\u2019</p><p>She shakes her head. \u2018Then you come talk to me. You know that word is on the Never List, and furthermore you can\u2019t go all vigilante justice in this house.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019 he says.</p><p>She shakes her head again and sighs like she\u2019s tired, and then she takes his arm and puts him on a kitchen chair. She sets the timer for six minutes because Sean is six so that\u2019s how many time-out minutes he gets. His face is as red as that cherry Roll-Up and his eyes are angry and looking at me.</p><p>\u2018River. Come with me,\u2019 Wendy says, and I follow her to the bedroom. When we get there, she stands in the middle of the floor and opens her hand. I go to the drawer and get Sean\u2019s Roll-Up and give it to her. It still has the wrapper on. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t eat it.</p><p>She slips the Roll-Up into her shirt pocket and takes my hand. We sit on my bed.</p><p>Her mouth makes a straight line, like she\u2019s holding her words in. You don\u2019t have to press your lips together to hold words in, though. I opened my mouth wide one time to see if the words I was thinking would fall out, but they wouldn\u2019t. If words don\u2019t want to come out, they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand when people say things and then they say, I didn\u2019t mean to say that. Words don\u2019t just fall out. You have to push them out. And sometimes, you can\u2019t push them out, even if you want to.</p><p>I count to nine in my head before Wendy says, \u2018River, you can\u2019t take other people\u2019s things. It\u2019s bad enough when you hide your own food, but you can\u2019t take other people\u2019s food and hide it too. Do you understand?\u2019</p><p>My eyes get full of tears and I nod once and look down at my lap, which makes them run down my face. I wipe them on my T-shirt sleeve and chew my bottom lip. It tastes like the tears now. Like salt.</p><p>\u2018All righty then.\u2019 She pats my knee and looks at her watch. \u2018You sit right there till you hear Sean\u2019s timer ding. Time out. Four minutes.\u2019</p><p>I want to ask her what a bastard is. Maybe a bastard is somebody who steals other people\u2019s food. Or just somebody you hate.</p><p>I hate Harry, and I would like to call him a word from the Never List. I remember his face, and I wish I didn\u2019t. I remember his face, and I can\u2019t remember Mama\u2019s. Harry is a bastard, I think. I wish I could forget him.</p><p>REID</p><p>On the elevator up to my manager\u2019s office, I was at war with myself \u2013 should I tell him about Brooke, the kid, the adoption ... or not? I knew from the start that if there was any possibility of my alleged paternity going public, George would have to know to have any shot at doing career damage control.</p><p>I\u2019ve never worried that what I tell him will leave his office \u2013 it\u2019s like a confessional, without the claustrophobic booth or the Hail Marys. Even so, uncomfortable revelations made to George \u2013 or my parents \u2013 have always been on a need-to-know basis. There\u2019s a shitload that none of them knows, but the fact that I have a four-year-old son dwarfs everything else to hell.</p><p>Undecided one way or the other, I found my manager in a rare, unfocused frame of mind. He didn\u2019t inspect me for indications of suppression, though I knew it was rolling off me like overzealously applied body spray. If he was paying attention, he\u2019d be able to tell, every time. Sitting back, he\u2019d just eye me patiently and wait for me to come clean.</p><p>I realized uneasily that he was starting to trust me.</p><p>All I could think was Damn, what crap timing for that.</p><p>George detailed the bitch of a promotion schedule for Mercy Killing (killer promo is a good thing, because if no one wants to talk to you, your movie is dead in the water), while inside the front pocket of my jeans, my hand gripped my phone like it was either a grenade or a gold bar. Damn if Brooke wasn\u2019t the queen of mind-blowing text photos. As my manager droned, I struggled to concentrate on the three weeks of heavy promotion Chelsea Radin and I were about to do and prayed that something would stop Brooke from her insane resolution.</p><p>George and I spoke about Dori, of course \u2013 he\u2019d seen the gossip sites, and I told him that yes, we were dating, and yes, it was serious. After a moment spent eyeing me like he was waiting for the punchline to an unfunny joke, his mouth quirked. \u2018Huh.\u2019</p><p>I told him I was inviting her to the premiere, but called five minutes ago to let him know I\u2019m taking my mother instead, at Dori\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>After a moment of silence, he scoffed, \u2018Who is this, and what have you done with Reid Alexander?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Haha,\u2019 I said.</p><p>Standing in the hotel bathroom post-shower, I wrap a towel around my waist. My razor is charged and ready to give me the perfect shaved-yesterday trim. While I wait for the steam to subside, I shift between watching myself gradually emerge in the steamed-up mirror, like a suspended, developing image in a darkroom, and staring, again, at the photo Brooke texted.</p><p>Some children don\u2019t resemble their fathers. I look nothing like Mark Alexander, for example. But this child, next to me, would be like seeing John next to his dark lord CFO father \u2013 too much resemblance to be anything but related.</p><p>Zooming in on the kid\u2019s face, I compare his features to mine. Similar face shape. Same eye colour. Same mouth \u2013 full, almost feminine. I got into my fair share of fights as a boy over my girly lips. Until I got to be around eleven and it became clear that girls weren\u2019t bothered by that fullness. Quite the opposite, in fact. I wonder if anyone will tell him that.</p><p>River\u2019s mouth isn\u2019t smiling, and I wonder if he ever laughs. The straight, pale lines of his eyebrows are barely there at all, and their shape, too, matches mine. But where my straight brows express confidence, and when necessary \u2013 conceit, he just looks ... solemn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As though summoned, a new text appears from Brooke. I never called her back after I ignored her interruption during Dori\u2019s call. She called again this morning \u2013 also ignored. She didn\u2019t leave a message either time.</p><p>Brooke: I need to talk. I can\u2019t talk to anyone else about this. Please.</p><p>Reluctantly, I dial her back, imagining some sort of ill-omened soundtrack in the background, intensifying with each ring like a swelling threat of doom.</p><p>\u2018Thanks for calling,\u2019 she answers. \u2018I\u2019m not \u2013 not asking for your opinion or your advice. I just need to talk, and I need you to listen.\u2019</p> <p>Seriously? Just listen and keep my opinions to myself. When has that ever applied to me?</p><p>\u2018Brooke, you can\u2019t just unload on me and expect me to not tell you what I think.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment, and I think maybe she\u2019s about to deliver a terse Never mind and dead air. Or Fuck you and dead air. Or just dead air.</p><p>\u2018Okay. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to follow \u2013 or even consider \u2013 what you have to say.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why tell me? Why not tell Kathryn, or \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Because it\u2019s a career thing. And usually, I would call ...\u2019</p><p>Graham. Damn that fucker. I get it, and we\u2019re even cautious friends, now \u2013 but damn.</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay. Fine.\u2019 I run a hand through my hair. The fact that she just wants to discuss a career crisis is sort of a relief, though I have to wonder what she\u2019d have to say to me that she wouldn\u2019t much rather talk over with her agent or manager. \u2018Spill.\u2019</p><p>She breathes a sigh and tells me how last fall, she nearly landed the lead in Paper Oceans \u2013 an upcoming film that has Hollywood buzzing, even pre-production. Impressed, I have no problem commiserating at the loss, especially since it went to Caren Castleberry, one of the industry\u2019s most talentless, well-connected twits.</p><p>\u2018That sucks. Don\u2019t they know they need someone who can express multiple emotions for that role? She\u2019s basically got one expression.\u2019 I switch on the razor and start a quick once-over.</p><p>\u2018I know, right? If they did a graphic representation of her accessible emotions, they could use the same fucking photo for all of them. The most accurate one would be labelled stoned.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Speaking of \u2013 didn\u2019t she just break her pelvis or something, drunk skiing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. She totally did. Pelvis and both legs, according to my agent.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ouch. That\u2019ll put her out of commission for a few weeks ... for many things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Gross, Reid. Jesus.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just sympathizing!\u2019</p><p>She huffs a breath. \u2018Anyway \u2013 and this is totally classified because it\u2019s not on paper yet \u2013 I got the role.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow. That\u2019s awesome.\u2019 I recall her I don\u2019t want your opinion speech, and I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the dilemma she felt compelled to share. \u2018So what\u2019s the problem?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Filming starts in Australia. This summer.\u2019</p> <p>Ah. Talk about suck-ass timing. \u2018Brooke, you might not get another shot at a film like this \u2013 a role like this. If this is the career direction you want, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See, that\u2019s the thing. I do have a choice. And I think ... I have to turn it down.\u2019</p><p>My mouth hangs open for a moment and the razor buzzes in my hand. \u2018You\u2019re going to turn it down? Because of \u2013 what you\u2019re doing in Austin? Isn\u2019t there some way around flat-out turning it down?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t see a way. I have to be here. In the US. I can go back and forth between Austin and LA, as often as needed, but I can\u2019t adopt a child and then disappear to the land down under for a month or however long \u2013 if the court would even allow me to do that, which it won\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you expect me to \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you I don\u2019t expect even an opinion from you, and I was serious. I just need to talk this out. Fuck. I mean \u2013 God, I\u2019m going to have to stop saying that \u2013 Stan also wants me back for the season finale of Life\u2019s a Beach. I think I can work that into an offer for next season.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Speaker.\u2019 I set the phone on the counter and start shrugging into my interview outfit. \u2018Let me get this straight, Brooke \u2013 you\u2019re going to throw away a major role in a possibly Oscar-worthy film to be on a teenage cable version of Baywatch? Have you completely lost it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018If this opportunity hadn\u2019t come back around \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018If the opportunity hadn\u2019t come back around, your agent would still be looking for film roles, right? Hearts Over Manhattan is coming out in three weeks \u2013 I\u2019ve seen clips, by the way, and it\u2019s going to kill at the box office. You\u2019ll get auditions for more romcoms from that alone. But I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re even talking about that because you can\u2019t be serious that you want to turn down this role.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not always about what I want. At least, not any more. If I mean to be his mother, then he has to start coming first.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean throwing away your career.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t consider this to be throwing my career away \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, crippling it, then. This whole thing could hit a brick wall, where either you or the court says it\u2019s a no-go. What then? What if you turn this role down for nothing?\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s silent, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve landed a point or pissed her off.</p><p>\u2018This is why I didn\u2019t want your opinion.\u2019</p><p>Guess the answer is pissed her off.</p><p>\u2018What, so you wouldn\u2019t have to hear the truth?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, so I wouldn\u2019t have to hear how people talk themselves out of being the parents they should be. The excuses. The selfishness. Don\u2019t you think I want to play Monica?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I think you want it \u2013 that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m arguing \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reid. He needs me.\u2019 She chokes up. \u2018He needs me, and I\u2019m not going to fuck this up \u2013 dammit, I mean screw this up \u2013 not this time. I\u2019ve never done anything in my whole life that wasn\u2019t selfish \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brooke,\u2019 I sigh, lacing my black Prada boots. \u2018Five years ago, you were a pregnant teenager. You moved to Texas. You had him without your parents\u2019 support, without my support. I don\u2019t know why you made that inadvisable choice, but you did. That wasn\u2019t selfish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong. It wasn\u2019t some moral judgement or an unselfish choice \u2013 I just knew that when we made him, I loved you, and I couldn\u2019t ... there was no other choice for me. That decision was about me, and I can\u2019t pretend otherwise.\u2019</p><p>Weeks ago, when she told me that he was unequivocally mine and I finally believed her, I was dumbfounded. But this kicks the breath out of me. When we made him, I loved you.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no choice for me this time, either. Thanks for listening, Reid. I know what I have to do, but I\u2019m not going to tell Janelle right away \u2013 she hasn\u2019t even got the Paper Oceans offer yet. I think I can get through the premiere of Hearts Over Manhattan first. God, she\u2019s going to go off like a roman candle.\u2019</p><p>A slight drawl \u2013 it was never thick \u2013 threads through her words, almost imperceptibly. Must be a by-product of her being back in Texas, living with her stepmother.</p><p>For a moment, I drift in the memory of it.</p><p>And then my phone beeps. It\u2019s Dori.</p><p>11</p><p>DORI</p><p>\u2018I was in class when you texted \u2013 I just got out and thought I\u2019d call instead of text since I\u2019m wearing mittens. So you\u2019re going to come up this weekend? Are you sure you have time?\u2019 After an hour in an overly warm classroom, I exit Barrows and immediately begin shivering in a gust of north wind.</p><p>\u2018I can escape from the promo tour overnight Saturday, but I\u2019ll have to fly,\u2019 he says. \u2018I don\u2019t have time to drive it. I can\u2019t leave LA until after 7:00 p.m, and I have to be back by noon.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019ll barely have twelve hours inside those parameters.</p><p>Like the swipe of a hand across a fogged window pane, I see clearly, abruptly, that this is how it will be between us. Berkeley is where I\u2019ll be for the next four years, and when I try to imagine him, or us, after that, I can\u2019t. I visualize myself, applying to earn my master\u2019s in social work. Possibly leaving California to do it. Alone.</p><p>My teeth chatter \u2013 from cold or fear or both \u2013 and I struggle to dispel the ache from my voice. \u2018What do you want to do ... while you\u2019re here?\u2019</p><p>His low chuckle initiates a warmth in the pit of my belly that spreads like a slow blaze. \u2018Do you need to ask? It feels like months since I\u2019ve got my hands on you.\u2019</p><p>Entering the library, my voice drops to a whisper. \u2018It\u2019s been ten days ... I think.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Months,\u2019 he insists. \u2018And did you say you were wearing mittens? Photo. Now.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head and laugh soundlessly. \u2018You\u2019ll just have to wait and see them in person.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is there a matching hat? And scarf? Hmm, I like the thought of a scarf ... scarves are so handy for draping or blindfolding or trussing \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop that,\u2019 I hiss softly. \u2018It\u2019s abnormal to blush like this in the library, you know. Maybe you should bring your own scarf and I\u2019ll use it on you.\u2019 When he doesn\u2019t reply, I say, \u2018Reid?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry. I\u2019m way too turned on for a proper comeback.\u2019</p><p>I was certain my research on social interaction in groups and organizations would be more productive if I spent my time in the library around other equally studious undergrads. Instead, the hum of low voices and rustling movements of books and papers keeps lulling me into thoughts about the social interaction of two people, connected. Thoughts about the nature of love.</p><p>People in a group attempt to fit together like puzzle pieces to make a uniform whole. A recognizable representation of the efforts and goals of the organization itself.</p><p>I used to think of two people in love like that. Like puzzle pieces, fitting together. But it\u2019s not like that at all. Love pulls a part of you out, and it pulls a part of him \u2013 like taffy, stretching but not separating. The tendrils of each one wrap around the other, until they meld together. One, but not quite. Separate, but not quite. Like my parents.</p><p>And then there are those like Colin and me. He never shared a shred of himself, but I didn\u2019t know it. I\u2019d embedded myself into him because he wanted me to, and thought he did the same. But when he broke free, he ripped a part of me away. He retreated, unaltered, and I came apart, fractured and incomplete.</p><p>What Reid and I have, right now, is enough. I love him, and he loves me in a way Colin never did, but that\u2019s no guarantee of forever. I don\u2019t know when it will end, only that it will, and I want to protect us both. I can\u2019t let myself become a part of him, and I can\u2019t let him become part of me. So I won\u2019t whisper the words to him, even if they\u2019re true.</p><p>Shayma is tossing a change of clothes and her toiletries into her backpack. She\u2019s spending the night with a friend, and leaving the room to me \u2013 and my boyfriend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Are you sure it\u2019s okay? You\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind? We can go to a hotel \u2013\u2019</p><p>She shakes her head and laughs. \u2018Will you stop? If I say I\u2019m good \u2013 I\u2019m good. Hotels are expensive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018One tiny stipulation, though.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019 I say, distractedly glancing around the room. I can\u2019t imagine Reid here. Our low-cost dorm room, the size of his closet, looks like a set of a movie in which he stars as an average, albeit very beautiful college guy \u2013 not somewhere he\u2019d deign to spend the night.</p><p>\u2018I need to meet him. Wait. Two stipulations. Second stipulation: not on my bed, mmkay?\u2019</p><p>My face goes sunburn-hot and my mouth falls open. \u2018I \u2013 I would never \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 Her brows shoot up. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen somebody blush that hard. You\u2019re like ... maroon.\u2019</p><p>I hide my blazing face behind my hands, mortified.</p> <p>\u2018So he\u2019s driving from LA? Flying?\u2019 She plops on to her bed, four feet across from me.</p><p>\u2018Flying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you don\u2019t need help picking him up, since you don\u2019t have a car?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. I\u2019m meeting him at the Starbucks. He\u2019s going to ... get a car from the airport.\u2019</p><p>Her head angles. \u2018Get a car ... Like a rental? Like a taxi?\u2019</p><p>I shrug. Shayma is one of the most low-key girls I\u2019ve ever met. This level of curiosity from her is as weird as if the stuffed Cal-cap-wearing Golden Bear Deb bought for me two years ago \u2013 now sitting on my overcrowded desk shelf \u2013 suddenly struck up a conversation. I take a deep breath. If Shayma is going to meet Reid tonight, she might as well know it ahead of time.</p> <p>\u2018Not exactly ... more like the kind of car driven by a chauffeur.\u2019</p><p>One eyebrow quirks up and her chin shrinks back. \u2018A who? A what? Girl, you\u2019ve got a man with money? No wonder you can afford to be a social welfare major.\u2019</p><p>Shayma is studying international business, and plans to head for London or Hong Kong for graduate school.</p><p>I frown.</p><p>\u2018So he\u2019s what \u2013 trust-funded? Or old? Oh shit \u2013 he\u2019s from LA \u2013 is he Hollywood?\u2019</p><p>My eyes widen. \u2018Are you psychic, Shayma?\u2019</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u2018You know I don\u2019t believe in that crap. The only things that don\u2019t lie in this world are numbers. My mawmaw thinks she\u2019s a seer. Daddy says she\u2019s always claimed to have second sight, but ever since I was a little child \u2013 when she predicted Kelly Clarkson winning the first American Idol \u2013 she\u2019s sworn she\u2019s a bona fide clairvoyant.\u2019</p><p>We laugh, and then I take a deep breath. \u2018So. My boyfriend. He\u2019s ...\u2019 another breath, \u2018Reid Alexander.\u2019</p> <p>She stares, blinks once and shakes her head a little, like she\u2019s trying to clear water from her ears. \u2018Did you just say Reid Alexander?\u2019</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u2018Well. Forget what I said about \u201cnot on my bed\u201d.\u2019</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Rowena: You in Austin?</p><p>Me: Visiting family. I\u2019ll be back in LA for promos soon. Will text with details.</p><p>Shit. Even for an industrious and thriving \u2013 thanks to me \u2013 paparazza, Rowena is scary-connected. I don\u2019t like when she knows things I\u2019m not ready for her to know, and this is too close. I don\u2019t want the media getting wind of River \u2013 not yet. She knows better than to cross me, but it may be time for us to have a come-to-Jesus talk \u2013 a favourite phrase of my mother\u2019s, which is odd considering her lack of a personal moral compass. I think even Jesus would pick up his skirts and run in the opposite direction if he saw my mother coming.</p><p>My stomach drops when I think about this news coming to light, and how it will be portrayed. Of course I knew there\u2019d be no escaping public conjecture about River, but I haven\u2019t considered the best way for it to go public in the first place.</p><p>I\u2019ve always believed that my sex life and sexual history is no one\u2019s business, but that freaking questionnaire stripped away that delusion. The media will be just as interested. More so. To them, everything is possible news fodder and nothing is sacred. The number one thing they\u2019ll want to know: Who\u2019s the daddy? Five years ago, I scrawled unknown on the form. I didn\u2019t care how it looked to leave that line blank on his birth certificate. For myself, I still don\u2019t care. But for River \u2013 how will that affect him?</p><p>I\u2019ll have to control it, and the best way to do that is Rowena.</p><p>Everything has been turned in to the court \u2013 questionnaires, criminal background checks and drug tests (thank God it\u2019s been months since I smoked a joint and years since I tried anything stupider). Norman urged out-and-out candour about everything \u2013 the shoplifting to spite Mom at fourteen, the random recreational drug use, the abundant underage drinking, my sex life \u2013 the real one and the publicized one.</p><p>Lord knows there\u2019s probably detailed evidence of every one of my sins somewhere. If I lie, something is sure to come back and bite me in the ass.</p><p>Now, according to Norman, we wait. Before we leave his office, he asks us to give him character references \u2013 three related, three non-related. Kylie and Kelley are going on my \u2018related\u2019 list, and, grudgingly, I decide my father would be better than my mother, given a choice between them \u2013 and Kathryn agrees.</p><p>Daddy. There\u2019s a fun phone call for later. I doubt he\u2019ll be pleased, but Kelley is pregnant, so it\u2019s not like impending grandfatherhood could induce heart failure. I have no idea if he and wife Number Four plan to propagate, but with three ex-wives and five children, one would think he\u2019d feel kind of been-there, done-that by now.</p><p>On the other hand, whenever he wants an empty nest, all he has to do is leave.</p><p>I nearly draw a blank on the three non-related sources, because the first person to come to mind is Graham. But of course, we\u2019re not speaking. I stare at the form in my lap, swallowing the hot mix of guilt and grief. I print MiShaun Grant and copy her contact information from my phone. She\u2019s the only actress in my age range for whom I have both respect and a working phone number. I add Dana Scatio \u2013 the director of Hearts Over Manhattan. She loves me, and (bonus) was my most recent boss, of sorts.</p><p>\u2018What about Janelle, my agent?\u2019 I ask. Note to self: I need to inform Janelle about River.</p><p>Norman frowns. \u2018She\u2019s an option, if you can\u2019t think of anyone else.\u2019 His expression says That can\u2019t possibly be true, can it? \u2018Technically, she works for you and has a vested interest in getting you what you want, so she\u2019s deemed a less reliably candid source. The caseworker will likely contact her when they do the sweep through everyone with whom you\u2019ve had substantial interaction. These six are merely the ones you deem most likely to give a favourable, yet realistic depiction of you.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m gripping the pen in my hand so hard that the metal clip bites into my palm, and my world goes a bit fuzzy at the edges. \u2018Sorry \u2013 but did you just say they\u2019re going to speak with ... everyone?\u2019</p><p>In what\u2019s left of my peripheral vision, Kathryn\u2019s head pops up. Her gaze swings between Norman and me, and both she and Glenn have stopped writing. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re both having a tough time narrowing down to six people who will speak favourably of them.</p><p>\u2018Family, work relationships, close friends, ex-boyfriends \u2013 I\u2019m afraid so.\u2019 Norman regards me kindly from behind his folder-buried desk. \u2018Not to worry \u2013 they don\u2019t expect you to be perfect or universally loved.\u2019</p><p>Universally loved? Can there be anything in the history of catchphrases that applies to me less? Oh, God.</p><p>\u2018They conduct these interviews to evaluate whether (a) you\u2019re truthful and (b) you\u2019ve got no detrimental personality disorders \u2013 anything that might prevent you from being a dependable parent to the child. It\u2019s all about his best interest, as I\u2019ve said. I know you\u2019re tired of me saying that phrase, but it\u2019s what matters to the court. Best get accustomed to it early on.\u2019</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>They\u2019re going to call both of my parents. My ex-stepmothers and ex-stepfathers. They\u2019re probably going to call Reid.</p><p>And they\u2019re definitely going to call Graham.</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>Emma\u2019s voice is exactly as I expected \u2013 clipped. Cold.</p><p>\u2018Emma, this is Brooke,\u2019 I reply needlessly. She obviously recognizes my number.</p><p>Silence. Okay.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m calling ...\u2019 I close my eyes \u2018... to ask a favour.\u2019</p><p>She sputters a little. \u2018A favour? How ... what would Graham\u2019s mom call it? How cheeky of you. But since Cara isn\u2019t around, I\u2019ll just say how goddamned presumptuous of you. What do you want, Brooke?\u2019</p><p>What do I want? I want to hang up. Last year, I made a huge miscalculation where Emma was concerned. Where Graham was concerned. I never said anything to either of them afterwards, of course. Never tried to account for what I did, or beg forgiveness. I knew I was automatically evicted from his life. I didn\u2019t need to hear him say it.</p><p>I rarely apologize. It\u2019s not that I think I\u2019m never wrong \u2013 I just don\u2019t care to admit it out loud. The only time I say I\u2019m sorry is when there is literally no other way around saying it, or to get out of penalties that are possible to circumvent. Most consequences stick. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called consequences.</p><p>Eight months ago, there was no evading Graham\u2019s banishment, and my way around a pointless I\u2019m sorry was avoidance, plain and simple.</p><p>If I take that approach now, I could lose River. I take a breath and square my shoulders.</p><p>\u2018I need to talk to Graham \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of all the \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Emma, I\u2019m sorry. I fucked up. I totally fucked up. I wouldn\u2019t bother you \u2013 either of you \u2013 and look, I\u2019m calling your phone, not his. I\u2019m asking your permission. I\u2019m begging you for it. Please.\u2019 My voice splinters at the end of this appeal, the last word sounding more like a sob. Fucking hell.</p><p>More silence.</p><p>\u2018Are you dying or something?\u2019 she asks, and I can\u2019t tell if she sounds more hopeful or regretful at the prospect.</p><p>\u2018Not yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean not yet?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not \u2013 this isn\u2019t about me, as such. Well, it\u2019s only about me secondarily. It\u2019s about ... my son.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The baby I gave up for adoption. His adoptive father died and his mother turned into a meth addict and now he\u2019s in foster care and I\u2019m trying to get him out.\u2019</p><p>Way to go, Brooke. That wasn\u2019t word vomit. That was word projectile vomiting.</p><p>\u2018Does Reid know?\u2019 She says his name as though they\u2019ve been in contact, which I suppose is possible. Maybe she was part of his twelve-step apologyfest last month.</p><p>\u2018He knows. He\u2019s not ... involved. Which is fine. This is my choice. When I told you about the pregnancy \u2013\u2019 I sigh. \u2018I only told you so you\u2019d hate him. But he was just a kid. I was just a kid. I\u2019m not asking him for anything now, but yes, he\u2019s aware.\u2019 Stop talking. \u2018We\u2019re even sort of getting along. It\u2019s kind of weird, actually.\u2019 Stop talking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Huh.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes, remembering how Graham and I had an infuriating conversation once upon a time about Emma and how she said huh whenever she couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say. He thought it was so adorable, and I wanted to gag him with a knee sock.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll, um, talk to him. No promises. He\u2019ll call you if he wants to talk. If he doesn\u2019t, he won\u2019t call.\u2019</p><p>I grit my teeth, feeling powerless. \u2018I understand. Thank you.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Goodbye, Brooke.\u2019</p><p>After we disconnect, I pull up the photo of River I scanned into my phone and sent to Reid. Every time I look at it, I feel more overwhelmed, more terrified I\u2019m going to fuck this up, and more sure that I can\u2019t let that happen. If I have to go round Emma to beg Graham not to ruin this, I\u2019ll do it. But I\u2019m patient enough to bide my time and wait, and hope she doesn\u2019t hate me as much as I deserve to be hated. If our positions were reversed, I\u2019d have told her to fuck off and blocked her from Graham\u2019s phone.</p><p>But Emma is not me. And that\u2019s just one more reason why Graham is hers, and not mine.</p><p>12</p><p>REID</p> <p>I have the driver drop me a block away from the Starbucks on the corner, pulling the beanie over my ears and hunching into my jacket before grabbing my shoulder duffle. It\u2019s dark out, so I can\u2019t wear my sunglasses, but it\u2019s not like anyone expects Reid Alexander to pop up here, either. Even if I\u2019m recognized, most people will merely assume I bear an uncanny resemblance to \u2018that one guy from that movie\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Nine tomorrow morning?\u2019 I say, opening the door, and he nods.</p><p>\u2018Yessir.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d missed the sight of her until I see her. She sent a text fifteen minutes ago to tell me she\u2019d arrived and staked out a chair on the second level. I was supposed to call her when I got there, but I didn\u2019t. I wanted this moment. I hoped she\u2019d be caught up in reading, not looking for me. That I could take a few precious seconds to drink her in. That I\u2019d get to witness the exact moment she notices I\u2019m there.</p><p>Dori never disappoints.</p><p>As though she feels my eyes grazing over her, she glances up and right at me. She snaps the book closed without marking her page and tosses it towards her bag on the floor. Springing from the chair, she\u2019s clamping her mouth shut to keep from saying my name and giving my identity away \u2013 but her smile is a mile wide. One second later, she\u2019s in my arms, on her toes, offering her lips up for a kiss. I\u2019m happy to oblige.</p> <p>\u2018I wholeheartedly approve of that welcome,\u2019 I murmur into her mouth, kissing her once more as she regains her composure and recollects where we are \u2013 in public.</p><p>Sweeping her hair back on one side, I cradle her head in my hand and smile down at her now-demure expression \u2013 pursed lips, faint blush pinkening the curve of that exposed ear. My voice restrained, low, I say, \u2018Let\u2019s go be alone, beautiful girl, where I can ravish you without the audience that bothers only you.\u2019 I feel her pulse speed under my fingertips and tighten my opposite arm around her, pressing her closer. \u2018Or ... I\u2019d be happy to back you up against a wall, right here, right now, and kiss you breathless. For a start.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get my bag,\u2019 she says, her warm breath gushing against my neck.</p><p>I nod, and she ducks her chin low and steps away to collect her book and bag from the floor, and her sweater from the chair. Shrugging into it, she leads the way down the narrow staircase, across the expanse of main floor, and out of the door. I reflect that this may be the only time in my personal history in which I entered a Starbucks and didn\u2019t buy anything.</p><p>Outside at the kerb, she pulls to a sudden stop. \u2018Oh, did you want something?\u2019</p><p>I arch a brow. \u2018Not anything they sell. Let\u2019s go see this tiny room of yours. And say hello-and-goodbye to your very considerate roommate.\u2019</p><p>Glancing up, she bites her lip and smiles at the same time, pulling me across the street to the campus. Her face is a perfect picture of the inner mischievousness with which I\u2019m oh-so familiar. Avidly familiar.</p><p>We don\u2019t get far before we\u2019re in a thick grove of storeys-tall trees, which I make a mental note of for some future encounter. When it\u2019s warmer.</p> <p>The campus is well lit and well populated for a Saturday night, which makes me feel easier about her being here. No one pays us any mind. We are two more students crossing the campus grounds, in search of entertainment \u2013 or privacy. As though I\u2019m playing a character, I immerse myself in a storyline where Dori and I have parallel goals, parallel lives. Where we meet for coffee in between classes, commiserate about professors and assignments, take walks and weekend trips and lie out in grassy common areas on sunny days. Where we study between make-out sessions, and make love between study sessions.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 she asks, and I realize I\u2019m frowning.</p><p>I stop, pulling her fully against me and tip her concerned face up to mine. \u2018Absolutely nothing,\u2019 I say. \u2018I just need to do this before going any further.\u2019 I lean to kiss her in the semi-darkness. Someone hoots in the distance \u2013 at us or at something unrelated \u2013 I don\u2019t know or care.</p><p>I\u2019m always amused by people\u2019s reactions when I\u2019m recognized in entirely incongruous, unexpected places for movie-star viewing. A state college dorm elevator is, predictably, one of these places. Dori grips my hand when a couple of girls with laundry bags get in. They\u2019re whispering while giving me not-so-covert sidelong glances. Wrapping my arms around Dori, I pull her back against my chest and into our own personal space bubble.</p><p>When the girls exit one floor up and the doors begin to close, they turn back and stare, bug-eyed. I wink, and Dori catches me doing it.</p><p>The doors slide shut, and she smacks my hand where it lays across her abdomen. \u2018You\u2019re a bad boy, Reid Alexander.\u2019</p><p>Chuckling, I whisper into her ear, though we\u2019re alone now. \u2018Baby, you just wait until I get you into that room. Unless you don\u2019t want to wait ...\u2019</p><p>Breath catching, she shudders against the length of me, from my thighs to where the back of her head rests under my chin. I close my eyes and breathe through my nose, which only intensifies the cake-sweet smell of her invading my senses. Fucking hell. She has no idea how close she is to me slamming that emergency stop button and backing her into a corner.</p><p>Then again, maybe she has a very clear idea. Her fingertips stroke my hand, feather-light, where she slapped it seconds ago. When we reach her floor, she grabs hold of my hand and makes a sharp right, pulling me into the hallway. We may only have the next twelve hours, but I\u2019m going to make good use of every single one of them.</p><p>DORI</p><p>Seated at a corner bistro table by the front window of the Starbucks, we wait for the car that will take Reid to the airport. He checks email and messages on his phone, facing away from the other Sunday-morning patrons, while I sip my latte and make note of every visually accessible detail of him. It could be weeks before we see each other again, unless he can slip away from his crazy promotion schedule \u2013 something he\u2019s promised to try to do.</p><p>The late-January sun glints off the waves of his movie-star hair, burnished gold with darker natural lowlights. Falling over his forehead, curling over his ears, marginally flattened by the knitted cap he wore on the walk from my room, it begs to be touched. His dark lashes, too, are somehow gold-tipped. When those lashes sweep up and his gaze connects with mine, I catch my breath. In the clear morning light, his dark blue eyes are vivid enough for me to perceive every individual facet, his irises becoming mosaics of broken sea glass.</p><p>Angling his head, he says, \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head faintly. \u2018When I didn\u2019t like you, the fact that you were so hot played against you.\u2019</p><p>He smirks. \u2018You don\u2019t say.\u2019</p><p>Struggling to find the right words, I lean on my elbows. \u2018If I was already angry at you for something you said or did, I\u2019d look at you and just get angrier. Because it seemed so unfair to be given a face like that and use it for nothing but ... egocentric causes. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not how it normally works for you \u2013 or I guess I should say, not normally how it works against you.\u2019</p><p>His mouth pulls up on one side and he shakes his head once. \u2018Uh, no. That\u2019s usually not the case.\u2019</p><p>\u2018People find themselves letting you have your way, because you\u2019re so beautiful that they don\u2019t want to deny you anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I feel so cheap now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault you were born looking the way you look \u2013\u2019</p><p>He barks a laugh, hand across his mouth, weirdly self-conscious. \u2018Thanks for the ... sympathy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What I mean is, how you look just intensifies everything else about you, which didn\u2019t work with me, because I was raised to weigh people\u2019s actions, to rank them higher than their looks. Superficial people can be swayed by surface beauty alone. It\u2019s basic human nature to like pretty things, after all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019m enjoying the turn of this conversation, to tell you the truth. I feel like I should go and rub some dirt on my face, or at least change into polyester plaid.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head and try again. \u2018When you showed up at Habitat with the cast of Mercy Killing, I\u2019d already experienced, first hand, what it was like to be cared for by you. By the time I left that day, I knew what you\u2019d done for Deb \u2013 and the knowledge of that beautiful part of you \u2013 the real you, apart from your looks \u2013 stunned me. But the combination of the compassion you were capable of and your physical beauty, right in front of me, was so overwhelming.\u2019</p><p>His mouth drops open just slightly, and his brows draw together just as disconcertedly. \u2018Dori, I\u2019m no angel \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know, and I don\u2019t expect you to be. You know I like the, uh ...\u2019 I feel the blush creeping over my ears, and with my hair in a messy knot at the nape of my neck, I know that tell-tale signal is visible. My voice drops to the lowest possible level. \u2018... The naughty side of you too.\u2019</p><p>He takes my hand from the table between us and holds it loosely in his, splayed open, tracing loops on my palm with the tip of his thumb. \u2018Is that why I was able to say a few words I\u2019m not allowed to say in the daylight, when I whispered them to you last night?\u2019 His voice is low and rough, dragging something deep inside me to the surface. He leans closer. \u2018When I told you what I was going to do to you before I did it? When I told you what to do to me?\u2019</p><p>My face floods with heat and memory. I had been beyond shocked to discover that those forbidden words \u2013 some of which he\u2019s never spoken in front of me \u2013 made my body go liquid under his as he whispered them in the dark, his voice husky and demanding.</p><p>When he sat on the edge of my cramped bed this morning, stretching, his shoulder blades bore the evidence of my enthusiasm. And he seemed to have a bruise or two in curious spots. I was mortified.</p><p>\u2018I hurt you,\u2019 I said miserably, tracing my fingers over the thin lines on his back.</p><p>He turned and flattened me against the bed in the space of one blink, his chest pressed to mine, his elbows bearing his weight. \u2018If you ever apologize to me for doing,\u2019 he closed his eyes and then flashed them open, \u2018anything you did to me last night, I\u2019ll have no choice but to punish you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 I whispered, my imagination running rampant.</p><p>He smiled wolfishly. \u2018In the heat of the moment, it appears we forgot to employ that scarf you were promising to produce. The next time you give me a few hours of your time, Dorcas Cantrell, I think we have a few new things to try.\u2019</p><p>His soft laugh brings me back to the Starbucks. \u2018I always feel like doing a quick fist-pump when I manage to say something that makes you blush well beyond the ears,\u2019 he says.</p><p>\u2018Meanie.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You know you love it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a glutton for punishment, apparently.\u2019 Another wave of pink descends after I realize I just used the word punishment, and he chuckles again.</p><p>Tapping a coffee stirrer on the table, he stares at it before sighing. \u2018Dori, what you said about the \u201creal\u201d me \u2013 I\u2019m trying to be a better human being, but I\u2019m still the same guy. People can only change so much.\u2019</p><p>My heart aches at the truth of those words, and how they apply to the thing I\u2019m dreading most \u2013 losing him. But I know he\u2019s referring to other, more personally important changes. \u2018You underestimate yourself, Reid. As always. You have a good heart, and now your eyes are more open to other people, to suffering you can do something about. All you have to do is not close them again. I know, better than anyone, that everything isn\u2019t fixable.\u2019</p><p>Everything isn\u2019t fixable, and miracles are only happy twists of fate. Fate can so easily twist in the opposite direction. I face that fact every time my sister looks right through me.</p> <p>13</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>\u2018Brooke, where are you? I heard a rumour that you\u2019re in Texas. Is that true?\u2019 Janelle\u2019s voice is a bit overly-screechy before my second cup of coffee. Truthfully, it\u2019s screechy all the time. I love her, but Christ, when she\u2019s worked up, her voice could pierce steel. I hold the phone a foot away from my ear, only bringing it close to speak.</p><p>\u2018Okay, what the hell. Where are these rumours coming from? You\u2019re the second person who\u2019s asked me that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you aren\u2019t in Texas? You and Chandler have multiple promo commitments in the LA area this week, starting tomorrow \u2013\u2019</p><p>Glenn shuffles into the kitchen, but stops and turns when he hears the voice blaring from the receiver. When I roll my eyes and mouth Janelle, he shakes his head and chuckles.</p> <p>My stepfather is in the oil business. After decades growing his career in the field, he moved into management a few years ago. He\u2019s good at his job because he\u2019s firm but easygoing, traits that served him equally well as a stepfather to Kelley and Kylie. All things Hollywood confound and amuse Glenn.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, Janelle, I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2013 so I just need to ascertain that you\u2019ll be there,\u2019 she continues as though I haven\u2019t spoken, \u2018unless something needs to be rescheduled ...\u2019 Her tone says that had better not be the case unless someone is dying. Namely, me.</p><p>\u2018No rescheduling necessary, Janelle. I had to run home to deal with some family issues, but I\u2019m coming back to LA later today.\u2019</p><p>Over the rim of his coffee cup, Glenn\u2019s brows rise. I shake my head. I\u2019m not ready to spill everything to my agent just yet. Especially knowing that conversation is going to include me telling her that in all likelihood, I\u2019m going to turn down Paper Oceans. She may attempt to have me committed.</p><p>\u2018Oh, thank goodness,\u2019 Janelle says. \u2018I was just telling Amaris ...\u2019</p><p>My phone beeps and I check the screen easily, since I\u2019m holding it away from my head.</p><p>Graham.</p> <p>My mouth goes dry and I have to remind myself to breathe.</p><p>\u2018Janelle,\u2019 I interrupt. \u2018Janelle \u2013 I\u2019ve got another call \u2013 I\u2019ve got to take this. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m home tonight.\u2019 I\u2019m already grabbing what\u2019s left of my tepid coffee and walking back to my room when I flash over. I try and fail to sound composed instead of freaked out. \u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Brooke. Emma said you called.\u2019 His tone is guarded, non-committal, but his voice is so very familiar. My eyes fill and I swallow, suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p>\u2018Brooke?\u2019 he repeats.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m here. I guess ... I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d call. Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just want to know what you want. Don\u2019t thank me yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay. Okay.\u2019 I take a deep breath. \u2018A few weeks ago, I hired an investigator to check on the baby I gave up \u2013 just to make sure he was okay. I was having nightmares about him. I thought if I could find out he\u2019s happy and healthy, the nightmares would stop and I could just ... go on with my life.\u2019</p><p>He makes no comment. The old Graham, in our old friendship, would have asked me some question. But I destroyed that relationship. I killed his trust and his care for me.</p><p>I close my bedroom door and sit on my bed. I have to do this for River. What I\u2019ve lost is not of any consequence.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s in foster care. He was removed from his adoptive home by CPS.\u2019</p><p>Hesitantly, he says, \u2018That\u2019s what Emma said. Do you know why?\u2019</p><p>I feel a rush of gratitude for his question, and for the first time, I entertain the hope that he\u2019ll listen. That maybe, for River\u2019s sake, he can stop hating me long enough to not prevent me from getting him.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know all of it. I know his adoptive father died, but I don\u2019t know how. I know his adoptive mother became a meth addict, and that she went into court-ordered rehab at least twice, and that she failed both times. I know that no relatives have stepped forward to take him \u2013 my PI is working on information about them. He\u2019s been in foster care for months.\u2019 Tears are rolling down my face. \u2018Bethany Shank \u2013 my PI \u2013 gave me a photo of him.\u2019</p><p>When my voice breaks, I hear a soft whoosh of breath from Graham and I think, Please-oh-please don\u2019t think I\u2019m faking this. \u2018He\u2019s so small. And he looks so sad. He needs me, Graham. That\u2019s why I applied to adopt him \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I know that he\u2019s frowning now. Combing his dark hair back with one hand. Closing his eyes and shaking his head twice before opening them. \u2018Emma said you told her you were trying to get him out of foster care \u2013 but we didn\u2019t know what that meant, exactly. Adoption, Brooke? You?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m trying so hard not to sound like I\u2019m crying. My fingers press against that characteristic pain in my sternum, but nothing soothes the sharp burn of it, like a newly lit match, flaring to life just under my skin.</p><p>\u2018Yes. I\u2019m all he\u2019s got. It has to be me.\u2019</p><p>He sighs. \u2018It sounds like you mean well, and I can appreciate that you feel responsible for him, believe me. But he needs someone stable, someone ... devoted to him. He\u2019s just a little younger than Cara, right? You have no idea how much energy it requires to look after her, and I have my parents and my sisters. I have Emma.\u2019</p><p>And you have no one. He doesn\u2019t say the words, but they hang there between us, as though he has.</p><p>\u2018Emma said you wanted a favour?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. His caseworker is going to call you. Maybe his ad litem too. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to ask, but please, just ... just don\u2019t say anything that will make me lose him. Please, Graham.\u2019</p><p>I count my own heartbeats as they pulse through my ears. One. Two. Three. Four.</p><p>\u2018You really want this, don\u2019t you? My concern is \u2013 why? He\u2019s a child, Brooke. He can\u2019t fill your need for affection. Children are owed love from their guardians \u2013 not the other way around.\u2019</p><p>I would be offended, but in light of our history, and what he knows of me, it\u2019s a valid question. \u2018I understand why you\u2019d think that. But if I\u2019m getting anything from this, it\u2019s a sense of doing the right thing. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m terrified thinking about all I don\u2019t know, and everything I could screw up. But he needs me. I have to do this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What if he has needs you can\u2019t fill? What if he\u2019s been hurt so badly that you can\u2019t help him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll get him the help he needs. I\u2019ll keep trying. I\u2019m goddamned stubborn, Graham. If nothing else, you know that about me.\u2019</p><p>I envision the wry, reluctant smile on his face. \u2018Yes. I do.\u2019</p><p>REID</p><p>I could say I looked for an opening, some time in the twelve hours I spent with Dori, to tell her about River.</p><p>But that would be a lie. And right now, my only lie is of omission.</p><p>I could say that every day that goes by, the guilt is heavier, but that\u2019s not exactly true, either. What I feel is fear. Fear that if she finds out \u2013 no matter how, from my mouth or someone else\u2019s \u2013 she won\u2019t vacillate. She won\u2019t bother with the semantics of telling a lie versus not telling the truth. She\u2019ll see in black and white. She\u2019ll ignore the grey.</p><p>This is a girl who seems to have lost a lifelong faith in God. Discarding her tenuous, newfound faith in me would be nothing next to that.</p><p>Besides, there\u2019s a chance that Brooke will change her mind \u2013 as slim as that chance may be. Or that someone else will step up and take responsibility for him. That this secret will stay in the closet, where secrets belong. And maybe some day, I can tell Dori \u2013 when I don\u2019t have this feeling that there\u2019s a time clock ticking over my shoulder. Or maybe a bomb.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to lose her. She\u2019s more important to me than a boy I\u2019ve never seen. A child I didn\u2019t even think was mine, biologically, until a few weeks ago. I can\u2019t be a father \u2013 not yet, and maybe never.</p><p>Dori said I have a good heart.</p><p>And there is where I find the guilt.</p><p>By a week prior to the premiere of Mercy Killing, I\u2019ve been asked by multiple interviewers if I\u2019m dating someone \u2013 though they hint about it slyly rather than framing the question plainly, to get around the studio\u2019s constraint on the subject being broached directly. I give evasive answers and an oblivious smile. Today\u2019s interviewer was a little pushier.</p><p>What\u2019s funny is I don\u2019t give a shit what the studio wants or doesn\u2019t. This is about Dori, and her parents \u2013 and not giving them reason to hate me for dragging their daughter into my debauched world, as they like to term it. Not that I can argue. I\u2019ve debauched with dedicated regularity and zeal for years.</p><p>I have more sympathy now for Emma\u2019s ordeal during the School Pride promo tour last spring \u2013 not only having to deny the existence of her relationship with Graham, but having to pretend one with me at the same time. While I was doing everything in my power to sabotage their relationship. Christ, I was such an asshole.</p><p>George began negotiating the \u2018official\u2019 stance on my love life with the studio last week, when I made it clear I had no intention of denying my relationship with Dori once it comes to light. \u2018And it will,\u2019 I added. \u2018I\u2019m just easing her into the spotlight.\u2019 Along with her parents.</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019ll agree to wait until after the release to announce the relationship publicly?\u2019 he asks now, again. George knows me too well.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, sure \u2013 in theory. But if someone shows me a photo of Dori and says, \u2018Is this your girlfriend?\u2019 I\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t.\u2019 I park in the gated lot of Brooke\u2019s exclusive complex and let the engine idle while we wrap up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Noted.\u2019 He clears his throat. \u2018One more thing \u2013 I\u2019ve been contacted by a social worker in Texas \u2013 and asked to pass along a request for you to return the call. Something to do with a court case? He said it involved confidential information that he couldn\u2019t discuss with anyone but you. I don\u2019t suppose you want to let your manager in on what that\u2019s about, if you happen to know?\u2019</p><p>The blood in my veins turns to ice, and my hand grips the gear shift as though it will keep me from being sucked out of the open window of my car. Brooke said she wouldn\u2019t connect me, but clearly, she lied. This is my chance to tell George everything, but I\u2019m immobilized. \u2018Uh, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I can give him a call and see what it\u2019s about.\u2019</p><p>His sigh reveals his suspicion that I\u2019m withholding something critical. \u2018I\u2019ll email his information. Give me a call back if there\u2019s something I need to ... oversee.\u2019</p><p>I go from fuming to dumbstruck when Brooke opens her door. Brooke is like my mother in a few ways \u2013 one of them being the fact that she always looks as though she could grab a bag and go straight to a club or some posh event without so much as checking the mirror.</p> <p>My mother wears designer clothes around the house. She always has. Even when she\u2019s drunk \u2013 when she was drunk, I correct myself, because it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen her that way \u2013 she was stylish and well groomed. A little off, but not by much.</p><p>It\u2019s not that Brooke looks off.</p><p>She\u2019s Brooke ... from five years ago.</p><p>Her hair is pulled into a messy ponytail, tendrils escaping around her face. Thin gold hoops dangle from her ears, but she\u2019s not wearing make-up. Her eyes are big and blue in her very young face.</p><p>When we were going out, she would occasionally dig through my dresser drawers and take a pair of jeans, and I was content to let her. She\u2019d ditch whatever trendy pair she was wearing \u2013 shimmying out of them while I watched her, breathless \u2013 and pull mine on. They\u2019d hang perfectly on her slim hips, fitting her the same way they fitted me when I had a boy\u2019s body \u2013 the one I outgrew a couple of years ago.</p> <p>\u2018Ahhh,\u2019 she\u2019d say, dropping on to my bed. \u2018Much better.\u2019</p><p>All I could think about was how to get her back out of them.</p><p>The worn jeans she\u2019s currently wearing could be one of the three or four pairs she appropriated from me back then, though I\u2019m fairly certain she either shredded them with a giant set of shears or burned them in some sorcerous ritual after we broke up. She\u2019s barefoot \u2013 her toenails polished blood red \u2013 and wearing a plain, fitted white T-shirt.</p><p>Silent, she gestures for me to enter, and I follow her through a maze of boxes and into her living room. I don\u2019t remember exactly what her place looked like when I was here last, because I\u2019ve only been here once, and it\u2019s been almost a year \u2013 but several things appear to be missing. And then there are the boxes.</p><p>Frowning curiously, I turn back to her. \u2018Moving?\u2019</p><p>She nods. \u2018I\u2019ll need two bedrooms. And most of my d\u00e9cor isn\u2019t exactly child-friendly.\u2019</p> <p>She says this as though it\u2019s normal for such sentences to be said between us. Or for the phrase child-friendly to come from her mouth, ever.</p><p>She perches in a black leather chair and I take its twin \u2013 these make up the only furniture in the room, aside from a nearly empty bookcase.</p><p>I begin first, pre-empting whatever plan she had for the direction of this conversation. \u2018My manager got a call for me from a social worker in Texas. He wouldn\u2019t tell George what he wanted, but I\u2019m pretty sure it has to do with you \u2013 or, you know, River.\u2019</p><p>She takes a deep breath, staring at the interlocked hands in her lap, and a distinct feeling of unease creeps over me.</p><p>\u2018Yes, that\u2019s why I asked you to come over.\u2019 She sighs, and I think, Oh, no. \u2018I had to tell them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Excuse me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That you\u2019re his birth father.\u2019</p><p>My jaw drops. \u2018What do you mean you had to tell them \u2013\u2019</p> <p>Her eyes flash up. \u2018I had to fill out an eighteen-page questionnaire, Reid. It asked the most personal questions you could imagine, and Norman, my attorney, warned me to be utterly truthful, or I could risk a denial before we even got started.</p><p>\u2018So I told them about my home-wrecking mother, and my cheating father. The fact that I was illegitimate because my father was still technically married to Kathryn when I was born. The fact that my mother frequently slapped me across the face when I pissed her off, starting so young that I don\u2019t remember the first time she did it. I had to reveal my sexual history and experience \u2013 all of it. My relationships with my stepfathers and stepmothers and my experience with children \u2013 which is of course zero.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018You keep saying you had to, but that\u2019s not true, Brooke \u2013 no one is forcing you to do this.\u2019</p><p>She narrows her clear blue eyes and they blaze. \u2018We are done discussing the decisions I\u2019m making concerning my child, Reid Alexander.\u2019 Backlit by the wall of windows behind her, pale blonde hair haloing her head, she looks like an angel spoiling for a fight.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re making decisions for me, Brooke \u2013 why can\u2019t you see that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine! Then I\u2019m choosing our son.\u2019</p><p>My jaw clenches and I stand, hands fisted at my sides. \u2018You\u2019ve called me his birth father. Now you\u2019re calling him my son \u2013 like I have some sort of connection with him. I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t think he was mine when you turned up pregnant, and you knew it. We\u2019d been broken up for weeks by then. I never felt anything about him one way or the other, Brooke, and I don\u2019t now, and if that makes me a heartless bastard, then so be it \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, Reid \u2013 that\u2019s you making him a bastard.\u2019</p><p>My hands both go to the back of my neck and I pull my elbows in, biceps shielding my face like blinkers. Pacing between the dozens of boxes littering the floor, I count. One, two, three, four ... I ache to throw something or break something or scream something. Five, six, seven. Eight, nine, ten.</p><p>I need to leave. But first: \u2018What does the social worker want?\u2019</p><p>She blanches like she\u2019d forgotten about that, and then licks her lips. If her head was transparent, I\u2019d see gears working furiously. \u2018A couple of things. They want you to sign a form saying you willingly volunteer to relinquish your parental rights to him. That ... shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you, I gather. It\u2019s like clearing a deed to a property, Norman says, so it can transfer easily to a new buyer.\u2019 She swallows, the muscles in her throat strained. I get the feeling she wants to cry, but isn\u2019t allowing herself to do it. So Brooke of her. Always calculating something.</p><p>\u2018They might also ask you about our relationship. And the break-up. And the pregnancy. And why I left your name off the birth record. And ... they\u2019re calling people for character references. For me.\u2019</p><p>I laugh once, humourlessly, stuffing my hands into my front pockets. \u2018Me? A guy who plea-bargained his way out of a DUI a few months ago as a character reference? I doubt anything I say will hold any weight one way or the other.\u2019</p><p>She shrugs, her expression earnest. I can\u2019t stand to look at her. Not when she looks so much like she did years ago. I conclude that she must have done this on purpose \u2013 but how would she know? How would she know that for months after our break-up, I woke up from dreams of her looking exactly like she does now?</p><p>\u2018Maybe not,\u2019 she says. \u2018But the worst thing would be if they believe I lied and said he wasn\u2019t yours, or didn\u2019t tell you about him at all. Will you just back me up on that, and sign the relinquishment papers? Even if you can\u2019t say another positive word about me?\u2019</p><p>She did tell me she was pregnant, and even if she let me believe he probably wasn\u2019t mine, she never told me he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll back up your story, because it\u2019s true. But relinquishment papers? That\u2019s a legal declaration, Brooke.\u2019 I\u2019m back to pacing. The stacks of boxes narrow the walls, constricting the paths between them, paralleling my emotions perfectly. \u2018Fuck. My father will kill me if I sign a legal document without his expert guidance.\u2019 I look back up at her and shake my head slowly. \u2018I\u2019m going to have to tell him. And may God have mercy on my soul.\u2019</p><p>14</p><p>DORI</p><p>My schedule looks like a sampler platter instead of a meal. Every class I\u2019m taking this semester is preceded by \u2018Introduction to\u2019, which theoretically makes sense, considering I\u2019m a freshman, and therefore assumed to be a novice at everything. If I hadn\u2019t tested out of reading and comprehension, quantitative reasoning and four semesters of Spanish, I suppose my schedule and I wouldn\u2019t look quite so deficient in experience.</p><p>On a bench in upper Sproul, I wait with one member of my Intro to Sociology study group for the other two to arrive. The plan was to stake a spot somewhere outside to study, but that was before the sky became completely overcast and the temperature dropped ten degrees.</p><p>Claudia scowls down the plaza, looking for Raul and Afton. \u2018Whose bright idea was it to study outdoors in February? I\u2019m. Effing. Freezing.\u2019</p><p>I shrug. \u2018I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll agree to go inside. And it was nice out yesterday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Psshh,\u2019 she says. \u2018It was tolerable, at best. Have you ever noticed how all campus brochures have pictures of happy, smiling students taken on beautiful, blue-sky days? No matter where the campus is located \u2013 Oklahoma, North Dakota, Arizona \u2013 whatever. No one is ever huddling into their down-filled North Face jacket, cursing their chapped lips and flyaway hair. No one\u2019s ever sloshing across campus in an ugly downpour with no umbrella, a soaked-through backpack, waterlogged shoes and jeans saturated to mid-thigh. No one\u2019s got sweat-stained pits and perspiration-covered faces. Oh, no \u2013 they\u2019re throwing a Frisbee or studying contentedly on a green lawn in perfect temperatures. They\u2019re laughing on the way to the food court or chatting on the steps of the library.\u2019</p><p>I smile. Claudia is one of those people who constantly complains, but she grumbles so humorously that I don\u2019t care. She\u2019s like a grumpy old lady in an eighteen-year-old body.</p><p>A couple of girls suddenly appear in front of us, gazing directly at me, as though I\u2019m about to impart life-saving information. Claudia lifts an eyebrow and looks at me too.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 the girl on the left says. \u2018Um, we live in your building? And you were with a guy the other night ...\u2019</p><p>Uh-oh. I recognize them now \u2013 the elevator girls. Darn Reid and his winking.</p><p>I attempt to look blankly at them. Reid\u2019s told me what his studio wants, but he\u2019s also told me that he doesn\u2019t care what I say or do \u2013 he says that if someone asks me about him, I can say whatever I\u2019d like. But his premiere is tomorrow night, and I don\u2019t particularly want to out myself right here, right now, with strangers. Along with Claudia, the world\u2019s most acerbic Peace and Conflict Studies major ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Girl on the right isn\u2019t about to drop this opportunity. \u2018Was he really Reid Alexander?\u2019</p><p>Before I can say a word, Claudia hoots a laugh. \u2018Are you guys high right now? Reid Alexander, on campus, and no one noticed? Give me a break.\u2019</p><p>Their faces fall. \u2018Oh.\u2019</p><p>Then left side girl rallies. \u2018Then that guy \u2013 he\u2019s goes here? To Cal?\u2019</p> <p>I shake my head once. \u2018No, he doesn\u2019t. He was just visiting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aww,\u2019 they say in unison, dismayed, and my scowl narrows on them.</p><p>\u2018And he\u2019s my boyfriend.\u2019 Whoa. Where did that tone come from?</p><p>Unbothered by any sense of diplomacy, left side girl snorts. \u2018He is?\u2019</p><p>Her friend tries to save face \u2013 by saying the most awkward thing possible. \u2018Well, congratulations \u2013 I mean \u2013 he looks just like Reid Alexander, so obviously he\u2019s hot. Aheh.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Uh. Thanks?\u2019</p><p>After they scuttle away, I say, \u2018That was weird.\u2019</p><p>I feel Claudia\u2019s eyes on me. \u2018So you\u2019re dating Reid Alexander?\u2019</p><p>I look into her dark eyes, and my lips part, but no sound emerges. I can\u2019t think of a single thing to say.</p><p>\u2018Has anyone ever told you that you do not have a poker face?\u2019</p><p>Lips twisting, I admit, \u2018Yeah, I may have heard that one a time or two.\u2019</p> <p>She angles her head and smiles. \u2018You\u2019re the Habitat girl, aren\u2019t you? From last summer.\u2019</p><p>Oh, yay. I\u2019d escaped two zealous Reid Alexander groupies, only to find out I\u2019m in a study group with the most dangerous of them all. \u2018And you\u2019re ... a Reid Alexander fan?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hell, no. My little sisters are. They\u2019re rabid about him. He seems like a pretentious, untalented asshole to me.\u2019</p><p>I blink.</p><p>\u2018Note I said seems. I haven\u2019t actually seen any of his films. And he can\u2019t be a total lost cause if he\u2019s dating you. I think. Unless you care to refute that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which part?\u2019</p><p>She shrugs. \u2018Any of it. I\u2019m open-minded. Sort of.\u2019</p><p>I laugh softly as our classmates finally walk up, shivering in their jackets.</p> <p>\u2018Oh. My. Holy. Fucking. Hell,\u2019 Raul says. \u2018Can we please go inside to do this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A man after my own heart,\u2019 Claudia says, bounding from the bench as though released from a spell and walking resolutely in the direction of the library. \u2018Brr! Dayum. I never thought I\u2019d say this ... but I miss San Diego.\u2019 Turning and pointing a finger, she adds, \u2018You guys did not hear me say that.\u2019</p><p>Afton mimes locking her lips and tossing an invisible key over her shoulder. \u2018We all wanted to get the hell outta somewhere, dude,\u2019 she says. \u2018But some stuff we take for granted about home just isn\u2019t better elsewhere.\u2019</p><p>Claudia leans closer as we head towards the library. \u2018Psychology majors, Jesus. And did she just call me dude? That\u2019s so not going to endear her to me anytime soon \u2013 I don\u2019t care how cute her butt is in those jeans. Although she does have a valid point about home and elsewhere. So ... About the pretty boy \u2013?\u2019</p><p>I smile and meet her eyes. \u2018He\u2019s not a lost cause.\u2019</p><p>She returns my smile. \u2018Good enough for me.\u2019</p><p>I have Reid\u2019s fan sites bookmarked, so I can watch him from a distance, like everyone else has to. My annoyance is increasing, especially when sites claim \u2018proof\u2019 that he\u2019s hooking up with random starlets or singers he stands next to at some event. Or a commenting fan proclaims her undying love and desire to have his babies. Or someone is trying to figure out who I am and where I\u2019m from and why in the world Reid Alexander would even bother with me.</p><p>Looking at these pages feels a little stalkerish too. On the other hand, this is no different than going to friends\u2019 Facebook profiles and browsing through photos of them living their lives apart from me. Curiosity is a compelling thing. Where Reid is concerned, I\u2019ve been curious from the moment he called me a hypocrite for deeming him hopeless, days after we met.</p><p>With his mother beside him on the red carpet at his premiere, it\u2019s a no-brainer where Reid gets his looks. Their colouring is exactly the same, as well as their features \u2013 with the exception of the angled jaw bestowed by his father. Lucy Alexander is stunning and elegant, her pride in her son evident in the way she watches him while he signs autographs and leans in to take photos with the beside-themselves fans pressing against the velvet rope.</p><p>When I came up with the idea of inviting his mother as his plus-one, I had a good feeling about it. He was unconvinced that she\u2019d want to go, so I told him the only way he\u2019d know was to ask.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d have thought I just handed her an Oscar,\u2019 he said later, filling me in on their conversation. \u2018First, she gasped and teared up, and I was thinking, Oh, great, I\u2019ve upset her. And then she said, \u2018Don\u2019t you want to take Dori?\u2019 So I told her you couldn\u2019t get away that night. She stepped forward and hugged me, which she hasn\u2019t done in \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 it feels like years, and then she said she\u2019d love to go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you so,\u2019 I sing-songed, and he laughed.</p><p>\u2018You just live for the times you\u2019re able to say that, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, and lucky for me \u2013 with you, I get to say it a lot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Haha. Very funny, Miss Cantrell. I\u2019ll have to try to hand out those little treats more sparingly. I don\u2019t want you to get spoiled.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, so now you can control the frequency of your wrongness?\u2019 I scoffed, trying not to giggle. \u2018How will you do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I appear to have two choices. I can either be right more often \u2013 stop laughing \u2013 or I can stop saying things that turn out to be wrong. Hmm. This is a tough decision.\u2019</p><p>REID</p><p>Me: We need to discuss something. In person. Important.</p><p>Dad: I\u2019ll be home tonight by 8. Will that work for you?</p><p>Me: Yes. I\u2019ll meet you in your study. I leave for the NYC debut tomorrow morning.</p><p>Dad is still dressed for work, with the exception of the suit jacket hanging on the peg and padded hanger he had installed for that purpose near the open door. His cufflinks are in a small glass bowl he purchased for the express function of holding cufflinks, his red-patterned tie remains knotted, but loose, and his shirtsleeves are rolled to mid-forearm.</p><p>I knock my knuckles twice to announce my presence, and his eyes snap up from the paperwork he\u2019s scanning.</p><p>He pushes it aside and collects a pad and pen. \u2018Reid. Come in.\u2019 After I take a deep breath and sit, he says, \u2018All right, what\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>Every carefully premeditated introduction to the grenade I\u2019m about to toss into the room has flown out of my brain. Entire perfectly crafted explanations are just gone. I\u2019m thinking in words, like a toddler. Or Tarzan. Me father. You grandfather. HELP.</p><p>I look him in the eye and he\u2019s frowning, waiting for me to state my business. I haven\u2019t been scared of my father since I was ten. Intimidated? Yes. Demeaned? Yes. Afraid? No.</p><p>Is this what his clients feel like, sitting across the desk from him?</p><p>And that\u2019s when it hits me. No, this isn\u2019t what it feels like to be his client. He doesn\u2019t frown at his clients. He may wear a veneer of concern. He may even be concerned. But the face I\u2019m seeing \u2013 the eyes I\u2019m looking into now \u2013 he\u2019s alarmed. Apprehensive. Worried.</p><p>His clients don\u2019t get that puckered-brow expression. My mother does. And I do.</p><p>I rub my clammy palms against my jeans. \u2018I have a problem, and I need your advice. Your legal advice.\u2019</p><p>He takes a breath through his nose and his brow clears, the slightest bit. He\u2019s still on alert, but he knows this crisis is in his territory \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 and I\u2019ve brought it to him before someone else did. That\u2019s possibly unprecedented.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 he says.</p><p>I take another deep breath. \u2018You remember Brooke?\u2019</p><p>He grimaces. \u2018Brooke Cameron?\u2019 I nod, and he answers, \u2018Yes, I remember her.\u2019</p><p>Grenade time. \u2018After we broke up ...\u2019 Pull the pin. Toss. \u2018She found out she was pregnant.\u2019</p><p>I expect him to speak, start sputtering or roaring, something. Eyes drilling into mine, he goes a little pale around the edges, but he holds his fire. He recognizes that there\u2019s some reason I\u2019ve brought this to him, and I haven\u2019t voiced it yet. He hasn\u2019t scribbled so much as a stroke on that pad.</p><p>Swallowing, I continue. \u2018She had the baby, and gave it up for adoption. A few weeks ago, she hired a PI to look for him. She found him \u2013 in foster care. And now ... She wants to adopt him. She wants me to sign relinquishment papers. I want to make sure I\u2019m not missing something before I do it.\u2019</p><p>He begins to write on the pad, and I sit, waiting.</p><p>Several minutes later, he begins to fire questions at me, one after the other. After each one, there\u2019s a prolonged pause as he logs my answer.</p><p>\u2018Did she tell you she was pregnant at the time?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did she tell you she was giving the child up for adoption?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you sign anything \u2013 anything at all \u2013 taking responsibility for the pregnancy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No paternity test either, I assume.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you might not be the biological father.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m the father.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reid, if there\u2019s no proof \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m the father.\u2019</p><p>He scratches something on to the pad, and mumbles, \u2018We\u2019ll revisit that one later. Do you know if your name is on the birth certificate as his father?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No \u2013 Brooke says she left it as unknown.\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head a bit, exasperated. \u2018Then how does she now all of a sudden know it\u2019s yours?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She always knew. I ... I hurt her.\u2019 He flinches and I throw my hands up. \u2018Not physically. Jesus, Dad, don\u2019t you know me at all?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he says, shaking his head. \u2018Hazard of the profession \u2013 literal thinking. Carry on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We had an argument that turned into a screaming match. I thought she was cheating, and she was so indignant that she let me think it. Instead of talking about it or even arguing more, I just started going out. Publicly. With lots of girls. I didn\u2019t call her. She didn\u2019t call me. Until she found out she was pregnant ... God, I don\u2019t even know what I said to her \u2013 but I made it clear that I didn\u2019t care. So she made her own decisions. I had nothing to do with them. I didn\u2019t know until a few weeks ago that he was mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A few weeks \u2013 Reid, why do you wait to tell me things?\u2019 He closes his eyes and huffs a breath. \u2018And how do you know he\u2019s yours? Because she says so?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s not lying \u2013\u2019</p><p>His placating lawyer-face sliding into place, he says, \u2018Even if she\u2019s not lying, per se, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right. She may wish it was yours \u2013\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018He is mine.\u2019 I pull out my phone and pull up the photo.</p><p>He takes my phone, unaware what I\u2019m showing him. Glancing at the screen, he stops and blinks. Looks at me. And back at the display in his hand.</p><p>\u2018His name is River,\u2019 I say.</p><p>\u2018How old is he?\u2019 My father\u2019s voice catches and he clears his throat.</p> <p>\u2018Four and a half.\u2019</p><p>He scribbles on the pad. \u2018We\u2019ll have to get a blood test \u2013\u2019 He holds up a hand when I start to object. \u2018I\u2019m an attorney, Reid. You\u2019re going to have to trust me. No legal entity or governmental agency is going to take the fact that he\u2019s the spitting image of you at his age as evidence of paternity \u2013 as well they shouldn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So we can\u2019t just sign the papers?\u2019</p><p>Sitting back, he shakes his head. \u2018Signing relinquishment papers does one thing \u2013 it takes away your parental rights to the child. It does not remove the state\u2019s right to hold you financially responsible and accountable. It\u2019s highly unlikely that they\u2019ll cross that line, but not unheard of \u2013 especially if her bid to adopt fails. Now \u2013 where is he? I know people in LA County Family Court, of course ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s ... in Texas. He was born there.\u2019</p> <p>My father does something I\u2019ve seen him do only once before \u2013 during one of Mom\u2019s relapses. He puts his face in his hands and he says, \u2018Oh, God.\u2019</p><p>15</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Production wants me on hand and looking hot to hype media interest at the Ziegfeld Theatre opening of Hearts Over Manhattan, along with my co-star, Chandler Beckett. Tonight. To that end, I\u2019m at LAX before dawn with a front row seat at the gate, facing a boarding agent who\u2019s clearly trying to place who I am. If box office predictions are correct, I may be less likely to encounter that expression soon. Critics are calling Hearts \u2018a heartwarming little romance\u2019 \u2013 perfect for Valentine\u2019s weekend.</p><p>I ignore the boarding agent and hunch over my laptop to keep what I\u2019m doing private from my fellow travellers, who are beginning to fill in behind me. I\u2019m taking required parenting classes online. Having worked through seven sections, I\u2019ve got twenty-three to go. I plan to polish off at least two more on the long flight from Los Angeles to New York. The current unit concerns disciplining your child in public. While reading a section about not employing the use of public shaming for behaviour motivation, I reflect that my mother clearly never took a parenting class.</p><p>Chandler is bringing his tediously insecure girlfriend, Nan. At the premiere\u2019s after-party on Tuesday, I warned him to clip her claws or I was going to point her at the wardrobe girl, whom she has far better reason to hate according to on-set gossip \u2013 which is generally accurate. The guy has ample acting talent, but I should have demanded a bonus for every love scene. He\u2019s one of those guys who kisses like he\u2019s gasping for breath every second \u2013 no concentration, no finesse, no aim. How any girl, even Nan, would worry over losing that is beyond me. I\u2019d be kicking it to the kerb at the first opportunity.</p> <p>It slipped my mind to line up a plus-one for tonight. Janelle said, \u2018Don\u2019t you know anyone in New York? You can\u2019t just show up at your first opening night in a lead role alone.\u2019</p><p>First, yeah, I do know someone in New York, but I can\u2019t exactly phone him up and ask him to be my escort. Thanks for reminding me. And second \u2013</p><p>\u2018Why the hell not? I don\u2019t need an escort, by the way. I can walk from the car into the theatre \u2013 and probably even back again! \u2013 without being led by the elbow, thank-you-very-much.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not what I \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whatever, Janelle, let\u2019s just drop it. I\u2019m going alone, and I\u2019ll hit the after-party for a bit, and then I\u2019m coming home tomorrow. And next week, you and I have some things to discuss.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s an apprehensive pause. \u2018Oh? Like ... what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Next week.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 She\u2019s not genuinely angry, just exasperated. I\u2019ve had that effect on her for a while, especially three years ago, when our relationship took a not-so-subtle turn. She woke up to find me in the driver\u2019s seat of my career the day I turned eighteen and fired the manager Mom had hired years earlier. The way Janelle accepted instead of power-tripped that day is why she\u2019s still my agent.</p> <p>We hang up, and I concentrate on the multiple-choice questions for the Public Discipline section I\u2019ve just completed. Question number four: Your child throws a screaming tantrum because you won\u2019t buy him a candy bar at the grocery store. Do you: (a) explain that a candy bar will ruin his dinner, (b) plead with him to stop, (c) swat him on the bottom, (d) ignore him.</p><p>I guess Roll my eyes and wonder what the hell I was thinking would most closely resemble (d). Click.</p><p>\u2018Whatcha doin\u2019?\u2019 a voice says, and I snap the laptop closed, which probably means I\u2019ll have to start that section over again. I turn and glare \u2013 at Reid, who\u2019s relocated my shoulder bag from the adjacent seat and plopped down next to me.</p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing here?\u2019 I whisper much too loudly.</p><p>\u2018Looks as though I\u2019m joining you for opening night. Different movies, of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I shake my head, cobwebs clearing. \u2018You\u2019re going to New York. Today. On my flight.\u2019</p><p>He smirks. \u2018Or \u2013 you\u2019re going to New York on my flight.\u2019 Pulling his boarding pass from his back pocket, he asks, \u2018So what seat are you? We might as well get this over with.\u2019</p><p>I know for a fact that Reid prefers the aisle, while I insist on the window. And of course we\u2019re both flying first class, alone ... I turn my ticket over next to his.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u2019 3A, 3B.</p><p>\u2018What are the chances that I\u2019ll make it to New York alive?\u2019 Reid has never, ever been a morning person, and yet he is alarmingly wide awake for someone who should be sleeping off a hangover with one or more idiot girls and missing his flight.</p><p>If only.</p><p>\u2018Better, if you shut up and stay that way,\u2019 I mumble.</p><p>I want to get back to my end-of-section quiz while the material is fresh, but I don\u2019t particularly want to do it with him looking over my shoulder. And now the expectation that I can intimidate my rowmate into muteness like I always do is shot to hell.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t suppose you can just pretend you don\u2019t know me for the next six \u2013\u2019 I glance at my phone display \u2013 \u2018or oh-my-God seven hours?\u2019</p><p>He smiles, picking at a fingernail. Without turning to look at me, he asks softly, \u2018Why do you still hate me?\u2019</p><p>I falter before hissing, \u2018Like you\u2019re all good with me?\u2019</p><p>Hands moving to grip the seat on either side of him, his shoulders taut and facing straight ahead, he angles his head just enough to look at me. His hair falls forward, hiding his focused expression from everyone but me. \u2018I don\u2019t hate you, Brooke.\u2019</p><p>The gate agent announces the impending boarding process, and Reid breaks our staring stand-off, turning to get my bag and his own from the seat next to him. I shove my laptop into the rolling bag, stand and pull the handle as he shoulders his only bag and hands mine over.</p><p>\u2018Will our first class passengers please begin boarding at this time,\u2019 the agent intones robotically, and I march forward to present my boarding pass, Reid right behind me.</p><p>When we reach our seats, he automatically takes my bags and heaves them into the overhead bin, placing his in beside them as I take my seat. As he slides into the seat next to me, each of us pulls a drink menu from the seat pocket, avoiding eye contact with our fellow passengers as they trudge by sluggishly.</p><p>It occurs to me that to these strangers, we look, to all intents and purposes, as though we\u2019re travelling together.</p><p>Half an hour later, we\u2019ve each downed a coffee, and Reid has requested and eaten a bag of caramel popcorn. The plane taxis down the runway, finally, and judders into the air at a worrisome angle, but we haven\u2019t exchanged another word.</p><p>An hour later, I clear my throat. \u2018Are you ... going to sign the paper?\u2019 My question is barely audible over the droning of the plane engine.</p><p>Leaning closer, but without turning to look at me, he says, \u2018I talked to Dad. We\u2019re requesting a confidential paternity test first.\u2019</p><p>A blaze of resentment rips through me like a flash fire. And then I recall that Reid\u2019s father is, of course, an attorney. Like Norman Rogers, he\u2019s bound to proceed cautiously \u2013 more so in matters pertaining to his son. Proof is a required starting point. And I know better than anyone that the proof will be conclusive.</p><p>Checking my resentment, I ask, \u2018How long will it take to get the results?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think it will take long. I already did my part of it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><p>He shrugs. \u2018It\u2019s not that complicated, I guess. Once they have his, it shouldn\u2019t be more than a day or two.\u2019 After another drink service, during which I order a club soda and Reid orders (and is given) a scotch on the rocks, he ventures, \u2018I\u2019m not sure what happens after that. Everything is complicated by the fact that you went to Texas,\u2019 he lowers his voice to a whisper, \u2018to have him. The relinquishment does no more than take my rights away \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have any rights \u2013\u2019 I hiss.</p><p>\u2018Think of the title of the form, Brooke. If no rights existed, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to relinquish.\u2019</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>REID</p><p>This after-party is the most over-the-top event I\u2019ve ever attended. The hotel ballroom looks as though someone took a slice of Vancouver\u2019s Gastown district and airlifted it to New York. One wall boasts an animated projection of Burrard Inlet, while the remaining three walls are covered in convincing replicas of storefront fa\u00e7ades. Bistro tables line the bricked \u2018streets\u2019 while globed street lamps cast spheres of light on squares of real grass and paths dotted with light-strung trees. In the centre of it all is the Gastown Steam Clock, which \u2013 through the magic of CGI \u2013 is blown to smithereens in the next-to-final scene of Mercy Killing.</p><p>I snap a few photos and text them to Dori.</p><p>Me: Isn\u2019t this ridonkulous? I wish you were here.</p><p>Dori: I wish I was in LA. Mom just called. Esther isn\u2019t doing well.</p><p>Me: She\u2019s sick?</p><p>Dori: I don\u2019t want to interrupt your night. I\u2019m a mess. Maybe we could just talk tomorrow, please?</p><p>\u2018Talk to me.\u2019 I\u2019ve found a private niche outside the ballroom. People are milling around in the hallway, and the band from inside the party is audible, but this is as discreet as it will get until I get back to my hotel and in my room.</p><p>Dori is crying. No. She\u2019s bawling. The sound squeezes my heart like someone has reached inside my chest cavity and seized it, and all I know is I would do anything \u2013 anything, to stop her anguish.</p><p>\u2018Reid.\u2019 Her voice is already hoarse. God knows how long she\u2019s been distressed over this while I viewed my stupid film and accepted accolades from the audience and the crowd waiting outside. The sound of her sobs turns me inside out. \u2018I don\u2019t ... I don\u2019t want to ruin your big night. Can we please talk tomorrow?\u2019 She\u2019s covering the phone so I won\u2019t hear the sobs between the sentences. As if I can\u2019t feel it anyway when she speaks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Baby. Please talk to me. Nothing is more important to me right now. What happened?\u2019</p><p>She wrestles with herself to stop crying, her breaths coming in slowing stutters. \u2018I knew this was coming. Esther has lived a long, good life. She\u2019s my age. Did you know that? When we adopted her, they knew her birthdate, and it was the same as mine \u2013 the same exact day. Dogs don\u2019t live this long. I\u2019ve been so lucky.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m about to snap this phone in two, I\u2019m so frustrated that I can\u2019t comfort her.</p><p>This long-distance thing is complete ass.</p> <p>\u2018She started limping last week, and Dad took her to the vet. She\u2019s got ...\u2019 More sobbing comes from her end and I turn towards the wall, clenching my jaw. \u2018She\u2019s got multiple tumours. All over. The last few days, she\u2019s been whimpering when she walks, and she stopped eating yesterday. They\u2019re taking her to the vet tomorrow morning.\u2019 She dissolves again and I curse under my breath.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just \u2013 the last time I saw her was the last time I\u2019ll ever see her, and I didn\u2019t know it. I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye. Just like ...\u2019 More tears.</p><p>Just like Deb. Oh, fuck no. No goddamned way.</p><p>\u2018Dori. I need to go. I\u2019m going to call you back in like \u2013 ten minutes. Maybe fifteen, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to call back \u2013 Reid, seriously, thank you for listening \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018When I call, you answer. Okay? Swear.\u2019</p><p>She takes a deep breath and squeaks out a heartbreaking, \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>I fight the urge to punch the stone wall in front of me. Breaking my hand will solve nothing.</p><p>When she answers, she\u2019s more hoarse than before, but not crying. \u2018Hello.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey, baby. I\u2019ve got some instructions for you. Do you have a pen?\u2019</p><p>She sniffles. \u2018Uh, instructions? What?\u2019 There\u2019s a paper-shuffling sound. \u2018Okay?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Are you in your room?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, good. Write this number down \u2013 it\u2019s important: 1360. That\u2019s your flight number. I want you to start packing. Now. A car will be waiting outside the Starbucks to take you to the airport. That flight leaves in just over an hour, and it\u2019s the last one of the day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What? But you can\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do not argue with me \u2013 you don\u2019t have time. Pack a bag. Get to the Starbucks. Get in the car. The driver will drop you at the right gate. Go inside and head right to the first-class counter to get your boarding pass. Don\u2019t forget to take your licence, by the way. I learned the hard way a couple of years ago that they don\u2019t let you on the plane without ID. When you land, there will be another car \u2013 the driver will have your name on a placard \u2013 and he\u2019ll take you straight home.\u2019</p><p>She starts crying again, and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s going to fight me, but thank God, she just rasps, \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>I bite back the I love you on my tongue. I won\u2019t ask for the return of those words from her, certainly not as a reward for this, and that\u2019s what saying it now would be. She\u2019ll say it when she\u2019s ready.</p><p>\u2018Let me know when you\u2019re home. Don\u2019t worry about the time here \u2013 I won\u2019t go to sleep until I know you\u2019re there. Call your parents once you\u2019re in the car.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Okay. Thank you, Reid,\u2019 she says again.</p><p>\u2018Go pack. I\u2019ll talk to you in a little while. If you have any problem, call me. My phone is in my front pocket and set to vibrate the crap out of my leg.\u2019</p><p>Her gravelly little laugh destroys me. I return the phone to my pocket and take a deep breath. If Dad wasn\u2019t sure how serious I was about Dori before, he sure as hell knows now.</p><p>16</p><p>DORI</p><p>When I was six, Deb and I lost our last grandparent \u2013 my father\u2019s opinionated, quick-witted mother, who made the world\u2019s best sugar cookies, loved to sing and fondly recalled her years as a piano teacher. At her funeral, my sister held my hand, and at the end of the day, she put me to bed.</p><p>\u2018I love you, baby sister of mine,\u2019 Deb said, tucking the covers to my chin.</p><p>\u2018How much?\u2019 I asked, Esther settling in next to me, as she did every night.</p><p>Leaning over me, her serious fourteen-year-old eyes shining, Deb whispered, \u2018As many grains of sand as there are on all the beaches in all the world.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For how long?\u2019 I pressed, and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u2018Forever and forever and forever.\u2019 When I smiled, she added, \u2018Duh.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019d repeated this ritual on occasion over the years, though I\u2019d never doubted my sister\u2019s love. Hearing her say it was a comfort that I sometimes craved.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to accept that Deb is forever changed. I\u2019ll never hear her quirky laugh or her sound advice again. I\u2019ll never feel her arms around me. She\u2019ll never tell me she will love me forever. She\u2019s gone but not gone, and my heart is in limbo, unable to say goodbye.</p><p>Because of Reid, I got to say goodbye to Esther. Last night, she slept next to me one last time, nestled against my chest, her intermittent whines, so soft as to be apologetic, breaking my heart. We drove to the vet\u2019s office this morning, and I sat in the back seat, stroking her head where it rested on my leg. Telling her in whispers how much I loved her, and what a good friend she\u2019d been. Her big, dark eyes looked up at me, and I knew she was telling me goodbye too.</p><p>On the way home, I held her worn red collar tight in my hands, tears streaming down my face. I read the inscriptions on her tags \u2013 her licence info, our matching birthdate, her please-return-to number and address, and her name: Esther Cantrell.</p><p>It may seem odd to think of a dog as having a last name, because they don\u2019t need it for school or a job, but it was right. Esther and I shared a surname because she was family, tip to tail.</p><p>Kayla: Dori, have you seen the photos in the link I just sent you? Maybe nothing is going on, but I never liked that Brooke Cameron. She\u2019s probably as bitchy and stupid as her life\u2019s a beach character.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m actually home. We put Esther to sleep this morning. I\u2019m going back to Cal tomorrow.</p><p>Kayla: Oh no! I loved Esther. I\u2019m so sorry. Can me and Aimee come over to cheer you up?</p><p>Me: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, but thank you. I\u2019m going to visit Deb tonight. I\u2019ll see you guys next time, I promise.</p><p>Kayla: Okay. {{hug}} We\u2019ll keep an eye on that Brooke bitch for you.</p><p>The link Kayla sent goes to a gossip website. At the top are two photos \u2013 clearly cell-phone taken \u2013 of Reid. And Brooke Cameron. Together. In one, they\u2019re sitting together at the gate, talking and waiting for a flight. In the other, they\u2019re sitting together on that flight.</p><p>I spoke to him earlier today, and he\u2019d not mentioned her. Perhaps he\u2019s waiting for me to bring it up. Or hoping I won\u2019t. He didn\u2019t tell me they were going to New York together, but they clearly did. There are separate photos of each of them there too \u2013 attending the opening nights of their new films last night, both alone. No dates, no plus-ones. The media, of course, speculates wildly over what that means, and the post includes a photo of the two of them from years ago, holding hands, happy. They look the age I was when I fell in love with Colin.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to ask him about her. This day has drained me emotionally, and I\u2019m incapable of thinking rationally.</p><p>There\u2019s also my gratitude for the fact that thanks to Reid, I\u2019m at my kitchen table, making a gravestone out of a clay tile and ceramic buttons to place on Esther\u2019s spot in the back-yard garden. Two hours ago, Dad and I lowered her carefully into the deep hole he\u2019d dug at dawn, before we left. We positioned Esther\u2019s body as Mom stood by, holding a rawhide bone and her favourite toy \u2013 a squeaky banana \u2013 to be buried with her.</p><p>Esther loved chasing and rough-housing. She was one of those dogs who discouraged any fragile things placed on low tables for fear of her long, constantly wagging tail accidentally sweeping them to the ground. But wrapped in a beach towel of mine which she\u2019d absconded with so many times \u2013 dragging it to her dog bed like a security blanket \u2013 that I finally gave it to her, she\u2019d seemed so small.</p><p>\u2018Would you like tea?\u2019 Mom asks now, her voice as gruff as mine. Our grief over Esther has revived every anguished memory of Deb\u2019s accident. The three of us are wrestling with the tacit loss of my sister all over again, though no one says so.</p><p>\u2018Yes, please. Chai?\u2019</p><p>Mom nods and moves to the sink with the tea kettle. She stares out of the back window, gazing at that new mound of earth within the flower bed, where my identifying tile will go. In a month or so, the dirt will have compressed back into place and the weather will be warmer, and Dad will plant new flowers there.</p><p>Deb used to tell me hilarious stories of Esther as a puppy \u2013 how she regularly dug up part of Dad\u2019s flower garden to bury her treats and toys. She\u2019d then deposit newly uprooted flowers on the back step, like a confession, or a gift \u2013 infuriating our usually unflappable father.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s ... Reid?\u2019 Mom asks, and her question takes me by surprise.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s good, I think. He came up for a visit last week.\u2019 Keeping my eyes on the tile I\u2019m working on doesn\u2019t prevent my ears from growing hot, because I\u2019m hoping she doesn\u2019t ask where he stayed the night.</p><p>She\u2019s quiet for a few minutes, making the tea. When she sets a mug in front of me, she says, \u2018It was a nice thing he did, flying you home last night. Are you ... planning on seeing him, while you\u2019re here?\u2019</p><p>I note the slight judgement in her tone and answer defensively. \u2018He\u2019s in New York, actually. He won\u2019t be home in LA until tomorrow, after I\u2019ve gone back to Berkeley.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 she says, considering. She offers nothing more, padding from the room to take Dad his tea. He\u2019s in his study, working on tomorrow\u2019s sermon. I can\u2019t imagine trying to stand up in front of a congregation tomorrow and be encouraging or instructive \u2013 but then, he had to continue doing his job after Deb\u2019s accident. In the face of it, even.</p><p>No matter what grief or loss takes place, most of life flows on all around us, as though nothing\u2019s changed. At some point in our sorrow, we each make a choice to sink or swim. There\u2019s no other alternative.</p><p>REID</p><p>The paternity test results are in. No surprise \u2013 I\u2019m River\u2019s father. I anticipated this answer, of course. What I didn\u2019t expect was the irrational dread that tore through me, in the seconds before Dad gave me the 99% confirmed answer: I was afraid he was going to say he wasn\u2019t mine.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s definitely yours.\u2019 Dad\u2019s dismal tone makes it clear that this wasn\u2019t the outcome he was wishing for. I can\u2019t fault him. This can\u2019t be how he envisioned becoming a grandfather (assuming he\u2019d ever envisioned that), though legally he\u2019s sort of not one yet.</p><p>I expected this answer to amplify my frustration with the whole thing, foreseen or not. After all, the possibility that I\u2019ll have to tell Dori just became a probability. Legal concerns \u2013 something I thought I\u2019d moved past two months ago when I got my licence back \u2013 are about to complicate the hell out of my life. And most bizarre of all \u2013 I have a sudden, unwelcome sense of obligation towards Brooke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should be angry, but instead, I feel conflicted and relieved. What. The. Hell?</p><p>So then I think \u2013 maybe it\u2019s biological. I\u2019m a man and I\u2019ve reproduced. Maybe there\u2019s a sort of chest-beating satisfaction at the root of this. How fucking lame and archaic \u2013 I mean shit, seriously? On the heels of that thought is the knowledge that this same kid has turned Brooke Cameron into an ardent defender of motherhood \u2013 her own, of course \u2013 not the institution itself. But still. There must be some primitive impulse to blame.</p><p>Six hours later, I\u2019m meeting with Dad to decide what to do next. Dropping into a seat across from him, I wait while he finishes a client email. His home office looks the same as it always has \u2013 a near-duplicate of his high-rise headquarters, but I haven\u2019t given it a detailed survey in years.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t meet with clients here, of course, so there\u2019s no need for posturing \u2013 tasteful artwork, perfectly aligned legal books, smiling family photos. Accordingly, the only artwork hanging on the walls consists of a couple of repulsively gruesome war paintings he inherited from his parents, who died when I was too young to retain a memory of them. The built-ins behind him house a disordered arrangement of California and Federal criminal-law volumes, penal codes (the titles of which made me snigger as a ten-year-old), and thick tomes housing Supreme Court precedents. I thank fate once again for making me an actor, though at times I wonder how far apart my dad\u2019s career and my own actually are.</p> <p>On his cupboard is an array of framed photos \u2013 all turned to face his desk, as though he glances at them occasionally, or can if he decides to. The largest is my favourite of my parents on their wedding day. Next to it is Mom holding me the day I was born \u2013 she, fresh-faced and beautiful, and me, nothing but a cranky face the size of a grapefruit, encased in a tube of blue blankets. Another shows Mom and me on my first day of kindergarten, my backpack more like a giant shell on my back. She smiles down at me, her hand on my head, and I\u2019m all teeth and big blue eyes, laughing straight into the camera.</p><p>While Dad taps at the keyboard, I rise and pick up the pewter frame. Looking closer, I mentally compare this photo to the one of River. Only a year older than he is now, I look much bigger. My clothes are new and expensive \u2013 a mirror image of what hip adolescents wore at the time, though at five, I couldn\u2019t possibly have known or cared. My expression is far from solemn. Even so, I see him in my features. I see him, if he was cared for. And happier.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want this, any of it, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck on a track, and the train is coming, and there\u2019s nothing I can do but accept the inevitable and try to mitigate the collateral damage.</p><p>\u2018All done,\u2019 Dad says, and I set the photo back in its place and take a seat in front of his desk, leaning forward, elbows on knees, hands clasped. Mirroring the sensation I got walking between Brooke\u2019s box towers a few days ago, the walls are closing in.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t expect you to answer what I\u2019m about to say right away, though we haven\u2019t got the time to linger over decisions. You\u2019ve said that Ms Cameron intends to adopt the child \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018River.\u2019</p><p>\u2018River. Right.\u2019 His pen scratches across the pad. \u2018Do you know whether she intends to continue to live in LA? Or move back to Texas?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s moving into a two-bedroom condo near the one she\u2019s in now. I assume that means she plans to be here most of the time, if not all of the time.\u2019</p><p>Pursing his lips, he taps his pen, staring at his handwritten notes. \u2018My initial reaction was hope that I could extricate you from this situation, because this isn\u2019t something for which you can serve a few weeks of community service or pay a fine, and then it\u2019s all over.\u2019</p><p>He leans up and our eyes lock \u2013 his dark, like Dori\u2019s, and I wonder how long it\u2019s been since he\u2019s looked at me so directly. \u2018I\u2019m not going to lecture you about protection \u2013 I think you know these things, and you probably knew them then, but not well enough to be consistent. If anyone should be lectured, it\u2019s me. Christ, you weren\u2019t even fifteen when this happened.\u2019 He runs a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, his jaw locked. \u2018The fact remains, you fathered a child, even if you were a child yourself at the time \u2013 and instead of living with settled adoptive parents, he\u2019s presently in foster care, and it\u2019s very likely he\u2019ll be living with your unstable ex-girlfriend soon, minutes away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are you saying, Dad?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m saying ... that if you relinquish your rights to him now, you may live to regret it.\u2019</p><p>Okay. This day is full of unanticipated responses. I nod once and stare at my hands as he continues.</p><p>\u2018When you were born, I was petrified that I\u2019d be a horrible father. Your grandfather was a hard man and he taught me nothing of paternal tenderness. I guess in many ways my fear came true \u2013 I made it true. But I never turned my back on you. I don\u2019t have to look at you right now and try to explain why I signed away my rights to you. Giving up a baby for adoption is a good thing, almost always, in cases like yours and Brooke\u2019s. What\u2019s happened to the \u2013 to River \u2013 is virtually unheard of. It couldn\u2019t have been foreseen, and there\u2019s little use asking why or how it happened. All that matters is what we choose to do about it now. What you choose to do about it now \u2013 because I won\u2019t make this choice for you. But I\u2019ll stand by you, no matter what you decide.\u2019</p><p>I close my eyes and will the walls to shift further apart so I can breathe. \u2018Assuming I don\u2019t sign the relinquishment, what happens?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Three choices. One, you simply refuse to sign it, making the adoption more difficult for Brooke, but likely resulting in an eventual relinquishment by default. Two, join Brooke\u2019s bid to adopt and request joint custody. Three, file for full custody. Considering the fact that you were fifteen when he was born, she knew you were the father, and no one saw fit to inform your legal guardians, a case could be made that you never legally relinquished your rights. She signed her rights away, with full parental consent. You signed nothing, and neither did we.\u2019</p><p>Brooke will be furious no matter which of those I choose. I\u2019m going to drive Dori away as soon as I spill this to her. And I could destroy my mother\u2019s fragile sobriety.</p><p>\u2018What about Mom? What will this do to her?\u2019</p><p>His mouth forms a grim line, and he\u2019s silent for a moment. \u2018I\u2019ve grappled with that all day. I don\u2019t know, Reid. She\u2019s been going to meetings every day. She\u2019s doing well. Better than I\u2019ve seen her in a decade. But you and I know that upheavals like this ...\u2019</p> <p>I drop my head in my hands, pulled in a million directions. \u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>Ever the attorney, he says, \u2018I\u2019ll have to consider how to best disclose it to her. That will be mine to handle, however. You have enough on your plate.\u2019</p><p>17</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>My discussion with Janelle goes as predicted \u2013 she has a gradually mushrooming shit-fit, insisting that I should have told her about River long before now.</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I ask, sitting on the tan leather sofa across from her desk. Boasting an impressive view of Hollywood, Janelle\u2019s new corner office is located several floors up from her original shoebox-sized cube with its parking-lot view.</p><p>\u2018So I could be prepared for things like this!\u2019 she exclaims.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u2018And how exactly would you have prepared for this? I gave him up for adoption when I was sixteen, and never expected to see him again. If I couldn\u2019t have \u201cprepared\u201d for this, how the hell would you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 She spits her go-to I\u2019ve-had-it-up-to-here word at me. \u2018But I still think you should have told me.\u2019</p><p>I offer an indolent one-shoulder shrug, which she hates. \u2018Janelle, if you don\u2019t know by now that there\u2019s a load of crap you don\u2019t know about me and never will \u2013 then we\u2019ve got an even bigger problem.\u2019</p><p>If the pen she\u2019s holding was any thinner, she\u2019d be holding two busted pen halves and a face full of ink. Her jaw clenches and she smiles tightly. \u2018Is there anything else you do plan to tell me?\u2019</p><p>Here we go \u2013 the reason for my in-person visit. \u2018Well. Yes.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u2018You look sheepish. I\u2019ve never seen you look like this. I don\u2019t like it. What \u2013\u2019 I watch as her quick brain connects the dots and her face pales. \u2018Oh, no. Paper Oceans \u2013 you\u2019re still going to do it, right? Brooke. Brooke \u2013 I\u2019m too young and healthy to die of a heart attack, even if I want to!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Janelle. I just don\u2019t see how I can.\u2019</p><p>Her blanched face refills with pink from the bottom up, like someone is topping it off. \u2018B-but you said Get me an audition for something powerful. You said Something like Monster, but where I don\u2019t have to look ugly like Charlize. And I did it! I did it, Brooke. You were so upset when that Castleberry twit got the role. When she busted her ass \u2013 literally, hah-hah! \u2013 on that slope, it was like a miracle. You don\u2019t turn down miracles in this business, Brooke!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t leave him. I can\u2019t leave the process.\u2019 I hold up a hand to forestall the comment forming on her tongue. \u2018I\u2019m not going to screw this up, Janelle.\u2019</p><p>Like a boulder tumbling down a hill, nothing stops her. \u2018But screwing up your career is no big deal?\u2019 Her eyes bug and I hope she meant what she said about being too healthy to have a heart attack. \u2018Can\u2019t we just \u2013 we\u2019ll get you an au pair! We\u2019ll send them with you. Angelina hauls her brood all over the globe!\u2019</p><p>Instantly sceptical \u2013 sure I\u2019d read something about at-home and filming swap-offs \u2013 I ask, \u2018She does?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hell, I don\u2019t know \u2013 probably. Who cares \u2013 because you can!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um, no, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll have just got placement of him. I can\u2019t run off to Australia with him before the adoption is final.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s so google-eyed that it makes my eyes water to look at her. \u2018Look. Brooke. We haven\u2019t heard from the studio yet \u2013 maybe something in your circumstances will change, and we won\u2019t have to turn it down ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like \u2013 maybe the court will tell me I\u2019d be the most screwed-up mother he could have, and toss me out on my ass?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t mean that ...\u2019</p><p>I narrow my gaze on her. \u2018Have they called you yet? Because if you do anything even remotely resembling an attempt to keep him from me just so I will do Paper Oceans, I will fire you so fast you\u2019ll be embers.\u2019</p><p>She blinks multiple times and then darts her eyes away, tugging at her suit jacket and harrumphing. \u2018I\u2019m supposed to call someone back tomorrow, actually, and of course I wouldn\u2019t do ... that ... to you.\u2019</p><p>Seeing Janelle in person was definitely the right move.</p><p>\u2018I know you wouldn\u2019t, Janelle.\u2019 I smile sweetly, my tone conciliatory, with a touch of my native drawl. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to accuse you. I know you would never do anything to hurt me.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flight to Austin is blissfully uneventful \u2013 no broody teenagers or flirtatious businessmen. No Hollywood golden boys I\u2019d like to strangle with my bare hands. When the flight attendant closes the loading door and the seat next to me remains vacant, I mutter, \u2018Oh, thank God,\u2019 a bit too vehemently, earning me an arched brow from a lady across the aisle. I pretend not to notice. Feeling the effects of the past week in all its stressful glory, I know one more annoyance might result in an air marshal and handcuffs.</p><p>Finally free of the breakneck round of promotion for Hearts, I\u2019m heading back to Texas to address the final pieces of my application for River\u2019s adoption \u2013 one of which is my mother, who\u2019ll soon be contacted for her opinion on my suitability as an adoptive parent. As if she would have a clue.</p><p>Some time in my pre-adolescence, some jackass came up with the term MILF and the boys I knew quickly applied it to my mother. Now, Mom\u2019s a three-times-divorced cougar, and instead of being mortified at those titles she wears them like she wore the hayseed beauty-queen crowns now stored in a lighted display case \u2013 proudly. She refuses to see that her looks are all she\u2019s ever had going for her, and now that she\u2019s on the verge of losing them, she\u2019s become a pathetic stereotype.</p><p>Never undertaking any sort of career aside from securing and discarding husbands, she\u2019s accepted a multitude of labels over the years, including trophy wife and single mother. When I was little, she called herself a \u2018stay-at-home mom\u2019 whenever it suited her, though she did little to nothing to earn that designation.</p> <p>I know how she\u2019ll respond to my bid to adopt River. I knew before I came \u2013 because out of all the titles she\u2019s willingly assumed, I can\u2019t imagine Grandma ever being one of them.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen my mother since she showed up in LA last spring, without notice, expecting entrance to the premiere and after-party of School Pride \u2013 for herself and her latest cougar-bait. I granted them entrance to the film, but pretended I couldn\u2019t get her into the party on such short notice. Total bullshit, but there was no way I was dealing with her up close and personal while Reid and I focused on our doomed plan to break up Graham and Emma.</p><p>When I arrive at her downtown apartment at our prearranged time \u2013 10:00 a.m., she\u2019s fully made up, but still wearing her black dressing gown.</p><p>\u2018Hello, Brooke,\u2019 she smiles tightly. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s had work done since I\u2019ve seen her, because her facial features look a tad ... stretched. Her caramel eyes are the same as always \u2013 somehow cold despite their warm colour.</p><p>Leading me into the familiar living area, she gestures towards the plush sofa and I sit while she grabs her cup of coffee from the kitchen counter and sits without offering me anything. A new yappy dog runs up and barks annoyingly, beginning to nip at my ankles until I lean down and growl \u2013 a trick I learned with the last one. Like its predecessor, it runs away bleating.</p> <p>\u2018I assume there\u2019s a reason for your visit beyond terrorizing Tipsy.\u2019 Tipsy?</p><p>Where Kathryn\u2019s drawl is comforting, my mother\u2019s inflections wring my insides like dishrags. I hate the sound of her voice. I hate her calculating eyes. I hate that I came from her, that she tried to make me into her likeness and in many ways succeeded. I hate that I can\u2019t escape this connection, no matter what I do.</p><p>I fix her with a polished stare of my own. \u2018Yes. I\u2019m here to inform you of a decision I\u2019ve made that will affect you, though probably not much.\u2019</p><p>Her mask drops for a moment and curiosity peeks through. \u2018Oh?\u2019</p><p>I take a breath through my nose and just blurt it out. \u2018I\u2019ve applied for custody of my son.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, what?\u2019 Her pencilled-on eyebrows would no doubt arch if they could.</p> <p>\u2018He was taken from his adoptive mother because of extreme neglect, and he\u2019s currently a ward of the state. I\u2019ve applied to adopt him.\u2019</p><p>I wait while she processes what I\u2019ve just told her, wondering if I\u2019ll have to repeat it with smaller words.</p><p>\u2018What the hell are you saying, Brooke? Did CPS come after you to take \u2013?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. This was my choice.\u2019</p><p>She blinks, her mouth going slack. \u2018You mean to tell me ... you are \u2013 on purpose \u2013 taking back that brat you gave away five years ago?\u2019</p><p>Oh, hell no. I breathe through my nose one more time. \u2018Do not ever call him that again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t call him a brat? People will call him worse. After all, he is a bastard \u2013\u2019</p><p>The slap shocks us both. I stand, shaking. My hand stings and the pink print of it is visible on her cheek until she covers it with her palm. Her eyes are radiating indignation, gears spinning behind them, and every defensive instinct I have is on red alert.</p> <p>\u2018A caseworker is going to call you. Tell them whatever you\u2019d like about me \u2013 I\u2019m sure you will anyway. Just make sure whatever you tell them is the truth. If you lie, and I find out about it, I will go straight to a reporter I know at People, and she\u2019ll happily whip up a sweet little story about my relationship with you that will make Joan Crawford look like Mother Mary.\u2019 The false threat rolls off my tongue, but I calculate that I can make it true if I have to. \u2018I\u2019ve turned into the famous little actress daughter you wanted. Now, you can return the favour by staying the hell out of my life. Feel free to claim me in your laughable circle of expendable acquaintances. But fuck with me or my son and I will make you wish I was never born.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry \u2013 I\u2019m way ahead of you there.\u2019 Her snarling face resembles that of her overbred, ankle-snapping dog. \u2018You always were a selfish little bitch.\u2019</p><p>Her words render me breathless for a moment, and bring back all of those backhanded slaps from my childhood and adolescence. The hair-pulling. The cruel verbal jabs about any imperfection.</p><p>\u2018Well. I learned from an expert.\u2019 I smile, as if nothing she\u2019s ever said has affected me, which feels like the biggest lie I\u2019ve ever told. \u2018Have a nice life, Sharla.\u2019 Marching to the door without a backward glance, I bite my tongue until I taste blood. I will not cry in front of her. That\u2019s what therapists are for, goddammit, and I\u2019m getting one as soon as I get back to LA.</p><p>I slam her door behind me, and dial my father\u2019s number once I get to the pick-up truck I borrowed from Glenn. I might as well get all the hell over with in one day.</p><p>\u2018Daddy?\u2019 I say when he answers. \u2018I have something to tell you. Do you have a minute?\u2019</p><p>REID</p><p>In view of what I\u2019m about to tell Dori, and what I\u2019m about to ask of her, I feel like a two-faced asshole when I pick her up the Friday evening before her birthday. All she knows is that I\u2019m taking her across the bay into San Fran for the weekend. I promised her she\u2019d have time to study for a major exam scheduled for Monday \u2013 which would be humorous if I wasn\u2019t so preoccupied with the coming conversation.</p><p>I\u2019ve decided not to tell her until Sunday. I want to give her the best weekend of her life before I disclose this sort of news. If there was any way around it, I would put it off longer. I hate that I have to tell her at all, ever.</p><p>On a bookcase shelf in her library alcove, my mother has a small wood-carved quotation by Robert Frost that says, \u2018The best way out is always through.\u2019 I\u2019ve never fully understood that line until now.</p><p>The solitary drive on the 5 from LA to Berkeley is even more monotonous than I remember from the road trip John and I took a couple of years ago. I want my own wheels this weekend, though, so we won\u2019t have to rely on chauffeured transportation. When I pull on to the side street next to her dorm, almost everyone ogles the car. It\u2019s not my yellow Lotus (I think Dori would have appreciated Dad\u2019s mocking douche taxi title, had she been around at the time), but the feline body shape and headlights and the Ferrari marque are conspicuous, even in a staid grey.</p><p>At the corner just ahead, Dori spots me, ducks her chin and hurries to the passenger side. Her hair is swept into a giant clip at the back of her head, and she\u2019s wearing jeans, dark green Chucks and a Cal sweatshirt. She\u2019s using her backpack as an overnight bag, which makes me wonder if she has any decent luggage. Something else I need to remedy, soon.</p><p>My heart rate jams into high gear as she slips inside and shuts the door.</p><p>\u2018Happy birthday,\u2019 I say, taking her face in my hands and kissing her.</p><p>She braces one hand against my chest, twisting it into my shirt and leaning closer as her mouth opens under mine. It\u2019s been twenty-six days since I\u2019ve seen her, and that interval somehow feels like hours one moment and years the next. There\u2019s a sense of desperation to this kiss that scares me, because it\u2019s not just coming from me.</p><p>\u2018Thank you again for last weekend \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was nothing. I wish I could have been with you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p><p>Something flares in her eyes and she lowers them quickly, like a window shade screening whatever she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>I pull her chin up. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>She shakes her head and tries to smile, but she\u2019s no actress. \u2018It\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just ... still sad. I don\u2019t want to ruin the weekend you\u2019ve planned. Let\u2019s not talk about it. I\u2019ll be okay.\u2019</p><p>I want to press her to tell me what\u2019s going through her mind. I want to tease her about what a horrible liar she is, and how I need to give her lessons, if she means to do it right \u2013 but the words stick in my throat. I can\u2019t call her on a fib with what I\u2019ve been hiding from her.</p><p>\u2018No problem,\u2019 I whisper, kissing her again before taking her backpack and placing it in the seat behind her. \u2018I plan to indulge your every desire this weekend, Miss Cantrell.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s unusually quiet as I manoeuvre through in-town traffic. Crossing the bay, she stares out of her window, silently watching the yachts and fishing boats, her gaze rising to follow the occasional seagull. For the hundredth time, I struggle to find some way out of telling her about River \u2013 not now, not this weekend \u2013 but I may not see her until her spring recess \u2013 a month away. Some time in the next few days, Dad will start the adoption process. After I\u2019ve told Brooke, of course.</p><p>They\u2019ve accelerated the schedule for my next film, much of which will be shot on set at Universal Studios in LA, with the rest shot in Utah and New York. Filming was supposed to start in April; instead, we\u2019re starting next week, with the scenes in Utah up first.</p><p>The best way out is always through.</p><p>I\u2019ve made Saturday dinner reservations, so when I suggest that we stay in and order room service tonight, Dori agrees.</p><p>\u2018You can even do a little studying,\u2019 I say, and she crooks an eyebrow at me, dubious. \u2018Maybe like twenty minutes\u2019 worth.\u2019 Pulling up to the valet at the Mandarin, I add, \u2018Once dinner arrives, though, you\u2019re mine.\u2019 Grinning, I grab our bags and hop out.</p><p>We\u2019re definitely recognized at the front desk \u2013 or at least, I am. I think the desk clerk is more than a little worried that I\u2019m checking in with an underage girl, given Dori\u2019s backpack and make-up-free face \u2013 thank God for the Cal-wear she\u2019s sporting, which suggests that she\u2019s the co-ed she is. Within minutes, we\u2019re in the designated elevator, zooming up to the suite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh, my gosh \u2013 my stomach,\u2019 she says, holding on to me and laughing.</p><p>\u2018No need for the elevator to waste time when it doesn\u2019t plan to stop anywhere along the way. I promise that\u2019s the last rushed experience you\u2019ll have tonight.\u2019 I kiss her nose as the doors slide open. \u2018Everything else will be unhurried and deliberate. If you want something faster,\u2019 I bend to whisper in her ear and she gives a gratifying shiver, \u2018you\u2019ll have to say so.\u2019</p><p>Her lips part when she sees the suite, and she\u2019s speechless for several minutes, standing in the doorway and scanning from one side to the other and back. Finally, she leaves the entrance, tentatively, and moves into the room. \u2018This is all ... ours? This is one room?\u2019</p><p>I shrug, enjoying her amazement. \u2018It\u2019s a suite.\u2019</p> <p>Within minutes, we\u2019re enjoying an unobstructed view of a breathtaking sunset over the bay \u2013 judging by the fact that she seems to stop breathing, watching it. I couldn\u2019t have timed this better if I\u2019d actually scheduled our arrival time to coincide with the sun\u2019s measured retreat.</p><p>True to my word, I set her up at the desk and let her do her thing while I put our stuff away and order a dinner of champagne, Nasi Goreng and Singapore Noodles \u2013 to be delivered in an hour and a half.</p><p>\u2018Time\u2019s up.\u2019 I lean over her and nuzzle her cheek. \u2018I\u2019ve given you a very generous half-hour of study time.\u2019</p><p>She leans her head back on my shoulder and closes her eyes. \u2018I can\u2019t only study for half an hour \u2013 I\u2019m going to fail ...\u2019</p><p>I pull her chair away from the desk and kiss her behind the ear, eliciting a soft moan. \u2018If you\u2019re a good girl, I\u2019ll allow you another half-hour tomorrow.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m always a good girl, Reid,\u2019 she says, and the ear I\u2019m attending to warms under my tongue. \u2018I mean ... uh ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018No explanation needed,\u2019 I chuckle, kissing down her neck before releasing her hair from the clip and slipping her sweatshirt off. Underneath, she\u2019s wearing a white tank with a scooped neckline trimmed in lace \u2013 which I can see straight down from my vantage point behind her. A sweatshirt ... with this hidden beneath it?</p><p>\u2018Jesus, Dori.\u2019 My head is swimming with wanting her, and I\u2019m determined to pay her back in kind, and then some. Cupping my hands over her shoulders and sliding forward, my thumbs follow the line of her collarbone while my fingers brush over the curves of her breasts. \u2018You\u2019re perfect.\u2019 She starts to object and I place two fingers over her mouth, slipping my other hand into the top of her white lace bra. She arches back and gasps, giving me better access to her warm skin, her heart beating against the palm of my hand.</p><p>Pulling her up and kicking the chair out of the way, I turn her and am kissing her deeply before she can take a breath. Her tank follows the sweatshirt to the floor. Gripping her hips, I ask, \u2018Shower before, during or after? Since you\u2019re the birthday girl, your wish is my command.\u2019</p><p>\u2018During?\u2019 Her brow creases. \u2018During wha\u2013 oh. Oh.\u2019</p><p>I release her long enough to pull my T-shirt off, and then lift her until she settles her legs around me and hooks her ankles at the base of my spine. Carrying her into the bathroom, I say, \u2018What you\u2019re doing right now? Yes.\u2019 I kiss her. \u2018Exactly this. In about three minutes.\u2019</p> <p>She slides down the length of me when I put her down to switch on the hot water and then turn to remove her jeans. I\u2019m kneeling, tugging her jeans from her feet when she says, \u2018I thought you said something about ... unhurried ...\u2019 She steps out of them, nibbling her lower lip and standing in front of me in nothing but scraps of white lace.</p><p>\u2018So I did,\u2019 I answer, rising. Unbuttoning my jeans while my eyes skim over her curvy little body, I whisper, \u2018How is it not my birthday? Because I\u2019m definitely getting my wish.\u2019</p><p>Once my jeans are off, I back her to the wall and she squeaks.</p><p>\u2018Cold?\u2019 I laugh, pulling her away from the chilly marble and kissing her while I unhook her bra and slide her panties over her hips. \u2018It\u2019s warmer in the shower. And be prepared to be very, very wrinkly \u2013 because if you want slow, by God, you\u2019re getting slow.\u2019</p><p>We barely have time to get our robes on before dinner arrives an hour later. Curling up on the sofa with her legs beneath her, Dori pretends to read while the room service attendants set up the table by the window. Her hair is still damp and shoved back behind her pink-tipped ears. I struggle not to laugh at this girl who is the most mind-blowingly responsive lover I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 while also bizarrely bashful in the presence of hotel personnel.</p><p>While we trade bites of our meals, placing chopsticked morsels into each other\u2019s mouths in a way that would be impossible to get her to do out in public, I coax her into sipping a glass of the champagne \u2013 just enough to render her languid and periodically giggly after dinner, mostly when I kiss her somewhere ticklish, like the bottom of her foot, or the curve of her waist, or the top of her inner thigh. For the most part, she sighs and smiles impishly, her hands wandering over me, gentle and teasing, until I pin her to the bed, at which point she grips my biceps and makes the most incredibly satisfying sounds I\u2019ve ever heard her make.</p><p>Note to self: stock a case of Mesnil Sur Oger ASAP.</p><p>18</p> <p>DORI</p><p>A month ago, I woke up with Reid in my narrow dorm bed, and it was like a dream \u2013 spending an entire night with him next to me. Burrowed under the covers, back pressed to his warm chest, his arms surrounding me \u2013 I wanted to stay there forever.</p><p>Waking up with him in this suite feels like \u2013 what\u2019s better than a dream?</p><p>A fantasy. That\u2019s what.</p><p>We left the heavy draperies pulled open last night. Without moving from the bed, I take in the cerulean blue of the bay, blending into the lighter horizon beyond it. Boats cross the water slowly \u2013 tiny specs of white or grey from this distance, without form.</p><p>The suite is perfectly temperature-controlled, and the pillow-topped bed is huge, so we weren\u2019t required to sleep like two spoons in a drawer due to winter chill or lack of space. Still, my ankle is hooked over his. With the arch of my foot, I stroke the soft hairs on top of his foot and he utters a sleepy, \u2018Mmm ...\u2019 Bare-chested, sheet pushed to his waist, his opposite arm is crooked under his pillow while the arm nearest me is parallel to mine, intersecting at our hands. His hand rests under mine, fingers folded loosely over the back of my hand.</p><p>Asleep, he looks so young, which is perhaps odd for me to think, considering the fact that I\u2019m eleven months younger than he is. With his independent demeanour and his successful career, it\u2019s difficult to view him as a boy who\u2019s a month shy of twenty. Except when he\u2019s unguarded, like now.</p><p>I slip from the bed to use the bathroom and brush my teeth, and a few minutes later, he pads in, still a bit heavy-eyed, his hair sticking in all directions. He\u2019s pulled on the plaid Cal pyjama bottoms I gave him when he visited campus, while I\u2019m wearing his Berkeley tank that completes the set. It falls to my mid-thigh, the arm openings extending almost to my waist.</p><p>It\u2019s all I can do to concentrate on getting rid of any traces of morning breath instead of turning and twining myself around him like a ribbon. He grabs his toothbrush and the toothpaste, blearily squirting a blob on to the bristles and attacking his teeth. When he begins to brush his tongue, I stare at my toothbrush, running it under the water stream and willing my pulse rate to normalize. My hair looks like chaos incarnate, but thank goodness, it\u2019s down and covering my ears, because I can\u2019t stop conjuring memories of his tongue. Sweet baby Jesus.</p><p>Before I can leave the room, he captures my hand and pulls me back, tossing his toothbrush next to mine. \u2018Good morning, baby.\u2019 Slipping his arms around my waist, his lips meet mine as his hands inch the hem of the tank higher. \u2018Should I call for breakfast now? Or do we want dessert first ...\u2019</p><p>Scraping my nails lightly over his hard pecs, tracing the sharp definitions and encircling each nipple with an index finger, I watch his eyes darken. \u2018Dessert, please,\u2019 I say, and he gathers me into his arms, walks to an overstuffed chair in the living area and settles me astride his lap, giving me a floor-to-ceiling view of the bay over his shoulder that I can\u2019t quite take advantage of at the moment.</p><p>His hands alternately dipping into the sides of the tank or gripping the bare skin of my hips, he makes love to me with slight adjustments of clothing only, pushing his drawstring pants lower on his hips after producing a condom from the pocket.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s some confidence, Mr Alexander,\u2019 I whisper, closing my eyes as he rains kisses down my throat and pulls the arm slit of the tank to my mid-chest, exposing one breast and making good use of his gifted tongue.</p><p>\u2018Um-hmm,\u2019 he mumbles, completely unrepentant about his smug capacity to dissolve my reticence like a quick, hard summer rain dissolves chalk sketches from sidewalks.</p><p>I dig my nails into his shoulders and down his hard, muscled arms, holding him close and almost crying from pleasure. He chuckles, pulling me tighter \u2013 his confidence fully justified.</p><p>After a late breakfast on the terrace of our suite, wrapped in fluffy robes and soaking up the sun, we dress and head out for a day of attempted incognito shopping. Reid\u2019s dark sunglasses, two to three days of facial scruff and the Cal cap I bought him, along with my standard ordinary-girl appearance, fool the general public just enough for us to remain anonymous, for the most part. We earn a few double takes \u2013 especially from clerks in the shops \u2013 but there aren\u2019t any mob scenes.</p><p>In a boutique shop on Fillmore, he chooses several dresses and tells me to go try them on. \u2018If you hate them all, we\u2019ll go somewhere else. But I\u2019m getting you something that will make you feel like royalty when we go out tonight.\u2019 I start to object, but he hands the hangers to a shop attendant and presses me towards the dressing room. \u2018No arguments, because I chose somewhere completely condescending and snooty for dinner, and that\u2019s not your fault.\u2019</p><p>His line of reasoning makes a peculiar sort of sense ... until I look at the price tags. \u2018Reid,\u2019 I hiss, poking my face out from behind the dressing-room curtain. \u2018I can\u2019t wear this. It\u2019s the price of a car.\u2019 He smirks. \u2018A used car, maybe,\u2019 I qualify. \u2018But still.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I bought a car two months ago, and I will personally guarantee that nothing in that dressing room is anywhere near the price of a car. Even if you wanted all of them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t!\u2019 I gasp. \u2018But \u2013\u2019</p><p>Crossing his arms, he says, \u2018Let\u2019s assume that for you, the price of a nice dress is the price of a decent new car, minus a couple of zeros. Yes?\u2019 I nod. \u2018That\u2019s what this is for me. It\u2019s all relative, Dori.\u2019 He pushes the curtain aside enough to peek inside. \u2018Let me see.\u2019 Smiling, he asks, \u2018You love it, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>I chew the inside of my cheek, appraising myself in this dress \u2013 a soft, dark royal blue knit cut like it was made exclusively for me. It somehow upgrades every physical attribute I\u2019ve got \u2013 enhancing the good and improving the bad. But I don\u2019t want him to buy me something this un-reasonable. My life is made up of enough make-believe with him even in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stepping into the dressing booth and drawing the curtain closed behind him, he pulls the zipper down at the slowest pace imaginable and catches my gaze in the mirror. His eyes are steely. \u2018I\u2019m purchasing this dress, Miss Cantrell, and you\u2019re going to wear it tonight. Understood?\u2019</p><p>Caught between wanting to stomp his foot for ordering me around and wanting to throw my arms around him for making me feel like the most desirable girl in California, I simply nod.</p><p>\u2018Good girl. As always \u2013 like you said.\u2019 He places a kiss on my nape and leaves the room.</p><p>We\u2019re driving back to the hotel when my brain clicks everything into place. I turn the music down. \u2018Reid. This car \u2013 this car cost that dress, plus a couple of zeros?\u2019</p> <p>He just smiles out of the windscreen and I\u2019m glad to be sitting down and strapped in.</p><p>Holy cow.</p><p>While Reid is showering, Brooke calls him \u2013 no last name. She\u2019s in his contacts, then, as simply Brooke. I assume it\u2019s Brooke Cameron, though of course there are other Brookes in the world.</p><p>This could be a publicist Brooke. Or an admin Brooke. Or a mechanic Brooke. Frozen in place, I stare at his phone\u2019s display while it buzzes. A minute after the buzzing stops, a message alert beeps. She\u2019s left him voicemail.</p><p>Wandering out minutes later with a bath sheet slung loosely around his hips, rubbing his hair dry with a hand towel, he glances to where I\u2019m carefully removing the price tags from my dress. After detouring to turn me by my robe\u2019s belt and steal a slow-building kiss, one hand slipping inside the robe to stroke the bare skin of my hip, he smiles and turns to dig shaving accoutrements from his bag, his phone feet away on the night table.</p> <p>Trembling from his touch and the words stuck in my throat \u2013 Brooke called you \u2013 I walk into the bathroom.</p><p>I pull coils of my hair up with hairpins while Reid shaves, reflecting that he was in the bedroom long enough to listen to the message, but I didn\u2019t hear him call her back. He doesn\u2019t seem uneasy or concerned. Expression concentrated, he runs the razor over his foam-obscured jaw, pausing to swish the blade beneath a stream of hot water after each swipe.</p><p>Maybe it was unimportant. Maybe it was nothing.</p><p>\u2018You got a call while you were in the shower,\u2019 I finally say, watching him.</p><p>His brows draw down slightly and his eyes flick to me. \u2018Oh?\u2019</p><p>Staring into my own eyes, I lean close to the mirror and run the mascara wand over my lashes. \u2018From Brooke?\u2019 I clarify, trying to sound unconcerned. Trying to be unconcerned.</p> <p>He stops cold, staring at me, and I feel as though the air has all just been sucked from the room. \u2018Did you ... answer it?\u2019 he asks, strained.</p><p>He must not have looked at his phone, must not have seen the alert. Even before calling her back, he\u2019s more on edge than I\u2019ve seen him since the night he came to speak to my parents. The apprehension is plain on his face \u2013 his normally evasive-if-necessary face.</p><p>\u2018Of course not, Reid \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t answer your phone.\u2019 I frown, as taken aback by his question as I am by the disquiet in his eyes and the rigid line of his bare shoulders. If I could backpedal right now and retract my mention of her, I would. I wanted this to be nothing. I wanted him to shrug and say it\u2019s nothing, but it isn\u2019t nothing. It\u2019s clearly anything but nothing.</p><p>It\u2019s too late to about-face, but I can\u2019t watch this unravel, not now, even if I\u2019m the one who pulled the string.</p><p>\u2018I have to tell you something \u2013\u2019 he says as I say, \u2018I only wanted to let you know \u2013\u2019</p><p>We both stop.</p><p>He licks his lips, still unmoving, his face half shaved. \u2018Dori, tonight is your birthday celebration. Let me take you out \u2013 let\u2019s have our night out, and we can talk later, or tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m a coward. A willing coward, complicit in my own fall. I\u2019ve never told him that I love him, as if refusing to say it aloud would somehow shield us both, but it hasn\u2019t. Like an untamed, sentient thing, full of all I am and yet estranged from me, my heart discerns its own truth and knows that this omission is a lie.</p> <p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he says.</p><p>REID</p><p>I want to shake Brooke until her perfectly straight, Hollywood-white teeth rattle. God fucking damn her timing. I don\u2019t know what message she left, but I suspect it\u2019s a Why haven\u2019t you signed that form yet call \u2013 which can wait, because she\u2019s going to give me hell over my answer.</p><p>Dori and I finish dressing in silence, and when she\u2019s done, she looks more beautiful than she\u2019s ever looked \u2013 while clothed. The deep blue of her dress reveals the flawless tone of her warm skin, and matches my eyes besides. The clingy knit hugs the lush curves of her hips, and nips at her waist, while the neckline plunges just low enough to give a hint of her perfect breasts. She was made to wear clothes that fit her like a second skin.</p><p>Still, nothing compares to how damned gorgeous she is when there\u2019s nothing between us. In my bed \u2013 or hers \u2013 with her modest demeanour suspended and her curious nature aroused, she\u2019s everything I could ever want.</p><p>\u2018Your tie matches my dress,\u2019 she says, running a finger over the silky pattern down the centre of my chest. \u2018And your eyes.\u2019 I packed a crisp white shirt and a dark grey jacket and slacks, plus an assortment of ties, intending to match whatever dress she chose today.</p><p>We\u2019re taking one last look at ourselves and each other before we exit the room, the mirror reflecting how very different but complementary we are \u2013 my build still angled and a bit boyish, but tall and broad-shouldered next to her smaller, softer frame of arcs and curves. Our colouring contrasts too \u2013 my blue eyes and dirty blond hair next to her almost black eyes and smooth mahogany curls. I imagine pulling those pins from her hair, one by one, and pushing my fingers through the soft strands.</p><p>\u2018How many hairpins did you use?\u2019 I ask, my words seeming like so much small talk while I\u2019m picturing her beneath me in a few hours\u2019 time, hair spread across the pillow like a spill of ink.</p><p>She smiles, but permeating every tic of her mouth is an underlying sadness that I\u2019m determined to wipe away, no matter what I have to do. I will make her forget that badly timed call \u2013 for tonight, at least.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure. A lot?\u2019</p><p>Pulling her to me, I don\u2019t have to bend as far to kiss her. When I pull away, I smile down at her. \u2018Mmm, you\u2019re wearing heels. Do me a favour \u2013 walk across the room and back. I won\u2019t get to appreciate this view nearly as much as everyone else will tonight.\u2019</p><p>She purses her lips, self-conscious, but she complies, turning to walk the length of the 2,000-square-foot suite.</p><p>Oh. God. Damn. Her hips sway, and my eyes are torn between following her curvaceous ass, her shapely, naked calves, or the arch of her neck \u2013 bare but for a few strategic tendrils allowed to escape the pins. She turns at the opposite end of the room, eyes widening in confusion at the look on my face, and I wonder how the hell that\u2019s possible \u2013 because she just looked in the mirror, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>As she returns, I find that it\u2019s no easier to decide what to focus on from this perspective. Same flawlessly muscled legs and rounded hips, with the addition of those perfect breasts and her beautiful face.</p><p>\u2018We need to leave now,\u2019 I say gruffly when she reaches me. \u2018Right now. Or else I\u2019m going to toss you on that bed,\u2019 I take her in my arms and whisper into her ear, \u2018and fuck you senseless.\u2019</p><p>She leans into me and gasps softly, flushing scarlet, fingers crushing the sleeves of my jacket and digging into my arms.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just put that on the agenda for our return, shall we?\u2019 I kiss her one more time, gently, carefully, and then pluck her tiny clutch from the dresser and lead her from the room, never releasing her hand.</p><p>The paparazzi find us between the valet stand and the restaurant door, which is no big shock, considering I shaved and ditched the classic celebrity disguise \u2013 hat and sunglasses. They get off a few shots while bellowing my name. They don\u2019t know Dori\u2019s yet \u2013 too slow to match my designer-swathed date with her Habitat girl alter ego.</p><p>Once we enter the restaurant, all the diners and every employee from the head waiter to the chef are aware that a paparazzi-worthy guest has arrived. The whole place is either staring or trying not to. So much for a private, low-key meal.</p><p>\u2018That wasn\u2019t too bad, was it?\u2019 I ask, holding Dori\u2019s hand across the tiny candlelit table, ignoring the audience and hoping she can as well.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m still seeing spots ... but no, I guess not.\u2019 She blinks a couple more times. \u2018How in the world do you see where you\u2019re going if you\u2019re alone?\u2019</p><p>I nod. \u2018Yeah, that can be tricky. If you\u2019re with bodyguards or other handlers, they just cannonball you through the crowd to where you need to be, almost like crowd-surfing. When I\u2019m with other celebs, we stay in a herd as much as possible and head in the general direction of an entrance, exit, or car door.\u2019</p><p>She laughs lightly. \u2018That\u2019s terrible.\u2019</p><p>I arch a brow at her. \u2018And she laughs! Where\u2019s the compassion?\u2019</p><p>Attempting to suppress her smile, she fails entirely. \u2018No, I\u2019m serious! But I mean, a herd of you? How is that not a funny mental picture?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad my pain amuses you,\u2019 I say, feigning a stern countenance.</p><p>She releases my hand and runs her finger across my palm. \u2018Well, no herd tonight. And no bodyguard, either \u2013 unless I can stand in. I may not look very tough, but I pack a mean shin-kick.\u2019</p><p>Imagining her booting a hulking stalker photog in the shin is only amusing to the extent that I make sure it never happens \u2013 because I sort of believe she\u2019d do it. \u2018You\u2019re plenty tough, Dorcas Cantrell.\u2019 When I reclaim her hand and brush my thumb over her knuckles, her lips part. \u2018But your bodyguarding skills won\u2019t be necessary this evening. I\u2019ll get the head waiter to help us sneak out when we leave. Don\u2019t worry over that now. Because right now, I\u2019m just a guy, trying to have a romantic dinner with this beautiful girl ...\u2019</p><p>She lowers her eyes.</p><p>\u2018You aren\u2019t worried, right?\u2019</p><p>Her smile is wry. \u2018No. But I\u2019m really relieved to be wearing this dress, instead of an extra-large iced-tea-and-fruit-stained T-shirt.\u2019</p><p>19</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Reid is seriously pissing me off, but what else is new? He\u2019s only been doing that for-fucking-ever. I get that he might be busy \u2013 Reid-world busy \u2013 which could mean anything from starting a new film project to banging a new girl, but he\u2019s had plenty of time to get the paternity test results and sign that freaking relinquishment form.</p><p>I texted him mid-week and he didn\u2019t answer. I called him last night and he didn\u2019t answer. I left him a voicemail he didn\u2019t return.</p><p>This is the sort of avoidance that makes me think something problematic is going on. I\u2019ve worked too hard to get all my ducks swimming in a row, as Kathryn would say. I even called Daddy, which I\u2019d been putting off doing. After that delightful meeting with my mother, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose. So I gave him the shortest version possible of what I was doing, and he was silent for half a minute or so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Brooke, you\u2019re still so young \u2013 and there\u2019s more to being a parent than you know,\u2019 he began, clearly about to launch into couldn\u2019t-be-less-welcome life advice.</p><p>\u2018You think?\u2019 I snapped, and he shut up right quick. \u2018Look. I\u2019m not asking your opinion or guidance any more than I wanted Sharla\u2019s. This is an FYI call only. And if you want to tell the adoption caseworker what a horrible mother I\u2019ll be, then just go ahead.\u2019</p><p>He had the nerve to sound taken aback. \u2018Brooke, I would never do that. I know I wasn\u2019t the best father \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God \u2013 really? Because you keep having more children, which makes it seem like you think you\u2019re great at it.\u2019 I wanted to rip the gear shift out and beat myself with it after saying that. I\u2019d just tacked a bull\u2019s-eye right over my most emotionally susceptible spot. Idiot.</p> <p>\u2018The opposite, actually. I kept thinking I could start over again and get it right.\u2019</p><p>Holy shit, I thought. How deluded could he be? \u2018Well, that\u2019s just stupid. You\u2019re screwing around with people\u2019s lives and breaking people\u2019s hearts. I can\u2019t imagine why you left Kathryn for Sharla.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t stop sneering my mother\u2019s given name like I was spitting out something poisonous. \u2018Or why Kelley and Kylie weren\u2019t enough for you.\u2019 Or why I wasn\u2019t enough for you.</p><p>\u2018The problem, Brooke, is that with Sharla came you. With Vivian came Rory and Evan. The marriages may look like colossal mistakes from this distance, but I don\u2019t regret any of you kids. So I guess I can understand your motivation to get your boy back ... and maybe you\u2019re doing it right. Getting the child without the dysfunctional relationship.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You say you don\u2019t regret me, but you left me. You didn\u2019t just leave a bad marriage. You didn\u2019t just leave my mother, Daddy \u2013 you left me.\u2019 I bit back tears.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ... sorry.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah, well.\u2019 I steeled my jaw. \u2018Try calling Rory before he turns into a teenager who hates you. Try taking Evan to the zoo or something. Go to their soccer games, or school plays, or birthday parties, instead of just sending them money.\u2019</p><p>I realized by the time I was fifteen that my father never slacked on his financial support of me. He paid his child support payments on time. He sent birthday cards and an escalating amount of cash every year. But I was jealous of the kids whose dads showed up for their lives.</p><p>\u2018Do you hate me, Brooke?\u2019</p><p>I sighed, too tired to hate more than one parent at a time with any real conviction. \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>He sighed in return. \u2018You always were brutally honest.\u2019</p><p>I huffed an indignant laugh. \u2018Mom just told me I was always a bitch.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What? That\u2019s absurd. I think the whole state of Texas knows who the bitch is, sugar.\u2019 He hadn\u2019t called me sugar since I was ten. The age I was when he left. My jaw clenched up again.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not kidding, Daddy. Call Rory and Evan. I\u2019ll ... keep you posted on River.\u2019</p><p>\u2018His name is River? Brooke and River.\u2019 He chuckled. \u2018I like it. I\u2019d like to meet him \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not if you\u2019re going to disappear on him,\u2019 I countered.</p><p>\u2018I ... understand. Keep me posted. And don\u2019t worry about Sharla. She\u2019ll come around.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, she won\u2019t \u2013 but I don\u2019t care. You know as well as anyone \u2013 some things just don\u2019t work out.\u2019</p><p>Me: WHY aren\u2019t you calling me back? Have you signed the form???</p><p>Reid: Give me five minutes. I\u2019ll call you.</p> <p>\u2018Have you signed it?\u2019 I answer in place of hello, trying to keep the panic out of my voice, but there\u2019s something going on, and I know it. Something he\u2019s not telling me. I can feel it the way you feel certain storms out here in the hill country, right before they roll across the horizon. Like the air is charged. Electric. The invisible hairs on your body all standing up for it. Waiting.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t, and I\u2019m not going to \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018What? What? What the fuck, Reid \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will you give me a minute, please? We need to talk about \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reid, if you don\u2019t sign that form \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t threaten me, Brooke.\u2019 His voice is solid, authoritative in a way it\u2019s never been, and I\u2019m shot through with fear, because he has the upper hand, and he clearly knows it. \u2018Please shut up and listen.\u2019</p><p>I say nothing.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t sign the form because ... I don\u2019t want to relinquish my rights to him.\u2019</p><p>My whole body begins to shake uncontrollably, like it did the time I popped an amphetamine at a party \u2013 which scared me so badly I never tried it again. I yank on my boots, which look ridiculous at the end of my flannel pyjama bottoms, but I don\u2019t care. Phone pressed to my ear, I tromp down the hallway and into the kitchen, where Kathryn and Glenn are making brunch together \u2013 a Sunday morning ritual. Jazz flows lightly from the sound system and the smell of waffles and bacon permeates the room.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m walking down to the creek,\u2019 I tell them, yanking a sweater from the coat rack and sliding the back door open.</p><p>Kathryn turns, spatula in hand, her smile fading as she takes in the phone and my freaked-out expression. \u2018Everything okay, honey?\u2019 Her head angles and she takes a step towards me.</p><p>\u2018Fine. Everything\u2019s fine.\u2019 My smile feels like elastic play putty. There\u2019s nothing of me in it. \u2018I\u2019ll be back up in a few minutes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to join your adoption application,\u2019 Reid says as I pull the glass door shut behind me.</p><p>\u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 I\u2019m trembling so hard that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll drop the phone. Pulling the sweater\u2019s hood over my head as though the chill in the air is responsible for my body\u2019s reaction to Reid\u2019s words, I stomp in the direction of the creek. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I talked to my dad \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018So this is a legal move? You\u2019re covering your ass or some shit while I\u2019m trying to give him a home \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. No, that\u2019s not it.\u2019</p><p>I realize then that he\u2019s speaking quietly. Almost whispering.</p><p>\u2018Where are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m in San Fran. With Dori. Her birthday is tomorrow, so we\u2019re here for the weekend. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t call you back right away. That ... and I knew how you\u2019d react to this.\u2019</p><p>In the short amount of time I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve already begun to re-flatten a path from the house to the creek. \u2018Let me guess. You still haven\u2019t told her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you told your dad.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. And I plan to tell Dori. Today. I just wanted to wait ...\u2019 He sighs. \u2018I wish there was some way I didn\u2019t have to tell her. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s going to react.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re at a hotel? It\u2019s like 8 a.m. there \u2013 are you in the room?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Our room has a private terrace. I\u2019m outside.\u2019 He laughs softly. \u2018With a blanket. Jesus Christ it\u2019s colder here than LA.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about the weather, Reid.\u2019</p><p>I reach the creek, and my favourite rock, the flat surface of which is freezing cold. The slow trickle of the current is soothing, even so. I tuck the sweater under my butt and pull my knees to my chest, shivering and exhaling quick-fading clouds of warm breath.</p><p>\u2018Okay. Yeah. I know.\u2019 He sighs. \u2018Dad thinks the best thing would be if we join the application you\u2019ve already started.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing this, Reid. You\u2019ve never expressed any interest in him \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t think he was mine, Brooke. I got that conviction in my head years ago, and I just never let it go \u2013 not until we talked a couple of months ago. Not fully, to tell you the truth, until you sent me that photo. And now \u2013 the fact that you haven\u2019t once asked about the test results, well, obviously, you didn\u2019t need to ask. You knew what they\u2019d be.\u2019</p><p>I close my eyes. Feel the speckled rays of sun touch my face through the trees. Listen to the creek babble. And forgive him, finally. \u2018I did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit. I\u2019m just so \u2013 sorry \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018We were kids, Reid \u2013 I know that. We were too young to be in love or anything. We were just kids.\u2019 These are hollow words, of course. I loved Reid, once upon a time. For too long, I\u2019ve held on to a silly little-girl belief that I didn\u2019t misread him completely. That some part of him loved me too. It\u2019s time I got over that ... and yet, I don\u2019t need or want to hear the blunt truth.</p><p>\u2018Brooke ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reid, don\u2019t.\u2019 My words are barely audible.</p><p>\u2018I just \u2013 I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong impression \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, then let\u2019s just drop it?\u2019 I press my forehead to my knees, wrapping the sweater all the way around myself like a blanket. I can\u2019t deal with this right now.</p><p>\u2018Brooke, I worshipped you. And what I thought you\u2019d done, with those other guys \u2013 I could have handled it a million different, better ways. I know you hate me for deserting you and I deserve that. I\u2019d talked myself into the belief that he wasn\u2019t mine, and I let that colour everything else. But I did love you.\u2019</p><p>Tears well up in my eyes and soak into the thin flannel covering my knees.</p><p>\u2018Um. I need to go,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ll call you tomorrow, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure. Okay. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>I hang up and realize two things. One, Reid has just told me that he once loved me. And two, I still don\u2019t really know why he wants to adopt our son.</p><p>DORI</p><p>When I woke up, the bedside clock read barely past 8:00 in the morning. Reid wasn\u2019t in bed next to me, and his impression wasn\u2019t warm against my palm. I got up and pulled on the robe, which never left its peg last night. Flushing from the memory of Reid\u2019s follow-through on his pre-dinner promise, I stepped through our shoes, my lingerie, his shirt and tie, dozens of hair pins and his slacks. I\u2019d insisted on folding the dress over the desk chair.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t anywhere. I frowned, wondering if he\u2019d left the suite to get something when I caught sight of him on the terrace, in his robe. Despite the sun\u2019s rays on the patio cushions, the air here is still quite cool this early, and our room is at the top of the hotel \u2013 even chillier.</p><p>And Reid was outside. On his phone.</p><p>I could have gone to take a shower. Or ordered coffee and breakfast. Or picked up the bits of clothing and undergarments strewn from the suite door to the king-sized bed, in anticipation of the fact that we need to pack up and check out in a few hours.</p><p>Instead, I went to the door and opened it slowly. My body ached at the sound of his gruff morning voice \u2013 kept low, only a few words made their way to me: Worshipped. Million. Better. Mine. Love you.</p><p>I must have made a sound, because he turned and looked right at me, still talking. To her. I knew he was talking to her. He told her he has to go, that they\u2019ll talk tomorrow. He hung up as I backed into the room and he followed me inside, closing the door behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t know it would come this soon.</p><p>Tossing the phone on to a low table, he reaches me in four long strides and grabs my shoulders, stopping me before I back into a wall. \u2018Dori, we need to talk.\u2019 He swallows, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him look this apprehensive. \u2018I\u2019ll call for breakfast \u2013 unless you already have?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head, no.</p><p>He leads me to the sofa and seats me in a corner before opening the room service menu and calling in a breakfast order. On this call, his voice is full of his usual self-confidence, but it vanishes as soon as he sits next to me, the dark blue of his eyes flicking away and searching the room as though he\u2019ll find the words he needs to say somewhere outside himself.</p> <p>\u2018Okay. Do you know who Brooke Cameron is?\u2019</p><p>I nod. \u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>He exhales a long breath, one hand at the back of his neck. \u2018Well, we used to go out.\u2019 His eyes watch mine closely, reading and measuring. I don\u2019t know if I want to hide my thoughts or open them all to him. \u2018A long time ago \u2013 five years.\u2019</p><p>Most people dismiss relationships that take place at fourteen or fifteen. Puppy love. Infatuation. A crush. But I know all too well how serious fifteen can be.</p><p>\u2018It didn\u2019t end well.\u2019 He runs a hand through his hair, unable to stop fidgeting. \u2018It was pretty ugly, actually. I thought she\u2019d cheated on me. So I broke up with her without even really ending it. A couple of months later, she called and told me she was pregnant.\u2019</p> <p>Pregnant?</p><p>My brain calls up Colin, and what I would do or say if I ran into him now. He\u2019d discarded me for no reason that I knew of, although Deb suggested the fact that he\u2019d turned eighteen and I was fifteen was incentive enough. I never told him I was pregnant. I knew he wouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u2018Dori?\u2019 Reid says, his hand on my face. I look back into his worried eyes. \u2018Where\u2019d you go? Talk to me.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018I don\u2019t understand. Why is she calling you now?\u2019 As soon as the words leave my mouth, I know the answer. No. No. No.</p><p>His jaw flexes and his throat works. \u2018She gave him up for adoption.\u2019</p><p>I bite the inside of my cheek and my hands grip each other in my lap.</p> <p>He cups his hands over mine. \u2018God, your hands are freezing. We can talk about this later \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 My voice is the only solid thing left of me, and he flinches. \u2018Finish. Please finish.\u2019</p><p>He closes his eyes briefly before answering. \u2018He was mine, but I didn\u2019t know it. I didn\u2019t talk to anyone about it, Dori. My parents didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never even told John.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do you know he\u2019s yours?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We just did a paternity test.\u2019</p><p>Just. As in recently.</p><p>I\u2019m missing something, and I don\u2019t know what it is. When children are adopted, their biological parentage is no longer an issue. \u2018But \u2013 you said she gave him up ... Why \u2013?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A couple of months ago, she hired a private investigator to look for him. She was having nightmares about him and just wanted to make sure he was okay. The PI found out that he\u2019d been removed from his adoptive home months ago due to drugs and gross neglect. He\u2019s in foster care now. So she\u2019s ... she\u2019s applying to adopt him. And ... so am I.\u2019</p> <p>The hands that he thought were cold moments ago flash like ice and then go numb. I can\u2019t feel anything. And then, suddenly, I feel everything. Waves of chills run from the back of my neck to my toes, millions of tiny pinpricks like sharp, agonizing barbs. As though some outside source grips my throat, my airway narrows and expands, over and over, and with it, my vision.</p><p>\u2018I told you about ... everything that happened to me \u2013 with Colin,\u2019 I gasp. \u2018And you never said \u2013 you never told me \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dori, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t know. I thought Brooke had cheated on me. I swear, I didn\u2019t think he was mine. We were both so young and stupid and stubborn \u2013 we didn\u2019t talk like you and I talk \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like you and I talk? Like when you told me you had a child with someone?\u2019</p><p>He drops his head in his hands. \u2018I didn\u2019t think he was mine, and I had nothing to do with her decision.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you left her to make that choice \u2013 alone? And now you get a second chance at doing the right thing because she made a different choice than I made?\u2019 I shift away from him, but he reaches out and grabs my wrists.</p><p>\u2018Goddammit, Dori \u2013 no. It\u2019s not like that \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You said you\u2019re both adopting him. So you\u2019re ... you\u2019re getting back together?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. No. Jesus. This isn\u2019t about me and Brooke \u2013 it\u2019s only about River.\u2019</p><p>His child has a name. Of course he does. \u2018River?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s four and a half. I have a picture \u2013\u2019 He lets go of me, stands to grab his phone from the table and clicks through it. When he offers it, I reach to take it, thinking, I don\u2019t know him.</p><p>But I see him in his child\u2019s face. And if anyone needs saving, it\u2019s this little boy. His sadness is unmistakable, mirroring so many small faces from East LA to Quito \u2013 children shouldering the weight of the world. A world they didn\u2019t create, or ask to be abandoned to.</p><p>\u2018Dad is telling Mom this weekend. He\u2019s talking with contacts in LA County Family Court tomorrow, and we\u2019re going to Austin on Tuesday to speak with Brooke\u2019s attorney, and possibly the caseworker and judge. Last, but not least \u2013 I\u2019m not sure when this is going to break publicly, but once it does, it\u2019ll be a circus.\u2019 He takes the phone from my hand and tips my chin, looks into my eyes. \u2018Dori, say something.\u2019</p><p>The brusque rap on the door startles us both.</p><p>He sighs. \u2018That\u2019s breakfast, I guess.\u2019</p><p>While he rises to let the attendant in, I stare out of the window at the boats in the bay. From this distance, they look like models, or radio-powered toys. I imagine the holders of the remote controls are bored demi-gods occupying rooms like this on the top floors of tall buildings.</p><p>I feel his eyes sweep over me, neither of us speaking while our breakfast table is set up.</p><p>He is not the self-centred, arrogant boy who showed up at Habitat last summer, calling me a hypocrite for dismissing him and then proving to me that he was worth saving. Not the boy who urged me to be reckless with him last fall, because he was safe. Not the boy who showed up on the other side of my parents\u2019 screen door weeks ago, telling me he was all in before carrying me up the stairs and making love to me in my childhood bed.</p><p>This is Reid Alexander \u2013 the stuff of fantasy for ordinary girls. And in a few hours, this fantasy will be over. I\u2019ll return to my life, and he\u2019ll return to his.</p><p>20</p><p>REID</p><p>Dori is as quiet on the drive back to the dorm as she was on the drive into the city two nights ago. I slide into a rare open parking spot and offer to walk her in, but she has that exam to study for, and if I get out of this car, there\u2019s the possibility I\u2019ll be recognized \u2013 and she clearly doesn\u2019t need to deal with that right now.</p><p>We angle over the centre console to kiss goodbye until I murmur, \u2018Screw this,\u2019 slide my seat back as far as it will go and pull her into my lap. \u2018Mmm. Better.\u2019 Pushing my hand into her hair, I draw her mouth to mine and kiss her deeply, every slide of my tongue against hers, every shared caress a declaration of all she means to me.</p><p>Inhaling shakily, she rests her head against my shoulder. \u2018You didn\u2019t exactly encourage a lot of study time this weekend, you know.\u2019 Her hand lies over my heart.</p><p>\u2018Well, I got plenty of study time. I\u2019m pretty sure I could pick you out of a line-up of only belly buttons or kneecaps or pinkie toes now ... let alone the parts I committed to memory ages ago. For instance \u2013 I could have identified you by those delicious lips two days after meeting you.\u2019</p><p>She blinks up at me and tilts her head back on my arm. \u2018But you didn\u2019t kiss me until, you know, the pink closet.\u2019</p><p>I fix her with a suggestive look. \u2018I remember \u2013 but those lips were one of the first things I noticed about you. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about them, on or off site. I kissed you a hundred times in my imagination, and once I\u2019d actually kissed you, all I could think about was doing it again.\u2019 I run the pad of my thumb across her plump lower lip, recalling all the wretched time I spent trying to move on, trying to forget her. It had taken no more than two seconds of seeing her face again to realize that I hadn\u2019t forgotten a damned thing.</p><p>I wish I could read her mind. She\u2019s a pensive, deep-thinking girl, and it\u2019s not unusual for her to stare into space, lost in her thoughts. Normally, I\u2019m fascinated when she does this \u2013 the shifting emotions crossing her face, marked by faint smiles, frowns or grimaces. That\u2019s not how I feel now, when I can\u2019t escape the uneasy awareness that her contemplations concern me.</p><p>\u2018What are you thinking about?\u2019</p><p>She blinks distractedly, and then stares up at me with eyes so dark and fathomless that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never know all the mysteries behind them. Even if I can\u2019t follow her when she withdraws inside herself like this, I want her to know that I\u2019ll always be there to pull her back to solid ground before she goes under. That I won\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to say goodbye,\u2019 she says, her eyes shining.</p><p>\u2018Then don\u2019t say it,\u2019 I say, ignoring the subtle premonition in her words. Ignoring the fact that she\u2019s not asked a single question about River, or Brooke, or the adoption. Ignoring my own hunger to hear her tell me, just once, that she loves me.</p><p>RIVER</p><p>Wendy told me I might get a new mama. That I might go live with her.</p><p>The social lady came to talk to me about it \u2013 her name is Kris. She comes to talk to me sometimes. About Mama. Or about Wendy. Or about how I feel or what I think when I hide food. She said that I was just going to talk to the lady who might want to be my mama (except Kris said mother, not mama). Then she said, \u2018Can you draw me a picture about that?\u2019</p><p>That\u2019s what they always want me to do. Draw a picture.</p><p>I don\u2019t want a new mama. I want to stay here with Wendy, and I wish Sean would find a new mama instead. But I don\u2019t know how to draw that.</p><p>21</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>\u2018So, what you\u2019re telling me is \u2013 we\u2019re making a scrapbook.\u2019 Reid lifts an eyebrow and gives me a look of undisguised bafflement. Photos and scrapbooking supplies \u2013 borrowed from my stepmother \u2013 are spread across the huge, scarred farm table in Kathryn\u2019s kitchen where we sit side by side on a bench seat.</p><p>\u2018My caseworker, Sheldon, calls it a Life Book. But yeah, basically, it\u2019s a scrapbook.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And we have to do this because ...?\u2019</p><p>I heave a sigh. I can\u2019t blame him \u2013 crafts are something neither of us does without a damned good reason, if ever. \u2018River\u2019s caseworker will give it to him, to show him who we are and where we live. Where he will live. Hopefully, his foster mother will read what we write to him. Sheldon says some kids are thrilled shitless to leave their foster homes, and some aren\u2019t \u2013 so this helps.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reid laughs. \u2018Sheldon the social worker said thrilled shitless?\u2019</p><p>I shrug and laugh too. \u2018Sheldon\u2019s pretty laid back.\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head. \u2018I\u2019m just trying to imagine Dori ever saying that to a client.\u2019 One corner of his mouth turns up. \u2018Nope. Nothing doing.\u2019</p><p>Not for the first time, I wonder about this girl who\u2019s so unexpectedly significant to Reid. He pulls his phone from his front pocket and checks it for the third time in the past half-hour. Whatever he\u2019s looking for, it isn\u2019t there.</p> <p>\u2018While you\u2019ve got that out, let\u2019s go hook it up to my computer so we can print out the photos you took.\u2019 I get up and he follows me down the hallway to my bedroom.</p><p>As I\u2019m booting my laptop, he examines my room. There\u2019s not a lot to it, frankly. I\u2019m a minimalist everywhere I go. I stripped my apartment in LA of glass tables and white upholstery before I moved, but I don\u2019t do cosy \u2013 not naturally, which worries me where River is concerned. What if cosy is required for a child his age? I\u2019ve never painted walls anything other than some neutral tone. There were no photos out, anywhere in the apartment. My living-room furniture has never encouraged a spontaneous nap. I\u2019ve never had a pet, not even fish. I kill plants.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re different here,\u2019 Reid says.</p><p>I glance back at him as he\u2019s scooting on to my bed, one long leg off the side, foot on the floor, the other angling so the sole of his boot doesn\u2019t soil my white quilt. Reclining against the mound of pillows, he folds his hands behind his head, forearms flexed below the haphazardly rolled-up sleeves of his light blue button-down. His head tips to the side as he inspects the room, and me, and I turn back to the computer to keep from squirming.</p><p>I know what he means, I think \u2013 I\u2019m just not sure whether I care for his spontaneous appraisal. I like being looked at when I know I\u2019ve taken pains to look hot. Such is not the case at the moment. Ignoring both my blow-dryer and flat-iron, I haven\u2019t bothered to tame my naturally messy waves into the sleek, blonde waterfall mane I\u2019m famous for. I\u2019m wearing a long-sleeved thermal T-shirt in a plain heather grey over worn boot-cut jeans and my favourite leather-tooled Ariat boots. Nothing about me says LA right now \u2013 or Hollywood.</p> <p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 I ask, feigning unconcern as I pull up the photo folder labelled Life Book.</p><p>He considers before he speaks \u2013 which is either thoughtful or shrewd. \u2018It\u2019s more than just how you\u2019re dressed, or the lack of make-up \u2013 though that\u2019s noteworthy. Your body language and expressions are \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 more relaxed? And your accent is more prominent. You\u2019re less ...\u2019</p><p>I turn around and fix him with a sardonic look. \u2018Less stylish? Less sophisticated?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was going to say \u2013 less counterfeit. I know what you think of your mother, and how much you don\u2019t want to be like her. But you aren\u2019t like her. You were never like her. Your stepmother? She\u2019s the one you sound like, by the way. I know that now that I\u2019ve met her. Though your time in LA has probably weakened your accent permanently.\u2019 He looks at me through dark, thick lashes some blonds would commit homicide for. \u2018Which I\u2019ve always believed to be a regrettable loss.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean, counterfeit?\u2019</p><p>His brows draw together. \u2018You wear the LA-girl part well. But it\u2019s a role, isn\u2019t it? You were like this when I went by your apartment a few weeks ago too. This is the real Brooke Cameron.\u2019</p> <p>It takes everything I\u2019ve got not to fall out of my chair. \u2018Wow. When did you get to be so psychoanalytical? Is your girl responsible for this new, uncharacteristic awareness?\u2019</p><p>He smiles. \u2018Probably.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Interesting. I think I need to meet her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You will, no doubt.\u2019</p><p>I angle my head, struck by the thing I\u2019ve just figured out. He\u2019s in love with her. \u2018You\u2019re really serious about her.\u2019</p><p>He nods, but doesn\u2019t look happy. Hmm.</p><p>\u2018You did tell her about all this \u2013\u2019 I swirl a finger between us. \u2018River, the adoption, et cetera ... Right?\u2019</p><p>He nods again, lips compressed. \u2018She\u2019s had to deal with some rough shit lately. It\u2019s messed up her ability to trust.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m sure this didn\u2019t help any \u2013 or you keeping it from her.\u2019</p><p>His mouth flattens and he shakes his head once. \u2018Uh, no.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So why\u2019d you do it, Reid?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why did I keep it from her?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. That\u2019s yours to puzzle out. I want to know why you\u2019re doing this. Why you want to adopt River.\u2019</p><p>He flicks a blade of grass from his boot \u2013 slick, trendy and black \u2013 not cowboy boots, like mine, not work boots, like something Graham might wear. Perfect LA boy. But in Austin \u2013 straight-up hipster. Not that he\u2019d care.</p><p>\u2018I think it\u2019s a by-product of who I\u2019ve become since I\u2019ve known Dori. Since I was sentenced to work on that house. It\u2019s like ... I see issues I didn\u2019t see before, and my connection to them. My obligation to do something, where I can.\u2019 He looks me in the eye. \u2018Where River is concerned, it\u2019s a pretty hardcore responsibility.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve only ever felt that sort of responsibility where River is concerned,\u2019 I admit. \u2018I doubt I\u2019ll ever have any weighty sense of social commitment, but I feel linked to River, even if I\u2019ve never seen him.\u2019</p><p>Shrugging, he says, \u2018He\u2019s part of you.\u2019</p><p>I bring the laptop to the bed and sit, handing it to him. \u2018He\u2019s part of you too.\u2019</p><p>He hooks up his phone and brings up the photos I asked for \u2013 of himself, his parents\u2019 house and the room they\u2019ve set aside for River.</p><p>\u2018Wasn\u2019t this your bedroom?\u2019 I recognize the placement of the windows and the dark sliding closet doors. It\u2019s been five years, but I remember Reid\u2019s bedroom better than which house or condo Mom and I were living in at the time.</p><p>\u2018I moved to my grandmother\u2019s suite a couple of months after ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018After we broke up. You can say it. I won\u2019t shatter, you know.\u2019 We sit shoulder to shoulder on my bed, which seems as unbelievable as the subject we\u2019re calmly discussing. \u2018I know this might be difficult to hear, Reid, but I\u2019m kind of over you.\u2019</p><p>He smirks. \u2018Yeah ... when you went all Operation Graham last spring and deployed me to seduce Emma \u2013 I kinda figured that you were well over me.\u2019</p><p>Graham again. I close my eyes and press my fingers to my chest. Damn.</p><p>\u2018Still upsets you, huh? I guess you really did love him. God, there\u2019s no fucking way I\u2019m ever taking Dori around that guy. Because seriously.\u2019 His words are tongue-in-cheek, but the underlying tone is anything but.</p><p>\u2018Last spring, I was so sure I could deal with all-or-nothing,\u2019 I say. \u2018When I lost him, I knew that wasn\u2019t true, but it was too late. In that moment, I\u2019d have given anything to take it all back. Our friendship saved me \u2013 he saved me. No matter what I did or who I pretended to be, he was there for me. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019d be if it hadn\u2019t been for him.\u2019</p><p>Copying the photos over to my computer so we can print them out, Reid says, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I did that to you, Brooke.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018It wasn\u2019t you. I\u2019ve realized some things in the past few days. Like how I felt when my father left \u2013 when he stopped paying any attention to me. I was forever looking for something, or someone, to fill that void.\u2019 I send Reid\u2019s photos to the printer in Glenn\u2019s home office, shut my laptop and slide it off my lap. \u2018There are empty places in all of us, and some of them will never be filled. You couldn\u2019t fill the loss of my father, and I blamed that on you. Graham couldn\u2019t fill it, and I thought it was because I needed more from him than friendship. But that was never true.\u2019</p><p>He turns towards me. \u2018Dori and I were friends first, I guess. But I don\u2019t think I could ever be just friends with Dori, even though that part of what we are is essential. I\u2019ve wanted her almost from the beginning, and being with her only makes me want her more. It would kill me to be around her and never touch her. Maybe you\u2019d reached that point with Graham.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018See, that\u2019s the stupid part. I hadn\u2019t. I convinced myself of that, but it was a lie. You and Dori \u2013 you\u2019ve begun a relationship. Friendship only would be a step back that you don\u2019t want to make. But Graham never felt that way about me. Never. We were best friends for four years, Reid.\u2019 Tears spill down my face. \u2018I threw away the closest relationship of my entire life \u2013 aside from Kathryn \u2013 on a gamble to get something he\u2019d made it very clear he never wanted.\u2019</p><p>Reid slides his arms around me and pulls me to his chest. I haven\u2019t cried about Graham in months. Instead, I\u2019ve made myself endure that deep burn in my chest \u2013 the one that reminds me what I did \u2013 without giving myself the release of tears.</p><p>\u2018I called Graham about the adoption.\u2019 Reid starts and looks down at me, surprised. I take a shuddering breath. \u2018I knew River\u2019s caseworker was going to call him, and I was afraid of what he might say to her. He told me I couldn\u2019t use River to fill my need for affection.\u2019</p><p>Pulling away, I grab a tissue and look back at Reid, whose shirt is wet with my tears. \u2018Reid, River lost the only parents he\u2019s ever known. And he\u2019s understandably attached to Wendy, which will be another loss. If we do this, we can\u2019t back out.\u2019 I take his hand and stare into his eyes. \u2018Please don\u2019t do this if you can\u2019t be there for him. If you\u2019re going to start a new family some day and leave him behind. He doesn\u2019t need any more hollow places.\u2019</p><p>Staring down at our hands, he says, \u2018I\u2019ve thought for years that my father wasn\u2019t there for me, but he was. He was present \u2013 even if he didn\u2019t get me at all most of the time. Even if he didn\u2019t pay as much attention as he should have.\u2019 Returning his gaze to mine, he says, \u2018I\u2019ll be present, Brooke. I don\u2019t want to make promises I can\u2019t live up to, but I\u2019ll try my best to be more than present. Just promise me that if I fuck up, you\u2019ll call me on it. And you\u2019ll give me the chance to make it right.\u2019</p><p>I nod. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>Reid twitches his hair back and opens a palm. \u2018So. Does every girl I know have to turn insightful all at once? I mean hell \u2013 I know I\u2019m shallow, but Jesus. You\u2019d think somebody would be content to remain superficial, just to keep me company.\u2019</p><p>The weight leaves the conversation, and I\u2019ve unburdened myself \u2013 to Reid \u2013 without being demeaned for it. His wisecrack allows me to swim back to a place where my feet can touch the bottom.</p><p>\u2018Like John?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, right,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018I forgot about John. Dude, I\u2019m so covered.\u2019</p><p>REID</p><p>When Dori didn\u2019t answer texts or calls yesterday, I didn\u2019t freak out. She had classes all day, including that statistics exam she was worried about. It was her birthday, though, and I didn\u2019t get to talk to her. I told myself that her friends probably took her out to celebrate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even if it would have taken her thirty seconds to return a text.</p><p>Now it\u2019s Tuesday, she\u2019s still not replied, and every passing hour makes it harder to pass off her radio silence as the demanding life of a college student or a dead phone battery. I wonder if she\u2019s okay. I wonder if her parents would even try to call me if she wasn\u2019t. And then I wonder if I should call them. I try to remember her friends\u2019 names. (Kayla something. Aimee something. Shayma something.)</p><p>I\u2019m not cool with the direction my thoughts are taking, because I don\u2019t do clingy or needy or dependent or possessive.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent most of the day with Brooke, first at her attorney\u2019s office with Dad, and now at Kathryn\u2019s house making a scrapbook about us for River. After printing out photos of ourselves and parts of LA \u2013 hiking trails, parks, his bedroom-to-be at each of our respective places \u2013 we glue-stick them on to the pages, like kindergarteners.</p> <p>\u2018So, how do we plan to explain our relationship to him, since we\u2019re planning to move him from the one home he knows ... into two he doesn\u2019t know at all? Two parents who are already separated \u2013 that might be confusing.\u2019</p><p>Brooke chews one side of her lip, thinking. \u2018Hmm. Well, we need to convince him that we\u2019re friends. That we aren\u2019t going to drag him into a tug-of-war. All our self-portraits are separate. Are there any photos in existence of the two of us together, happy? But not, you know, happy-happy. Maybe something taken during School Pride?\u2019 Glancing at my dubious expression, she waves a hand. \u2018Yeah, never mind. We pretty much loathed each other for the duration of that whole thing ...\u2019</p><p>After today\u2019s revelations, I feel even worse about how I treated Brooke then. Seriously, having a conscience is ass. \u2018The only friendly one I know of is from five years ago \u2013 the one that got printed along with the pics of us at LAX a couple of weeks ago, along with all the theories about why we were flying together.\u2019</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u2018Right? Because nothing coincidental ever happens to celebrities.\u2019 She thumps herself in the forehead and grabs her phone. \u2018Duh. Let\u2019s just take one now. Lean in.\u2019</p><p>We lean our heads together and smile, and she takes two or three shots. After we choose one and she sends it to her laptop, I say, \u2018You know what the media is going to do with this story, right? River. Us.\u2019</p> <p>Sighing, she nods. \u2018I\u2019m not sure what slant they\u2019ll take, but they\u2019ll probably either try to make us into a pre-packaged little family, or we\u2019ll be the new young Hollywood poster children for teen irresponsibility. Like having a child is comparable to being jailed and rehabbed non-stop for a coke addiction. I wouldn\u2019t care what they say about me \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s new.\u2019</p><p>She shrugs. \u2018I just don\u2019t want River getting hurt because of it. Especially the whole illegitimate thing. So ... I was thinking about giving Rowena an exclusive for the first photos of River \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018What? No. Why would you even consider letting one of those vultures take photos of him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because, c\u2019mon, Reid, be realistic \u2013 they\u2019re gonna take photos of him. This is a huge story, and Hollywood babies are stalked hard. If we have Rowena do them, we diffuse some of the demand for him, and control how he\u2019s presented to the general public.\u2019</p><p>I grimace. \u2018Alarmingly, that makes some sense ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Of course it does. Look. He\u2019s four. If we can manage the way his story is told now, it will become the accepted account of his life. Once he\u2019s old enough to realize we\u2019re his real parents, it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Except when he figures out that you and I were happy-happy at least once, which should absolutely be our secret code word for sex.\u2019 I flutter my lashes and affect a feminine voice. \u2018Reid, since you have River this weekend, I\u2019m going to happy-happy my new personal trainer!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up.\u2019 She punches me in the arm just hard enough to bruise. \u2018I don\u2019t do people who work for me. Gross. And trust me, you\u2019ve been getting a lot more happy-happy than I have recently.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jealous?\u2019 She tries to punch me again and I block her and laugh. \u2018Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019d decided to do the season finale of Life\u2019s a Beach, along with that brainless beefcake you were involved with \u2013 what\u2019s his name \u2013 Xavier something-or-other? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be game for a little happy-happy.\u2019</p><p>Hiding her face, she laughs. \u2018Ugh! We were involved all of once \u2013 he was all pretty and no skill.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Unlike yours truly.\u2019 Grinning wickedly, I waggle my brows and she rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u2018Christ, your ego always was ginormous. Unbelievably, it appears to have grown. How does your new girlfriend handle that thing? Or is that what you like about her being an ordinary girl \u2013 ass over elbows because hot superstar Reid Alexander is paying attention to her.\u2019</p><p>I feel like she\u2019s just poked my good mood with a pin. \u2018Dori\u2019s not like that.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s never been awestruck by me or impressed by the whole celebrity thing, whether I wanted her to or not. She doesn\u2019t think of me like that.\u2019</p><p>She arches a brow. \u2018So you say. But you can\u2019t escape who you are, Reid, and neither can she.\u2019</p><p>And with those words, Brooke verbalizes exactly what I\u2019m worried about. The odd solidarity building between us today served as somewhat of a distraction from my uneasiness concerning Dori, but that\u2019s all it was \u2013 a distraction.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to step outside and call her,\u2019 I say.</p><p>But of course, Dori doesn\u2019t answer. I disconnect when it rolls to voicemail, and then send her another text, in which I try to sound like I\u2019m not about to lose it because she hasn\u2019t answered me since she got out of my car forty-eight hours ago.</p><p>22</p><p>DORI</p><p>Reid: You never told me how you did in the exam. Everything okay? Depressed to be the ripe old age of 19?</p><p>I stare at Reid\u2019s last text again and know I have to answer him. He\u2019s in Austin, with the mother of his child \u2013 who I didn\u2019t know existed until two days ago. All Sunday evening, I thought about what he said. How he hadn\u2019t known the baby was his. That he didn\u2019t know how to tell me.</p><p>I inferred from these words that he didn\u2019t want to tell me at all, and I should be angry or tolerant or hurt over the lie. I am all those things \u2013 but over his child\u2019s existence, not over the fact that he didn\u2019t tell me. Once I got over the shock of it, I can see why he didn\u2019t want to tell me.</p><p>Because he feared I\u2019d react like this. Maybe he even knew I would.</p><p>It\u2019s been hours since that last text, but when I answer it, he replies immediately.</p><p>Me: I survived the exam. 19 is a weird age to be. I think I should feel older. Or younger. I can\u2019t decide.</p><p>Reid: I\u2019ll give you a heads-up on 20 in 3.5 weeks. I suspect it may be more of the same.</p><p>Me: At least it will be a different decade. Observable progress.</p><p>Reid: True.</p><p>Reid: We met with Brooke\u2019s attorney and caseworker. They\u2019re going to try to make this as simple as possible, so the process isn\u2019t extended thanks to me joining it.</p><p>Reid: Can I call you now? Or tomorrow night when I\u2019m home?</p><p>Me: I\u2019ve got a study group in a few minutes and a guest lecturer symposium tomorrow.</p><p>Reid: Ok. I\u2019m heading to Utah on Thursday morning to start shooting scenes there, but I\u2019ll text you.</p><p>A few photos of our night out in San Francisco made it on to the gossip sites. It took a couple of days for anyone to identify me, and even still, there are sceptics \u2013 because in that blue dress and heels and Reid\u2019s shoulder partially blocking my face, I look nothing at all like that girl from Habitat. Nothing like an ordinary girl from LA.</p><p>The most vocal disbelievers think I\u2019m someone minor from his last film, or the new one that begins shooting in a couple of days. According to rumours, taking a bed-to-bed sampling of the female cast members is customary for Reid Alexander. I\u2019ve tried to get Kayla and Aimee to stop sending me links to the photos and stories \u2013 but they\u2019re far too excited to \u2018know\u2019 a celebrity like Reid.</p><p>My mind drifts back a few months, to when we\u2019d begun hanging out at his place, to the night I taunted him about having a popular novel with predominantly female fans on his bedside table. Brushing aside my snarky tone, he informed me he was up for the lead role in the film, as though this was no big deal. Deliberately, he gave me that lazy smile and asked if I thought he could bring him to life on the big screen.</p><p>He knew exactly what those words would do, once unleashed in my imagination.</p><p>Before I could hide my astonishment, he teased me by guessing that I was one of those \u2018brainy\u2019 girls who only got in trouble for reading past lights-out. (I was.) Before I left that night, he\u2019d kissed me \u2013 a lot \u2013 while a tiny sliver of my mind\u2019s eye was unable to stop picturing him as that brooding character I knew too well.</p><p>Thus began the weeks of what we termed being reckless \u2013 and I worry that from my viewpoint, at least, that word defines our entire relationship. Reid lives his life in a reckless way, and ever since his life collided with mine last summer, I\u2019ve been unbalanced. The trajectory of my safe, small orbit cannot contain him, and no amount of wishing will change that.</p><p>He told me on Sunday that once news of River breaks, it will be a circus. I\u2019m not sure what he means, not entirely, but I have a better idea than most. The truth will only be what the truth looks to be, not what it is. The media will toss out possibilities, and fans will gobble them down, making up their own storylines. They\u2019ll want to see Reid and his beautiful ex back together, saving their son from the horrors of drug addicts and foster care, and they won\u2019t want a plain-Jane nobody interloper in the mix.</p><p>Claudia drives Raul, Afton and me to Zachary\u2019s Pizza to brainstorm ideas for our group project. Afton and I don\u2019t own a car, and Raul\u2019s tiny, ill-maintained Fiat seats two and is forever running on fumes. He and Claudia argued about this all the way here and are still at it.</p><p>\u2018You never drive, even that one time it was just the two of us.\u2019</p><p>Raul peruses the menu, his eyebrows arched defensively towards his black spiked hair. \u2018So I\u2019d rather bum rides or take public transport everywhere and have a social life than buy gas for my little deathtrap \u2013 sue me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bum is right,\u2019 Claudia murmurs.</p><p>\u2018You do know pizza can be delivered? We didn\u2019t have to show up in person,\u2019 he says.</p><p>\u2018Not from Zachary\u2019s. And other places are so not the same \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Vraiment!\u2019 Afton interjects in French, though by the looks they give each other, neither of them speaks it. \u2018This place is the best. Now stop fighting, you two. God.\u2019 She punctuates this edict with a pout, which ruins the stern mother effect.</p><p>Gesturing at her with his menu, Raul objects. \u2018We\u2019re not fighting, we\u2019re sparring. It\u2019s what we do. If you don\u2019t like it, turn away.\u2019 He makes a move-along motion with his free hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afton rolls her eyes. \u2018I vote thin crust spinach and mushroom.\u2019</p><p>Raul is horrified. \u2018No way. I\u2019m a man. I need meat and I want it stuffed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what he said,\u2019 Claudia mumbles.</p><p>Before Raul can return fire, I notice one of the girls from my building who saw me with Reid the night he stayed in my dorm \u2013 one of the girls on the receiving end of that spontaneous wink of his. She\u2019s sitting at an adjacent table with several other girls, and they\u2019re all leaning their heads together and staring \u2013 at me.</p> <p>\u2018Uh-oh,\u2019 Claudia tells me quietly. \u2018I think your cover is blown.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What cover? What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Afton is wide-eyed and speaking in a whisper that could be heard two tables away.</p><p>\u2018Why. Are. We. Whispering?\u2019 Raul asks, whispering just as loudly.</p><p>\u2018Can we go somewhere else?\u2019 I ask, and they all look at me like I\u2019m insane. There\u2019s a mob of people waiting for tables, and we\u2019ve got one.</p><p>A waiter appears, as though Raul\u2019s growling stomach conjured him. \u2018What can I get for you guys tonight?\u2019</p> <p>As Raul and Afton order, Claudia scoots her chair a bit, blocking me from maybe two people at the table of six. \u2018Just ignore them.\u2019</p><p>Ignore them. Right. I rearrange my silverware, all too aware that they\u2019ve pulled out cell phones now and are taking pictures. Of me. When I was with Reid on Saturday night, and he guided me into the restaurant with one arm around my waist, the paparazzi flashes were different. The photos were of him, and I was merely with him.</p><p>Here, I\u2019m alone, ordering dinner with friends, living my average-girl life.</p><p>Except for the whole strangers photographing me part.</p><p>\u2018Why is that gaggle of sororstitutes taking our picture?\u2019 Raul asks when the waiter leaves.</p><p>Claudia sputters, \u2018Don\u2019t call them that, you sexist \u2013\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Have you seen the parade of them through my dorm room? No. You have not.\u2019 One of Raul\u2019s roommates is a total man-whore, and is beyond skilled \u2013 according to Raul \u2013 at locating and successfully propositioning every willing girl on campus. \u2018I can sleep through just about anything now. A condition which makes me sad for my lost innocence.\u2019</p><p>Claudia barks a laugh. \u2018Oh, please. If you\u2019re innocent, I\u2019m the Dali Lama.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Namaste,\u2019 he returns.</p><p>\u2018Excuse me.\u2019 Oh, no. Elevator girl \u2013 holding a magazine, folded open to a page splashed with photographs of various celebrities everywhere from fashion shows to deli counters to poolside. Right in the centre: Reid in his grey suit and blue tie, and me, semi-obscured by Reid\u2019s body, in the blue dress. \u2018This is you, isn\u2019t it? And when Geneva and I saw you in the elevator \u2013 that was him, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, I can understand why you\u2019d want to keep it on the down-low, but come on.\u2019</p><p>I cross my fingers under the table. \u2018We\u2019re ... friends.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m lying. I hate lying.</p><p>She arches an eyebrow. \u2018So what\u2019s he doing with Brooke Cameron? I mean \u2013 you said the guy you were with was your boyfriend before, when we asked ...\u2019</p><p>Darn her memory. \u2018He just ... didn\u2019t want to be recognized.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because he didn\u2019t want it getting back to her that he was spending nights with you?\u2019</p> <p>My jaw falls open. Luckily, Claudia says, \u2018Hey, look. We\u2019re trying to have a study group session here. She says they\u2019re friends, and she has no comment on what\u2019s-her-name. And please tell your friends that taking pictures of people they don\u2019t know is rude. Tah-tah and buh-bye.\u2019</p><p>The girl turns on her heel and shoots back to the table, where all six heads are conferring.</p><p>\u2018Fudge,\u2019 I say.</p><p>By Wednesday evening, there\u2019s an indistinct photo of Reid and Brooke Cameron outside a courthouse in downtown Austin on Tuesday morning. That\u2019s when the speculation starts in earnest. The photos of them in the airport and on the plane \u2013 each reading something, not touching and not speaking to each other \u2013 all of a sudden look like a lovers\u2019 spat.</p><p>That girl in San Francisco must be the cause of it, one site speculates. Brooke must have gone home to Texas, upset, and he followed her. But what are they doing at a courthouse?</p><p>Everyone has an opinion, and of course, neither of them can be reached for comment.</p><p>Reid: Why aren\u2019t you answering my texts or calls?</p><p>REID</p><p>Every time I get a text, I think maybe it\u2019s from Dori, but it\u2019s not.</p><p>This morning, Mom texted photos of the renovations in my old room. She and Dad set up home study appointments, and we\u2019ve all filled out questionnaires that are every bit as intrusive as Brooke warned me they\u2019d be. Mom is somehow happy about River, which floors me but doesn\u2019t seem to stun Dad, who says he knew it would go one of two ways.</p><p>He told her, she cried, and then she called to tell me she was proud of me.</p><p>She\u2019s only said that to me once before \u2013 the day I beat up a kid at school who\u2019d lifted a girl\u2019s skirt in front of everyone in the playground and thought it was funny \u2013 until I busted his lip open. We both got suspended, though our exclusive private school had a zero tolerance for violence policy. Funny how zero tolerance turns into we\u2019re-tolerating-it-just-this-once when affluent parents throw money at the problem.</p><p>That was ten years ago.</p><p>I just got a text from Emma, who I\u2019ve only talked to twice since the Vancouver film festival last fall; getting a text from her is out of the blue.</p><p>Emma: Dad called to tell me I\u2019d got a call from a caseworker in Texas, and I assumed it was about Brooke, but it was about YOU?</p><p>Me: Wow, that was fast.</p><p>Emma: ???</p><p>Me: We\u2019re asking for joint custody.</p><p>Emma: Hold on. I must be hallucinating. I read that you two have been ... seeing each other, which I thought could not be for real. But YOU and BROOKE \u2013 joint custody? Can you talk???</p><p>Me: Sure, I\u2019ve got a few minutes.</p><p>\u2018I see you\u2019ve been reading the gossip sites,\u2019 I answer in place of hello, grabbing a bottle of water from the craft services trailer and moving away from the current scene being shot. I\u2019m in full costume and make-up \u2013 including a couple of authentic-looking blades, one tucked into a holster on my belt and another in my boot, but I\u2019ve got fifteen or twenty minutes until I\u2019m up.</p><p>\u2018Reid, you know I\u2019m not allowed to read those. Emily reads them. I\u2019m shown links or given summarized news on a need-to-know basis only.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Still? I guess now she\u2019s protecting you from the legions of Graham-stalkers, eh?\u2019 She growls and I can\u2019t help but laugh. \u2018Well, you can tell Emily that hearsay concerning Brooke\u2019s and my rekindled relationship is baseless. I\u2019m with Dori. Not that she\u2019s talking to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And the joint custody thing you just so casually mentioned?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, that\u2019s a thing. Not a thing that\u2019s out yet \u2013 but it will be. Soon.\u2019</p><p>She sighs. \u2018Reid \u2013 you know that once that\u2019s out, it\u2019s going to underscore the perception that you and Brooke are together, and the media will push that angle full throttle. I don\u2019t know your girlfriend, but if it was me, I\u2019d be really bothered. You need to talk to her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know that \u2013 but she\u2019s not answering my calls or texts. Her parents hate me. I don\u2019t actually know any of her friends. I\u2019m going to try to make a quick trip to Berkeley on Saturday, but right now I\u2019m stuck on location in the middle of a fucking canyon in fucking Utah ...\u2019 I release a snarl of complete frustration and stop just short of running my hand through my perfectly styled set hair. \u2018And why am I talking to you about this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m nosy?\u2019</p><p>I laugh and heave a sigh.</p><p>\u2018I know I\u2019m not a regular girl compared to Dori \u2013 especially since I\u2019ll be banking on my previous film career to help me land Broadway auditions. But I do know how it feels to watch my movie-star boyfriend be publicly salivated over by thousands of girls, to have him constantly rumoured to be hooking up with other people. It\u2019s hard to take sometimes, even if I know it\u2019s total rubbish. And I trust Graham more than I\u2019ve ever trusted anyone.\u2019</p><p>Her words are like a physical blow. \u2018You think Dori doesn\u2019t trust me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t say that. Maybe she\u2019s feeling insecure? No one wants to admit to that. Insecurity makes you feel weak and powerless, and that\u2019s no way to have a healthy relationship. I would know. I was never more miserable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But she\u2019s not the insecure type. She\u2019s like ... the opposite of insecure. It definitely feels like she doesn\u2019t trust me. But why should she? I fucked up, not telling her about River. Just like I didn\u2019t tell you.\u2019</p><p>She sighs. \u2018You know, I\u2019ve told you before \u2013 what happened between you and Brooke, before me, wasn\u2019t my business. I\u2019d have got over the shock of that if it hadn\u2019t been for, you know, the parade of girls right after.\u2019</p><p>I shut my eyes. \u2018Ugh, Emma ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never mind that \u2013 I\u2019m long past it. Here\u2019s the thing. Graham and I share past stuff \u2013 we talk about relevant personal history. But only stuff that impacts on our relationship. Neither of us needs to know or confess every single thing that happened before we met. Once you decided to become involved with River \u2013 that\u2019s when it was time to tell her. And it sounds like you did. Eventually. Now she\u2019s just got to work it out in her own head. Maybe she needs time. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to be in a stepmother position at her age. And if that\u2019s the case ... you\u2019re going to have to make a choice between her and River.\u2019</p><p>I feel like she\u2019s just unloaded a ton of bricks on top of me, and I can barely breathe. Because what she just said \u2013 it\u2019s true. It\u2019s so fucking true. Emma would know what it takes to make that choice \u2013 to accept a child who doesn\u2019t belong to you, right in the middle of your relationship, like a ghost of some former love. Goddammit if my initial reflex isn\u2019t to back away from this child \u2013 who I don\u2019t know at all \u2013 if that\u2019s what it would take to keep Dori.</p><p>But what kind of man would that make me?</p><p>The PA calls out to let me know I\u2019ll be up in ten minutes. I hold up a hand and nod at him. Fuck. How can I shoot a battle scene now when I feel crushed into dust? I need every second of that ten minutes to get my game face back on.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got to go. Thanks, Emma.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Reid \u2013 I know I didn\u2019t make you feel any better \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I laugh softly, once, \u2018but you told me what I needed to hear. I\u2019ll look you guys up when I\u2019m filming in New York.\u2019</p><p>Brooke: CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS.</p><p>Me: Filming. Can\u2019t call. WHAT??</p><p>Brooke: We\u2019re getting a pre-placement visitation. We may get him early. His foster mother had some kind of health thing come up, possible surgery, and they don\u2019t want to bounce him into a new foster home and then to us not long after that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Me: Shit. WHEN?</p><p>Brooke: Saturday. Can you be here? They need to see both of us interact with him. Are you doing the online parenting course?</p><p>Me: Yes and yes. I\u2019ll figure something out. Call you later.</p><p>Me: We\u2019re getting a visit with River on Saturday morning, so I can\u2019t come to Berkeley this weekend \u2013 I have to fly in and out Friday-Saturday. So sorry.</p> <p>Me: Dori, ANSWER me. Please.</p><p>Dori: That\u2019s ok. Shayma and I are helping with a free laundry thing for local homeless people on Saturday anyway. I was going to text you.</p><p>Me: Were you?</p><p>Me: If I call you tonight, will you answer?</p><p>Me: I miss you.</p> <p>Dori: I miss you too.</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how much I expected to get dumped into her voicemail again until I don\u2019t. How much I missed the sound of her hello until I hear her say it.</p><p>\u2018Hey. You answered.\u2019 Right behind the relief is anger. I didn\u2019t expect that, either, and I start my silent therapeutic counting, hoping it will go away quickly. But it doesn\u2019t work that way; the aggravation is filling me as fast as I\u2019m emptying it, like a rainy day in a water-laden rowing boat, and nothing to bail it out with but a tin can.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so busy,\u2019 she says, and I\u2019m literally clamping my jaw shut on the words that want out.</p><p>I breathe through my nose and count. One. Two. Three. Until I can trust myself to speak. \u2018Can we talk, please? Are you still upset?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not upset, Reid. I just don\u2019t think we should rush into anything \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean by that \u2013 rush into anything? By anything \u2013 do you mean us? Dori ... is this about River?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No ... Maybe. It\u2019s not about him, specifically. You\u2019ve got a lot going on with the movie, and River, and Brooke \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dori, the stuff about Brooke and me in the tabloids is all speculation or make-believe \u2013 you remember all the fabricated crap they printed when you fell on me last summer \u2013 that we were having a secret relationship \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018We did have a secret relationship \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018But we weren\u2019t having one then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s your argument?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well. Yes. I didn\u2019t say that they don\u2019t guess right sometimes. And do I need an argument?\u2019</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t answer. The silence is thick and solid. I want to reach through this phone and pull her to me.</p><p>\u2018Dori?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t have to explain yourself, Reid. You\u2019re right. I just want you to be free to do what you need to do \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m not? I\u2019m not free to do what I need to do?\u2019</p><p>Silence, again. I\u2019m arguing her into corners, because that\u2019s what I do. But if she goes mute on me, what good does it do me to be right? So I retreat to what I know. How I\u2019ve been raised to handle conflict. It\u2019s simple, really. If the communication is making everything worse, then we\u2019ll just stop talking about it.</p><p>\u2018Your spring break is in three weeks, right? We\u2019ll be done filming in Utah by then. I\u2019ll have some long work days at Universal \u2013 but at least we\u2019ll both be in LA. We\u2019ll spend as much time together as possible. Everything will be fine. I promise.\u2019 Without thinking, I ask, \u2018Do you trust me?\u2019 As though this question isn\u2019t at the core of everything, and I haven\u2019t just circled back around to it, as unintentional as it was.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re doing the right thing, Reid, and I\u2019m proud of you for it.\u2019 That\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve heard that sentiment in as many days, but this one feels like the prelude to something unwanted. \u2018Spring recess is in three weeks, yes.\u2019</p><p>Everything is off. The cadence of her voice isn\u2019t quite right \u2013 it\u2019s ... flat, stilted, but I can\u2019t see how to fix this. Plus she didn\u2019t answer my question.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll ... call you, after we meet him?\u2019</p><p>For the beat of several seconds, I think she\u2019s not going to answer. Maybe she\u2019s already gone. And then she says, \u2018Sure. That would be fine.\u2019</p><p>23</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>I\u2019ve just got off the phone with Janelle, who is begging me, for the zillionth time and all that is holy, not to turn down Paper Oceans. She\u2019s got her first call from the producer and is freaking out that I\u2019ll say no to it. Attempting to explain my reasons does no good. \u2018I\u2019m done talking about this until you\u2019ve got an offer on the table,\u2019 I said, thoroughly irked. What I left unsaid, but she managed to hear anyway: And then I\u2019ll turn it down.</p><p>When the phone rings, I assume she\u2019s calling back with additional declarations of the Many Ways in Which I am about to Ruin My Career, but the number on the display is unfamiliar and begins with 512. Local.</p><p>My hand shakes as I jab talk and say, \u2018This is Brooke,\u2019 in the most confident voice I can muster.</p><p>\u2018Miss Cameron \u2013 hello, this is Wendy Long. I\u2019m River\u2019s foster mother.\u2019</p><p>My fist clenched to calm the shaking, I strive to maintain my feigned composure. I know this woman has voiced concerns to River\u2019s caseworker, his ad litem and the judge about me adopting him, though I\u2019m not sure exactly what was said. Norman keeps reminding me that she\u2019s just looking out for his best interests, but I can\u2019t help feeling personally affronted.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to do whatever it takes to mask that feeling.</p><p>\u2018Yes, Wendy, good evening.\u2019 Shit. I automatically used her first name \u2013 something I do to even the playing field in adversarial confrontations. Awesome. I thump myself in the forehead with that clenched fist. \u2018Please call me Brooke.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, certainly. Brooke.\u2019 Her drawl is heavy, words fading into soft endings, fusing and linking together, mirroring my mother\u2019s dialect. My brain screams hick, and I struggle not to assign that personal bias to it. \u2018I thought we should have a chat about River before tomorrow\u2019s visit. Is Mr Alexander going to be accompanying you? Is this a good time to talk?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it\u2019s fine. Reid will be in town this evening, and I\u2019ll pick him up on my way over in the morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah. Um. All right. Well, about River. There are a few important things you should know about him before you meet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018First off, and most importantly \u2013 he doesn\u2019t talk.\u2019</p><p>Everything I know about children, I\u2019ve learned in the past few weeks. I may not know much, but I know that most four-year-olds are language-proficient and can supposedly talk your ear off. Kathryn says four is the age of Why?</p><p>\u2018Kylie was more of a quietly observant child \u2013 oddly enough,\u2019 she said, \u2018but oh my Lord, Kelley asked why a million times a day. Why do apples come in so many colours? Why did the dog eat that? Why do teeth fall out? Why can\u2019t I jump off the roof into the pool? The house always seemed unnaturally silent the moment she fell asleep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean, exactly?\u2019 I ask Wendy.</p><p>\u2018I mean he doesn\u2019t say words. He doesn\u2019t communicate by speaking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018At all? Ever?\u2019</p><p>\u2018At all. Ever,\u2019 she confirms.</p><p>\u2018Is he ... developmentally challenged? From \u2013 what happened to him?\u2019 I bite my lip and taste blood, cursing his adoptive mother to hell. Again.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t believe so. He understands what\u2019s said to him just fine. And he\u2019ll nod or shake his head, so you get your basic yes or no responses. And most notably, I\u2019ve heard him verbalize words and short sentences in his sleep a few times \u2013 usually during nightmares. So he can talk ... he just won\u2019t. It\u2019s possible that he doesn\u2019t even know he can.\u2019</p><p>I frown. \u2018What\u2019s been done to address that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He sees a therapist every week, and his social worker every month.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What the \u2013 what good does a therapist do if he can\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 speak?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He has River draw pictures about his feelings. He\u2019s real good at that. He\u2019s smart, and he\u2019s a good little artist.\u2019 I hear the affection lacing her words and almost lose it. \u2018He\u2019s just had a rough time of it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. He has. I intend to end that, Ms Long. I promise you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, call me Wendy. And ... I want to believe you, Ms \u2013 er, Brooke. But the stories in the tabloids, about you and Mr Alexander both ... Well, I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m sure the gossip is played up and all to sell papers. I mean I seen one last week that said a lady gave birth to a thirty-pound baby, and I\u2019m here to tell you, that\u2019s just not possible.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 you two are both young and nice-looking, and I don\u2019t mean to pass judgement on you for your lifestyles, whatever they are. It\u2019s not my place to say, you understand, except where River is concerned. He\u2019s not ...\u2019 She swallows audibly. \u2018He\u2019s not a knick-knack, or a pet. He\u2019s been hurt, and all the pretty clothes and new toys in the world aren\u2019t gonna fix him. He\u2019s like a little flower bud that just won\u2019t open up, and to be perfectly frank \u2013 with what he\u2019s seen, I don\u2019t know if he ever will.\u2019</p><p>Tears stream down my face and clog my throat. \u2018Thank you for your honesty, Wendy. Now let me give you mine.\u2019 My voice is earnest, pleading \u2013 such a foreign effort for me. But I need her to believe me. \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about raising a child, except how not to do it. I know he needs a home. He needs love. And I mean to give him those things.\u2019 I take a shuddering breath. \u2018If he never wants to speak, then I\u2019ll just have to get really good at artistic interpretation. He can draw on the damn walls if he needs to.\u2019</p><p>Reid slides into the passenger seat of Glenn\u2019s king cab pick-up wearing his sunglasses and a Cal baseball cap, an open plaid shirt over a white T-shirt, jeans and boat shoes. He looks like a cute college boy, not a Hollywood sex symbol.</p><p>\u2018Brooke Cameron \u2013 sporting western boots one day and driving an F-250 the next. Will wonders never cease ... What\u2019s next, a ten-gallon hat?\u2019</p><p>I flip him off, but he just arches a brow and smirks.</p><p>\u2018Aww, c\u2019mon, I was just funnin\u2019.\u2019 His drawl is all kinds of exaggerated. \u2018No need to get hostile.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes behind my own mirrored sunglasses and pull into traffic as soon as he\u2019s buckled up. \u2018There\u2019s more hostility where that came from, Reid Alexander.\u2019 Like slipping into a broken-in pair of boots, I affect the accent he professes to love. \u2018You just keep that smart mouth shut or you\u2019ll be meetin\u2019 your son sportin\u2019 a fat lip.\u2019</p><p>Luckily, he grins that full-wattage smile and shakes his head without any more flippant commentary. Cocky son-of-a-bitch.</p><p>As we leave downtown and head south on I-35, he turns the alt rock station down and asks, \u2018You nervous?\u2019</p><p>I sigh. \u2018Hell, yes. You?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never felt so panicked about meeting anyone in my entire life.\u2019</p><p>Nodding in agreement, I say, \u2018That pretty much sums it up.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018How long will this visit last?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wendy said about an hour, unless River makes it clear he\u2019s done, and then it would be best to leave. We don\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable.\u2019</p><p>When I tell Reid what I learned from Wendy yesterday concerning River\u2019s muteness, his periodic nightmares, and some of the details about his adoptive parents, he mutters, \u2018Shit,\u2019 and stares out of the passenger window for several minutes.</p><p>Two years ago, River\u2019s adoptive father died in a tragic car accident. I vaguely recall him, out of all the prospective adoptive parents Kathryn and I sifted through that summer. Blond, handsome, mid-thirties. Financially sound. What I remember best is something he wrote at the end of his prospective adoptive parent statement: I hope to be the same loving, wonderful father to my child that my dad was to me. That sentence was the tipping point for my choice of them over another couple.</p> <p>His father is deceased, his mother is in her seventies and living in a retirement home.</p><p>River\u2019s adoptive mother had been estranged from her parents for years, and they were unwilling to consider caring for River, whom they didn\u2019t regard as a grandchild. Soon after her husband\u2019s death, she\u2019d sunk into an addiction she was unwilling or unable to abandon, even though it meant losing her child \u2013 a little boy who had no one else to depend on in the world.</p><p>Except for me.</p><p>\u2018What are we supposed to say to a kid who doesn\u2019t talk?\u2019 Reid asks, finally, all hints of his earlier levity gone.</p><p>\u2018He can understand what we say. And I brought the Life Book \u2013 it\u2019s on the seat behind you.\u2019</p> <p>He turns to snatch the scrapbook we started when he was here earlier in the week, leafing through the pages as I spot the exit up ahead. \u2018This is great, Brooke,\u2019 he murmurs.</p><p>\u2018When I was six or so, Kathryn made me a scrapbook of my own. I was jealous of Kylie and Kelley having books of their baby photos and stories about their first few years of life.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your mom didn\u2019t make you one?\u2019 he asks, and I glance at him like Really? \u2018Guess that\u2019s not much of a surprise.\u2019</p><p>Sharla making a scrapbook? Definitely not. \u2018Kathryn told me to bring a few photos the next time I came over. Over the next few weeks, I pocketed snapshots of myself that I found in drawers or boxes at home. There weren\u2019t many, even though I was basically an only child. Kathryn bought a handmade journal at some craft fair, stuck glittery pink adhesive letters on the front that spelled out Brooke\u2019s Book, and composed the story of me.\u2019</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought of that thing in years. I\u2019d forgotten about it until just now.</p><p>\u2018Do you still have it? My mom\u2019s definitely not crafty, but she kept photo albums of my childhood. Up until I was ten, anyway.\u2019</p> <p>I bite my lip until it goes numb. \u2018No. I don\u2019t have it. I made the mistake of taking it home. Sharla found it. She was furious. Ripped the pages out and tore up all the pictures.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Holy shit, Brooke.\u2019 He stares at me. \u2018That\u2019s fucked up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. What a great role model for a mom, huh?\u2019</p><p>His hand clenches into a fist on the console between us. \u2018Your role model is Kathryn, not Sharla. You know that, right?\u2019</p><p>I did know that, somewhere in my head. I\u2019d just never acknowledged it consciously.</p><p>\u2018Yeah. You\u2019re right.\u2019</p><p>I turn down a street of analogous one-storey homes, all of them small, each with a big front yard, a driveway on the right-hand side and a cyclone fence. A few pecan trees and crepe myrtles dot the landscape here and there, but this flat stretch of acreage was probably reclaimed farmland when the subdivision was built, so there were no old oaks, like those surrounding Kathryn and Glenn\u2019s place.</p><p>\u2018This is it,\u2019 I whisper, spotting the mailbox house number, which is surrounded by a hand-painted swirling heart motif. My heart thumps so hard that I feel each beat like someone is pounding on my chest from the inside, trying to escape. My hands grow cold, though it\u2019s a beautiful late-winter day, the temperature in Austin within a degree or two of LA.</p> <p>As we walk up the long, cracked sidewalk, I alternate between examining the chalked pictures and inscriptions decorating the concrete and staring at the quiet little house I recognize from the photo Bethany Shank brought to me not even two months ago. Reid, silent and following me, takes my hand as we reach the front door. He removes his sunglasses and I remove mine, and for a moment we stare at each other. I\u2019ve never seen him look so resolute.</p><p>\u2018Here we go,\u2019 he says, pushing the doorbell. At the echo of chimes inside the house, my heart rate surges. Reid squeezes my hand and says, \u2018It\u2019s all good, Brooke. We can do this.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t let go of him.</p><p>And then the door opens, and the middle-aged woman I recognize from the background of my only photo of River stands there, a faint smile wreathing her face. Her hazel eyes are clear and kind.</p><p>\u2018Brooke and Reid, I presume?\u2019 she says, and we both nod. She pulls her arm gently from behind her, her hand attached to a little boy who appears slowly on the right side of her hip. All I see are dark blue eyes, impossibly huge in his small face. \u2018This is River.\u2019</p><p>DORI</p><p>Shayma has nudged me at least ten times this morning \u2013 whenever I\u2019m not paying attention and someone asks me a question about operating the washers and dryers, how many tokens are allowed per person, or where the nearest public bathroom is located. After my last space-out, she says, \u2018Girl. Where is your head this morning?\u2019</p><p>While my roommate is one of the few people with confirmed knowledge about Reid and me, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of sharing too much information with anyone, even trusted friends. I love Aimee and Kayla, but I\u2019m pretty darn sure they\u2019ve told every living soul at UCLA that they\u2019re friends with Reid Alexander\u2019s girlfriend. Shayma knows we\u2019re going out, and that we met when I supervised him (or rather, tried to supervise him) at Habitat. She also knows I don\u2019t publicize our relationship, so neither does she \u2013 which places her in a select class of friends.</p><p>Occasionally, she surprises me with facetious questions like, \u2018So ... is Reid Alexander a good kisser?\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll bet Reid Alexander is RAWR in bed, isn\u2019t he?\u2019 I\u2019m glad she hasn\u2019t yet discovered my glowing, telltale ears. The wide-eyed look on my face is indicative enough of my discomfiture, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>\u2018How do you deal with all the making out your boyfriend does in those movies?\u2019 she asks now in her naturally discreet voice (thank goodness), after handing a stack of washer/dryer tokens to a guy who probably hasn\u2019t washed any of his clothes in months. The smell makes my eyes water involuntarily until he shuffles over to a machine with an armful of grubby laundry and the small box of donated detergent I just handed him. I suspect he\u2019ll need more than the one box.</p><p>\u2018And the rumours with ex-girlfriends or not-girlfriends. That alone would drive me batshit crazy. My mawmaw \u2013 the self-proclaimed seer? \u2013 is a practising Cajun Voodoo Queen. She\u2019d be happy to whip up a little gris-gris for you.\u2019</p><p>At the word voodoo, I arch a brow. \u2018I\u2019m afraid to ask what a gris-gris is ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a protection amulet. Sometimes for luck, but usually to ward off evil. I imagine ex-girlfriends qualify. Also, I figured you might not want to follow the still-practised but ethically-murky voodoo superstition to make a man stay faithful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now I\u2019m really afraid to ask.\u2019</p><p>She leans closer and whispers, \u2018You put a drop of your blood in his coffee.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ugh!\u2019 I look down at the latte in my hand, appalled.</p><p>\u2018Right?\u2019 she chuckles. \u2018I overheard Mawmaw telling my momma to do that to Daddy when I was little. And my ordinarily sane legal-secretary mother was listening. I never asked her if she did it ... If she did \u2013 it didn\u2019t work. If she didn\u2019t \u2013 well, who\u2019d want to keep a guy that way anyhow?\u2019</p><p>\u2018But using an amulet is a-okay,\u2019 I laugh.</p><p>She shrugs and smiles. \u2018That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard you laugh in a few days.\u2019 When I pin my lips together and sigh, she says, \u2018Amulets are about warding off bad stuff, not binding people to do things they might not otherwise do. But I\u2019m with you. If and when I get a guy I\u2019m interested in keeping around, I want him to stay because he wants to stay. Not because I poked a voodoo doll of him in the junk with a pin.\u2019</p><p>During a show we were watching online last night, an ad for the MTV Movie Awards popped up, which is on next month. Reid and his School Pride co-star, Emma Pierce, have been nominated for Best Kiss. As the clip played, Shayma gave me a sidelong glance, but didn\u2019t say a word. An unwelcome mental image of the two of them re-enacting the lip-lock that made every girl I know swoon (Claudia excepted) at the upcoming awards show made me feel temporarily homicidal.</p><p>\u2018Maybe I should tell Mawmaw to make a gris-gris for Emma Pierce,\u2019 Shayma suggests now, and I suppress an actual growl. \u2018Though supposedly, she and Graham Douglas have been a legit couple for months. They went to the Vancouver Film Festival together last fall, and she popped up for a romantic weekend in Dublin a couple of months ago, when he was filming there. They\u2019re spotted together all the time \u2013 alone or with friends, sometimes with his daughter. In particular near NYU, where they\u2019re rumoured to be condo-shopping.\u2019</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u2018You looked all of that up last night, didn\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! I looked it up this morning.\u2019 Shrugging, she counts out tokens to a tired woman with two small children in tow, all three of them holding a basket of clothes, and I plop a trial-sized box of detergent in each of their baskets. \u2018You looked like you might go postal when that ad came on, is all. A little abnormal for such a peaceful girl, if you ask me.\u2019</p><p>Rats. My non-existent poker face betrays me again.</p><p>24</p><p>REID</p><p>River doesn\u2019t speak a word during the visit, of course, but he seems curious enough that he doesn\u2019t signal an end to our stay. The first hour is spent under Wendy\u2019s supervision, and he never ranges far from her. Brooke and I sit side by side on the worn sofa, our legs wedged behind a coffee table that \u2013 while smelling of wood polish \u2013 has been crayoned and scratched and generally battered to hell. Propped next to his foster mother\u2019s chair, River leans his thin frame against her as though her bodily support is necessary to his ability to remain upright.</p><p>\u2018We made a book for River to keep \u2013 well, Brooke made most of it.\u2019 I remove the book from Brooke\u2019s lap and lean over the table to put it into Wendy\u2019s hands. River inclines closer, eyes a little wider and head angled to study the cover, which depicts a beach view of the western horizon over the Pacific at sunrise. \u2018It has some pictures of Los Angeles, where we live \u2013 parks and other cool places. And a few pics of us.\u2019</p><p>I reach over and squeeze Brooke\u2019s cold hand as Wendy turns the pages, reading the descriptions to River, who doesn\u2019t take his eyes from the book until she\u2019s done. And then he reaches over, turns back to page one, and looks at her expectantly until she begins to read it again. Brooke clutches my hand as if she is hanging over a deep gorge, her eyes never moving from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Handing him the book after the second read, Wendy says, \u2018River, why don\u2019t you show Reid and Brooke your room? And put this with your other books.\u2019</p><p>He eyes us for a moment before hugging the scrapbook to his chest and leading the way down a short, dim hallway, and into a cramped bedroom that contains a set of bunk beds, one separate twin bed, a dresser and a bookcase. There is no room for anything else. While we stand in the doorway, he walks to the single bed and slides the book beneath his pillow. The pillowcase is covered with cartoon depictions of cars and trucks in primary colours, and it occurs to me that here is a boy who would have loved my yellow Lotus.</p><p>Going to his knees on the tiny wedge of open carpet, he pulls a box from beneath his bed. I tug Brooke into the room by her elbow and urge her to sit down on the floor beside me. \u2018What have you got there? Ah, Legos \u2013 they were my favourite thing in the world when I was your age. I wanted every set that came out.\u2019 What I don\u2019t say: I got every set that came out. All stored somewhere in my parents\u2019 house, no doubt.</p><p>The three of us are sitting on his bedroom floor building things when Wendy appears in the doorway and announces that it\u2019s time to wash up for lunch. I check my thick-banded watch and am dazed to find we\u2019ve spent nearly two hours here. My eyes meet Brooke\u2019s and she nods, subtly. Time to go.</p> <p>I clear my throat. \u2018We should go and get lunch too.\u2019 River finishes snapping a plastic brick on to what appears to be a spider the size of my hand that he\u2019s fashioned out of the black and grey rectangles. He\u2019s used two red squares for eyes \u2013 at least I think they\u2019re eyes \u2013 on a creature that only exists in nightmares for most little kids.</p><p>With an intense blue gaze, full of his hesitation and all the reasons for it, he examines me and then Brooke, alternating between us. Brooke seems as guarded as River, and almost equally quiet. I have no idea what she\u2019s thinking; I can\u2019t read her. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re all that familiar with each other now, as weird as that is, considering the fact that we\u2019re attempting to adopt a child together.</p><p>\u2018Thanks for letting us come and play, bud.\u2019 Still sitting cross-legged, I hold a fist towards him \u2013 something I might do with John or any other guy under twenty-five. He considers my knuckles, his pale brows drawing together, and for a moment I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve made a careless miscalculation, but after a quick glance at my face, he raises a very small fist and bumps mine lightly with it.</p><p>And then he smiles. It\u2019s fleeting and subdued, but it\u2019s definitely a smile.</p><p>\u2018It was so nice to meet you, River,\u2019 Brooke says then, her voice soft. After a glance at me, he offers his knuckles to her, and she bites her lip and bumps them gently, her eyes glassy. At which point I figure I\u2019d better get her out of here.</p> <p>Brooke and I walk to the truck in reflective silence. At the kerb, I turn and look back at the house. River is standing with Wendy in the doorway, his expression disturbingly stoic. I wave, and Wendy waves. River stands like a toy soldier, straight and unblinking, but the fingers of his right hand wiggle.</p><p>Neither of us speaks a word during the twenty-minute drive to my hotel. The enormity of what we\u2019re doing is too staggering. We need time to select the words and formulate their order. When we arrive, Brooke parks the truck and automatically follows me inside, and I\u2019m vaguely aware of fellow guests identifying us between the door and the elevator.</p><p>Brooke and I both released box office hits almost three weeks ago, and I\u2019m the lead in the in-production film version of one of the decade\u2019s most popular novels. Our STARmeter ranks are glowing green, and our days of occasionally roaming around in public sans bodyguards are all but over \u2013 especially when we\u2019re together. It\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to be together a lot.</p><p>Following me from the elevator to my room, she collapses on the small sofa next to my open suitcase and stares out of the lake-view window at the cloudless sky.</p><p>I got a late checkout approved, but it\u2019s already noon.</p><p>\u2018Lunch?\u2019 I suggest, and she nods.</p> <p>Grabbing the room service menu, I ask what she wants, and she waves a hand, mumbling, \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019</p><p>After calling in sandwiches and fries, I grab a couple of bottled waters from the mini fridge and slump into the armchair next to her. While she sips silently, I swallow half my bottle.</p><p>\u2018So what now?\u2019</p><p>Her eyes shift to mine and I blink, hard. She looks wrecked. \u2018I want him, Reid. I\u2019ve never wanted anything so much. Is it wrong? That I want him?\u2019</p><p>For the space of a breath, I wonder why she\u2019d think that wanting River could be wrong. And then it hits me. \u2018You don\u2019t trust your own intentions.\u2019</p><p>She shakes her head, her eyes welling up.</p><p>I lean up and take her hand for the third or fourth time today. It\u2019s still so cold that it feels bloodless. \u2018Brooke, I\u2019ve never seen you be less sure of yourself, and yet more on a mission. I knew when you said you were going to give up Paper Oceans to get him that you\u2019d rocketed past my preconceived notions about Brooke Cameron.\u2019 The image of River thumping his small knuckles against mine knocks the breath out of me. And that brief, barely-there smile. \u2018But I guess I\u2019m drinking the Kool-Aid, because I want him too. I can see that he\u2019s good there with Wendy, but she\u2019s a short-term solution and always was. My dad was right. If we don\u2019t do this, we\u2019ll live to regret it \u2013 sooner rather than later, I imagine.\u2019</p><p>She frowns in confusion. \u2018Your dad said that?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 I chuckle. \u2018Shocked the shit out of me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So he\u2019s really ... okay with you doing this?\u2019</p><p>I shrug, thinking about the fact that my parents\u2019 house is in an uproar of make-ready for a four-year-old they didn\u2019t even know existed a couple of weeks ago. Dad wore his courtroom face this morning at her attorney\u2019s office, though Brooke\u2019s counsel was genial, and by the time we\u2019d left, the two of them were strategizing together as if they\u2019d always done so. Evidently, there\u2019s a potential issue with the fact that I\u2019ll only be twenty, and the minimum age to adopt is twenty-one. They plan to carefully approach the judge with the contention that I was fifteen and had no legal counsel when I effectively gave up my parental rights.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s more than okay, and so is Mom. It\u2019s bizarre. In their defence, I think I set their expectations of me quite low in the past few years.\u2019</p><p>She laughs softly, one tear escaping and trailing down her cheek. I reach to wipe it away, but that simple touch erases her smile. She swallows and sits back abruptly. \u2018Thanks for upending your schedule on such short notice to come with me today.\u2019</p><p>My elbows on my knees and my hands clasped, I sigh. \u2018You don\u2019t need to thank me any more. We\u2019re in this together. I\u2019m not doing you a favour. I\u2019m doing what I should have done in the first place \u2013 taking some fucking responsibility.\u2019</p><p>I finish packing while we eat, and she agrees to drop me at the airport so I don\u2019t have to bother with calling a car. When we exit the hotel, there\u2019s a single photographer waiting outside. Snapping up from leaning against his van, he hollers our names, but neither of us takes the bait. Nice try, dickwad. Luckily, the truck is parked in the opposite direction, and since there\u2019s only one of him, he doesn\u2019t get too close \u2013 though I\u2019m sure his zoom lens does.</p><p>DORI</p><p>My cell recorded a missed call from Reid, though I never heard it ring or felt it buzz. It figures that when I fully intended to answer it, my phone goes on hiatus. When I try him back, his phone is off \u2013 the call goes straight to voicemail \u2013 and I presume he\u2019s somewhere between Texas and Utah. I leave him a message telling him I\u2019ll be studying in my room tonight.</p><p>\u2018Call me when you\u2019re back to your \u2013 trailer, I guess? Talk to you later. Bye.\u2019</p><p>I try to imagine Reid in a production trailer, but having never been inside one, all I can picture is the interior of a motorhome purchased years ago by a pair of retired neighbours, after they sold the home they\u2019d owned for forty years. They were very proud of the cramped, nomadic house and the miniature everything \u2013 from the fridge to the shower to the \u2018bedroom\u2019 that was little more than a wall-to-wall bed at the back of the vehicle.</p><p>During the \u2018tour\u2019, Deb leaned to me and murmured, \u2018What happens when Oscar slams on the breaks to take a sharp corner and Ethel is in bed ... or in the shower? Naked, wet, pissed-off old lady tumbleweeding up to the cockpit, that\u2019s what.\u2019</p><p>I nearly choked to death trying to contain my giggles. When Mom turned and bestowed a narrowed look on the two of us, Deb blinked and appeared angelic, angling her head towards me. \u2018She swallowed her gum.\u2019 She slammed a hand on my back several times. \u2018Cough it up, Dori, cough it up.\u2019</p><p>In between devising a citations page for my Intro to Psychology paper and studying for a test in Intro to Sociology, I text Aimee, who is incensed that she and Kayla won\u2019t get a normal spring break because UCLA does quarters instead of semesters.</p><p>Aimee: We only get TWO DAYS of your spring break before we start another quarter! What about the college experience??? This is false advertising.</p><p>Me: Didn\u2019t you look at the academic calendar before applying? Or registering?</p><p>Aimee: Obviously, no.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be home all week, though, and you go to school in LA.</p><p>Aimee: But you\u2019ll be making time for REID, I\u2019m sure (not that I blame you). And ... Nick?</p><p>Me: Nick\u2019s spring recess is a week before mine, so we\u2019ll only overlap the first weekend. And Reid, if he\u2019s in town, yes. He\u2019s filming, though. So I\u2019m not sure of his schedule yet.</p><p>Aimee: DUH. He\u2019ll be filming at Universal, so he\u2019ll be in town. I have it on Perez authority.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m rolling my eyes at you so hard right now.</p><p>Ten minutes later, I get a text from Kayla.</p><p>Kayla: Hey, check out the link I just messaged you. I don\u2019t want to be the bearer of bad news, but there are some things you have to KNOW!</p><p>Me: Ok.</p><p>The link goes to one of those websites I wish didn\u2019t exist, where the lives of people like Reid are dissected and displayed. It\u2019s there that I find a somewhat indistinct photo with the caption: \u2018Reid Alexander and Brooke Cameron! Together again?\u2019 They\u2019re entering a hotel elevator. And if that isn\u2019t conclusive enough \u2013 there\u2019s an incontestable photo of the two of them a couple of hours later, exiting the same hotel and climbing into a pick-up truck.</p><p>Brooke Cameron is beautiful. This isn\u2019t an envious or unrealistic statement \u2013 it\u2019s just the incontestable truth. She\u2019s one of the prettiest girls I\u2019ve ever seen. Who had Reid\u2019s baby. And was with him in Austin on Saturday. Entering and leaving a hotel.</p><p>Suddenly, I\u2019m so tired.</p><p>I\u2019m tired of feeling jealous \u2013 an emotion I\u2019ve never truly experienced before Reid, which has somehow become all-consuming. And relentless. And just so exhausting.</p><p>Closing out of the website, I barely register the tears streaming down my face, but I can\u2019t let them blind me to reality. If I talk to Reid, my tongue will burn with the need to ask him what\u2019s going on between them, if anything is. And even if nothing is \u2013 yet \u2013 I can\u2019t believe that it won\u2019t. Or even that it shouldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t see this coming \u2013 not this soon. Not this way. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because I always knew he would return to his Hollywood lifestyle and his peers. I can\u2019t blame him and I don\u2019t. Because in pursuing the adoption of his son, he\u2019s choosing the difficult thing. He\u2019s choosing the right thing. And I admire him for it.</p><p>He believes that I helped him become a better man, that I\u2019m a good influence, and it\u2019s true. Because that\u2019s what I was meant to be, for him.

I\u2019ve called, and I\u2019ve left messages. I wanted to talk to you about today.</p><p>Reid: Are you angry with me? Did I do something I\u2019m not aware of doing? I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>Reid: missed calls (2)</p><p>Reid: If I wasn\u2019t stuck in the middle of the damned desert, under contract, I would be banging on your dorm-room door and to hell with who heard or saw me. I\u2019m worried.</p> <p>Reid: I\u2019m going to have to call your parents. (And I can\u2019t BELIEVE I just wrote that.)</p><p>Reid: Dori, not again. Please, goddammit, not again.</p><p>25</p><p>REID</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mrs Cantrell \u2013 this is Reid. Alexander.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, Mr Alexander?\u2019 Her tone is somehow accusatory \u2013 and what\u2019s with the Mister Alexander crap?</p><p>Ten seconds in and I\u2019m already pacing the length of this fucking trailer, wondering what sway her parents have with her, still. Wondering if I can fault them for her withdrawal. Knowing, after that meeting two months ago, how elated they would be to see this relationship collapse, which makes me furious.</p><p>One. Two. Three. Deep breath. Four. Five. Six.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t heard from Dori in several days. I just want to make sure she\u2019s all right.\u2019</p><p>She pauses before answering. \u2018Dori is fine. I appreciate your concern \u2013 but she\u2019s fine.\u2019 Without you \u2013 that\u2019s what I hear. She\u2019s fine without you.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re aware, then, that she\u2019s not returning my texts or calls. And clearly, you also know why.\u2019 One hand at the back of my neck, I\u2019m fighting every innate compulsion I have to keep from demanding that she tell me what the fuck she knows that I don\u2019t. \u2018Would you mind, very much, sharing that information with me? Because I don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What does that mean?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Do you read the celebrity gossip sites, Mr Alexander?\u2019</p><p>I huff a breath. \u2018Not if I can help it. I ignore them as much as possible, in fact, because they\u2019re mostly lies and misconstrued half-truths, or unabashed invasions of privacy. Dori knows what\u2019s true or what isn\u2019t. At least, I thought she did. I thought she trusted me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what is the truth? That you\u2019ve been photographed numerous times with another young lady \u2013 one you used to ... date?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dori knows why \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. She told me about the child you fathered, and what you and your ex-girlfriend are doing now \u2013 which, for the record, is admirable of you both. But it\u2019s also not something my daughter needs to find herself caught up in or distracted by \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe it\u2019s not something Dori should have to deal with. Maybe it\u2019s even more than she can handle.\u2019 Christ. Speaking that sentence makes me feel as though I just stabbed myself in the chest. I can\u2019t accept that it\u2019s true. \u2018But why isn\u2019t she talking to me about it? Why does she think that dropping off the face of the earth is the way to resolve this?\u2019</p><p>Her answer is quietly devastating. \u2018I imagine she\u2019s protecting herself from being further hurt by you.\u2019</p><p>When I recover my breath, I blurt, \u2018Further? What do you mean further hurt by me? I love her. I don\u2019t intend to hurt her. I don\u2019t want to hurt her. I almost relinquished rights to my son because I don\u2019t want to lose her \u2013 because I was afraid of this reaction.\u2019 I can\u2019t tell her what may actually be behind Dori\u2019s reaction \u2013 the needless guilt she feels over a choice she made years ago \u2013 a choice that, at the time, was right for her. \u2018Even so, I never imagined her doing ... this. She\u2019s not a coward, and this is the most cowardly thing I\u2019ve ever known her to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you believe that shielding herself from certain emotional damage is cowardly?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Certain emotional damage? You make it sound as if this outcome was inevitable. Like there wasn\u2019t any other possible result of a relationship between us, and we were doomed from the start. But that deduction isn\u2019t something you based on the knowledge of my son or anything to do with Brooke Cameron \u2013 it comes from your prejudice against me. Against my lifestyle, or my career, or my previous reputation \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t that how we all assess people and predict outcomes, Mr Alexander? By their previous reputations? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re correct. What about your lifestyle or reputation would benefit my daughter? What about your career would ever make her feel safe? Standing aside and watching while you\u2019re physically involved on-screen and constantly rumoured to be off-screen \u2013 whether it\u2019s true or not \u2013 with other women? Why would I want that for her?</p><p>\u2018And then, let\u2019s add the existence of a son with one of those rumoured other women. What will happen to her once that secret comes to light? What will people say? Of course I don\u2019t want that for her. Why in the world would I?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m shredded by the recognition of how right she is. Even if her daughter is the only person I\u2019ve ever met who didn\u2019t ultimately judge me by my reputation, but by what she saw in me \u2013 and God knows how she managed that. I have only one truth to stand on.</p><p>\u2018I. Love. Her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If that\u2019s true,\u2019 she answers evenly, \u2018you\u2019ll want what\u2019s best for her. Not for yourself.\u2019</p><p>Brooke\u2019s words about Graham slam into me and I fall to my knees in the middle of the trailer. I feel like my heart is imploding. Every scrap of anger or righteous indignation evaporates. Every argument turns to ash. Because, of course, she\u2019s right. If I love Dori, I\u2019ll want what\u2019s best for her. And only Dori can know what that is.</p><p>Brooke: I saw the judge this morning. The case is being accelerated. We\u2019re getting an overnight. First, here, tomorrow night. (If you come to Austin, Kathryn says you can stay here. A hotel would blow our cover.) If that goes well, each of us will get him in LA for a few days. His caseworker will travel with him.</p><p>Me: DAMMIT. I can\u2019t get away right now. I am LITERALLY in the middle of the desert. They had to set up a special tower just so we could all get cell service. If I could leave this set, I\u2019d be in CA. Call me in a couple of hours? I\u2019ve got a scene to shoot.</p><p>Brooke: K</p><p>Two hours later on the dot, my phone rings. Brooke.</p><p>\u2018Hey. So he\u2019s going to stay at Kathryn\u2019s with you overnight? Will the fact that I\u2019m not there be a problem?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 she answers. \u2018I explained that I\u2019m not working right now, but you are, and that if we get him, we intend to trade off projects. That one of us will always be with him.\u2019 Brooke always did think fast on her feet. \u2018Reid?\u2019 A new hesitation creeps into her voice. \u2018Are you sure about this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018About River? Yeah. I\u2019m sure.\u2019 I don\u2019t have to ask if she is.</p><p>She releases an audible breath at my answer \u2013 as though she\u2019s still expecting me to back out any minute. It\u2019s so difficult for her to count on anyone. To trust when someone says they\u2019ll be there for her. With our history, it\u2019s a damned miracle for her to have confidence in anything I promise. I can\u2019t blame her for asking.</p><p>\u2018Wendy is having surgery two weeks from Monday, so that\u2019s when the overnights in LA will take place. One of the little boys she\u2019s been keeping will be moving to a new foster home, and the other is moving towards a family reunification that might be too early. She couldn\u2019t say much about either one, but it sounded like she was freaking out over both of them. I think we\u2019ve suddenly become the best-case scenario.\u2019</p><p>That seems like a wrong sort of thing to feel fortunate about, but I\u2019m a dick, so I\u2019ll take it. \u2018Yay for other people fucking up?\u2019</p><p>She laughs shortly. \u2018I guess. Will you be back in LA by then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. We\u2019re wrapping up here in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. Probably fourteen, fifteen days left, and we\u2019ll be doing the studio sections next, at Universal. I should be back in town right before he arrives.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you\u2019ll have the home study and parenting course stuff by then?\u2019 she presses.</p><p>I roll my eyes, but tell myself she\u2019s just making sure of essential details. No need to snap back. I set my jaw. \u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 She takes a deep breath and launches into part two of this call. \u2018I think it\u2019s time to call Rowena.\u2019 I curse and start to object \u2013 again \u2013 but she barrels on. \u2018I know you have a preconceived perception of her after last spring \u2013 but, Reid, she\u2019s our best shot at maintaining any control over how this news breaks. The public will want photos of our child. You know they will.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s right \u2013 River is going to be top photo-stalker material. The only way to neutralize that is to provide the pics ourselves. With a jolt of comprehension, I realize I\u2019ve got to trust her. And this Rowena person. Ugh. My opposition dissolves unsaid.</p><p>\u2018What did you mean before, when you said you\u2019d be in California now if you could?\u2019 she asks, undoubtedly to change the subject before I can build a case against her sycophantic paparazza.</p><p>\u2018Dori. She stopped talking to me about a week ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A week? What happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have no idea. That\u2019s a major component of the \u201cstopped talking to me\u201d bit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be an asshat. Did you two have a fight? Did you do something stupid like screw some girl who took photos of your naked backside and leaked it online?\u2019</p><p>I would take exception if that exact thing hadn\u2019t transpired a couple of years ago.</p><p>\u2018No fight. No girls. The photos of you and me in Austin are all over, of course, though she hasn\u2019t said a thing about them. But she knows about River. I guess she just decided she couldn\u2019t deal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That sucks. She should know not to pay attention to the crap online ... although it\u2019s occasionally true. If she can\u2019t handle it, though, maybe you\u2019re better off without her.\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better time to film a withdrawn, brooding character. My Darcy role was a bit brooding, but he was mostly sarcastic and arrogant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With the amount of time I spend alone \u2013 either in my trailer or walking at a barely visible distance from the huddle of trailers and sets, I think my co-stars have decided I\u2019m one of those method actors who insists on remaining in character on and off-screen. I\u2019ve caught insinuations that indicate as much, but I\u2019ve no need to artificially immerse myself in the moody temperament of my current character.</p><p>I get him. Jesus Christ, do I get him.</p><p>And though I\u2019m certainly drawing on my personal thoughts and emotions during filming to portray him (aka actual method acting) I\u2019m not drawing on painful experiences from my past. All I have to do is conjure Dori, and the agony blazes through me, on cue.</p><p>BROOKE</p> <p>It\u2019s been six days since I\u2019ve seen him.</p><p>Kathryn has been the voice of reason at every turn. \u2018Don\u2019t overwhelm him with things, Brooke,\u2019 she says, when I want to buy him every Lego set I can find online. We choose a half-dozen, and put four of them away for later. It takes me almost an hour to narrow to a couple of plush animals \u2013 a teddy, of course, and a floppy-eared puppy (to compensate for the fact that Kathryn urges me not to buy him the real thing).</p><p>One wall of his room at Kathryn\u2019s has been painted green \u2013 his favourite colour, according to Wendy. His room at my condo will include lots of green \u2013 I\u2019ve hired a trompe l\u2019oeil artist to paint a roadway with colourful cars and background scenery all the way around at eye level. The ceiling will be baby blue, with fluffy clouds scattered from one corner to the other. His closets will be painted with chalkboard paint, so he can draw all over them.</p><p>It appears that I can\u2019t help but overdo.</p><p>I worry over this, too, but Kathryn laughs and shakes her head. \u2018This is you, Brooke. Just try to pull back a little. Remember, what he needs is your love. That\u2019s why poverty-stricken parents can still do a wonderful job of raising a child.\u2019</p> <p>What she doesn\u2019t say: That\u2019s why wealthy parents often fail at it. They substitute things for affection.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll remember.\u2019</p><p>One thing we agree on is half-filling his built-in bookcase with books \u2013 dozens of picture books \u2013 favourites from my childhood, and anything new that catches my eye. Their spines are multi-hued and inviting when we line them up on the shelves \u2013 a miniature library. Wendy says River likes to be read to before bed, and I wonder to myself if he\u2019d like to be read to on the flat rock by the creek, in the middle of the day, for no reason.</p><p>I buy Matchbox cars and a track with a double loop in the middle that Reid assures me every boy ever born would like, and authentic-looking construction trucks that will look even more realistic with their working parts encrusted with dirt.</p><p>I choose a green toothbrush and three kinds of toothpaste. A nightlight shaped like a racing car that switches on and off. A pair of galoshes in John Deere green, even though the forecast calls for a cool, sunny day.</p><p>River\u2019s caseworker is picking him up from Wendy\u2019s after his afternoon nap, and bringing him here. Kris has been here several times during the home study, so she\u2019s already familiar with the place. She and Kathryn hit it off immediately \u2013 lucky for me. It took Kris longer to warm to me, but that\u2019s the upshot of being a woman and having a blunt personality.</p> <p>Sometimes people just don\u2019t like me. Go figure.</p><p>Glenn is planning a barbecue for dinner. He\u2019s one of those guys with the manly black canvas apron boasting, Licensed to GRILL! and all the long-handled accessories you can shake a stick at. On the way home from work last night, he stocked up on supplies: sirloin patties and beef hot dogs, buns, pickles, sweet relish and shoestring potatoes.</p><p>Kathryn\u2019s charged me with assembling a fruit salad to keep me occupied (read: I\u2019m driving her up the wall with my anxious patrolling around the house). One minute I\u2019m happy and ridiculously domestic, and the next I\u2019m positive someone will call to tell me they\u2019ve made a mistake. I never should have been considered to be River\u2019s mother. It was a court error \u2013 haha, so sorry.</p><p>When the phone rings, my hands jerk reflexively from the task of chopping the heads off strawberries, and I feel the sharp sting of the blade cutting through layers of skin.</p><p>\u2018Ouchgoddammit! I mean \u2013 darn it!\u2019 In a matter of seconds, my index finger develops a streaming red gash.</p><p>\u2018Maybe handing you a paring knife wasn\u2019t the best decision ...\u2019 Kathryn observes, turning to grab first-aid supplies from the pantry while I cleanse the cut and press a paper towel to it to stop the bleeding.</p><p>Glenn snags the phone on the third ring. \u2018Y\u2019ello?\u2019 His expression appears concerned, which makes my heart flip over \u2013 until he says, \u2018And it\u2019s only making that noise when you\u2019re coming to a stop, but not when you\u2019re idling? Uh-huh. Do the noise one more time for me.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot. This call is on the landline, not my cell. And it\u2019s obviously Kelley or Kylie with some sort of car trouble, rather than the State of Texas calling to stamp out my delusions of motherhood.</p> <p>\u2018Let\u2019s see that grisly wound.\u2019 Kathryn takes my hand and examines the cut. Light green eyes sparkling, she says, \u2018I think we\u2019ll be able to save the finger. Let\u2019s bandage that up and then give you something less disaster-prone to do while we wait.\u2019</p><p>As though I\u2019m six again, my stepmother seats me on the corner barstool, applies ointment to the gash and covers it with a neon-pink bandage.</p><p>\u2018Reid told me that you\u2019re my role model, instead of Sharla,\u2019 I say, and her worried gaze flashes to mine. \u2018I must have known that, deep down, for years. But I never really acknowledged it. I always thought who I was \u2013 who I\u2019d become \u2013 came down to blood, but that\u2019s just not true. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019d be without you. Which seems pretty damned unfair, given the fact that my existence ruined your life.\u2019</p><p>Pressing a kiss to my forehead, she sighs. \u2018Oh, honey \u2013 take a look around. Does my life look ruined to you? I have three very beautiful, talented daughters, a loving \u2013\u2019 We hear Glenn outside, preparing the patio cooking area and belting out his own version of an eighties pop song, in which grills are crazy about sharp-dressed men. \u2018\u2013 slightly insane husband, and I\u2019m preparing to become a grandmother twice in the next few months! I have a wonderful life, Brooke, and I\u2019m happy you\u2019re part of it.\u2019</p><p>When the doorbell chimes, I freeze in place. I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u2018Go and answer the door, honey,\u2019 Kathryn urges, slipping outside with Glenn so River won\u2019t be overwhelmed with new faces, everyone hovering, before he even gets in the door.</p><p>I walk to the door, shaking, and pull it open, hoping my smile looks friendly instead of panic-stricken. There he stands, gripping Kris\u2019s hand as securely as I\u2019d held Reid\u2019s on Wendy\u2019s front porch just a week ago. Next to him is a miniature rolling case shaped like a rather squared-off frog. Green, of course. He makes no move to enter, and his unsmiling expression doesn\u2019t waver.</p><p>According to Wendy, River is forty inches tall and weighs thirty-four pounds, putting him in the sixteenth centile for both height and weight. The medical consensus: nutritional deprivation for some portion of his first few years; with proper nourishment, he may be able to make up for some of it. In our pre-visit call last night, she notified me about his food hoarding, and the psychological causes of it. \u2018Also, he sometimes experiences nightmares \u2013 and occasionally, night terrors. Most nights, now, he sleeps just fine. But these are a possibility since he\u2019ll be in an unfamiliar environment.\u2019</p><p>I calmly accepted everything Wendy said, asking pertinent questions and taking meticulous notes, and when I got off the phone, I walked to the creek, sat on my rock and cried until my throat was raw.</p><p>I squat down to his level and fix a careful smile on my face. I\u2019m an actor. I can do this.</p><p>Years ago, I found a skittish litter of kittens living under Glenn\u2019s tool shed. They were lightning-fast balls of fluff, and I wanted to hold one of them more than life itself. So I sat in the grass all afternoon, as close to motionless as I could manage, cooing and sweet-talking as though I was the safest girl who ever lived.</p><p>Moderating my voice in that same way, I speak to my son, to whom I am still a stranger.</p><p>\u2018Hello, River. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come to visit. Would you like to come inside?\u2019</p><p>Like those kittens, his dark blue eyes regard me warily, assessing whether I can be trusted. An eternity passes before he nods, once.</p><p>Standing, I welcome Kris as well and offer to take River\u2019s case. His soft little fingers brush mine as he passes the handle to me, and I turn and lead the way through the living room and down the wide hallways, biting my lip.</p><p>\u2018Your room is right next to mine. Here we are.\u2019</p><p>Pausing in the doorway, he angles his head and scans the room \u2013 eyes moving deliberately over each individual object. I place his case on the bed and wait. When his gaze reaches me, he doesn\u2019t skip past. I\u2019m given the same careful regard as everything else. The thing that finally lures him into the room is the golden-coated stuffed puppy. Drifting closer, he comes to the opposite side of the twin bed, chewing his bottom lip. Kris remains in the doorway.</p><p>\u2018I think that puppy needs to be held.\u2019 My voice is still whisper-soft. \u2018Know why?\u2019</p><p>His eyes flick to mine.</p><p>\u2018Because we\u2019re having hot dogs for dinner, so he\u2019s a little worried.\u2019</p><p>One eyebrow quirks up, and I suppress a gasp \u2013 for the beat of two seconds, he is Reid, and I know in that moment that he\u2019s going to be fine. I\u2019ve never known anyone as stubborn and indomitable as this child\u2019s father ... unless it\u2019s his mother. He\u2019s survived the hand he was dealt because he\u2019s tough as nails, as small and breakable as he appears.</p><p>I quirk a brow back at him. \u2018We\u2019re going to eat outside. You can bring him along if you want. He doesn\u2019t have a name yet. I was thinking about calling him Hot Dog, but maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s worried about what\u2019s for dinner.\u2019</p><p>His mouth twists on one side this time, his eyes shifting back to the puppy.</p><p>\u2018Kris, would you like to stay for dinner?\u2019 I offer.</p><p>She shakes her head, smiling. \u2018I think you\u2019ve got this. Let me know if you need me \u2013 you have my numbers?\u2019</p><p>I nod. \u2018Programmed into every phone we\u2019ve got, and your card is on the fridge.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Awesome.\u2019 She turns her smile to him. \u2018Goodnight, River. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow after lunch, okay?\u2019</p><p>When I turn back, he has the puppy clutched to his chest. He looks at me one more time before nodding to her, giving her permission to leave him here with me. Alone.</p><p>26</p><p>RIVER</p><p>Brooke is pretty. Her hair looks soft, and I like her smile. Kathryn is nice, and even Glenn is nice. He\u2019s way, way bigger than Harry, but he doesn\u2019t scare me. He shows me how he makes broccoli taste better by sticking the tree part into a bowl of cheese.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know cheese could come in a bowl. I like it.</p><p>Brooke and Kathryn don\u2019t eat the cheese, but Glenn does and I do. I try my potato sticks and my hot dog in it too. (The food hot dog, not the puppy Hot Dog.) I try dipping a berry in it, but that isn\u2019t very good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After we eat, I pick up my empty plate. One of my chores at Wendy\u2019s house is to help clear the table. Kathryn smiles and says, \u2018Thank you, River.\u2019 She shows me where to put it in the kitchen.</p><p>Brooke asks if I want to walk to the creek and we go back outside. There is no fence around their house. I can only see one other house and it is far away.</p><p>Brooke makes me step around a big ant pile out in the grass, but the ants are all running around carrying things and I want to look. She says it\u2019s okay to watch the ants if I don\u2019t get too close. There are so many ants that I can\u2019t count that high.</p><p>\u2018If you get too close, they think you\u2019re a big monster, and they all bite you to make you run away,\u2019 she says. \u2018See, one bit me last week.\u2019 She shows me a red spot on her ankle.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to make those ants scared.</p><p>She has a real creek in her back yard. There are trees on both sides of it. We climb on to a big rock and sit near the edge. I can see down into the water. There\u2019s sand and rocks at the bottom. I don\u2019t see any fish, but there are bugs buzzing around on top of the water and we hear a frog.</p><p>\u2018This is my favourite place in the world,\u2019 Brooke says.</p><p>My favourite place used to be Mama\u2019s closet. It was dark all the time and Harry never found me there. This rock is better, I think.</p><p>Brooke makes her sweater like a pillow and lies on her back. She says, \u2018I like watching the clouds go by through the trees.\u2019</p> <p>I make my jacket a pillow and lie down too. She points to a cloud and says it looks like a squirrel. I think it looks like Hot Dog. I hold him up above me so I can see him next to the cloud.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re right. That cloud does look more like Hot Dog,\u2019 she says.</p><p>I have a bad dream after bedtime. When I wake up, Brooke is sitting next to me instead of Wendy. I want Wendy. I want Wendy. I want Wendy.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re scared and in a new place,\u2019 Brooke says. \u2018I know how that feels.\u2019</p><p>She rubs my head a little, like Wendy does when I have a bad dream. Wendy had to cut my hair really short because Sean got lice and he gave them to me. I like bugs, but I didn\u2019t like those bugs. They itched.</p><p>Brooke says it\u2019s a little dark in here, and she goes to open the curtain wide. \u2018Is this better?\u2019 she asks, and I nod. There are lots and lots of stars in the sky, and we can see the moon.</p> <p>\u2018Would you like me to sing you a song? I don\u2019t know very many, but I know a couple that my daddy used to sing to me when I was a little girl and I had bad dreams.\u2019</p><p>I nod again and she picks me up. She sits in the big chair next to the window and sings Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. That\u2019s a song Wendy sings to me sometimes. I hear her heart go thump, thump under my ear. The stars twinkle in the sky, like they\u2019re listening to her too.</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Usually, prospective adoptive parents meet the kids at a fast-food place or a park, before they do overnights. But that\u2019s not an option for us. I can\u2019t be seen in public with River yet, or we risk alerting the gossip rags to his existence, and the rumours will go nuts.</p><p>He\u2019s been to Kathryn\u2019s for two more overnights, during which I got him used to the idea of talking online with Reid. Not that he talks \u2013 but he listens.</p><p>Reid signed on once in full costume \u2013 sword and all. River\u2019s eyes widened while Reid told us about rappelling down a sheer cliff that day \u2013 how the winds were so gusty that his hair kept sweeping straight up, and the director kept yelling Cut! so someone could spray his hair back down while he hung in place on a rope.</p><p>\u2018It looked like this,\u2019 he said, making his hair stand straight up and managing to tease a smile from our son.</p><p>Our son. Every time I think or say it, it becomes less odd and more real.</p> <p>River\u2019s next overnight will take place in LA. He\u2019ll stay with me three days and nights, and Reid four. Kris will send daily reports to the judge. When I asked her point-blank if the judge was considering an early placement due to Wendy\u2019s health issues, she told me she couldn\u2019t reveal that sort of thing. And then she arched a brow and gave me a meaningful smile.</p><p>I\u2019m filming the season finale for Life\u2019s a Beach this week. It\u2019s odd working with my old castmates, most of whom would give anything to land either of the film parts I\u2019ve done since I left. There are also a couple of new girls who were hired as replacement-blondes, which puts me on the receiving end of some spiteful glares and mumbled asides. If I decide to return to the show, their dreams and jockeying for the position of top bitch are over.</p><p>So sad, so sorry.</p><p>Should Xavier and I both choose to stick around, the writers will devise an angsty continuation of the boiling-point romance between the now of-age Kirsten and her sexy long-time obsession, Kristopher. A passionate consummation will finally occur (during ratings week, no doubt), and then some justification for them to part will be devised, of course. Fans will be glued to the screen every week \u2013 whining and panting for our characters to screw each other again ... until Stan and the writers finally decide to land them in bed. Or more likely, on a picturesque, isolated beach \u2013 as if those are all over the place up and down the coast of California.</p><p>Yawn.</p><p>Xavier is as dense as ever, but we still have unrestrained chemistry on film, so Stan is downright smug over his own genius in getting both of us to agree to do the finale. We do a scene that takes two hours of body contortions and crude (on Xavier\u2019s part) lip-locks, and at the end of it, Stan tosses his arms in the air and says, \u2018Am I not goddamned brilliant?\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s so pompous I want to choke him. But we\u2019re almost done with the episode and it\u2019s been a long day, so I smile tightly and devise a half-dozen ways of killing him in my pretty little head.</p><p>Not an hour later, in front of the entire cast and crew, Stan bestows a smarmy, veneer-toothed grin on Xavier and me. \u2018I guess you two tried the wonderful world of movie-making and decided that a nice, steady, big-network pay-cheque is something to be missed after all, huh?\u2019</p><p>As if we failed on the big screen, like so many optimistic television actors before us.</p><p>Xavier grunts in response, but he\u2019s focused on a three-meat sandwich one of the giggly production assistants ran out (literally) to get him \u2013 so his grunt could be a sound of carnivorous appreciation.</p><p>I hold my tongue, just barely, until I slide into my car and call Janelle, who\u2019s left me five or six messages I don\u2019t bother to listen to before dialling her back.</p><p>\u2018Brooke!\u2019 she shrieks, and I dial down the volume on my phone. \u2018You got the offer!\u2019</p><p>Crap. I was about to beg her to find me another romcom, or a soap, or, hell \u2013 a set of commercials \u2013 anything but more Stan, as long as it\u2019s filmed locally. I don\u2019t want to talk about Paper Oceans today. Last week, I hinted at the fact that I\u2019d most likely ask her to turn it down, and she cried. I have never heard Janelle cry, and Christ on a cracker, I hope I never do again.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that I really do want that role.</p><p>After today, I\u2019d like to tell Stan to take his beach-bunny role and stuff it back up his ass.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m driving,\u2019 I say.</p><p>\u2018Ohmygod! You know how I feel about talking and driving!\u2019</p><p>Yes. Yes, I do.</p><p>\u2018Then don\u2019t leave me a hundred messages while I\u2019m filming \u2013 I thought someone died. I\u2019ll call you later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like a promising reaction. Brooke. Please. Do. Not. Turn. This. Down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Getting on the freeway!\u2019 Total lie.</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay \u2013 call me tonight.\u2019</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I\u2019m meeting my personal paparazza at my new place in about an hour. Despite Reid\u2019s reluctance to use Rowena to introduce River to the world, I have faith in her \u2013 to a point, of course, restricted to her job. She\u2019s always shown me in the light in which I wanted to be seen. She\u2019s never sold a pic I hated. She\u2019s even been handy a couple of times dispelling rumours I didn\u2019t want to spread.</p><p>Even so, we\u2019ve never met at my place before. My home has always been totally off-limits to the media \u2013 including Rowena. My new condo is situated inside a walled, guarded community. Ins and outs are filmed, and all non-residents are stopped by a security guard at the big iron gate at the front. Unauthorized visitors are sent packing.</p><p>The doorbell signals her arrival.</p><p>\u2018Hello, Rowena.\u2019 She\u2019s wary, like a wild animal being lured into a trap, but too hungry not to follow the smell of food. I shake her hand, which I guess I\u2019ve never done before, because her hand is tiny. I knew she was skinny almost to the point of malnourishment, but up close, she looks like she\u2019s got all the might of a parakeet. I can\u2019t imagine how she heaves that camera equipment around.</p><p>\u2018Ms Cameron,\u2019 she nods, entering haltingly. It\u2019s like she expects to encounter a tripwire and be impaled on my wall any second. I\u2019ve asked her to call me Brooke a dozen times before, but I realized a while back she was never going to, and I gave up.</p><p>She\u2019s brought her gear, but it\u2019s all zipped inside a tattered black bag. Glancing around surreptitiously, her desire to fish out her camera is unmistakable. We sit on my new sofas, skirting easily around the rounded corners of the reclaimed wood coffee table. There\u2019s a pink-tipped ivy plant of some sort in the centre of it, an indoor potted tree by the window and several hanging and potted plants on my top-floor patio.</p><p>I hired a plant person. Seriously.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got a proposition for you. It involves top-secret information, and of course a story I want told \u2013 photographically \u2013 in a certain light.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m listening,\u2019 she nods. Her ambitious eyes give me pause.</p><p>\u2018What I\u2019m about to tell you cannot leave this room. Ever.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes widen slightly. I\u2019ve trusted Rowena with a lot over the past few years, but I\u2019ve never prefaced anything like this.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve always been more than fair, Ms Cameron. I\u2019ll of course agree not to share any information you entrust me with.\u2019</p><p>I take a deep breath and keep my eyes directly on hers. \u2018I\u2019m adopting a son.\u2019</p><p>She blinks twice, stunned. \u2018Congratulations.\u2019 Whatever she expected, this isn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u2018Thank you \u2013 but it\u2019s more complicated than that sounds, which is why I need you. There\u2019s no ringing biological clock, no philanthropic statement. This isn\u2019t a foreign adoption. I\u2019m adopting my own child, a baby I gave up when he was born four and a half years ago.\u2019 Her eyes bulge. I\u2019ve never seen this much emotion on Rowena\u2019s face. \u2018I assume you\u2019ve made the leap everyone else will make \u2013 the question of who\u2019s the daddy. Well, you\u2019re in luck. If you agree to take photos of the three of us that he and I will approve prior to release, we\u2019ll give you an exclusive.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t have to tell her that once this comes out, it will be huge. If she times this right, and gets ahead of everyone else, she\u2019ll make a freaking fortune.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God,\u2019 she says. And then she does something I never, ever expected to see Rowena do. She bursts into tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brooke: Rowena is all set.</p><p>Reid: K. What\u2019s the plan?</p><p>Brooke: I was thinking we could go somewhere semi-public and have her photograph us \u2018candidly\u2019 \u2013 like we arranged to happen with you and Emma last May, outside the airport.</p><p>Reid: Shit. How did she ever forgive me?</p> <p>Brooke: You told her the truth when it counted, even if it made you look bad. For what it\u2019s worth, I admired you for that. Hated the shit out of you at the time, but admired you. You were a better man than me.</p><p>Reid: Haha.</p><p>Brooke: So, one of the hiking spots in the Hills, really early on a weekday? OH \u2013 I know \u2013 let\u2019s do it the day he transfers from me to you. The kid swap. Like divorced couples.</p><p>Reid: Yeah \u2013 perfect. That will answer the \u2018are they a couple?\u2019 question too.</p><p>Brooke: Ok, cool. Rowena is on this. She was stunned that you stepped up, btw. I think you\u2019ve gained a new fan. She\u2019s a single mom, apparently. She said her guy used to knock her around. She left the day he hit her kid.</p> <p>Reid: Jesus.</p><p>Brooke: She says she\u2019s always liked me because I don\u2019t take shit off anyone, lol.</p><p>Reid: Haha. Truth.</p><p>Reid: So have you heard anything more about Paper Oceans?</p><p>Brooke: Yeah. Janelle got the call earlier today \u2013 they\u2019ve officially offered it to me. But I\u2019d have to be in Australia all of June. I can\u2019t do it.</p><p>Reid: Brooke. This is your CAREER. Say yes. I\u2019ll take him in June. I\u2019ll probably be done filming by then. If not, it\u2019ll be a small overlap. He and the au pair we\u2019re hiring can come to New York with me. It\u2019ll be fine.</p> <p>Reid: Unless you want to do Life\u2019s a Beach instead ...</p><p>Reid: I\u2019ve heard that Xavier guy is an exceptional kisser ...</p><p>Reid: And Stan is a gem of a producer and not at all egocentric ...</p><p>Brooke: I\u2019m crying. Holy shit. Are you sure? Are you SURE?</p><p>Reid: YES. We\u2019ll be fine here without you. This is going to be his life. He\u2019ll adjust. I can do this. And yes, I even promise to call on the all-knowing and ever-powerful Graham if I need advice.</p><p>Brooke: Is it okay if I kind of love you right now?</p><p>Reid: Yeah. Is it okay if I thank you for letting me knock you up?</p><p>Brooke: God, we\u2019re weird.</p> <p>Reid: Hell yeah we are.</p><p>27</p><p>DORI</p><p>\u2018Hey, Deb.\u2019 I lean to kiss her temple and she blinks, but her fixed expression otherwise remains like the face of an impassive wax figure. \u2018I thought you might be getting tired of tulips, and also, one of Dad\u2019s rosebushes bloomed. They\u2019re pink \u2013 which I know you think is such a clich\u00e9 flower colour. But they smell so good that I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind.\u2019</p><p>Depositing last week\u2019s purple tulips in the trash can, I rinse and fill the vase in her bathroom sink. It\u2019s been five weeks since I\u2019ve seen my sister.</p><p>Five weeks since we buried Esther. Four weeks since Reid and I were in San Francisco. Three weeks since I\u2019ve spoken to him. Two weeks since he stopped texting and leaving voicemails.</p><p>\u2018I like Cal. My roommate, Shayma, is from Louisiana. You\u2019d love her. She\u2019s a business major, but she does community outreach projects with me.\u2019</p><p>Shayma hadn\u2019t asked about Reid \u2013 or the fact that I hadn\u2019t mentioned him in a while \u2013 until a couple of days ago. When I told her I hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk to him in a few days, she pursed her lips and said um-hmm, but nothing more.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m taking all intro classes this semester, but most of my professors are pretty cool. And you were right \u2013 the campus is one funky place. There\u2019s a full-scale T-rex model in the Life Science building. The grounds are beautiful, but the architecture is all over the place. And there\u2019s tons of activist history intact \u2013 like the building that\u2019s missing an outside handle because during protests fifty years ago, students chained the doors shut, and the administration took one handle off so they couldn\u2019t do it again. In the upper plaza, student groups hand out flyers and sell things to raise money for charity. Sometimes, opposing groups have tables feet apart, but everybody stays remarkably civil.\u2019</p><p>Running a brush through Deb\u2019s short hair, I recall what it looked like before her accident. She had beautiful shoulder-length hair, chestnut with auburn highlights she did herself. Now it\u2019s short, dull and frizzy; I make a mental note to bring conditioner with me next time. The bare spots from her surgeries have finally grown back in, though the surgical scar will remain a sort of odd, random part at the back of her head.</p><p>\u2018Berkeley feels like a small town, even though it\u2019s not. It\u2019s definitely not like LA or San Francisco \u2013 which you can see from certain spots on campus, if the fog hasn\u2019t rolled in.\u2019</p><p>Deb\u2019s chair is positioned so she can \u2018see\u2019 the view from her window, which is no more or less ridiculous than me taking her for a stroll in the grounds. My parents insist there is no proof that she\u2019s totally oblivious to what goes on around her, because her brain registers some activity. In some ways, this is more horrifying than if she\u2019d remained medically unresponsive, because no one can assure us that she isn\u2019t aware to some degree and simply unable to respond, though her doctors continue to reiterate that her brain activity is too inconsequential to represent comprehension.</p><p>My parents continue to hear what they want to hear.</p><p>I continue to speak to my sister because I have to talk to someone.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t spoken to Reid in a while. I miss him. Sometimes it feels like my heart is going to burst, and I almost want it to.\u2019</p><p>When I was very young, I had chronic ear infections and a grandma with unconventional ideas about what constituted a helpful story. \u2018Back in my day, there were no antibiotics for such things,\u2019 she told me during one particularly excruciating episode. \u2018Your eardrum just swelled up till it popped.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Mother! Don\u2019t tell her your horror stories!\u2019 Mom said, aghast.</p><p>\u2018Well, after it popped, it stopped hurting!\u2019 Grandma huffed. \u2018Problem solved.\u2019</p><p>I keep waiting for my heart to pop.</p><p>\u2018He has a son. River. He thinks that\u2019s why I stopped talking to him \u2013 he thinks I\u2019m angry he kept it from me. He doesn\u2019t understand how easily I could forgive and understand that choice. It\u2019s true that when he told me, and I looked at his picture on Reid\u2019s phone, that was when I felt myself detaching. But anger wasn\u2019t the reason for that.\u2019</p><p>I place a blanket over Deb\u2019s lap and take a light sweater from her closet. Clothing her is very much like dressing an infant on the cusp of being a toddler \u2013 she doesn\u2019t help, but she doesn\u2019t fight against me as I bend her elbow gently and pull her arm through the sweater.</p><p>Once outside, I resume our one-way conversation.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m such a coward \u2013 I\u2019m terrified that if I meet River, he\u2019ll become important to me. And when everything ends with Reid, I\u2019ll lose him too.\u2019</p><p>I find our spot \u2013 a secluded bench surrounded by waist-high camellia shrubs covered in white blossoms. Taking a seat, I face Deb\u2019s chair to me and stare at her beautiful hazel eyes. She blinks slowly, seemingly focused on something in the distance over my shoulder. Positioned as I placed them before we left her room, her hands rest in her lap, fingers twitching as they sometimes do \u2013 just another involuntary movement, doctors insist.</p><p>\u2018I know you\u2019d tell me I\u2019m being spineless,\u2019 I say to Deb now. \u2018Only you\u2019d say it more gently, like: Dori, you\u2019re braver than this. It\u2019s true, though \u2013 I\u2019m gutless where Reid is concerned. If I talk to him, I\u2019ll want to believe in everything he says.\u2019</p><p>My eyes fill, my heart compressing as I wait for the pop that never comes. \u2018I know I\u2019m hurting him, and I hate that.\u2019 After his last text: Please, goddammit it, not again \u2013 I almost caved. It took every ounce of willpower not to answer him. \u2018But it wouldn\u2019t be fair to try to keep him when I have nothing to offer him in return.\u2019</p><p>I swipe the tears away before they have a chance to track down my face.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s something I never told you about that decision I made four years ago.\u2019 I take a shuddering breath. \u2018I\u2019ve never felt a middle ground between acceptance and remorse. Every day for the last four years, it\u2019s been one or the other. Black or white. There was no grey, but I could bear it, because I had you. When I lost you, I began slipping into perpetual guilt. Carrying that secret, alone, for the first time, while trying to balance the idea of a benevolent God with a God who could let this happen to you \u2013 it was like falling into quicksand.\u2019</p><p>Reid saved me from going under. He\u2019d needed me to help him see who he could be, and in return, he allowed me to be myself in a way I never have. I was content to accept that happiness as long as it lasted. To try to make him happy while he was mine.</p><p>\u2018Deb,\u2019 I whisper, leaning closer. \u2018I feel hollow. I feel separate from everything and everyone. Nothing is touching me except the things that hurt. You always told me that if I helped other people, even if I was just going through the motions, it would keep me grounded. It would eventually help me define and know myself again. But it\u2019s not working this time. I don\u2019t know who I am, in relation to anyone else. I\u2019ve lost me.\u2019</p><p>When I get home, Dad is brewing his Saturday afternoon \u2018sermon-busting coffee\u2019.</p><p>\u2018Hey, sweetheart. How was Deb?\u2019</p><p>I almost say the same, but that\u2019s not what he means. \u2018The roses looked beautiful in her room, and when we got back in from a circuit in the garden, the whole room smelled rosy.\u2019</p><p>He smiles. \u2018You don\u2019t think she minds that they\u2019re pink?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t think she notices that they\u2019re pink.</p><p>\u2018No, Dad.\u2019 I smile, handing him the keys to the Civic.</p><p>\u2018If you might need the car later, just keep those,\u2019 he says.</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018Nick is coming over. We\u2019re going to get an early dinner and catch up before he goes back to Wisconsin tomorrow. Our breaks are on consecutive weeks instead of the same one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh? That\u2019s a pity.\u2019 He looks hopeful, and I bite back the desire to tell him that ship has long since sailed.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019 I shrug. \u2018At least I get to see him once.\u2019</p><p>He clears his throat, and I know before he speaks what he\u2019s about to say. He and Mom are so transparent. \u2018Seeing Reid this week?\u2019 he asks as I\u2019m walking towards the stairs, my face turned away so he won\u2019t notice the way I close my eyes and breathe through my nose, schooling my voice not to betray me.</p><p>\u2018No. I don\u2019t think so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh. Have you two \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dad, I\u2019m not ready to talk about it,\u2019 I say, and thankfully he drops it.</p><p>I\u2019ll never be ready to talk about it.</p><p>Nick arrives an hour later. The doorbell echoes through the house, and then I hear his voice in the foyer, comparing notes with Dad on the Badger basketball season. My father never took that relaxed tone with Reid ... but I have to quash my irritation over that. There\u2019s no purpose to it, after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hi, Nick,\u2019 I say, arriving downstairs. He beams and hugs me, and as he releases my shoulders, I ask, \u2018Have you grown?\u2019</p><p>His brows elevate hopefully. \u2018I dunno. Have I?\u2019</p><p>I laugh. \u2018I think you have! Boys gain weight in a whole different way than girls! Seriously unfair.\u2019</p><p>He smiles down at me. \u2018You do seem shorter.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Shut up.\u2019 I punch him half-heartedly and we turn to go. \u2018I\u2019ll be back in a bit, Dad. Don\u2019t get into any trouble while Mom\u2019s at work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aw, pumpkin \u2013 you\u2019re no fun!\u2019 he says in pretend objection, chuckling and shutting the front door behind us.</p><p>We turn to cross the porch and stop on the top step.</p><p>Reid is halfway up the walk. When he sees me with Nick, he stops abruptly too. In the span of those two seconds, a smile blooms and dies on my face. Whipping his sunglasses off, Reid glares at Nick and then at me. His jaw locks, fists clenched at his sides, as we all stand immobile and dumbstruck. He\u2019s clearly angry, but so beautiful I can hardly stand to look at him.</p><p>\u2018Dori?\u2019 Nick finally says, breaking the tense silence.</p> <p>\u2018Would you mind waiting in the car, Nick?\u2019</p><p>He glances towards Reid. \u2018Are you sure \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019</p><p>Reid\u2019s eyes flick to him as he passes. Nick is taller than average, but shorter and leaner than Reid, whose in-production body looks big and defined in comparison. Nick keeps a wide berth and avoids eye contact as he walks to the sedan he borrowed from his mom for the night. Reid\u2019s spotless Ferrari is parked right behind it.</p><p>I start down the steps. \u2018Reid. What are you ...\u2019 I swallow the uncomfortable lump in my throat and start over. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019</p><p>He watches me approach, but makes no move towards me.</p> <p>\u2018You stopped talking to me, Dori. I came to find out why.\u2019 He glances over his shoulder at Nick, who waits by the driver\u2019s side door, resting his arms on the roof of the car and watching us. \u2018Or should I take this as an answer?\u2019 When he looks back at me, the pain is evident in his eyes.</p><p>I shake my head, coming to stand in front of him. \u2018No. Nick has nothing to do with ... us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is there an us, Dori?\u2019 I flinch at the raw torment in his voice, and his hand moves as if to touch me, but he drops it back to his side. \u2018I made promises to you, and I intended to keep them. I know I was wrong to hide River from you, and I\u2019m willing to do whatever I need to do to make up for that. But you have to talk to me. If you\u2019re going to end it, you have to tell me why. You can\u2019t just disappear like you did before.\u2019</p><p>Mom told me he\u2019d called, though her memory was suspiciously vague as to the content of their conversation. From his perspective, my withdrawal is exactly like last time. But last fall was about submitting to pressure from my parents. This time is all me and my personal demons.</p><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t like last time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 he says softly.</p><p>My heart clenches rhythmically instead of beating. \u2018We can\u2019t talk about this now \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because going out with some other guy is more important to you?\u2019</p> <p>I wince at the indignation in his voice, and the way he pivots from hurt to anger.</p><p>\u2018Nick is leaving town tomorrow. We made plans ...\u2019</p><p>He stares at me, hard, silent.</p><p>Laying my hand on his forearm, I note the immediate tautness of the muscle under my fingers. Like he can steel himself against my touch. Like he wants to.</p><p>\u2018Can we talk tomorrow, Reid? Please?\u2019</p><p>The tension melts from his shoulders with a sigh. Carefully \u2013 as if he\u2019s afraid to startle me, he lifts his hand to curl one finger under my chin and gazes down into my eyes. \u2018Will you talk to me, Dori?\u2019</p><p>His thumb grazes over the indentation in my chin as though it\u2019s meant to rest there before it slides up to outline my lower lip. When he leans to kiss me, my body responds without regard to how this connection tears at my heart. My mouth opens to him, yielding against all the rapidly disregarded rationales for why I can\u2019t surrender to what he thinks he wants right now. My hand slides up his arm and under the sleeve of his T-shirt, tightening on his bicep as he slips that arm around my waist and pulls me closer, urgently.</p><p>I want this. I need this. And when he kisses me, he knows it.</p><p>Stroking my tongue with his, he\u2019s both fiercely possessive and gentle, and I want nothing more than to wrap myself around him and be carried away to a place where I don\u2019t have to think. A place where there\u2019s no guilt or fear, no right or wrong, no divine punishments or senseless accidents or indeterminate states.</p><p>When he draws back, his chest rises and falls with mine. \u2018I\u2019ll be back tomorrow afternoon,\u2019 he says, turning to go without looking back, pulling his keys from his pocket. He ignores Nick completely as he gets into his car and drives away.</p><p>I walk unsteadily to Nick\u2019s car, belatedly aware that at least three neighbours came outside in the last few minutes to sweep clean sidewalks or check empty mailboxes and watch Reid Alexander kiss me.</p><p>REID</p><p>As soon as Immaculada leaves the kitchen, Mom walks in with her coffee cup and heads for the impressive-looking coffee maker, which supposedly makes all sorts of coffee drinks. If it\u2019s in operation, though, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s just making coffee.</p><p>\u2018Reid?\u2019 She pulls out the adjacent seat and glances back at the digital clock over the stove. \u2018Goodness, you\u2019re up early,\u2019 she observes, sitting next to me.</p><p>I shrug. \u2018I\u2019m still on production schedule, I guess. Just as well \u2013 we start up at Universal on Monday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So soon?\u2019</p><p>I arch a brow at her. \u2018Time is money, Lucy.\u2019</p><p>She laughs at my overdone impersonation of my father ... and every producer in Hollywood.</p><p>Truth: I couldn\u2019t sleep most of the night, thinking about how Dori responded to that kiss. She wants me still. I don\u2019t care what she says \u2013 or refuses to say, since she hasn\u2019t been speaking to me. Come to think of it, her avoidance feels even more suspect, because I\u2019ve seen Dori angry, and nothing about her reactions yesterday denoted anger, even in the face of my obvious jealousy towards her friend.</p><p>Dr Shaw will be happy to know I didn\u2019t lay a verbal insult (or a fist) on Nick \u2013 the guy I mistook for her boyfriend last summer at Habitat, because he clearly wanted to be her boyfriend. Considering the fact that for about two minutes yesterday afternoon I thought that guy was the reason she wasn\u2019t calling me back \u2013 I think I showed extraordinary restraint.</p><p>\u2018River\u2019s room is completely ready,\u2019 Mom says, breaking into my mental recap.</p><p>\u2018Mom, are you sure you\u2019re good with River living here? I know you and Dad thought you were almost rid of me. And it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford my own place.\u2019</p><p>She smiles and lays her hand on top of mine. \u2018Reid \u2013 this house is ten thousand square feet, give or take a few closets. We have staff who\u2019ve been with us for years and are utterly trustworthy. It\u2019s private. It\u2019s safe. This is the perfect place for him. And for you, for now. Not forever \u2013 for now.\u2019</p><p>I nod. I\u2019m still stunned at how my parents have reacted to this.</p><p>Mom sips her coffee and I sip mine, both of us lost in our thoughts.</p><p>And then: \u2018You haven\u2019t said very much about Dori the last few times we\u2019ve spoken,\u2019 she says. \u2018How are things with her sister? And her first semester at Berkeley?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018I\u2019m not completely sure on either count.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 Her hmm doesn\u2019t sound surprised.</p><p>\u2018When I met her, I saw her altruistic side and thought do-gooder. I saw the girl with no make-up, wearing the least flattering outfits a girl could wear \u2013 especially knowing I was going to be around \u2013\u2019 Mom rolls her eyes and shakes her head \u2013 \u2018and I expected boring. And she wore these T-shirts every day, supporting all kinds of causes, and I decided she was judgemental and sanctimonious.\u2019</p><p>During our very first dinner out, Dori admitted that she was a bit sanctimonious. Her admission was coupled with that mischievous smile of hers that I\u2019d begun making deliberate efforts to trigger. That may have been the moment I fell in love with her.</p><p>\u2018But I was so wrong about her. Even when she questioned her own goodness, she managed to see something good about me. And then her sister had that accident. It destroyed her. It obliterated her faith in everything.\u2019 I bite the inside of my lip. \u2018Everything except me. I somehow got her to trust me. And then I lied to her. And I can tell myself it was a lie of omission like that\u2019s something other. Like that\u2019s something lesser. But it was still a lie, and I knew it every goddamned day that I didn\u2019t tell her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reid, if she\u2019s lost her faith in God, that isn\u2019t yours to resolve \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it is. She was trying, Mom \u2013 she was trying so hard to rebuild it. And then her dog died, and I didn\u2019t tell her about River. And now I have a son, who I can\u2019t turn my back on \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course you can\u2019t. Dori wouldn\u2019t expect that. She wouldn\u2019t want that. I know she wouldn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what\u2019s tearing me apart. I don\u2019t know how to fix this. How do I fix this?\u2019 I stare into her eyes \u2013 my eyes, mirrored back at me. \u2018I can\u2019t lose her. I love her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I see that, Reid. But if I\u2019ve learned anything in the past few months \u2013 and I think you have, as well \u2013 it\u2019s that people must fix themselves. That\u2019s the only way change has any hope of becoming permanent.\u2019 She squeezes my hand.</p><p>Winking at me from her ring finger is the huge, flawless, round-cut diamond my father presented on bended knee when they were young.</p><p>Not as young as I am.</p><p>My dad was twenty-nine or thirty when he proposed to my mother. He was thirty-five when I was born, very legitimately. Thirty-five. Not fifteen, and too much of a dickwad to even consider the fact that a girl he\u2019d had sex with \u2013 a girl he\u2019d made love to \u2013 could possibly be pregnant with his child, no matter what else he thought she\u2019d done, or with whom.</p><p>Mom follows my eyes to her hand and back to my face. She angles her head. \u2018Reid?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mom. I need to ask you something.\u2019</p><p>I hear the melodic chirrup of the Cantrells\u2019 doorbell when I press the button, because all the windows and the front door are wide open. It\u2019s a beautiful spring day in LA.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got it!\u2019 Dori calls as she descends the staircase, alerting me that one or both of her parents are home. Just like the first time I ever heard her speak, I\u2019m struck by the musical sound of her voice.</p><p>I watch her appear a bit at a time \u2013 bare feet on the steps and then her perfect legs in a pair of khaki shorts, followed by one of her more hideous T-shirts \u2013 a tie-dye done with too many colours, rendering it a sort of repulsive brown, for the most part. It sports the name of a chorale outreach programme for teens, sponsored by her high-school choir. Finally, her beautiful face dips into view. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could I have ever thought her plain? I must have been blind.</p><p>As she reaches the screen door, I say, \u2018You can\u2019t scare me off with that butt-ugly T-shirt, you know.\u2019</p><p>She clicks the lock on the door and admits me, glancing down at herself. \u2018It works on most people. I could stand on the porch like a scarecrow and no one would come near.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Except me.\u2019 I pull her close and wrap my arms around her. \u2018You know, if I keep you close enough, I can\u2019t actually see it. Plus, it\u2019s actually very soft, even if it is the most revolting T-shirt ever made.\u2019</p> <p>Her mouth quirks. \u2018It does sort of look like it was tie-dyed in poop.\u2019</p><p>I laugh. \u2018Yeah, it does.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d like to sweep her up, take her to her bedroom and strip it off. That\u2019s not an option at the moment. One, her parents are home. And two, we need to talk.</p><p>As if she\u2019s reading my mind, she shifts her eyes away from mine. Lucky for me, her hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and those exposed, pink-tipped ears tell me she can read my mind. Sucking her bottom lip into her mouth, she reveals her anxious mental state.</p><p>Time to be serious, as much as I\u2019d like to help her avoid it.</p> <p>I take her hand and lead her to the sofa. The ceiling fan whirrs overhead, and Esther\u2019s dog bed is still in the corner, though her collection of toys has been packed away. Rose bushes provide bursts of colour across the tiny back yard, and the aroma wafts through the open windows, as potent as a hothouse. As luxurious as my parents\u2019 house is, I love it here. I love her watery-coloured bedroom and those fish swimming across her ceiling. I think River would love it too.</p><p>Her hand lays palm up in mine. Skimming the contours of her fingers, I concentrate on calming her. Her eyes are still downcast, watching my finger trace slowly over her skin. I know from that kiss yesterday that she wants me, but she\u2019s always been capable of pushing those desires aside. If we don\u2019t go deeper than that \u2013 if she won\u2019t let me all the way in, apart from her physical response, I won\u2019t be able to keep her.</p><p>\u2018I want to apologize for not trusting you,\u2019 I say, and she frowns as her eyes snap to mine. This is not what she expected me to confess. Good. \u2018I was afraid of what you\u2019d think of me if, or when, you found out about River. But you\u2019ve been the one person to continually see anything worthwhile in me, to help me see it \u2013 and I should have trusted in that.\u2019</p><p>I recall the words she said when she found out about him: You\u2019re doing the right thing, and I\u2019m proud of you for it. Her eyes go glassy, and I cup her face in my hands as the realization hits. Fucking hell, how did I not see this? \u2018You have faith in me \u2013 but not me with you.\u2019</p><p>And that does it. She shuts her eyes and I know I\u2019m right.</p><p>\u2018You love your parents, but you think they don\u2019t know you. You may still believe in God, but not that he cares about you. You\u2019re disconnecting, trying to protect yourself. But, baby, it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019m here to tell you \u2013 it\u2019s not going to work.\u2019</p> <p>All of a sudden, she\u2019s crying, and I\u2019m praying this conversation isn\u2019t going to push her further from me.</p><p>I stand and pull a small, square box from my pocket. Go to my knees in front of her, so we\u2019re eye to eye. \u2018Dori, I have faith in us. I don\u2019t know how else to prove to you that I want you forever.\u2019 I open the box and set it in her open palm, and she gasps. \u2018My grandmother willed this ring to me, to give to the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. When she died almost six years ago, I had no idea what my future held \u2013 or that someone like you would be part of it. That River would be part of it. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be in another six years, but I know I want you there with me. With us.\u2019</p><p>She stares down at the enormous sapphire stone, surrounded by slivers of diamonds and set into a platinum band. I don\u2019t tell her that this ring also belonged to my great-grandmother. My maternal great-grandfather was one of those dudes who pulled his money from the stock market months before the crash, keeping his family beyond solvent at a time when many of his peers lost everything. Their son presented this ring to my grandmother, and it skipped a generation and came to me.</p><p>I close the box and shut her fingers around it. \u2018Take this. When you\u2019re ready, I want to put it on your finger. I want you to meet my son. I want you to let me bring you into my world \u2013 because I need you there. The media crap is just PR. Piece of cake for you, trust me. There are a hundred people ready to help us nail it. Let me help you rebuild your faith, because that\u2019s who you are, and I love who you are.</p><p>\u2018Remember last fall, when you needed to be reckless, and I told you to use me? Well, now, it\u2019s time to be fearless. I can\u2019t promise that you won\u2019t be hurt again, because life can suck. And, sometimes, it hurts like hell. I\u2019m asking you to have faith in one thing, for now: the fact that when we\u2019re alone, I\u2019m just Reid, and you\u2019re just Dori, and we\u2019re going to love each other for the rest of our lives.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s staring at me, the velvet-covered box clutched in her hand. I lean forward and kiss her, tasting her tears or my own, I don\u2019t know which. \u2018Come to me when you\u2019re ready to be fearless. Unless you can look me in the eye right now and tell me you don\u2019t love me.\u2019</p><p>Lower lip trembling, she says nothing, and I kiss her again before I leave.</p><p>28</p> <p>BROOKE</p><p>\u2018Brooke,\u2019 Janelle answers. \u2018Please tell me you\u2019re calling to say yes to Paper Oceans.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m calling to say yes to Paper Oceans.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, thank GOD!\u2019 My agent begins to squeal with joy and I jerk my mobile away from my ear. Jee-zus.</p><p>\u2018Janelle \u2013 I have one condition,\u2019 I yell towards the phone.</p><p>The squealing ceases. \u2018Okay. Let\u2019s have it.\u2019 She sighs. \u2018I\u2019m your agent \u2013 I was born to bitch up and negotiate. Hit me.\u2019</p><p>Ugh. Dramatic much? \u2018No negotiating necessary. This one is for Stan: tell him to go ahead and kill off Kirsten Wells, because she is never coming back to that damned beach.\u2019</p><p>She shrieks with laughter. \u2018Okay, seriously? After what he said to you on set last week, he can suck my \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018All right, then!\u2019 I stop her before she finishes that thought and I\u2019m stuck with a mental image I\u2019d prefer to bypass. \u2018We\u2019re good. So, other than the occasional PR-necessary interviews and whatever pre-planning meetings the producers might need me to do beforehand, I\u2019m officially out of commission until June. I\u2019ll be back and forth between LA and Austin until then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh. So you\u2019re going through with the adoption?\u2019 She sounds confused.</p><p>I grit my teeth. Janelle is a determined I will never, ever have children sort of woman. I was, too, not long ago. An aversion to parenthood was something we had in common. I can\u2019t expect her to suddenly relate to my new priorities \u2013 though I do expect her to work around them.</p><p>\u2018Yes. Reid has agreed to keep him while I\u2019m filming in Australia. He\u2019ll be between films in June.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Huh. Impressive. You two are behaving better than most of my divorced-with-kids cohorts \u2013 and they\u2019re in their thirties and forties. Those poor kids are like the rope in their parents\u2019 I-hate-you-now tug of wars. Thank God I don\u2019t have to ever speak to either of my douchebag exes again.\u2019</p><p>I know instinctively I\u2019ll never have that sort of issue with Reid. Whatever his past or present faults, he\u2019s stepped up in a way I never could have foreseen him doing. If he wasn\u2019t in love with Dori, I could fall for him all over again.</p><p>But he is in love with her. And I need his friendship too much, for River\u2019s sake, and for my own. I learned my lesson with Graham, whose friendship I\u2019m determined to earn back. Some day. If Emma allows it.</p><p>\u2018Heads up, Janelle \u2013 Rowena is getting an exclusive photo op of Reid and River and me. She\u2019s going to \u201ccatch\u201d us doing our first custody swap. Expect the story to break by the end of the week \u2013 I\u2019ll need you to consider who to give the print story to. It\u2019ll be jointly done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow. You\u2019re using Rowena for this?\u2019 she says. \u2018So, it will be a breaking story \u2013 photos only, instead of an official announcement. That\u2019s ballsy. But why am I surprised? Of course you\u2019d approach this the way you do everything else: head on.\u2019</p><p>Can\u2019t argue with that. \u2018I\u2019ve gotta go. River will be here any minute.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks for the great news!\u2019 she squeals. \u2018I\u2019ll be in touch!\u2019</p><p>I have got to get some earplugs.</p><p>I\u2019ve never made so much queso in my life, and I\u2019m from central Texas. River seems to like to dip everything he eats in a bowl of cheese, and given the fact that we\u2019re trying to get his weight up, his paediatrician has given the green light to unlimited amounts of it. To my son, everything is better dipped in cheese \u2013 except fruit. But hand the kid a chicken nugget or a green bean or a stick of celery, and into the queso it goes.</p><p>I also did something that Kris was none too sure about: I bought a dorm-room sized fridge for his bedroom. \u2018Maybe not the best precedent ...\u2019 Kris said, but I know she was thinking what I thought when I bought it: at least the food he hoards won\u2019t spoil. And it may get him to do it more openly, which could result in his no longer feeling the need to do it at all, at some point.</p><p>He also likes to sit in his closet occasionally, with the door almost all the way closed. So we constructed a little tented-off area in the back with blankets and pillows, and a safety light, though he sometimes sits in the dark. If I can\u2019t find him, I know that\u2019s where he is. I sit on his bed and call to him nonchalantly, telling him it\u2019s time for lunch, or bath, or pyjamas and a book. Eventually, he emerges, always holding Hot Dog ... who is going to need a bath of his own soon. His fur is sporting all sorts of random stickiness and, unsurprisingly, cheese.</p><p>\u2018Hi, River,\u2019 I\u2019ll say, as though it\u2019s perfectly normal for a kid to want to sit in a dark closet.</p><p>He climbs up beside me, and I smile as though it doesn\u2019t break my heart that he needs to hide. That he still gets that scared. That he still doesn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s had one bad dream this week,\u2019 I tell Reid quietly, as River stands at the hiking barricade, checking out the big Hollywood sign in the distance. He holds a finger out, tracing the letters in mid-air. I\u2019ve had him for three days, and he\u2019s going home with Reid now. \u2018He yelled, \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t hit Mama\u201d. But he stayed solidly asleep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus,\u2019 Reid says, watching him. We\u2019re both smiling, because Rowena is a small distance away, taking photos. My smile has never felt so unnatural.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call you if I have any problems.\u2019 He looks down at me, and the worry in his eyes is plain. \u2018You might want to keep your phone on twenty-four\u2013seven.\u2019</p><p>I smile up at him. \u2018You\u2019ll do just fine. But yeah, I\u2019ll have my phone on and on me for the next four days straight.\u2019</p><p>River\u2019s second favourite place is the huge sandbox on my enclosed patio. Daddy sent it, along with a note: Brooke, I got Evan one of these and he loves it. I thought River might too. Evan is the starting forward on his soccer team, which I\u2019m now assistant coaching. Rory\u2019s interested in cars, so we\u2019re taking a long weekend to go to the auto show in NYC. Thank you for your advice. It was spot on. Love, Daddy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reid plans to take River to the private beach owned by John\u2019s parents. \u2018John thinks he\u2019s become an uncle,\u2019 Reid says. \u2018I had to talk him out of buying River a kid-sized sports car.\u2019 I shake my head. John. \u2018Did you pack that bulldozer you said he likes?\u2019</p><p>I nod. \u2018And the crane. So you can both play.\u2019</p><p>We laugh and River turns to look at us. His sweet little face is so serious, but at least he isn\u2019t frowning.</p><p>\u2018Ready to go, bud?\u2019 Reid says, squatting down. River walks over and straight into his arms, and I bite my lip and keep my face turned from where I know Rowena is until my fake smile is back in place. I watch as Reid straps River into a booster seat in the back of his dad\u2019s SUV, and hands him Hot Dog. \u2018I\u2019m guessing Immaculada is gonna get hold of that dog some time in the next few days,\u2019 he murmurs, \u2018and send it through the wash.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I murmur back. \u2018I think we could stick him to a wall and he\u2019d stay there right now.\u2019 I run a hand through River\u2019s soft hair, wavy and the perfect beach blond, like Reid\u2019s. \u2018Goodbye, River. Have fun with Reid, and I\u2019ll see you soon.\u2019 When I lean to kiss his forehead, he turns his face into mine. Not quite kissing me back, but accepting my kiss.</p><p>I\u2019ve always said I would never need a man, and no boy would ever save me.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>DORI</p><p>Me: I\u2019m ready to talk, if you\u2019re free.</p> <p>Reid: River is here for his second overnight. His bedtime is 8. Mom is reading to him now, and he\u2019s looking pretty sleepy.</p><p>Me: Oh! I don\u2019t want to interrupt your time with him.</p><p>Reid: Come at 9. He\u2019ll be in bed \u2013 you won\u2019t be interrupting. Please come.</p><p>Me: You\u2019re sure it isn\u2019t too late?</p><p>Reid: No such thing, Dori. I\u2019ll open the gate \u2013 just park in your usual spot.</p><p>I have a usual spot, even if it\u2019s been over two months since I\u2019ve been here.</p> <p>I take a deep breath and stare at the house where Reid grew up. It looks like a castle to me \u2013 a beautiful architectural monstrosity. But to him, it\u2019s just home. He doesn\u2019t see the world as I do \u2013 not because he wilfully refuses to, but because this is his reality. His celebrity is his reality. His career. His reputation. His son.</p><p>And he wants me to be part of this life of his.</p><p>Unbeknown to me, Mom was eavesdropping on our conversation on Sunday afternoon. I didn\u2019t know until the next day. When she appeared at my bedroom door and asked if I had a moment to talk, I was separating the last of my clean laundry \u2013 hanging what I need for the coming week at home, packing what I\u2019ll take back to Cal next weekend.</p><p>\u2018Sure, Mom. Kayla and Aimee aren\u2019t coming to get me for a couple more hours.\u2019</p><p>My friends planned a night out that included a movie: Hearts Over Manhattan, having no idea, of course, that it starred the mother of Reid\u2019s child \u2013 whose existence was still a secret.</p><p>Mom perched at the end of my bed and glanced around my tidy room. \u2018I\u2019ve missed you, Dori. When Deb first left for college, it was difficult to watch her go, but her leaving didn\u2019t silence the house \u2013 though it certainly quietened it.\u2019</p><p>Deb, as tone-deaf as she could be, was the one who sang at the top of her lungs in the shower. She howled with laughter when talking on the phone or watching television. She banged pots and pans while cooking. It was impossible for her to enter or leave a room quietly. But she was so sweet and constantly happy that Mom and I, naturally more restrained, couldn\u2019t criticize her innate exuberance.</p><p>Those memories are bittersweet now \u2013 rare moments that bring both laughter and tears, and leave my emotions a tangled mess.</p> <p>\u2018You were only ten when she left for college,\u2019 Mom said, smiling. \u2018You still wanted to tell your dad and me all about your day, or help make cookies, or play with Esther. The house still felt full with you in it, and now, it\u2019s so quiet.\u2019</p><p>I slid a hanger through another shirt and hung it in the closet, unsure how to respond.</p><p>\u2018I was listening to some of your conversation yesterday. With Reid.\u2019</p><p>I turned to face her, stunned. My mother had never been the purposefully overhearing, snooping around sort of parent. Neither of my parents was. Of course, that was before I spent the night with Reid last fall.</p><p>\u2018What he said \u2013 that you don\u2019t think we know you, that you don\u2019t think God cares about you \u2013 it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged \u2013 because it was unerringly true. How can you tell a parent who\u2019s always loved you that she doesn\u2019t really know you at all? But I couldn\u2019t lie to her, either.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve been very patient with me while I figure some things out. Like the fact that you\u2019re a smart, loving young woman, and it\u2019s time I trust your decisions about who you choose to love. If my interference in your relationship with Reid is what\u2019s caused you to think I don\u2019t know you, Dori, I\u2019m even sorrier. You\u2019re my daughter, and I want what\u2019s best for you. But that\u2019s for you to decide, as hard as it is for me to admit.\u2019</p><p>I crossed the room as she stood to hug me. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Mom.\u2019</p><p>Shaking her head, she said, \u2018You have nothing to apologize for.\u2019 She pulled back and took my face in her hands. \u2018If you see something good in that boy, then there\u2019s something good in him. I trust your judgement, Dori. I always have.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a lot of good in him, Mom. And I want to tell you about all of it. Well \u2013 most of it.\u2019 I blushed, knowing Reid would laugh at that accidental disclosure.</p><p>A tap on my window breaks me from my reverie. I blink, because Reid is standing right there, waiting for me to exit my car.</p><p>As I release the seat belt, he\u2019s opening my car door, and the hinges protest as they always do, though I\u2019d swear they squeal louder when I\u2019m parked in his driveway.</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m glad you came.\u2019 I fall in beside him and we walk inside. \u2018He\u2019s asleep. Would you ... do you want to see him?\u2019</p><p>I nod, chewing my lip.</p><p>Tiny lights line the baseboard along the hallway between River\u2019s partially open door and the steps up to Reid\u2019s room, like the aisles in nice theatres. Reid pushes his son\u2019s door open and enters, barefoot. I slip my flip-flops off in the hallway and follow him.</p><p>The room is dark, but there are two nightlights, and after a minute, our eyes have adjusted well enough to cross the room. Along with shelves of toys, I spy a television and game console, a huge overstuffed chair, and a perfectly proportioned desk.</p><p>The bed is raised, with a ladder at the end, but isn\u2019t quite high enough to be a bunk. His small body curled around a stuffed dog, River is wearing pyjamas covered in cartoon ants, of all things. Unmistakably blond, his hair is longer than it was in the picture on Reid\u2019s phone. His lips are parted, the lightest snore emanating from him.</p><p>I\u2019ve always loved kids, but knowing this little boy is Reid\u2019s takes that appeal a step further. I have to clench my hands into fists to keep from reaching out to touch him. \u2018He\u2019s beautiful,\u2019 I say.</p><p>Reid stares down at me with dark eyes, his hair almost as light as River\u2019s \u2013 no colour, as though he\u2019s a black and white version of himself in his white T-shirt and dark jeans. He takes my hand and leads me from the room.</p><p>Instead of taking me to his bedroom, he steers me to a small parlour off the main living area, and we sit on a sofa, side by side. He turns to me and seems to brace himself for what I have to say.</p><p>I pull my Mary Poppins bag from my shoulder and reach into it, pulling out a gift bag. \u2018It\u2019s a belated birthday gift. I had to get creative, since you have everything. Or, you will now \u2013 after you unwrap that.\u2019</p><p>Surprised, he opens the bag and flings the tissue paper to the floor. When he pulls out the T-shirt, he laughs. Aimee, Kayla and I scoured the local thrift stores for the last two days to find a MADD T-shirt similar to mine. They were horrified that I\u2019d give Reid something \u2018used\u2019, but once I had the idea I couldn\u2019t let it go. They forced me to swear I wouldn\u2019t tell him they had any part in finding it.</p><p>\u2018Should I try it on now?\u2019 he asks, one eyebrow quirking up.</p><p>Good golly, he\u2019s hot, and I\u2019d love for him to strip off his shirt and not put anything back on. But we\u2019re not done.</p><p>\u2018I have one other thing to give you.\u2019</p><p>He pushes the shirt and wrapping materials to the side while I reach into my bag and pull out the small velvet box. His eyes flick from the box to my face, and he doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u2018What you said the other day \u2013 you were right. I\u2019ve been disconnecting myself. I haven\u2019t believed my parents know me. I haven\u2019t believed that God cares about me, or my sister. I haven\u2019t been sure he exists at all. And I haven\u2019t had faith in a future with you.\u2019</p><p>I take a deep breath and hold the box out to him. He swallows, jaw clenched, and opens his hand. When I place the box in his palm, he closes his fingers over it.</p><p>I lick my lips and take a deep breath of my own. \u2018You said you have faith in us. You told me to come to you when I was ready to be fearless. The truth is, I don\u2019t know if I can be fearless. I\u2019ve lost myself, Reid, and I\u2019m still so scared. But I\u2019m ready to try. If you still want to, I\u2019m ready.\u2019</p><p>He blinks, stunned, and opens the box. Taking my left hand from my lap, he pulls the ring from its silk-sheathed slot and slides it on to my finger. The dark blue stone and surrounding baguettes fill the space below my knuckle, and somehow, it fits perfectly. He leans closer, his lips a whisper over mine at first, and then he kisses me deeper, gathering me closer, our breaths mingled and shared until we\u2019re both winded, chests heaving like we\u2019ve each run a mile uphill.</p><p>He stares at my hand in his for a long minute, his thumb caressing the edges of the band on my finger, before his eyes lift to mine. \u2018When do you have to be home?\u2019 His voice is low and tinged with an ache that echoes back from my heart.</p><p>\u2018I told them I might be a little late ...\u2019 I say.</p><p>Before I can say another word, he grabs my right hand, jumps up and strides through the house to his bedroom. He programmes an intercom system inside his door \u2013 the display reads: River\u2019s room: ON. \u2018I can hear him; he can\u2019t hear us,\u2019 he says.</p><p>Elbowing the door shut, he tugs me into the circle of his arms.</p><p>The second his mouth crashes into mine, I\u2019m on fire. Engulfed. I open my mouth and he kisses me harder as I press against him, locking my arms around his neck. His hands are hard on my back, fingers digging in, sliding down to my hips, gripping me tight as his tongue thrusts deep into my mouth, stoking the fire at my core until it\u2019s raging through me.</p><p>One knee slips up the outside of his thigh and he immediately grasps my leg, wrenches it higher and around his waist. As the other follows, he lifts me effortlessly, and I hook my ankles at his low back. Cushioning my head with his hand, he slams me into the wall. His lips leave mine with a loud pop, sliding down my jaw, raining kisses down my neck as I\u2019m gulping in air. Seizing handfuls of his hair, I pull him back to my mouth, kissing him urgently, our tongues tangling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shoving my tank up, his hands cup my breasts, thumbs teasing beneath the smooth satin, and I can\u2019t get close enough to him. Without his hands bracing my weight, I\u2019ve slipped just low enough to feel him hard against me, too many layers between us. Panting, he unhooks my front-closure bra and shoves the cups to the sides, and despite my determined muteness so far, I cry out when he sucks a nipple into his mouth, hard. Arching into him, I bite my lip until it stings, and I\u2019m rewarded with his growl as he swings me around, strides towards the bed and drops me on to it.</p><p>I\u2019m transfixed by the sight of him jerking his shirt over his head without bothering to unfasten the buttons. He slings it to the ground, inside out, as I shrug out of my tank and bra. Stepping up and unzipping my shorts, his dark gaze is on my face. My heart thuds as I return his stare and begin unbuttoning his jeans slowly, brazenly.</p><p>Seconds later, he\u2019s tossing my shorts to the floor and pressing me to the mattress. As soon as our mouths meet again, my heart cracks open, and the memories are a tidal wave, beginning with that first spellbinding kiss in the pink closet. He seems heavier, bigger, harder all over than he was even those few months ago, but his beautiful face is still all angled symmetry, except for his full mouth and the thick, curving lashes ringing his dusk-blue eyes.</p><p>His kiss is the same \u2013 hot and demanding, but never stingy. Perfect. I\u2019m good for you even if you don\u2019t know it yet, he told me, and then he waited months for me to know it. To believe it. To stop doubting him.</p> <p>Tears seep from the corners of my eyes to snake into my hair, and I hold on and kiss him back, measure for measure. \u2018I love you,\u2019 I say, finally, and he freezes and pulls back, watching me. \u2018I love you,\u2019 I repeat, \u2018and I\u2019m so scared, Reid. But I have faith in us.\u2019</p><p>Fingertips stroking the edges of my face, he shifts his weight from me, pulling me into his embrace. \u2018That\u2019s what faith is, right?\u2019 he says. \u2018Believing in what can\u2019t be known? Fall into my arms, Dori. I\u2019ll catch you, every time, and I won\u2019t let go.\u2019 His lips brush over mine, feather-light. \u2018Say it again, please. I\u2019ve waited so long to hear you say it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you.\u2019 I push him gently to his back and lean over him. Stare into his eyes. \u2018I love you. Please don\u2019t let go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got you. And I\u2019m not letting go. Again. Please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you.\u2019</p> <p>He closes his eyes and whispers, \u2018Again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love you too,\u2019 he breathes.</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I say and he laughs, flipping me on to my back, lacing our fingers and pinning my hands.</p><p>\u2018Again.\u2019</p><p>I stare into his eyes, a slight smile pulling at my mouth, and I see myself as he sees me. I feel loved, and scared, and hopeful. I feel found. And I think, Here is the beginning of my faith. Here is my forever. Right here. Right here.</p> <p>\u2018I love you, Reid.\u2019</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>REID</p><p>New York City \u2013 June</p><p>Sitting across from me, Emma\u2019s eyes widen slightly, focused over my shoulder, and Graham coughs into his fist in a transparent attempt to conceal laughter.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder to see Cara and River emerging from the mouth of the hallway that leads to two bedrooms \u2013 Graham and Emma\u2019s on one side, Cara\u2019s on the other. Emma is still attending NYU, but she\u2019s planning to postpone her fall semester for a role she just landed on Broadway, and she may or may not return next spring. When Graham is filming on location, Cara divides her time between the apartment and Graham\u2019s parents, ten minutes away.</p><p>They were both more than excited to meet Dori and River, who flew into JFK last night. I have three more days of filming. Brooke left for Brisbane yesterday, but not before multiple confirmations of contact numbers and appointed Skype times.</p><p>\u2018No, walk like this.\u2019 Hands on her hips, Cara strides forward \u2013 her feet echoing thump thump thump on the worn wood floor. A pink sheet, tied around her neck, billows out behind her, and rhinestones glint regally from the top of her head. Her expression grave, she turns to look back at River. \u2018Now you try.\u2019</p> <p>Stepping into the room, adorned in a purple sheet, my son\u2019s stride is not so forceful. Unlike Cara\u2019s exaggerated stamping, the pads of his bare feet make no sound, and his gait is careful. I wonder again at genetics, and how Brooke and I could mesh genes and produce such an unobtrusive kid. And then I notice his head. More specifically, what\u2019s on his head. Which explains Graham\u2019s amusement.</p><p>\u2018Son of a bitch.\u2019</p><p>My voice is muted, but Graham coughs once more to cover it, stifling another half-laugh. I\u2019d really like to punch him, because somehow, some way, this is his fault. Dori places her soft hand on my forearm. My eyes jerk to hers. Dark and dancing with laughter, they almost convince me to laugh too. Almost.</p><p>\u2018Is my son \u2013\u2019 I inhale through my nose and keep my voice very low \u2013 \u2018wearing a tiara?\u2019</p><p>Hands raised in placation, Graham clears his throat, \u2018Eh-eh,\u2019 when I shoot him a direct glare.</p><p>\u2018Cara loves to play princess.\u2019 Emma\u2019s voice of reason pulls me from contemplations of violence. \u2018She must have convinced River to be her prince.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not the prince, he\u2019s the king,\u2019 Cara chirps, drawing all eyes to her. Her hands clasped daintily in front of her, she rolls big brown eyes and tilts her tiara-clad head at the four of us, like we\u2019re all a little stupid. \u2018He\u2019s carrying the prince.\u2019</p><p>Sure enough, in a hold that would be better suited for a football than a baby \u2013 which I\u2019m kind of thrilled shitless about at the moment \u2013 my kid cradles a blanket-swathed baby doll in his arms. \u2018Jesus Ch\u2013\u2019</p><p>Dori\u2019s fingers slide across my arm, a gentle reminder to swallow my words, and I breathe an involuntary sigh. I\u2019ll never understand how she does that with a single touch.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the little prince\u2019s name?\u2019 Dori asks, and Cara turns to carefully take the doll from River, as though it\u2019s made of glass and wouldn\u2019t just bounce across the floor if one of them dropped it.</p><p>\u2018Well I wanted to name him Tristan or Edward.\u2019</p><p>Cara frowns at her father when he chuckles again and Emma swats him, but Graham just pulls her closer and kisses her temple, and she settles into his embrace. \u2018Those are very princely names,\u2019 he assures his daughter.</p><p>\u2018Yeah ...\u2019 She rocks the bald-headed baby doll, the eyelids of which are closed because, I assume, it\u2019s horizontal. \u2018But we named him Reid, because River said princes get named after their grandfathers.\u2019</p><p>Dori\u2019s hand stills on my arm.</p><p>\u2018He said what?\u2019 My words are thin, but they seem to echo across the loft.</p><p>She continues to stare at the doll. \u2018Okay, really, he just said \u201cReid\u201d when we were choosing a name, which is you, so it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s what he meant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He said, \u201cReid\u201d?\u2019 My voice is a whisper.</p><p>Cara nods, unaware of what it does to me that the boy who never speaks when he\u2019s awake chose to utter my name, even if I didn\u2019t hear it. Dori knows, though. Her eyes are glassy when I slide a look at her, and her beautiful face swims through tears I\u2019d rather not shed in front of Graham and Emma.</p><p>River tugs the purple sheet behind him as he rounds the end of the sofa, his eyes on mine, puzzled and anxious. That\u2019s the last thing I want him to feel.</p><p>I open my arms and he climbs into my lap, still staring. His eyes are such a stormy, serious blue. Wisps of wavy blond hair poke up and out from around the tiara. Every feature is small and vulnerable. He scares the absolute hell out of me. My feelings for him scare the absolute fucking hell out of me. And that\u2019s how I know they\u2019re right.</p><p>Drawing the purple sheet up to my shoulder, he leans closer and I fight the urge to crush him close, watching Dori over his head. Her tears are incompatible with her blissed-out grin, like rays of sun hitting the ground during a rainstorm. Silly, beautiful girl \u2013 wearing my ring, sharing my bed, accepting my child, my past and my future.</p><p>My son\u2019s small finger touches the outer corner of my eye, releasing a tear. Damn. I know Graham and Emma are watching, but no matter how exposed I feel, I can\u2019t move. I don\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u2018No cry, Daddy,\u2019 he whispers, warm breath under my chin, his cheek against my heart.</p><p>And then everyone is wiping tears away, and Graham and I look at each other in silent agreement that this moment is between the four of us and is going nowhere. Ever.</p><p>Cara takes River\u2019s hand and tugs. \u2018C\u2019mon, River.\u2019 Sliding off my lap, he allows himself to be led away, and none of us can contain our laughter when Cara murmurs, \u2018That\u2019s another thing you need to remember about families \u2013 sometimes everyone is just weird.\u2019 </p> </body></html>"]
