I\u2019d woken up in the middle of the night, wide-awake and itching to finish the chapter in my manuscript where my dad finally makes progress in his relationship with my mom. Much of what I\u2019d written was conjecture since I only knew the basic history of my parents\u2019 relationship, but their world, or the world I\u2019d given them, had taken me over these past few months and I found myself enjoying writing in a way I had never before.</p><p>This often meant late-night type-fests and despite the fact that I was partially consumed by their story, I was also very much aware of my considerate bedfellow and was trying to act as he would and not wake him up.</p> <p>I\u2019d been typing for just over an hour and finally I\u2019d come to the end of the chapter. After saving the file, I shut the laptop down and stared at it for a while. Breathing in and out, slowly, evenly, I controlled the wound inside of me. Pain slashed me deep across my chest and when I thought on the loss of my parents, of my little sister, Beth, that cut would widen into an agonizing gash. Before my considerate bedfellow, I\u2019d have sewn that cut completely shut and put a numbing agent over it. Now I felt it. I just didn\u2019t let it overwhelm me by turning it into a gaping hole.</p><p>Braden helped a lot with that.</p><p>My considerate bedfellow.</p><p>Among other things.</p><p>I smiled and turned in my chair to look at him in the dark room. His bare back was uncovered, the sheets drawn up to his waist, his long legs tangled in them in the middle of the bed. We didn\u2019t have \u201csides of the bed.\u201d Braden was a cuddler\u2014he insisted we didn\u2019t need sides.</p> <p>He\u2019d had an exhausting day yesterday. He\u2019d called me late, explaining how he\u2019d gone from meeting to meeting, and then he had been pulled into some emergency at his nightclub Fire, which turned out not to be such an emergency but a case of crap management. When he\u2019d returned home I must have already fallen asleep but I wasn\u2019t surprised that I woke up in his arms. Or that he\u2019d been so tired he didn\u2019t wake up when I extricated myself from his embrace.</p><p>Gazing longingly at his muscular back and strong arms, I wanted to slip back into bed and wrap him around me. But looking at his sleeping face in profile I stopped myself. I was afraid I\u2019d wake him up and he obviously needed his rest.</p><p>Standing up slowly so my chair wouldn\u2019t squeak, I tiptoed in the dark across to the bed and very gently eased myself back into it, checking constantly to make sure I hadn\u2019t woken him as I pulled the sheets back up over me. I lay down on my side, my hand tucked under my cheek, and I stared at him.</p><p>He was beautiful.</p><p>Just looking at him caused a different kind of ache inside of me.</p><p>This was a man who\u2019d fought long and hard to keep me, even when I was bent on self-destructing us. This was a man who understood I could be difficult and stubborn and a little bit irrational (okay, maybe a freaking lot irrational), and still loved me. I wasn\u2019t the best at expressing my emotions. I\u2019d spent so long guarding them so I wouldn\u2019t be vulnerable to heartbreak that even now I wasn\u2019t the gushy, emotional type of girl who could tell her boyfriend every single day that she loved him.</p> <p>But Braden knew I loved him.</p><p>Sometimes I wondered, though, if he knew how much. I wondered if he knew that just watching him sleep made me scary happy, breathless even. I wondered if he knew that he was absolutely, without a doubt, everything to me.</p><p>Usually that wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d want anyone to know because it meant admitting it out loud, and if I admitted it out loud and then lost that person, then I couldn\u2019t pretend I\u2019d never felt so much for them in the first place. But that was the old me. Dr. Pritchard, my therapist, wouldn\u2019t be happy with me if I held on to that kind of thinking.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be happy with me.</p><p>Worse, Braden wouldn\u2019t be happy with me.</p><p>I snuggled a little closer, just needing to feel the heat from his body against my skin. My eyes dropped to his mouth, his beautiful mouth, which said and did a lot of nice things to me.</p><p>I was everything to Braden. I knew this because he told me so. He never made me doubt how much I meant to him.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re over there and I\u2019m over here?\u201d he suddenly muttered, his eyes still shut.</p> <p>I\u2019d jerked back at the sound of his voice but was now smiling as I slid closer. \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d I whispered, wrapping my arm around his waist, entwining my legs with his as he draped a strong arm over my back and snuggled me against his firm chest. I sighed. Content.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been awake for the past ten minutes, waiting for you to get your arse back in beside me.\u201d</p><p>I snorted at his disgruntled tone.</p><p>His warm hand slid down over my back, caressing my butt before smoothing back up my spine. \u201cYou get what you needed to get down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmhmm. Finished my chapter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, babe. Now go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I smirked against his chest. \u201cOkay, caveman.\u201d</p><p>A minute or so passed and just as Braden was drifting back off I whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re my everything. You know that right?\u201d</p><p>His arm tensed around me at my words and then I found myself pushed back, his eyes boring intensely into mine. After searching them, his sleepy mouth curled up at the corners. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to sweet-talk me to get sex, babe.\u201d</p><p>My eyes smiled. \u201cWell that kind of knowledge could have saved me months of uncomfortable expressions of love.\u201d</p><p>Wide-awake now, Braden tightened his arms around me and as he flipped onto his back he hauled me with him so I was sprawled across his chest, my legs straddling his hips. A note of seriousness entered his gaze as he drew his thumb across my mouth. A shiver rippled through me and I loved that he excited me so much. \u201cI know how you feel about me. I feel the same way. You never have to worry that you don\u2019t tell me enough, okay?\u201d</p><p>There he went again, being all perceptive to the point of being creepy psychic mind reader guy. \u201cYou\u2019re creepy psychic mind reader guy.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cCreepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a hot way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hot way to be creepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlide your hand south and creepy will certainly become hot.\u201d</p><p>Braden\u2019s teeth flashed in the dark, his wicked smile jump-starting my heart. His hand drifted south, down my back, over my pert ass he liked so much and under my nightdress.</p><p>\u201cAm I hot now?\u201d he asked, his voice low and rumbling with arousal as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.</p><p>I arched into his touch, bracing my hands on his chest. \u201cBaby, you don\u2019t know how to be anything else.\u201d</p><p>My words jacked Braden up, his torso lifting from the bed, so I found myself sitting in his lap, our chests pressed close, his arms holding me tight. His lips brushed gently over mine as he shifted me so his erection throbbed between my legs. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me with compliments.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, my reply whispered against his mouth, \u201cI just wanted you to know that just because I don\u2019t say it all the time, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it.\u201d</p><p>This time he kissed me, tongue and all, deep and wet. When he pulled back for air, he promised me, \u201cI know.\u201d His hands pushed at my nightgown until he caught the hem and tugged it up over my head. Braden\u2019s heated gaze moved over my naked body and I abruptly found myself on my back as he pushed down his pajama bottoms. \u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d</p><p>The wind was beating against my back and the sad, gray clouds above me were giving me this apologetic little pout. When I\u2019d left the flat this morning the sun had been out and I\u2019d dressed weather-appropriate. I had on a thin T-shirt and my best pair of black skinny jeans. Now it was threatening rain and I was shivering in my shirt, wondering how I\u2019d managed to let myself be talked into the trek I was on and trying not to be as pissed as I was feeling.</p><p>After the emotionally fueled sex Braden and I had had early that morning, I was a little surprised to find him so distracted when we\u2019d gotten up. Sure, he was tired from lack of sleep, but that had never stopped him from paying attention to what I had to say. However, he\u2019d hurried into a shower, shooed me (yes, shooed!) me out of our bedroom while he got dressed, given me a quick kiss, told me Ellie wanted to spend the day with me and I should call her, and then hurried out of the flat.</p><p>It left me feeling confused. I felt like I was missing something.</p><p>Instead of sitting at home on a Saturday, stewing over it, I\u2019d let Ellie talk me into accompanying her. Sometimes she\u2019d get something in her head that she just had to have or had to do and she\u2019d drag me all over the city to these obscure little shops. This time I\u2019d let her talk me into the thirty-minute walk to Bruntsfield. Way back in my pre-Carmichael years I used to live in Bruntsfield. It was this kitschy little area of the city with kitschy little shops. It was popular with students. I\u2019d say I missed it but it hadn\u2019t come with an adorably annoying best friend like Ellie or her brother Braden, the man who was currently driving me to distraction.</p><p>The journey to Bruntsfield had a purpose. Or at least that\u2019s what Ellie told me. Apparently she\u2019d passed this little clothing boutique that had on sale \u201cthe most gorgeous vintage shoes ever\u201d and Ellie was kicking herself for not buying them. We were back, trying to find the shop and hopefully the shoes.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d Ellie asked, a teasing smile in her voice as she studied me, her short blond hair blowing into her face.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I really was listening. Mostly. I knew the discussion pertained to our friend Jo and her new boyfriend, Cameron. \u201cYou were telling me you think Cam is moving pretty fast with Jo?\u201d I asked it with a slight hint of a question in my tone, since I wasn\u2019t too sure if that was the point she\u2019d been trying to make.</p><p>\u201cA little. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Absolutely. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d And I did. However, my gut told me Cam was a good guy. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing. In fact, I pretty much think he\u2019s the best thing that could have ever happened to her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellie shrugged. \u201cI like him. I do. I just don\u2019t want Jo to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cSince when did you get so . . . normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal?\u201d she glared at me. \u201cYou mean unromantic? I do realize there are times when romance needs to take a back burner to reality. Jo\u2019s had it tough. As much as I think Cam\u2019s great and as much as I\u2019m rooting for them, I hope he really is going to be there for her. Taking her home to meet his parents this weekend? He\u2019s telling her he\u2019s serious. I hope he means it.\u201d</p> <p>Although Ellie\u2019s caution surprised me, I understood where she was coming from. Our friend Jo had been messed around by too many guys because she\u2019d chosen them for the wrong reason. Struggling to look after her little brother and her alcoholic mother, Jo always chose men who had financial security. Cam wasn\u2019t one of those guys. He was a struggling graphic designer who\u2019d gotten a job as a bartender alongside me and Jo at Club 39, this swanky little basement bar on George Street. The sparks had started flying as soon as they met, though, and Jo had finally set aside all her silly little dating rules to take a chance on a man who seemed to want her for her.</p><p>Despite understanding Ellie\u2019s reservations, I didn\u2019t share them and finally I found myself being distracted from my own boyfriend as I tried to convince Ellie. \u201cI think he\u2019s serious. I think they have a connection. There\u2019s no way to slow that down when you just fit with someone like that. If I hadn\u2019t been so stubborn with Braden, we probably would have been a done deal within a few weeks of meeting each other.\u201d</p><p>A mysterious, secretive smile flirted with Ellie\u2019s lips.</p><p>What the . . . ?</p><p>\u201cWhat? Am I missing something? Did I say something funny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered hurriedly, eyes drifting up over the old Evangelical church. Abruptly she stopped. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is here?\u201d I looked around. There were no vintage shoes in sight.</p><p>Ellie glanced at her watch and then out at the traffic on the cross junction, then back at her watch, then back at the road . . .</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d My heart started to thump as the day\u2019s events began to fall into place, like pieces of a puzzle. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide when they hit mine.</p><p>\u201cJesus C, Ellie, what is it? You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d</p> <p>For once, however, her lips were tightly sealed. Literally. They were pinched closed so tightly the color was bleeding from them. Her eyes swung back out to the road and as I watched her shoulders deflate with relief, I followed her gaze.</p><p>She was smiling at an approaching black cab.</p><p>That excited, eyes-twinkling-bright-with-utter-joy smile swung my way. \u201cI\u2019m going to go now.\u201d</p><p>Uh . . .</p><p>I whirled around as she strode past me, heading back the way we\u2019d just come.</p><p>Baffled, I threw my hands up. \u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>She was still grinning as she looked back at me over her shoulder. She pointed behind me and I turned back to see the black cab had pulled up to the curb beside me.</p><p>The door swung open and I was greeted by a surprising but always very welcome sight.</p> <p>My boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cBraden?\u201d I gave him a quizzical smile as he leaned toward me. He was wearing one of his fitted, expensive three-piece suits I loved. This one was a dark gray and was molded perfectly to his broad shoulders and fit physique. The sight of him sitting in the cab in that suit on this spot where we first met\u2014</p><p>My heartbeat skittered to a stop as I finally processed the intensity in his gaze and the fact that the floor of the cab he was sitting in was strewn with dark red rose petals. Fuckity, fuckity, shit, fuck. His distraction this morning, his shooing me out of our room . . . it all added up and the breath just whooshed right out of me at the realization of what this meant.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he said, his voice low, brokering no argument.</p><p>Limbs trembling, I took his offered hand, ducked my head, and let him settle me close to him on the cab bench. \u201cBraden, what is . . .\u201d My words trailed off as he held up a gray suede ring box.</p><p>Everything around me stopped.</p><p>There was no cab, no rose petals, no nosy cabdriver grinning at us in the rearview mirror, no traffic going by . . . nothing but Braden and a ring box that symbolized so much to me.</p><p>Years ago I\u2019d lost everything that meant anything to me.</p><p>Losing that left me lost.</p><p>Until Braden.</p><p>I\u2019d given him the fight of his life when he\u2019d tried to convince me that loving him was the best thing for the both of us, but when he won, when I eventually realized the truth in that, I knew our path wouldn\u2019t always be smooth. I\u2019d thought if this moment ever came, I\u2019d be searching for a brown paper bag to stem my panic attack. To my utter surprise, I felt no such thing. Yes, the fear was there. The fear of giving in . . . only to lose him to life\u2019s unpredictability. However, greater than the fear was my excitement. My excitement that this impossible, too-perceptive-for-his-own-good, arrogant, stubborn, kind, caring, sexy man was about to ask me to spend the rest of my life with him.</p><p>Braden\u2019s pale blue eyes shone with emotion as he flipped open the ring box to reveal an elegantly simple platinum band with a princess-cut diamond perched upon a raised prong with a small diamond nestled on either side of it.</p><p>It was so me.</p><p>Shit, he knew me so well. Do not cry, do not cry!</p><p>\u201cJocelyn,\u201d his voice was rough, like he was struggling to get the words out. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. My everything. I love you and I want to be with you always. Marry me. I promise to try not to fuck it up if you promise to try not to fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, tears falling without my say-so as I nodded, completely unable to speak. Braden grinned huge and I reached for him, needing to feel his mouth on mine. My tears mingled with our heated kiss and when he finally let me go, we were both a little out of breath. He took hold of my trembling hand and slipped the ring on my finger. We both stared at the diamond glittering on my left hand. My stomach and heart were jumping all over the place.</p><p>Threading my fingers through his, I clasped his hand tight and stared into his beloved face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered hoarsely. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite person.\u201d The tears blurred in my eyes again. \u201cAnd if you ever tell anyone I cried during this moment I will withhold sex for a year.\u201d</p><p>His warm, husky laughter spread through me as he wrapped his arms around me, hauling me close. I tightened my own arms around his shoulders, shivering with delicious anticipation as he murmured against my mouth, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>Cocky, arrogant caveman. \u201cMarriage will drive the cockiness right out of you,\u201d I murmured back.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019ll drive the cockiness out of me is you faking an orgasm. And I don\u2019t see that happening any time soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I nuzzled my nose against his, the tingling between my legs growing more insistent. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a point there, Mr. Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Carmichael, I do believe I\u2019m tipsy,\u201d I threw him a wonky smile over my shoulder as I turned the key in our door.</p><p>We\u2019d just returned from having celebratory drinks with Ellie and Adam. Honestly, I think Braden and I would have preferred a quiet night in together on the night of our engagement, but Ellie was having none of that, and Alistair, my colleague at Club 39, had given us two bottles of champagne on discount, so I wasn\u2019t complaining. It had been a fun night.</p><p>As I pushed the door open, I felt Braden\u2019s strong hands on my hips and his warm breath on my ear as he asked softly, \u201cTipsy or drunk?\u201d</p><p>I grinned, stepping into our flat with him close at my back. \u201cTipsy.\u201d</p><p>It was true. I was feeling a little giddy and more talkative than usual, but my vision was clear and my coordination was intact.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>Turning around, I reached past him and shoved our door shut, leaning my breasts into his chest as I turned the lock. I was still grinning as I tipped my head back to meet his heated gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019m sober enough to fuck but drunk enough for it to be especially hot, the answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>Braden fought a smile. \u201cHave I ever told you how much I love that filthy mouth of yours?\u201d</p><p>Yes, on many occasions. \u201cWell, I hope so,\u201d I teased, \u201cbecause it\u2019s going to be your filthy mouth for a long time to come.\u201d I smoothed my hand up over his hard chest. \u201cSpeaking of coming . . .\u201d</p><p>His hand on my hip tightened, drawing my eyes back to his. To my surprise he\u2019d gone from teasing to intense. I knew that look well. My fianc\u00e9 was in the mood to play \u201ccaveman.\u201d I shivered, feeling my breasts swell with arousal. \u201cStrip,\u201d he uttered quietly, deadly serious.</p><p>The tingles started. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>He nodded to the space in front of him, smack-bang in the middle of our hallway. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut I get to be bossy tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The intensity in his eyes lightened for a second as he gave me a little nod of acquiescence. Of course he would acquiesce to that. My version of sexually bossy was insisting on being on top and although it wasn\u2019t Braden\u2019s favorite sexual position, he certainly enjoyed it and the view.</p><p>Eyes locked, I took a few careful steps backward until there was enough distance between us for him to enjoy the show. I shrugged out of my light blazer first, letting it pool at my feet, and then I reached for the first button on my black sleeveless silk shirt.</p><p>\u201cEverything but the ring,\u201d Braden murmured, his expression all smoldering as he leaned back against our front door, crossing his arms over his chest, and one ankle over the other. His pose said casual, possibly even bored. His eyes, however, were burning my not-even-naked-yet skin.</p><p>I shivered at his command, my own gaze dropping to the glitter on the fourth finger of my left hand. Braden had a possessive streak. He hadn\u2019t even known he had one until he met me. The thought of me with someone else cut him, just like the thought of him with someone else cut me. It was part of the undeniable connection between us. More than that, I\u2019d made it hard for him to win me over. That had not been intentional, believe me. I got the impression, however, that winning me over not only brought Braden peace, but it made him feel a bit like a conqueror. Not that he would ever admit it, but I knew my fianc\u00e9, and he definitely had caveman mentality. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thus, I knew that having me stand before him, wearing nothing but the symbol of my promise to be only his for the rest of always, was a huge turn-on for him. And that meant it was a huge turn-on for me.</p><p>My fingers drifted from my buttoned shirt to the studs in my ears. I took them out and reached over to the sideboard, the sound of metal clinking against wood as I dropped them there filling the hallway. I then removed the necklace I was wearing, followed by my watch. Once all the jewelry but the ring was off, I went back to my shirt.</p><p>Braden\u2019s pale eyes were already blazing.</p> <p>I kept mine on him as I slowly unbuttoned my shirt, shrugging my shoulders so the fabric would slip down my arms and flutter to the ground.</p><p>The zip on my pencil skirt was next. I slid it down in increments, enjoying the way the muscle in Braden\u2019s jaw flexed at the sound. My eyes lowered.</p><p>He was hard already.</p><p>My nipples tightened and I felt my breath hitch with anticipation.</p><p>Once my skirt fell to the ground, I stepped out of it, marveling at my own stability. I was still tipsy, and tipsy, four inch heels, and good balance usually didn\u2019t go hand in hand. Thankfully, I kept my grace and I bent down to slip the heels off. Flat on my feet, I lifted my eyes to watch Braden again as I reached behind me for the clasp of my bra. I unhooked it but slowly peeled the straps down, teasing the fabric away from my body.</p> <p>Goose bumps erupted over my breasts and areolas, my nipples hardening to little points. Braden\u2019s hard-on pressed against his suit pants and I hid a pleased smile. For someone who had dated a lot of women with small chests, Braden certainly was obsessed with my D-cups. He had gone from being a leg man to a boob man.</p><p>Not that he didn\u2019t like my legs, because he definitely liked those too.</p><p>Unconsciously I licked my lips, watching his eyes flare as I gently pushed down my panties. They were damp with my arousal. I was dying for Braden to touch me, to feel how wet I was with only his eyes on my body.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked quietly, my voice thick.</p><p>His eyes burned a path that touched every inch of me. \u201cLet down your hair.\u201d</p><p>I smirked at him as I reached up and unpinned my hair, letting the mass of waves fall heavily down my back. I threw the pins on the sideboard and massaged my head, my breasts rising provocatively with the movement. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p> <p>He stood up from the door, his relaxed pose gone as he replied in his low, rumbling tones, \u201cNow walk into the bedroom, lie on your back on the bed, stretch your arms above your head, spread your legs, and prepare to take me. Hard and deep.\u201d</p><p>Desire shot through my belly and straight to my core at the imagery. I had to admit I loved how confident and commanding Braden was in bed. Still, I couldn\u2019t allow him to be too bossy. \u201cIf I\u2019m spreading my legs for you, I want your mouth between them before anything else.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a slight smile and a knowing nod. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I smiled saucily back at him and turned around, feeling a surge of empowerment at the sound of his indrawn breath.</p><p>As I walked toward our bedroom he said, \u201cLater, I want you on your stomach and that gorgeous arse in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst your mouth,\u201d I replied before disappearing inside our room.</p><p>My heart was beating fast with excitement as I crawled onto our cool sheets, reached across, and flicked on the bedside lamp before turning on my back, stretching my arms above my head, and spreading my legs.</p><p>My whole body shivered at being in such a position.</p> <p>Eyes on the door, my pulse raced as Braden appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed, moving toward me, stripping much more quickly out of his clothes than I had done. \u201cHow did I get so fucking lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a very good boy this year,\u201d I teased.</p><p>He smiled devilishly in the low light as he pushed his pants and boxer briefs down. My hungry gaze settled on his huge, throbbing erection as he moved on to the bed, his beautiful hands sliding up my spread legs. \u201cAnd have you been a good girl, Jocelyn?\u201d</p><p>I tilted my hips up, telling him silently I wanted his mouth on me and I wanted it on me now before I combusted. \u201cYes,\u201d I breathed. \u201cI haven\u2019t made any grown men cry this year. I\u2019d call it an improvement upon last. Now give me your tongue.\u201d</p><p>His hands gripped my thighs. \u201cWho\u2019s in charge here?\u201d</p><p>Despite having started the teasing, I was losing patience. I knew one way to speed things up. \u201cJust put your mouth on me, Braden, please.\u201d</p><p>His growl was the last thing I heard before his head descended and his tongue parted my labia. I rocked against it, feeling the build start as he circled my clit over and over before sucking it between his lips. My panted pleas for more filled the apartment, my fingers curling into the sheets as his tongue drew down and entered me.</p><p>\u201cBraden,\u201d I gasped, my hands automatically reaching for his hair.</p><p>This halted him immediately. \u201cHands back,\u201d he demanded, looking up at me with fire in his eyes.</p><p>I instantly did what he asked and Braden returned to tormenting me.</p><p>Just when I was on the brink of orgasm, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I panted as he moved up my body. He\u2019d promised me his mouth first.</p><p>He threaded his fingers through mine, holding my hands firmly to the mattress. I felt his thumb rub over my engagement ring as our eyes held. \u201cI want the first time you come as my fianc\u00e9 to be around my cock.\u201d</p><p>My inner muscles squeezed and my reaction was surprisingly docile. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As his mouth moved over mine, he thrust into me.</p><p>It was hard. It was deep. And it was beautiful.</p><p>Just like always.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Mission Accomplished</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of quitting Club 39,\u201d I called out to Braden from the bedroom. He\u2019d gotten home from work earlier than usual and was in the kitchen making us coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he called back. \u201cI thought you liked it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my laptop, deciding to go back later to the chapter I was working on. It wasn\u2019t very often Braden finished a workday at five o\u2019clock, and I was determined to take advantage of that fact.</p><p>Wandering into the kitchen, I drew to a stop at the sight of the table. Braden\u2019s laptop was open, surrounded by papers and clippings. \u201cUm . . .\u201d I looked up at him as he stirred sugar into his coffee. \u201cI\u2019m sick of missing out on the weekends with you, and Jo\u2019s leaving, so . . .\u201d I gestured to the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>He handed me my coffee. \u201cWedding plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding plans?\u201d</p><p>Braden sat down in front of his laptop and nodded at me to take the seat beside him. \u201cI said I\u2019d organize this thing and you said you\u2019d help. I\u2019m not finalizing anything until I get your opinion.\u201d</p><p>Since I was more than grateful he\u2019d decided to take over the wedding plans from Ellie, who was determined to pinkify our wedding, I had agreed to help Braden. Sipping my coffee I sat down and stared at everything. It didn\u2019t look like much, but our decisions were worth thousands of pounds, so we needed to be sure. We\u2019d decided to split the wedding costs, which I thought was very evolved of my fianc\u00e9 considering his tendency toward caveman mentality.</p><p>\u201cSo what have we got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church is booked, but we have to make a decision on the reception venue.\u201d Braden turned the laptop toward me. \u201cI like the Balmoral Hotel. I\u2019ve priced it. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I was looking over the PDF the hotel had sent him when our doorbell rang, followed by the sound of it opening. That either meant it was Ellie or Adam.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d Ellie called. \u201cBefore I come any farther, are you both dressed?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I assured her we were. Somewhere along the way she\u2019d gotten the impression that Braden and I didn\u2019t do anything together but have wild monkey sex.</p><p>His sister appeared in the doorway, smiling broadly. She held up a bag of delicious-smelling food. \u201cBraden told me about the wedding plans. I brought Indian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though I fired you from the wedding plans, I\u2019m going to let you stay because you brought takeout.\u201d I slid out of my seat to help her plate up the food.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She smiled sheepishly. \u201cBut it\u2019s exciting. I just wanted to be here to see what decisions you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo refuting those decisions,\u201d Braden muttered, eyeing her sternly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ended up as the wedding planner in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good.\u201d She promised. \u201cOh, I brought you these.\u201d She shoved a white plastic bag at me as I fumbled with a plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked warily.</p><p>\u201cCandles.\u201d Ellie shrugged out of her jacket. \u201cThis place is so bare since I moved out. I thought those might make it a bit homier.\u201d</p><p>Sharing an amused look with Braden, I put the bag on the counter. Ellie was known to like clutter. Her idea of bare wasn\u2019t a normal person\u2019s idea of bare. \u201cWe\u2019re minimalist. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d Ellie cooed over Braden\u2019s shoulder as she tilted the laptop screen. \u201cThe Balmoral? What do you think, Joss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I replied honestly, having already decided after looking at the photos that I was just going to agree to Braden\u2019s ideas. It would make the process a lot less of a headache, and it wasn\u2019t like we didn\u2019t share the same taste.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I approached him with a plate of curry and rice, my eyes dipping to the floor. My gaze caught on Ellie\u2019s feet. I tried and failed not to smile as I asked Els, \u201cSweetie, have you looked at your feet lately?\u201d</p><p>Wrinkling her nose in confusion, Ellie looked down. She sighed. \u201cBugger.\u201d</p><p>Curious, Braden looked down too after accepting his plate from me and immediately choked on his bite of curry.</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Ellie was wearing two different shoes. They were flats of a similar style, but one was definitely brown and the other black. \u201cI\u2019ve been wandering all day over New Town like this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI doubt many people noticed your feet, Els.\u201d</p><p>She kicked off her shoes and we all settled around the table, eating and planning. Well, Braden had done all the planning, so it was mostly just me nodding my head to his suggestions and covering Ellie\u2019s mouth when she got too vocal in her opinions over the flowers.</p><p>We were just winding down when Ellie\u2019s phone rang. It was Adam, requesting her company, although from the way she blushed I doubted the request was that polite or lacking in sexual innuendo.</p> <p>She got up hurriedly, giving me a smile and her brother a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThis was fun. Thanks for letting me crash it. Speak soon!\u201d She floated out of the kitchen, in her mind already out of the flat and with Adam.</p><p>\u201cTell Adam I said hey!\u201d I called to her.</p><p>\u201cWill do!\u201d The door slammed in her wake.</p><p>I pushed my plate away, cupping my chin in my palm as I smiled at Braden. \u201cThank you for doing all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d His smile turned into a yawn. He ran a hand through his hair, looking exhausted. \u201cThe only thing left to plan is the hen and stag nights.\u201d</p> <p>A hen party was what the Brits called a bachelorette party, and a stag night a bachelor party. \u201cWon\u2019t Ellie and Adam be organizing those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, at least that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cThat\u2019s okay for you to say. I doubt Adam is going to arrange an elegant tea party for yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Braden grinned. \u201cCasino night.\u201d</p><p>I pouted. \u201cI want a casino night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a casino night. I\u2019ll get Adam to nudge Ellie in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t end up in the same place for our parties.\u201d</p><p>Braden leaned toward me, his gaze curious. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the question since I thought the answer was pretty straightforward, I blinked a few times. \u201cUh, because it\u2019s supposed to be a symbolic evening where we celebrate our last night of singledom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not single. We\u2019re married without the certificate. Let\u2019s change the symbolism of it. We\u2019ll celebrate together. We\u2019ll celebrate how we mean to go on for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>I loved the way he looked at me. So full of . . . everything. \u201cYou could charm the pants off absolutely anyone,\u201d I told him quietly.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI take it that means you like the idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the idea. I love everything you\u2019ve said. But I know Ellie\u2019s excited about this, so we\u2019re going to give our friends what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam mentioned strippers,\u201d Braden warned me, his eyes twinkling.</p> <p>\u201cIf Adam books a stripper for you, I\u2019ll force Ellie to book a stripper for me.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Braden relaxed back in his chair. \u201cLet\u2019s agree to no strippers.\u201d</p><p>I raised my glass of water and waited for Braden to do the same. \u201cTo no strippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo no strippers,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s just make that a motto for our marriage.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Braden nodded. \u201cI can guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>I gestured to our plans and gave him a smile. \u201cSo are we done for the night? Can we lounge in front of a movie now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Together, we cleaned our dishes and cleared the wedding plans away. Half an hour later we lay on the sofa together, my head on Braden\u2019s chest, his arm around my back, as we watched an action movie on pay-per-view.</p><p>Forty minutes in, I tilted my head back to look into his face and said, \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t believe that I get to do this with you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Surprised at my sentiment, Braden looked at me, eyes glittering with amusement. \u201cWhat? Watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answered honestly. \u201cLie in your arms and watch a crappy movie. It might seem simple to other people, but it\u2019s everything to me.\u201d</p><p>The amusement left his expression, quickly replaced with something far more intense as he reached up to stroke my cheek with his thumb. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re quitting the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve never liked you working there, and I miss you at the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you seemed happy. It\u2019s sort of my life mission to make sure you stay that way,\u201d he teased.</p><p>I grinned. \u201cGotcha. Well, mission accomplished. I have lots of new friends, so I don\u2019t need the bar for a social life anymore. And I want to concentrate on my writing and on us. I\u2019ll hand in my resignation this week.\u201d</p><p>Braden nodded and squeezed me closer. \u201cSounds good, babe.\u201d</p><p>Snuggling into him, I let out a contented sigh and turned my gaze back on the movie. \u201cPfft.\u201dI mocked the screen as we soaked in each other\u2019s warmth. \u201cLike a cop would start shooting in a public place like that. What is this crap we\u2019re watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about \u2018everything to you,\u2019 I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph. Well, it will be if we become a little more discerning in our rental choices. Oh, God,\u201d I groaned at the screen. \u201cThis guy is a tool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJocelyn?\u201d Braden tightened his arm around me and I looked up at him to find him grinning. \u201cJust so you know, this is everything to me too.\u201d He bent down to give me a sweet kiss before turning back to the television. \u201cPerhaps minus the commentary from the peanut gallery.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The Wedding</p><p>Clark, Ellie\u2019s stepdad, and thus father figure to Braden and me, threaded my arm through his elbow and patted my hand in a comforting way.</p><p>At the gesture, I glanced sharply at his kind face. \u201cWhat? Do I look nervous?\u201d</p><p>He smiled softly at me. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look nervous,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>Although his mouth didn\u2019t laugh, his eyes definitely did. \u201cJust take a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>We were standing out of view of the double doors that had opened up onto the red-carpeted aisle of the church and my bridesmaids were already walking their way up it. It was nearly my turn.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe our wedding day was here already. It didn\u2019t seem that long ago that I\u2019d woken up the day after my engagement to Ellie knocking on my door with a bunch of bridal magazines in her hands. Although I\u2019d had moments of doubt, I\u2019d fiercely fought them back.</p><p>It was kind of a shock then to find myself standing at the bottom of the aisle, freaking out.</p><p>Fuckity, fuckity, fuck, fuck.</p><p>Deep breaths.</p><p>I could not have a panic attack. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Braden. The problem was I was terrified I was going to find some way to fuck it up. Even after months of proving to myself that I was capable of being in a committed, loving relationship, I was still afraid. I was afraid I was going to hurt him.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I mess this up?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Clark\u2019s hand tightened over mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be perfect because no marriage is. You\u2019re going to fight, clash, say things you don\u2019t mean . . . When you love someone, these things can happen. But, Joss\u201d\u2014he dipped his head to meet my gaze\u2014\u201cthe good you two will have together, will always outweigh any bad.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd I think Braden\u2019s proved there\u2019s not much you can do to chase him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I squeezed his hand and took a shuddering, deep breath. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>The strains of the guitarist and violinist grew louder as the double doors swung open, their beautiful instrumental version of Paul Weller\u2019s \u201cYou Do Something to Me\u201d sending shivers up my neck. We stepped out onto the carpeted aisle of the church and at first all I could see was the flowers, the guests who had turned to stare at me, their approving smiles, their curiosity. At the squeeze of Clark\u2019s hand around mine where I clutched fiercely to my bouquet of white lilies interspersed with thin reeds of champagne gold, I began to focus. My eyes found my bridesmaids, Ellie, Hannah, Jo, Rhian, and Liv, dressed in their floor-length champagne-colored dresses, looking elegant and happy. The closer we got I could see Ellie was tearing up. I caught Elodie in the front pews along with Cam; Cole; Jo\u2019s Uncle Mick; his new girlfriend, Dee; Cam\u2019s best friends, Nate and Peetie; and Peetie\u2019s girlfriend, Lyn. I didn\u2019t have any family here so we\u2019d decided not to divide the room into groom and bride sides. Still, there were just my colleagues from Club 39. Everyone else was associates or friends of Braden and the Nichols family. And of course his vapid socialite mother hadn\u2019t turned up. She was feeling under the weather. More like we\u2019d met at Christmas last year and I\u2019d made my distaste for her clear and vice versa.</p><p>My eyes found Adam and Dec, who were standing on the opposite side of the altar. They wore the same as Clark and Braden\u2014what was referred to as a Prince Charlie gray jacket and matching three-button waistcoat. Their silk champagne ties were intricately knotted against their dark gray shirts, and because the Carmichaels were associated with the Stewart clan they were wearing a subdued Stewart gray tartan. Adam\u2019s kind, bolstering smile finally made me look at Braden.</p><p>I almost faltered on the walk up the aisle.</p><p>The look in his eyes was like a physical pressure on my chest. The love there caused my throat to constrict and I leaned more heavily against Clark as I attempted to float toward Braden in my wedding dress. My dress was simple. It was strapless with a heart-shaped neckline, and the upper half of the bodice was ivory with crystal beading and lace. The finest white silk chiffon pulled across the bodice in a tight drape, fitted to my waist. From my hips the layers of chiffon, shot through with silver, fell to the floor in simple elegance. I could tell by the look on Braden\u2019s face as Clark and I approached that he liked the dress.</p><p>Still shaking, I kissed Clark on the cheek, so honored that he\u2019d walked me down the aisle in absence of my father. I thanked him sincerely, almost choking up at the sheen of wetness in his eyes as he handed me over to Braden. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead of turning me to face the minister, Braden took my hand and pulled me into his side, his eyes burning intensely into mine. His head lowered and I felt his warm breath on my ear, \u201cYou look stunning, sweetheart, but deep breaths. This is just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to the hundred people sitting behind us,\u201d I told him a little shakily.</p><p>He chuckled, pressing an amused kiss to my mouth.</p> <p>When he pulled back, Braden\u2019s expression was reassuring as he murmured against my lips, \u201cI love you, you love me, our family loves us and they\u2019re right here beside us. Nothing else matters. So no fears for the future, no fear that you\u2019ll fuck it up beyond repair. Life isn\u2019t perfect, we aren\u2019t perfect, but I\u2019m telling you now, Jocelyn, we\u2019re indestructible. Stop shaking, and just marry me.\u201d</p><p>I pressed deeper into him, brushing my mouth over his. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>The minister cleared his throat, drawing my and my smiling groom\u2019s attention back to the ceremony and out of the little bubble we\u2019d been in. I heard our guests titter behind us and the music stopped.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>There was something a little surreal about sitting next to Braden at the top table, my wedding band sitting prettily against my engagement ring, everyone referring to us as husband and wife, and people being cute and calling me Mrs. Carmichael instead of Joss. It was weird. But the good kind of weird.</p> <p>Our wedding reception was held at the Balmoral Hotel. The banquet suite was this grand hall with tall ceilings, pillars, elaborate chandeliers, and huge arched windows with views of Edinburgh Castle. It was stunning and classy and beyond anything I\u2019d ever imagined for this moment.</p><p>After dinner, Clark tapped his champagne flute, drawing everyone\u2019s attention as he stood up to give his father-of-the-bride speech. I\u2019d told him he didn\u2019t have to, but he said he wanted to. And watching how comfortable he was as he lifted the mic, I knew as a university professor he wasn\u2019t that daunted having to talk to a large crowd of people.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to expect from Clark\u2019s speech. I felt butterflies in my stomach as he smiled down at Braden and me.</p><p>\u201cBraden is one of the finest men I know.\u201d He began. \u201cHe\u2019s a son to me. And he\u2019s a friend. So when it became clear that what he and Joss had together was something special, I couldn\u2019t have been more delighted for him. Because Jocelyn is without a doubt one of the strongest, most extraordinary young women I have ever met.\u201d</p><p>Jesus C.</p><p>I swallowed past the hard lump of emotion in my throat, leaning into Braden, who automatically wrapped an arm around me without my even having to ask.</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry that your dad can\u2019t be here with you on this day, Joss,\u201d Clark continued, his voice low with enough emotion that it threatened to spill the tears over my lids, \u201cbut I know that he would be so proud of you for the woman you\u2019ve become, and so happy that you\u2019ve found a family in Braden, and in us. I was honored to walk down the aisle with you for him. Tonight\u201d\u2014he lifted his glass, turning to our guests\u2014\u201cI ask you all to raise your glasses to my son and daughter. To Braden and Jocelyn.\u201d</p><p>As everyone said our names in unison, lifting their glasses to us, I fought back the tears. Just barely.</p><p>The truth was I did feel part of the Nichols\u2019s family. But it was kind of more than a little beautiful that the Nichols family thought of me as part of them.</p><p>Next to stand up was Adam as Braden\u2019s best man. He lightened the mood, joking about his and Braden\u2019s past, about Braden\u2019s reputation with women, how different he was with me, and how much fun he had had watching Braden work his ass off to get me. Upon Adam raising his glass to us in toast, Braden kissed me, waited for his best man to sit down, and then stood up himself.</p><p>I looked up at him. More than anything I wanted the reception to be over; I wanted to not be center of attention anymore. Mostly, I just really wanted to be alone in a room with my new husband.</p><p>Braden stood tall in his kilt, looking every inch the delectable Scotsman, and he stared out at the room with a familiar air of intimidating confidence. \u201cOver two and a half years ago,\u201d he began, his voice deep, his tone serious, \u201cI shared a taxi with a complete stranger. A young woman with a smart mouth and\u201d\u2014he smirked down at me\u2014\u201ca great pair of legs.\u201d</p><p>The guests chuckled as I shook my head slightly at him, a small smile playing on my lips.</p><p>\u201cI knew then,\u201d Braden spoke loudly to the guests, but his eyes remained on my face, \u201cmy life had changed. I just wouldn\u2019t know until you walked out of Ellie\u2019s bathroom without a towel on how happy I was with that coming change.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes, feeling my cheeks burn as everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d Braden turned back to them. \u201cThe second time we met, Jocelyn was starkers. Up to that point it was the best day of my life.</p><p>\u201cEven after being caught in the buff she gave me attitude.\u201d He grinned down at me again, and I felt the warmth inside my chest turn into a burn of overwhelming emotion. \u201cYou\u2019ve challenged me since the day I met you. No woman has ever challenged me more. Nor made me laugh harder. There is not a moment that passes where you don\u2019t make me feel more alive than I ever thought I could, and today you gave me something I thought was lost a long time ago for the both of us. You\u2019ve given me peace, babe. You\u2019ve given me everything.\u201d The timber of his voice had deepened with emotion and I swear to God I was close to bawling my eyes out as he lifted a glass of champagne from the table and raised it in the air. \u201cTo my wife, Mrs. Jocelyn Carmichael.\u201d</p><p>The guests repeated his words as he bent down to me, his eyes warming at the sight of my unshed tears. \u201cTo my wife,\u201d he murmured again, cupping a hand behind my nape to bring my lips to his.</p><p>While making the rounds of the reception, attempting to stop to chat with all our guests, the unsettled fluttering in my stomach had called a cease-fire and I was feeling a lot more relaxed. The champagne was helping.</p><p>I stood by Braden\u2019s side while he introduced me to distant cousins, relatives of Elodie and Clark, friends and business associates. We\u2019d nearly made our way through the entire guest list when we came upon Jenna and Ed. Jenna was one of Ellie\u2019s friends and Ed was her husband. When I\u2019d first met Ellie, Jenna and Ed had been a close part of their group, but after their wedding Jenna fell pregnant and for some reason they stopped hanging out with a lot of their friends. Ellie had been a little put out at first but Jenna seemed more content to spend time with married friends who had children and I reassured Ellie that she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Some people were just like that. Still, it was nice to see them.</p><p>\u201cJoss, you look beautiful,\u201d Jenna said, giving me a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s looking after Andrew?\u201d Braden asked, referring to their baby boy.</p><p>Ed grinned. \u201cI talked my parents into babysitting tonight. We haven\u2019t had a real night off in God knows how long. I actually had to talk Jenna into coming here, into leaving him.\u201d</p><p>Jenna frowned at her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t like leaving him. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>Hearing the bite in her tone, I shot Braden a look that suggested we should move along.</p><p>He nodded at me and turned to speak but Jenna cut him off by jerking me toward her.</p><p>\u201cSo, when are you thinking about having a baby, Joss?\u201d</p><p>The Jenna I knew was chilled out, down-to-earth, uninquisitive. Whoever this was, I wanted to kill her. \u201cUh . . .\u201d I glanced around the room, looking for help.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a proper talk about it,\u201d Braden offered, his hand resting on my lower back in a way that suggested he knew I was about to run away. \u201cBut kids are definitely in the plans.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders tensed, my stomach cramped, and the champagne sloshed unpleasantly in my stomach.</p><p>This morning I\u2019d been optimistic as I\u2019d looked at myself in the mirror. I\u2019d thought about my mini meltdown I\u2019d had a few weeks ago when Braden first mentioned having kids. I\u2019d thought that it was something I\u2019d get over.</p><p>But once again, the thought of children paralyzed me.</p><p>Worse, the thought that Braden believed they were in our immediate future paralyzed me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have kids yet. I wasn\u2019t emotionally ready for that. No. I definitely wasn\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s Alistair and his girlfriend.\u201d I pointed over Ed\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI better go say hello.\u201d I pulled away from Braden\u2019s touch and almost sprinted from them, two steps from Alistair when a strong arm wrapped itself around my waist and hauled me about.</p><p>I crashed against Braden\u2019s hard chest, blinking up at him in surprise. \u201cWas that necessary?\u201d</p><p>My husband frowned at me. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head in denial. \u201cI just . . . Jenna bothers me a little now. I just wanted to get away.\u201d</p><p>As Braden searched my face, I wondered if he believed me. In the end I didn\u2019t know if he did or not. But he let it go, bending down to press a soft kiss to my mouth. It was our wedding.</p><p>No fighting allowed.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The Honeymoon\u2014Part 1</p><p>\u201cDoes that say what I think it says?\u201d I asked, leaning my cheek against Braden\u2019s upper arm. With his hand clasped in mine, I stood next to him before the departures board in Edinburgh Airport quietly excited about our honeymoon to Hawaii, and trying not to be deflated by the information on the board.</p><p>Braden gave my hand a squeeze. \u201cYeah. Delayed.\u201d</p><p>Our flight was delayed by a few hours, which meant being stuck in the airport. Luckily Edinburgh wasn\u2019t grimy. In fact it was kind of shiny. We were surrounded by designer shops, restaurants, and an old-fashioned oval bar at one end of the international departure lounge. Still. It was an airport. As human beings we were genetically predisposed to hate them.</p><p>My husband let go of my hand to curl me into his side, his hand resting low on my opposite hip. \u201cDo you want to wait in the first-class lounge, get a drink there, or do you want to get a drink at the bar we just passed?\u201d he asked, absentmindedly pressing a kiss to my temple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was one of the things I loved about him. After having starved myself of affection for years it had taken me a while to get used to Braden\u2019s tactility but now I wouldn\u2019t know what to do without it. His affection for me came so easily he touched and kissed me all the time, even when he was half-distracted. I\u2019d gone from being uncomfortable with it, to expecting and coveting it.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I nodded, taking a reluctant step back. \u201cI need to go to the restroom. I\u2019ll meet you at the bar.\u201d</p><p>After I peed, I stood in front of the washstand, searching my face in the mirror. After the wedding Ellie had said I looked different. I hadn\u2019t known what she meant at the time but gazing at my reflection I had to wonder if it was something different about my eyes. They were gunmetal gray and tip tilted. They weren\u2019t warm, friendly eyes. I knew from photographs of myself that my eyes tended to come off intense, sometimes kind of bedroomy, even though most of the time it was unintended. The warmth only entered them in photographs that caught me laughing. However, staring into my eyes I could see a shift in them. The intensity hadn\u2019t totally left them, but there was definitely something new reflected there. Something good. Something warm.</p> <p>I ducked my head, smiling as I dried my hands.</p><p>My eyes dropped to my legs. They were bare in the sundress I\u2019d chosen to wear in anticipation of the hot weather in Hawaii. My olive skin was ready to deepen to a tan as I lazed by the pool for the next fourteen days. Vacations weren\u2019t something I ever bothered about because I\u2019d lost all that stuff when I lost my family. However, I\u2019d never been somewhere like Hawaii before. And I\u2019d be there with my hot husband.</p><p>Braden and I had busy lives. This was the first time we\u2019d spend a solid fourteen nights just enjoying each other\u2019s company with no interference from work or friends or family. Days by the pool or on the beach, and nights of hot, energetic sex.</p><p>My smile turned smug.</p><p>Strolling out into the departure lounge I wandered slowly toward the bar, glad at least not to be rushing around in a sweaty, flustered mess as some late passengers were. Eyes drifting over the quiet bar, I found Braden\u2019s back facing me as he sat on a stool. The female bartender kept throwing him surreptitious looks as she pretended to be busy.</p> <p>Braden wasn\u2019t a classically handsome guy, but he was rugged, sexy, very tall, well built, and he wore his suits better than an Armani model. Since the moment I\u2019d met him I\u2019d been struck by his natural confidence. It was hot. Even when it veered into arrogance, annoying the hell out of me, I still found it hot.</p><p>So it didn\u2019t surprise me that a lot of people found my husband attractive too.</p><p>When we first started our no-strings-attached relationship I\u2019d pretended not to care when I saw other women flirting with Braden. Afterwards, once I stopped putting him through the wringer and admitted that I loved him as much as he loved me, I\u2019d found it hard not to chase the obnoxious flirts away from him. In fact, sometimes I lost my cool and wasn\u2019t very diplomatic about telling those women that Braden was mine. Of course, he found this amusing and a total turn-on.</p><p>Not so much when the shoe was on the other foot.</p><p>Still, as our relationship had grown, so had my confidence in us, as had Braden\u2019s, and together we\u2019d mellowed somewhat. Not completely, but enough that right at that moment I didn\u2019t want to stride up to Braden in front of the bartender and stake my claim.</p><p>I was going on my honeymoon. I\u2019d taken a huge leap toward putting my issues behind me by even getting married. I was in a damn good mood.</p> <p>I wanted to play.</p><p>Hiding my mischievous grin, I smoothed my features until they were perfectly blank and sauntered toward the bar. However, I didn\u2019t take the stool next to Braden. My heels clicked on the hard, shiny floor as I sashayed onto a stool that gave me a good view of Braden . . . on the opposite side of the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you to drink?\u201d the female bartender asked politely.</p><p>\u201cA glass of red wine, please.\u201d</p><p>I felt Braden\u2019s eyes on me as the bartender turned to get me my drink. Flicking my gaze his way I saw his eyes dancing at my mischief.</p><p>He knew exactly what I was up to.</p><p>The bartender slid the glass of wine toward me as I attempted not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I greeted casually down the bar. \u201cI\u2019m Jocelyn.\u201d</p> <p>He eyed me for a moment with those intimidating, gorgeous pale blue eyes of his. And then he obviously decided to just go with it when he slipped out of his stool and made his way over to the one next to mine. He gave me a smirk as he reached out to take my hand in his. I felt his thumb rub over my wedding rings. \u201cBraden.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small, flirty smile. \u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really should say no.\u201d He held up his ring finger with his wedding band on it. \u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I hid my smile, feeling a rush of excitement go through me at our little game. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize. I take it your wife isn\u2019t with you this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Braden answered, his mouth twitching with definite amusement now as our eyes met.</p><p>Pretending we weren\u2019t at a bar in an airport but at home, my gaze turned heated in a way Braden understood. \u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d he glanced down at my left hand.</p><p>I turned my diamond so that it sparkled beautifully in the light. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m married too.\u201d</p><p>Eyes staring into mine again, Braden\u2019s reply was thick with a sincerity that somehow managed to be as emotional as it was sexual. \u201cHe\u2019s a very lucky man.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head flirtatiously. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hear.\u201d</p><p>Braden leaned into me and I knew he didn\u2019t even realize he was doing it.</p><p>My smile grew. \u201cSo can I buy you a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>The air was charged between us as he waited for my next move. I looked away and called the bartender over. After ordering him a drink, I waited to see if Braden would keep up the pretense with me.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you traveling to?\u201d he asked, his tone amused but slightly rough.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to look into his eyes to know he was aroused, but I looked anyway because I needed to.</p><p>\u201cHawaii.\u201d I pressed my leg against his thigh, wishing we weren\u2019t in a public place. I wanted his hands on me.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour drink.\u201d The bartender slid Braden\u2019s drink to him.</p><p>We took hold of our glasses and clinked them together.</p><p>\u201cBusiness or pleasure?\u201d I asked saucily.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m definitely hoping pleasure,\u201d he said as I took a sip of wine.</p><p>Slowly I licked a drop of wine off my lower lip, triumphing over the suffocated groan it produced from the back of Braden\u2019s throat. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Eyes still on my mouth, Braden\u2019s hand tightened around his glass. \u201cMy wife wouldn\u2019t be too pleased to find a strange woman flirting with me at a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your wife the jealous type?\u201d I teased.</p><p>My amusement was stifled by the intensity of our connection as our eyes held. \u201cShe can be,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I sucked in a breath. \u201cAre you the jealous type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cSo you\u2019re both a little possessive, huh? I don\u2019t suppose she\u2019d like what I\u2019m thinking about doing to you, either.\u201d</p><p>Braden ran his gaze over my face before replying. \u201cNo, she definitely wouldn\u2019t. But, you know . . . you remind me of my wife.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I pressed my leg harder against his. \u201cYeah, you remind me of my husband.\u201d</p><p>Eyes glittering with laughter, Braden asked, \u201cWhat would your husband do if he were here right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s a little possessive himself, but a gentleman, so he\u2019d be polite when he made it perfectly clear to you that I wasn\u2019t yours to flirt with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hear.\u201d</p><p>His laughter always made me feel like I\u2019d won something.</p><p>I stared, relishing everything about him. Slowly, his laughter faded and we were staring at each other like we were about to start going at it right there on the bar. \u201cThen what would he do?\u201d</p><p>The tingling between my legs flared to life and I felt my breasts swell against the thin material of my sundress. Shifting closer, inhaling his familiar scent, I wished we were somewhere we could do something about being this turned on.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cHe\u2019d probably kiss me. And then he\u2019d insist on hearing about all the things I\u2019m going to do to him when I get him alone.\u201d</p><p>Braden\u2019s eyes instantly darkened, his head descending toward mine before I could blink. His kiss was deep and hot, and I found myself clinging to him. I shivered at the feel of his hand sliding discreetly under my dress, his touch making my nipples pebble with need. I gasped breaking our kiss.</p><p>Barely cognizant of anything around us, I drew his ear to my lips. \u201cAs soon as I get you alone,\u201d I whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you fuck me as hard as you want.\u201d I then went on to elaborate until my breathing grew hitched, and the muscles in Braden\u2019s jaw were tense.</p><p>In fact, every line of his body was. His hand was clamped tightly around my thigh. I dropped my forehead to the side of his jaw, trying to control my breathing.</p><p>After a few very long minutes, Braden\u2019s grip on me loosened and he pulled me into a hug. I nuzzled his neck, feeling the burn of unsatisfied lust. \u201cSorry,\u201d I murmured against his skin.</p><p>He stroked my back in comfort. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It was hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo hot for an airport.\u201d</p><p>I felt him shake slightly, obviously laughing. \u201cProbably. I\u2019ll take care of you later, though. And, hey, at least you don\u2019t have a hard-on in public.\u201d</p><p>My turn to laugh now. Pulling back I glanced down at his lap, hidden under the bar, to see he was not lying. Glancing up into his face I said, \u201cYour mother. Naked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A look of distaste took the heat out of his eyes.</p><p>He took a swig of whiskey and eventually muttered, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at his lap. The erection was gone.</p> <p>Trying not to smile, I looked away casually and asked airily, \u201cWhat do you want to talk about until the flight is called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold wind. Sleet. The ugly doorman at Club 39. Porridge.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cYou mean anything that won\u2019t give you an erection?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, his eyes roaming my face lovingly. \u201cMaybe we should just stop talking altogether. And put a bag over your head. And cover your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can still smell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare move away from me and I\u2019ll put you over my knee, Wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d</p><p>Braden cut me a dirty look and I covered my mouth with my hand so he couldn\u2019t see my grin.</p><p>We were silent for a few minutes and then I leaned my elbow on the bar, resting my chin on my palm as I told him softly. \u201cI\u2019m loving our honeymoon so far.\u201d</p> <p>He took my other hand in his. \u201cI am too.\u201d</p><p>I shifted closer to him, resting my knee against his. \u201cDo you want to wait in the first-class lounge? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s filled with stuffy businessmen types who will certainly shatter the very sexual mood we\u2019ve got going on here with all their stiff-upper-lippishness.\u201d</p><p>Braden\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cStiff-upper-lippishness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStiff-upper-lippishness.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, laughing softly now as he got up out of the stool and helped me down from mine. Wrapping an arm around my waist, he said as he walked us toward the lounge, \u201cMaybe we should stop using the word \u2018stiff\u2019 since apparently being married to you means losing control over my body and any self-respect I might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrounds for divorce?\u201d I teased as we showed our boarding passes to an airline attendant at the lounge doors.</p><p>\u201cGrounds for a marathon fucking,\u201d he answered dryly, not caring that the airline attendant had turned purple at his reply. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to walk for a while when I\u2019m done with you,\u201d he continued, gently guiding me into the lounge, leaving the gasping attendant behind.</p><p>I determinedly tried not to show my embarrassment, as I was used to him sometimes saying hot, blush-inducing shit like that to me in public. The key was to not let him know he\u2019d flustered me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with that as long as we\u2019re talking multiple orgasms.\u201d</p><p>Three suits turned their heads toward me from the small bar in the lounge, their eyebrows raised.</p><p>Braden and I stopped and I felt his hand squeeze my hip. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get thrown out of the first-class lounge.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cYou started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you started it.\u201d</p><p>I heaved a sigh and glanced at my watch. \u201cWell, unfortunately we\u2019ve got about ten hours before we can finish it.\u201d</p><p>Not looking too happy about that, Braden\u2019s eyes swept the room, a glint entering them when they stalled on the restroom door.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said immediately.</p><p>He threw me that boyish grin that was very, very difficult to resist.</p><p>Shit, fuckity, shit, fuck.</p><p>\u201cBraden, no,\u201d I hissed. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can do that discreetly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraden\u2014\u201d</p><p>He let go of my hand. \u201cFollow me in after a minute.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand back. \u201cNo, we\u2019re acting like teenagers.\u201d</p><p>His grin widened as he leaned his head toward mine. \u201cWe\u2019re on our fucking honeymoon, babe, that\u2019s the whole point.\u201d He glanced back at the restroom and squeezed my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go and then you follow me after a minute. Pretend I\u2019m ill or something and you\u2019re just checking up on me.\u201d</p><p>Before I could refuse again, Braden strolled away from me, disappearing into the restroom.</p><p>I looked around the lounge. There were only four men in it and one woman and not one of them was watching me. Still . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in first class,\u201d I muttered, \u201cand I\u2019m going to get thrown out before I even hit the plane.\u201d</p><p>Frowning I waited what felt like a millennium but was only a few seconds and wandered over to the restroom door. Feeling like a total idiot I knocked on it and asked, \u201cBaby, you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>When no answer came, I slipped inside like I was a concerned spouse and nothing more.</p><p>We so couldn\u2019t be fooling anyone with that crap.</p><p>Once inside I discovered there were separate doors for men and women.</p><p>I knocked on the men\u2019s, and my knuckles had barely left the door before it opened wide enough for Braden to haul me inside, slam it shut, lock it, and press my back against it.</p><p>I slid my arms around his shoulders as he pressed his hard body against mine. \u201cWe\u2019re so getting kicked out of first class.\u201d</p><p>His hand caressed my ass before coasting down my thigh and then back up under my dress. His talented fingers slipped beneath my panties and he whispered hoarsely, \u201cThen let\u2019s make it worth it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The Honeymoon\u2014Part 2</p><p>From the moment we stepped into our plantation-style villa in the luxury resort Braden had booked for our honeymoon in the Pacific, I didn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>A few minutes\u2019 walk from the main resort, up a landscaped, lamp-lit path, sat our villa. A huge deck with a plunge pool and a cabana overlooked the ocean. Inside was a huge airy, beautiful living room with white furniture I was almost afraid to touch and a gorgeous bedroom with a four-poster bed draped in white voile and a walk-in-closet. The final touch of beauty was the marble bathroom, which must have been bigger than Olivia\u2019s entire flat.</p><p>Braden and I had been there for three days. We\u2019d spent our days lazing by our private pool, enjoying spectacular views that filled you with the kind of contentment I wished every day would bring. At night we\u2019d choose from one of the three amazing restaurants, head off to one of the bars to have a few drinks, and then we\u2019d head back to the villa where we made love for hours.</p><p>Best. Honeymoon. Ever.</p><p>For a change of scenery, we\u2019d left the villa on the third day and grabbed a couple of sun loungers under a cabana on the beach. Every now and then a courteous member of staff would approach us and ask us if we wanted anything to eat or drink while we both lay there, reading on our e-readers and soaking up the sun.</p><p>Just an hour before Braden had finally managed to coax me into the sea. I hadn\u2019t been too keen on entering the water, but it was so beautiful its tranquility and Braden\u2019s persistence finally got to me and I decided to wade in.</p><p>Lulled by Braden\u2019s patience, I was completely taken off guard when he dunked me.</p><p>You did not dunk Jocelyn Butler Carmichael and get away with it.</p><p>Thus commenced a water wrestling match that had children swimming out of the way to avoid us while their parents shot us dirty looks. Braden was cracking up. He would be. He was winning. It was only after he lifted me and cannonballed me into the water so hard that I almost lost my bikini top in front of the entire resort that he decided the game had hit its peak. I spluttered and coughed as he swam up to me and retied the strings of the bikini around my neck.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d I\u2019d slapped water at him, throwing him a mock-dirty look.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed my neck and wrapped his arms around my waist under the water. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>There really was no way to be crabby at an answer like that, so I\u2019d let him off the hook, letting him lead me back to our loungers where we were currently drying out. Braden was lying on his stomach, his tall body too big for the lounger, but he seemed comfortable enough. I had turned onto my side, watching him doze in the afternoon sun. Everything about the moment was perfect. From the sound of the water lapping gently to shore, the cries of happy kids, the soft chatter of couples, the smell of suntan lotion and seawater, the tiny flutter of my husband\u2019s lashes as he dreamed beside me . . .</p><p>I should be terrified.</p><p>It was a lot to lose.</p><p>That fear niggled at me and I determinedly pushed it back out.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d Braden asked quietly, eyes still closed against the sun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you relax for this long. It\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually nice to be relaxing.\u201d</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, I teased, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019re not missing keeping busy?\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened slowly, blinking in the sunlight. He shifted up onto his elbows. \u201cI have uninterrupted access to my wife for the next two weeks. Believe me, I\u2019m not missing a thing.\u201d</p><p>A delicious shiver rippled through me and I leaned over so my mouth was almost touching his. \u201cThem be fighting words.\u201d I brushed my lips against his. \u201cI think someone is trying to get into my bikini bottoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018trying\u2019?\u201d Braden grunted as he cupped his hand around the nape of my neck so his next words were muffled against my lips. I got the gist of it, though. Some cocky comment about having unhindered access to what was beneath my bikini bottoms. I bit his lip gently in retaliation, which only made him groan into my mouth and deepen the kiss.</p><p>Like always the world disappeared and I found myself balancing precariously half on, half off my lounger, clinging to Braden\u2019s biceps as he drugged me with kisses that still knocked me off-kilter.</p><p>The sound of a sharp, playful child\u2019s scream broke us apart, and I smiled ruefully as Braden brushed my lower lip with his thumb. He glanced over in the direction of the scream and my gaze followed his. A young boy was chasing what appeared to be his little sister, his delighted laughter and her mock-screams annoying a young couple that lazed near the spot of their antics.</p><p>Braden looked back at me. \u201cWe can return to the villa, lie by the pool, if the kids are bothering you.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, I shook my head. I didn\u2019t mind the kids. Their excitement and joy only added to the overall atmosphere of the resort. \u201cThe villa seems a long way away right now and I honestly don\u2019t mind the kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My reply caused Braden to tilt his head and ask in obvious surprise, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I snorted and lay back down. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p> <p>The smile in his voice for some reason caused my stomach to flip. And not in a good way. \u201cWhat\u2019s a good sign?\u201d I asked, not really sure if I wanted an answer or not.</p><p>\u201cYou. Not minding the kids.\u201d</p><p>Yup, I definitely didn\u2019t want the answer.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind the noise of other people\u2019s kids, then you\u2019ll definitely not mind the noise our kids will make.\u201d</p><p>He might as well have wrapped his hand around my throat. I tried to swallow past the constriction his words had caused and I knew I had to get up, walk away, do anything, so that I didn\u2019t have a panic attack. So it wouldn\u2019t be obvious he\u2019d freaked me out I waited as long as I could before saying, \u201cYou want a drink? I\u2019m going to get a drink.\u201d</p> <p>I felt his eyes on me as I shoved on my flip-flops and sunglasses, hurriedly tying my sarong around my waist. Not once did I look at him but I knew from his quiet, \u201cSure, babe,\u201d I hadn\u2019t been successful in keeping my freak-out to myself.</p><p>The whole time the bartender was making up our drinks the guilt clawed at me. I\u2019d left Braden back there wondering what the hell had happened and if I was shutting him out. That was something I\u2019d promised never to do to him again, and I had to keep that promise. With that in mind I took the drinks back to him and settled back onto my lounger.</p><p>After a few minutes of quiet I said, \u201cLet\u2019s go lie on our deck at the villa.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over at Braden I found him staring at me, his brow puckered in consternation. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I held his gaze and answered pointedly, \u201cBecause I like the peace and quiet. I want that for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>Braden drew in a deep breath and slowly sat up to face me. Resting his elbows on his knees he leaned in and asked, \u201cBut one day you\u2019ll want the noise, right?\u201d</p> <p>My heart started to bang around in my chest at the thought but I nodded tremulously. \u201cYes. But I just want it to be us for a while.\u201d</p><p>Something dark I didn\u2019t quite understand flashed in his eyes but he kissed me, cupping my face in his hand, and he murmured against my lips, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>When he pulled back his eyes moved behind me and he frowned at something. Feeling like there was definitely something off about his acquiescence, I asked, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I got a reassuring nod and he pulled back, standing up to gather his things.</p><p>Turning, I did the same, shoving my flip-flops back on and bending down to find my e-reader, which I\u2019d hidden under my lounger in the shade.</p><p>\u201cDo you fucking mind?\u201d Braden snapped.</p><p>My head jerked up at his tone and my eyes collided with my neighbor. He was an older man, perhaps in his late forties, early fifties, he wasn\u2019t with anyone, and he was staring in mild amusement over my shoulder at my husband. His eyes flicked to my boobs and then back to Braden.</p><p>Great.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t need to look around to know that Braden\u2019s sharp aggression had drawn all of our neighbors\u2019 gazes.</p><p>\u201cYour woman is very beautiful,\u201d the stranger commented in a thick accent.</p><p>I tensed and quickly turned around to face Braden, giving him a shake of my head. \u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t leave it.</p><p>He gently took hold of my wrist and pulled me behind him so he could lean into the stranger\u2019s face. \u201cMy wife is very beautiful. But to you she\u2019s invisible. Understood?\u201d</p><p>The stranger nodded. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>I understood too. I understood I was mortified.</p><p>Not wanting to cause more of a scene, I let Braden hold my hand as we walked up the beach but as soon as we were out of sight I tugged out of his hold.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pissed off.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m pissed off. There was no need to speak to him that way. It was embarrassing. You were peeing all over me.\u201d</p><p>I heard his snort of laughter but didn\u2019t dare look at him because I was afraid I\u2019d kill him.</p><p>\u201cThat arsehole was ogling you all fucking day and ignoring every warning look I gave him. I don\u2019t appreciate another man staring at my wife like he\u2019s imagining fucking her when he knows I\u2019m standing right fucking there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs dropping the f-bomb three times really necessary?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, heavily this time. \u201cYou\u2019re still pissed off.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m still pissed off. \u201cI\u2019m confused. You overreacted and you know you overreacted. I\u2019m just thinking the overreaction had nothing to do with that idiot staring at my breasts.\u201d</p><p>Instead of agreeing, instead of telling me he was bothered by the unspoken issue that was on our minds, Braden shook his head impatiently and began striding toward the villa without me.</p><p>Dinner was a quiet affair.</p><p>I\u2019d spent the rest of the afternoon lying by the pool with my headphones on listening to Bastille while Braden took a walk around the resort. By the time he came back I was in the shower. When I got out of the shower to get ready for dinner, he got in. Afterward Braden attempted conversation with me. I grunted answers at him, not so much pissed at him anymore as pissed that he\u2019d given me reason on our honeymoon to be pissed at him.</p><p>He\u2019d scowled at me when I strode out of the walk-in wearing a figure-hugging blue dress. The fabric was a thin, stretchy jersey, so although it covered me, it pretty much left little to the imagination. It was a hot dress and I\u2019d bought it for my hot husband.</p><p>At the time the thought hadn\u2019t been to torture him, but I was pissed, so now it was about torturing him.</p><p>Our walk to dinner was quiet. The night before we\u2019d dined at the Oceanview, a restaurant situated on the beach. Tonight I silently led us to the Great Room in the main house of the resort.</p><p>That silence reigned between us all through dinner.</p><p>The tension between us was thickening and I could tell Braden was losing patience with it. Or me, rather.</p><p>Deciding the best thing for us was to get a good night\u2019s sleep and put the stupid argument behind us, I quietly suggested we leave out drinks tonight and just return to the room. I took his brusque nod as agreement.</p><p>Dinner over, we strolled back to the villa. I kicked off my heels to sink my feet into sand, only reluctantly trailing back onto the landscaped path to our villa, all the while secretly dreading a quiet night in with annoyed silence and no sex.</p><p>Inside the air-conditioned heaven, I threw my heels to the floor and padded on cool tiles toward the bedroom. I heard Braden\u2019s footsteps behind me seconds before I found myself jerked back against his body.</p><p>I gasped at the sudden movement, my breath hitching as one hand coasted roughly up my stomach to cup my breast, while the other gripped lightly to my hair. Braden gently tugged my head back, exposing my neck. Those familiar shivers tingled through me as he kneaded my breast, and pressed hot, wet kisses down the side of my neck.</p><p>Just as abruptly as he\u2019d pulled me to him, Braden pushed me forward until I hit the bed. My torso bowed over the end of it as he nudged my legs open with his feet. In the same motion he slipped his hands under the hem of my tight dress and shoved the fabric upward until it hit me midback, baring my ass to him.</p><p>By this point my breathing was as hot and heavy as his.</p><p>Cool air touched my skin as Braden tugged my panties down. I stepped out of them and kicked them aside, quickly widening my stance again and biting back a moan at the feel of Braden\u2019s erection pressing against my ass.</p><p>His fingers dug into my hips as he tormented me with the promise of him.</p><p>\u201cBraden,\u201d I whispered, his name a plea.</p><p>He rubbed his cock between my legs, teasing me mercilessly. I rocked back and forth against him until it was too much.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>I lost his heat, but it was quickly replaced with his strong fingers slipping between my legs and deep inside.</p><p>He groaned to find me already wet and just like that his fingers were gone, a zip sounded, and his cock slammed into me. I whimpered again, my chest pressed to the bed, my hands gripping the sheets as Braden held me tight by the hips and thrust roughly in and out of me.</p><p>The build started quickly and I found myself rearing back against his dick in desperation.</p><p>\u201cHarder?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d I gasped.</p><p>He pumped harder into me and just as I was on the cusp of coming, Braden pulled out, flipped me over onto my back as if I weighed nothing, and took hold of the hem of my dress, pulling it up over my head. He tossed it aside, hurriedly removing his own shirt before gripping my thighs, spreading my legs, and jerking me toward him so only my back was pressed against the bed.</p><p>Our eyes locked and we both moaned as he slid back inside me.</p><p>As he fucked me toward oblivion we kept our eyes locked, the connection heightening our arousal, shooting us toward climax faster. His panting breaths and my gasp filled the night air until his cock drove deep, shattering the fragile tension inside of me.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn,\u201d he groaned as my inner muscles squeezed him. He jerked hard against me, shuddering as I felt his release inside of me.</p><p>After a moment he wrapped his arms around me and I wrapped my limbs around him, allowing him to drag me farther up the mattress. As soon as I was fully on the bed, Braden collapsed over me, his mouth nuzzling my neck as I squeezed my thighs around his waist and stroked the damp skin of his muscular back.</p><p>He lifted his head to press a soft kiss to my mouth, asking as he pulled back, \u201cDid I make my point?\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat you\u2019re still a freaking caveman? Yes.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle made him shake against me in a way I loved and I was disappointed when he rolled off of me. That disappointment quickly faded when he pulled me into his side.</p><p>\u201cI should clean up,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cIn a bit.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way that guy was looking at you. I made a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was embarrassing . . . also . . . was it really just about the guy? Honestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He kissed my hair. \u201cAnd . . . maybe the bikini. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t wear that one again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought you liked that bikini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like that bikini, but so does every man on this resort with a dick he knows how to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, okay.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cYou know I hate to point this out since we\u2019re speaking again, but you\u2019ve acted worse when you\u2019ve found women flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cOkay, true. But I thought we were trying to be grown-ups now that we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you were doing at the airport?\u201d He chuckled again. \u201cBeing a grownup?\u201d</p><p>He had a freaking answer for everything. \u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being pissed. I guess I was a little edgy. . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I mentioned kids again?\u201d</p><p>I tensed against him. \u201cI just . . . I want to wait a few years, but I don\u2019t want you to be upset about that. I don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>I quickly found myself on my back, my husband braced over me. \u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>In answer I kissed him.</p><p>Thinking back on it, I kissed him so I didn\u2019t have to see the disappointment he was trying so hard to hide.</p><p>Chapter 6</p> <p>The Homecoming</p><p>Something nudged me into consciousness, but I refused to open my eyes. Instead I kept my face buried in the warm, familiar skin of Braden\u2019s neck.</p><p>It became clear that the thing that woke me was my husband. I could feel him trying to extricate himself from my hold as gently as possible.</p><p>I held on tighter.</p><p>Braden shook against me, his tone rumbling with laughter as he asked, \u201cAm I not allowed out of bed this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I mumbled against his skin. \u201cIf you move, I\u2019ll have to move. If I have to move it means facing the fact that we\u2019re no longer in Hawaii. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>He rolled me onto my back, laughing at the fact that I refused to open my eyes. \u201cSo is the plan to stay here forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat might become a problem.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head against the pillows. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee any problems. It\u2019s a sound plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Braden sighed. \u201cWe will eventually start to smell. And needing the toilet might become a problem. And with your issues with flatulence\u2014\u201d</p><p>I punched him on the arm, opening my eyes so I didn\u2019t miss. My husband fought me off, laughing as though he was the funniest man on earth.</p><p>\u201cOne year,\u201d I growled at him. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is one year without you bringing that up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou getting adorably embarrassed when you fart in front of me?\u201d</p><p>After throwing him a narrow-eyed glare, I rolled off the bed. \u201cI am not adorable,\u201d I snapped, stomping out of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking adorable!\u201d he called to me as I made my way into the kitchen. I rolled my eyes. Braden could be pretty adorable, too, but he\u2019d like it even less than me if I told him that.</p><p>I reached for the kettle, about to call through and ask if he wanted coffee when a wave of nausea caught me completely off guard and I found myself swaying against the counter.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you okay?\u201d Braden rushed to my side, grasping my hip in his hand.</p><p>Breathing through my nose, I fought to hold the sickness down. After a moment I rested my forehead on his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so great.\u201d</p><p>I felt his lips in my hair. \u201cJet lag. Sit down.\u201d He ushered me toward the kitchen table and planted my ass at it. As he began to make the coffee the nausea rose again and I knew this time there was no fighting it. Without a word I shot up from the table and rushed out of the kitchen to the bathroom.</p><p>The toilet lid was barely up when I heaved everything inside me into it.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn?\u201d I could feel Braden behind me.</p><p>I waved him off. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Sensing I wanted privacy, he left.</p><p>After waiting a few moments to make sure the nausea was dealt with, I got up on shaky legs and washed and brushed my teeth. Seeing my pale face in the mirror, I glowered at it.</p><p>Home sweet freaking home.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Braden asked as I entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I smiled, gratefully accepting the coffee. \u201cMuch.\u201d</p><p>Sitting in the waiting room, listening to people cough and sniffle, I felt breakable for the first time in a long time. My chest was heavy, like the air all around me was much too thin, and my thoughts were too harried, making me feel like a crazy person.</p><p>I just needed to know one way or the other.</p><p>If I knew . . .</p><p>I just needed to know.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn Carmichael, Room Five, Dr. Orr.\u201d</p><p>Here we go. . . .</p><p>Braden was sprawled in the armchair, his shirt sleeves rolled up, his tie askew, and he was staring at the television as if he was only half-interested in what was going on.</p><p>He\u2019d had a long day at work.</p><p>I\u2019d just had a long day.</p><p>And now I was terrified. Terrified of answers. Terrified of fucking up. Of losing . . . everything.</p><p>We\u2019d been home from Hawaii for almost four weeks and I\u2019d been hiding my sickness from Braden ever since that first morning. After a visit to the doctor\u2019s that day I was almost sure of the diagnosis, but I wouldn\u2019t know until they called to confirm the results.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at my husband.</p><p>He was frowning at me in concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I whispered, my heart beating hard against my ribs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. You\u2019ve been quiet. Tense.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just on tenterhooks waiting to see if that lit agent in New York wants to sign me.\u201d</p><p>After months and months of rejection letters I\u2019d gotten an e-mail back from a lit agent from one of the top agencies in New York asking me for the first three chapters of my manuscript. When she e-mailed back asking to see the rest, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d been trying not to get my hopes up, and my secret worry was helping keep my mind off it.</p><p>\u201cYou sure that\u2019s all it is?\u201d</p><p>I felt sick lying to him. So I didn\u2019t. Instead I got up slowly and sauntered over to him, climbing onto the chair with him so I was straddling his lap. \u201cI wish we were back in Hawaii,\u201d I whispered against his mouth as he ran his hands down my back. \u201cI wish, I wish, I wish . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoc\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off with a hard, desperate kiss, and that night I made love to my husband as if I knew what was coming next could change everything.</p><p>Ellie and Adam had fallen in love with a property on Scotland Street, and in a bid to distract me, I let Ellie set up another viewing so that the girls and I could check it out. Jo, Liv, and I followed Ellie and her estate agent around the Georgian-period flat, and for a while Ellie\u2019s exuberance and exciting plans for the flat took me away from my problem. For a moment I even forgot I had a problem, so it was a bit like being jolted back into reality when my phone rang as we were leaving the property.</p><p>My stomach churned.</p><p>I gave the girls an apologetic smile and wandered off to the side to answer.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Carmichael, this is Dr. Orr. We have the results of your pregnancy test. I\u2019d like to be the first to say congratulations, you are pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The world skewed to the left.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Carmichael?\u201d Dr. Orr asked softly. And then his tone became more careful. \u201cI\u2019ll give you time to process the news. Please do call as soon as possible to arrange your prenatal care. We\u2019ll set you up with your first appointment with a midwife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I somehow managed to mutter, every nerve trembling like I\u2019d just run the New York City Marathon. I hung up and slipped my phone back into my purse.</p><p>I could hear someone trying to speak to me.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be a mom.</p><p>Someone was questioning me.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have a child.</p><p>\u201cJoss, what is it?\u201d Ellie\u2019s frantic voice finally broke through.</p><p>I looked up at her, her pretty face a little fuzzy in my distress. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d The world skewed to the right. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you\u2019re scaring me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She was scared? She was scared! \u201cEllie,\u201d I snapped, feeling an invisible hand wrap around my throat and constrict my breathing. \u201cJust . . .\u201d I stopped cold at the unadulterated concern in her eyes. \u201cI need to be alone for a little while.\u201d</p><p>I waited for her nod and as soon as I got it, as soon as I knew she understood I wasn\u2019t shutting her out\u2014I just needed space\u2014I turned on my heel and started walking, almost running, toward the castle.</p><p>Somehow a thirty-minute walk was over in a flash. I was buying my ticket into the castle, I was hoofing up Lang stairs, and striding up onto the elevated section of Edinburgh castle where St. Margaret\u2019s Chapel was situated. And right outside the chapel was my place.</p><p>My place with the canon, Mons Meg, and the best view of Edinburgh.</p><p>I leaned against the cannon for a moment, ignoring the tourists who were trying to get a photograph of it. Feeling its cool cast iron under my hand, I drew in a deep breath.</p><p>I was going to be a mom.</p><p>Limbs still quivering like a mess of jelly, I walked over to the parapet, leaned my elbows on the wall, and gazed out over my home.</p><p>Here was where I found my calm. For whatever reason, this place on Castle Hill allowed me to sort out my feelings, to process them, to deal with them. It was my special place. And I hadn\u2019t needed it in a while.</p><p>But now that I was going to be a mom . . . now, on top of having Braden and Ellie and all of my family and friends to lose, I had something miraculous to lose. My child.</p><p>The tears burned in my throat, the fear becoming something raw inside of me.</p><p>\u201cJocelyn?\u201d</p><p>I whirled around at the sound of Braden\u2019s voice, knowing that everything I was feeling had to be written all over my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ellie must have called him and he\u2019d guessed exactly where I\u2019d go.</p><p>Braden\u2019s features grew alarmed at the sight of me and he hurried toward me, gripping my arms in his hands. \u201cSweetheart, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d I blurted out, the tears spilling down my cheeks.</p> <p>Braden jerked back like I\u2019d hit him. He stared at me a long time, as if trying to figure me out. Just like that he looked like he\u2019d been punched in the gut. \u201cSo you came here?\u201d he whispered incredulously.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what that meant, but I realized quickly it didn\u2019t mean anything good.</p><p>\u201cBraden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He cut me off, turning from me. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>There was an uneasiness, a new fear, in leaving my place before I\u2019d gotten a chance to work through everything in my head. I\u2019d just wanted that chance before Braden and I . . .</p> <p>We walked in tense silence back down the hill and out of the castle. Braden had a taxi waiting for us on the esplanade. I was so out of it I didn\u2019t even realize Braden hadn\u2019t touched me. He opened the door for me but he didn\u2019t put his hand on my arm to help me in. He didn\u2019t scoot near me once we were inside. I\u2019d realize this all later, when my brain wasn\u2019t a tumult of thoughts and my stomach and chest weren\u2019t awash with too many feelings.</p><p>Not a word was spoken between us, not until the door to our flat was closed behind us and we stood facing each other in the kitchen.</p><p>Braden\u2019s features were hard in a way I didn\u2019t like. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant with my child and that\u2019s such fucking awful news you go to the castle?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe he thought . . . That wasn\u2019t it at all!</p><p>\u201cBraden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy or are you unhappy?\u201d he snapped, his glittering with desperation.</p> <p>My heart was pounding so hard in my chest, I thought I might vomit. \u201cBraden.\u201d My lips trembled, my nose stinging. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>He jerked back again, a pain in his eyes that he quickly banked.</p><p>\u201cLet me\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to finish. He was out of the flat too fast.</p><p>Trembling, I sank into a chair. Not only hadn\u2019t I been given a chance to process my own feelings, I was left confused and afraid of Braden\u2019s. He was the kind of man who gave you a chance to explain, but he\u2019d obviously taken my reaction to the pregnancy the wrong way, and now he was too hurt to listen.</p><p>I just needed to explain.</p><p>He had to listen.</p><p>It was late, but I left a message on Dr. Pritchard\u2019s work voice mail asking if I could schedule an appointment that week. Dr. Kathryn Pritchard was my therapist and she\u2019d helped me come a long way in dealing with my post-traumatic stress disorder. She\u2019d helped me grieve for my family and she\u2019d helped me work through my fears. I hadn\u2019t scheduled a session with her in a while, but I needed someone impartial to talk to.</p> <p>Braden stayed gone for hours. I got a text from Ellie asking me if I was okay. It was a dead giveaway that Braden had told Adam about my pregnancy and Ellie knew. She was trying to figure out how to deal with me. I knew this because normally she\u2019d call me or even come around to the flat. A text for news this huge . . . Yeah, she didn\u2019t know how to handle my reaction.</p><p>Staring down at the photo of me with my family Braden had framed and given me for Christmas, I tried to force my insides back together again. I gazed at Beth, my baby sister who I held tight in my arms, and I attempted to do this by understanding exactly what it was I was feeling. The fear was coloring everything, I wasn\u2019t even sure that I was unhappy with the idea of being a mom. It was soon. Sooner that I\u2019d wanted, but if I could just get past the fear, maybe I would see it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing. Not such a bad thing at all. This baby was a product of Braden and me. A part of him. A beautiful piece of him. A gift we\u2019d given each other.</p><p>As much as I loved the makeshift family I\u2019d created in Edinburgh, this was my chance at my very own family again.</p><p>That clawing pressure pushed and ripped at my chest but I fought through it, taking deep, even breaths.</p><p>Now I just had to explain all this to Braden so he\u2019d see I wasn\u2019t pulling another \u201cEllie moment,\u201d pushing him out when things got tough like I did when Ellie was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I just wanted him to understand what was going on inside of me.</p><p>See. I had come a long way.</p><p>I jumped at the sound of the door opening and shutting. My pulse throbbed harder beneath my skin as Braden\u2019s footsteps grew louder the closer he got to our bedroom.</p><p>He stood against the dark backdrop of the hall, the soft light in our bedroom barely casting him out of the shadow, but I could see his expression was tired. Grim, even.</p><p>I sat up, waiting.</p><p>\u201cToday was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Guilt gnawed at my stomach and I winced apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI need an answer,\u201d he demanded softly. \u201cI need to know if you\u2019re happy to be pregnant with my kid. After everything we\u2019ve been through, I need that answer.\u201d</p><p>I shifted, reaching out to him. \u201cPlease, just let me explain. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer,\u201d he uttered bitingly, his expression shutting down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you . . . after everything . . . that we\u2019re back here again.\u201d He turned, leaving me shocked, openmouthed as he stormed down our hall. A door slammed and I hopped off the bed and into the hall to watch a light come on, shining under the guest bedroom door.</p><p>Tears choked me and I swallowed the hitch in my breathing as I tiptoed back into our bedroom. My husband and I had fought quite a few times in the last few years, but not once had Braden let it come between us. He always slept in our bed with me and he always pulled me close at night.</p><p>The hot tears slipped down my cheeks.</p><p>I\u2019d hurt him.</p><p>And for the first time in a really long time, he\u2019d hurt me too.</p><p>That whole night I tossed and turned, my eyes on the hallway. A big part of me wanted to go into our guest room and shake Braden awake and make him listen to me, but the more I lay there and the more I thought everything over, I thought it best to let him sleep so we could have a rational conversation in the morning.</p><p>Except, I was exhausted from lack of sleep. I got up just before six in the morning, sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and attempting to read a book. Just before Braden\u2019s alarm was set to go off, I got up and made some fresh coffee for him.</p><p>Not too long after, he wandered into the kitchen in his pajamas, his hair in disarray, and I ached with hurt and love as he avoided my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI made you coffee,\u201d I told him quietly, trying to gauge whether or not this would soften him up.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he muttered, taking hold of the mug. He leaned against the counter, staring at the wall.</p><p>My stomach flip-flopped unpleasantly.</p><p>I had to explain so he\u2019d stop thinking the worst of me.</p><p>\u201cBraden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to shower.\u201d He walked out of the kitchen abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk!\u201d I yelled at him angrily.</p><p>His answer was to slam the bathroom door.</p><p>This was a whole new side to my husband. And I did not like it one bit.</p><p>I got up, ready to do battle, when a knock at the door stopped me. That knock was followed by a key turning in the lock, and I knew then it was Ellie.</p><p>Bracing myself, I wondered if I\u2019d be able to handle two of my favorite people being so mad at me. Three years ago that would have been a piece of cake. But these idiots had softened me up, whether I liked to admit it or not.</p><p>Ellie appeared in the kitchen doorway, her blue eyes instantly finding me.</p><p>Whatever she saw in my face made her pale and she came straight at me, arms wide-open.</p><p>I relaxed into her hug, not even realizing until right then how much I needed it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I should say congratulations.\u201d</p><p>I tensed.</p><p>Ellie pulled back, peering at me cautiously. \u201cBraden\u2019s really upset.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t speak. I wanted to. But I was afraid if I did I would scream.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m here, Joss.\u201d She rubbed my shoulder in comfort. \u201cI\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing past the gust of screams, I nodded and thanked her hoarsely.</p><p>We were quiet as I made her a cup of tea and we sat down at the table together. It occurred to me as we sat in silence that maybe if I told Ellie everything I was feeling, Braden would listen to her. I didn\u2019t know what was going on with my usually understanding and compassionate husband, but what I did know was that he was angrier than I\u2019d ever seen him, and clearly unwilling to listen to anything I had to say. He might listen to Ellie.</p><p>I opened my mouth to speak when the sound of the bathroom door opening halted me. Both Ellie and I turned to watch for Braden and as he passed the doorway he gave his sister a taut nod of hello and continued on into the bedroom to get ready for work. On a Sunday.</p><p>Ellie turned to me, her eyes questioning.</p><p>I took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cHe slept in your old room last night,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s never done that before.\u201d</p><p>My friend\u2019s expression grew pained. \u201cJoss . . . talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nausea hit me before Ellie could finish her sentence and I was up, bending over the kitchen sink. I felt her hands in my hair, holding it back. After spitting up the last of my morning sickness, I sank back against Els, glad for her comforting presence. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye drew my gaze and I froze at the sight of Braden staring at me, a muscle ticking in his jaw. He turned to Ellie. \u201cGive Elodie my apologies for missing Sunday dinner. I\u2019ll be in meetings all day. And, uh\u201d\u2014he cut me a look before glancing back at his sister\u2014\u201cstay with her until she feels better.\u201d</p><p>Anger burned through me as Braden walked out of the flat, ignoring Ellie\u2019s shocked and questioning calls of his name.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s pitiful and sympathetic looks suddenly became painful rather than comforting.</p><p>I pulled out of Ellie\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, hon. I just . . . I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded carefully and let me go.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sleep. I kept playing everything over and over in my head, trying to work out what to say to Braden first to make him stop and talk to me. I had it all planned, but dinner passed and he still didn\u2019t turn up.</p><p>Then evening.</p> <p>I texted him and didn\u2019t get a reply. I called. No reply.</p><p>I texted Adam but he wasn\u2019t with Adam.</p><p>Finally, just after two in the morning, our front door opened. Fury propelled me out of our bedroom and I stormed into the hall as Braden shut the door behind him. His eyes moved to me but it was like he was staring right through me as he started toward the guest room.</p><p>Oh, no! Not again!</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I snapped, grabbing hold of his arm so he\u2019d look at me.</p> <p>He jerked his arm away from me like he couldn\u2019t stand to be touched by me. \u201cOut,\u201d he told me simply, his tone cutting. And then he disappeared into the guest room, not even aware that I probably looked like he\u2019d run me over with a car.</p><p>I had theories as to why he was so angry. I knew he thought I didn\u2019t want his kid. I wondered if he was questioning everything about us. I wondered if he was scared. I wondered why he couldn\u2019t just tell me all that. I thought we had come further than that. No . . . I guess I\u2019d just, probably unfairly, thought he\u2019d see me through anything.</p><p>A long time ago he\u2019d almost left me for good for shutting him out. And now he was shutting me out. He\u2019d dived inside his head and he wouldn\u2019t let me near him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even want me touching him, and that hurt and scared me so much I didn\u2019t want to feel anything. I\u2019d sleep to help with that, but sleep was eluding me. Instead I shut myself in the bathroom and undressed. I switched on the shower and stepped into the freezing-cold water, allowing the shock to dissipate into numbness. My mind adrift, my hands covered the small of my stomach protectively, and I closed my eyes. I could be numb everywhere but there.</p><p>I thought I heard a muffled \u201cFuck\u201d and it brought my eyes open just as Braden was sliding the shower door open. He reached in, his features like granite as he switched the nozzle to warm. His eyes cut to me. \u201cAre you trying to catch fucking pneumonia?\u201d</p><p>Chittering, I blanched. I hadn\u2019t been thinking. Obviously.</p> <p>\u201cStay in there until you warm up,\u201d Braden snapped.</p><p>Where was my husband?</p><p>Everything I\u2019d been feeling suddenly broke out of the numbness. All the fear, the guilt, the anger, the loneliness of the past few days, and most especially the hurt.</p><p>Braden jerked back, confusion and something like fear entering his expression.</p><p>But since this man was a stranger . . . I couldn\u2019t give a fuck how he felt.</p><p>I reached over, staring at him blankly, shut the shower door, and turned my back on him.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Castle Hill</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Joss. What\u2019s been happening?\u201d Dr. Pritchard asked in that careful voice of hers. She had mastered the art of not sounding concerned. Nor too breezy. Just calm. Soothing.</p><p>It used to bug the crap out of me. There was a time I would have given anything to hear her yell at her kids for some wrongdoing just so I could hear a little bit of raised blood pressure in her voice. I wanted proof she was human.</p><p>Now I knew she was human. She could be a little on the sarcastic side. That\u2019s probably why I liked her so much.</p><p>\u201cBraden and I got married,\u201d I informed her quietly, my hands resting on my stomach.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Pritchard raised an eyebrow. She gave good eyebrow-raising. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Easing into the reason for my visit, I avoided the subject altogether. \u201cI got an agent.\u201d It was true. Dana had called at the beginning of the week and I\u2019d signed with her. It should have been one of the most exciting moments of my life. \u201cShe has a publisher interested in my manuscript.\u201d Already. Again, should have been one of the most exciting moments of my life.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Pritchard also seemed to fear hyperbole and expressions of excitement. Again, another reason I liked her so much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The good doctor was quiet a moment as she processed my blurtage. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trying to ignore the lump of tears in my throat as I thought over the last few days. Our home had been a silent, cold place recently. My whole life had. Ellie and Adam had refused to get in the middle, so they were staying out of it completely. I think Ellie must have talked Elodie into the same because I hadn\u2019t heard from her. I\u2019d gotten tentative texts from my friends but no one wanted to bring the subject up. \u201cIt\u2019s slammed up this huge wall between me and Braden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has or you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he has.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI was scared when I suspected I was pregnant. I was terrified when I found out that it was true. But I knew that wasn\u2019t all. I just . . . I had to get away, go to my place to process. Before I could, Braden got there, I told him, and he took one look at my face and assumed . . . the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m unhappy. That I don\u2019t want a child with him. He\u2019s so mad, so hurt, he wouldn\u2019t and still hasn\u2019t let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you tell him if he gave you the chance?\u201d</p><p>My hands pressed tighter against my stomach. \u201cThat our kid means more to me than anything ever has before. That it scares me to feel that much for anyone. It always will. But that I\u2019m working through it now. That I\u2019m still scared, and I\u2019m scared about screwing it all up, but that I want this with him. I just needed time to work out what I was feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the irony. \u201cSo happy I was paralyzed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still believe that everything good will be followed by bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t for a long time,\u201d I shook my head. \u201cBut this is a huge deal. I had a relapse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss, you\u2019re allowed to feel this way. You recognized it and you\u2019re working through it. That\u2019s all anyone can ask.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet a moment as I studied my wedding rings, twisting the bands on my finger. \u201cHe hurt me,\u201d I whispered, not wanting to admit it out loud.</p><p>\u201cBraden?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not perfect, Joss. You\u2019ve always known that he was a family man. It must be hard for him to wonder if he\u2019s married to a woman who could be unhappy about carrying her own child, his child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he won\u2019t let me explain.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, giving me a small, reassuring smile. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s afraid to hear what you have to say. So make him listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would . . . but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s gone I blame myself,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThe way I reacted . . . I can see why he would feel this way, act this way. But when he\u2019s right in front of me, looking through me, not wanting me to touch him, unable to bear my touch, I almost hate him. I feel so alone.\u201d The tears spilled down my cheeks. \u201cAnd he promised I wouldn\u2019t feel that way again.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Pritchard leaned over and pressed tissues into my hand, giving it a comforting squeeze as she did so. \u201cYou have to try to get past that feeling long enough to talk to him. This is a case of total miscommunication, and you two have come too far to let that derail you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as I wiped the tears.</p><p>\u201cAnd Joss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>She smiled kindly. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>She was the first person to say it to me in person, and although I understood it was my own fault that no one else had, it was still nice to hear it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I shutdown the laptop after having just bought up every self-help book Amazon had on being a first-time mom. After my session with Dr. Pritchard I\u2019d come home to an empty apartment and gone into this hyper mode, cleaning and tidying, throwing things out. I\u2019d also ignored reminders that Braden and I weren\u2019t sharing the same bed when I went into the guest room to measure up and saw his stuff scattered everywhere. This was going to be our kid\u2019s nursery. I was thinking yellow or green for a color scheme since those were both gender neutral.</p><p>I\u2019d then opened up my laptop to an e-mail from my new agent, telling me she\u2019d sent off my manuscript to the publisher, and she would like me to start thinking up concepts for a new book. For a while I typed up notes for several ideas I\u2019d come back to, to flesh out later.</p><p>And then I\u2019d started freaking out that I knew nothing about being a mother and began an online shopping spree.</p><p>Nerves frayed, I stood in front of the mirror in our bedroom and lifted my T-shirt.</p><p>No bump yet.</p><p>I smoothed my hand over my stomach thinking how weird it was that there was a little person inside of me whom I already loved beyond reason.</p><p>Now if only my husband would give me a chance to tell him that.</p><p>I glanced at the space between the window and the bed and wondered if there was room to put the baby\u2019s crib there for a while. I wanted him or her to be close to us. I already knew I\u2019d find it difficult to sleep if I didn\u2019t know our kid was safe and at arm\u2019s reach.</p><p>After a few minutes of fruitless search for the measuring tape, I wandered back into the guest room to see if I\u2019d left it in there. I found it on the bedside cabinet, but as I moved away, the address on a letter half-hidden under a book drew me up short.</p><p>Heart beating obnoxiously loud, I slipped the letter out from under the novel and fear prickled my skin in cold shivers as I read it.</p><p>My fingers went numb and the letter fluttered out of my grasp to the floor.</p><p>It was a letter to Braden\u2019s tenants, asking them to vacate the premise in one month\u2019s time. It was his bachelor penthouse on the Meadows. The one he\u2019d put up for rental when he moved in with me.</p><p>The one he could take back from tenants on a short notice if he needed it for personal usage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My doorbell rang.</p><p>A welcome distraction from the pure fear running cold in my veins.</p><p>\u201cLiv?\u201d I said, after I opened my front door, surprised to see her on my doorstep.</p> <p>Olivia and I were good friends, but for some reason she wasn\u2019t the first person I expected to see. Jo and I were closer. Liv and I only knew each other because of Jo, but we\u2019d quickly banded together as fellow Americans and book enthusiasts.</p><p>Liv\u2019s eyes washed over me in concern and I instantly tensed. I knew what she was seeing. Dark circles under my eyes because I hadn\u2019t been sleeping; a pale, icky complexion; and hair that was all over the place.</p><p>\u201cIs Braden here?\u201d she asked casually as she barged right past me and into the flat.</p><p>There was no need for barging. I welcomed her presence as long as we talked about anything else but Braden and my pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s at work,\u201d I replied as I followed her into the kitchen.</p> <p>When I got there she was already making coffee. She frowned at me. \u201cYou need to take better care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy,\u201d I hopped onto a different subject quickly. \u201cA literary agent in New York now represents me.\u201d</p><p>Liv smiled in excitement. \u201cShe loved your book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back, knowing out of everyone Liv would be the one to really get how cool it was. Liv was a librarian. Books were her passion.</p> <p>When her eyes dipped to my stomach, uncertainty entering their depths, I cut off her obvious next question.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I should start working on another.\u201d</p><p>To my relief, Liv let me get away with the distraction, listening to me yammer on about my different ideas as we settled in the sitting room with coffee and biscuits. Anything, anything, to forget the letter I\u2019d just found.</p><p>I was in midsentence about this crazy dystopian idea I had that was completely not what my agent had in mind when she asked me to think up new concepts, when the front door opened.</p><p>Braden.</p><p>I felt my whole body lock with tension as I stared, waiting with this horrible sick feeling in my stomach, for Braden to appear in the doorway and crush me.</p><p>He appeared, looking just as tired as I felt, and stopped in the doorway. \u201cLiv,\u201d he greeted her before glancing at me. His eyes instantly narrowed at the sight of me. \u201cDid you sleep today?\u201d</p><p>Are you leaving me? \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing annoyed, he sighed. \u201cYou need to get some sleep.\u201d Tugging on his tie, he strode out of sight.</p><p>\u201cJoss?\u201d Liv\u2019s whispered anxiety brought my attention back to her. She looked so worried for me. \u201cGirl, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>What am I doing? What am I doing? \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She didn\u2019t know shit.</p><p>We sat in taut silence, sipping on coffee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a late meeting with Adam,\u201d we heard Braden say as he wandered down the hall. Another lie. The front door slammed behind him. I flinched and desperately tried not to cry. This pregnancy was turning me into an emotional black hole.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Liv stood up as if she was coming to hug me.</p><p>I held up a hand to stop her. \u201cYou hug me and I won\u2019t stop crying. And I need to not cry.\u201d</p><p>She froze, looking helpless and angry that she felt that way.</p><p>I knew exactly how she felt. \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d I needed someone other than Dr. Pritchard to know that. \u201cI haven\u2019t shut him out. I\u2019m just having a really hard time right now and I ruined it. I ruined this for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one not talking to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe talks. But it\u2019s . . . it\u2019s like he can barely stand to be in the same room as me. He hasn\u2019t asked me how I feel about it now that the shock has worn off. He doesn\u2019t want to know. He doesn\u2019t want me to touch him. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never been like that.\u201d The letter came back to mind and I felt that panic swallow me whole. \u201cI think I\u2019ve fucked up.\u201d My hysterical laughter immediately turned into loud, hard sobbing I couldn\u2019t control. I couldn\u2019t even be mortified that I was breaking down. I was crying too hard to care.</p><p>I felt Liv\u2019s comforting warmth as she gently nudged me aside on the chair and snuggled in beside me so she could pull me into her arms. And then everything just disappeared as I let her comfort me, the tears soaking her shirt a testament to the fact that I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t aware of the shaking stopping, or the tears drawing to a halt. Everything was just black as I finally fell into the deep relief of sleep.</p><p>My eyes felt crusty as I tried to open them, consciousness coming to me, and with it the feel of a heavy warmth resting on my waist.</p><p>As I opened my peepers I realized they felt swollen and that\u2019s when I remembered why. I tensed at the memory of crying in Liv\u2019s arms at the same time I looked into my husband\u2019s sleeping face.</p><p>The heavy warmth across my waist was his arm.</p><p>We were lying in bed together.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how we\u2019d gotten there.</p><p>I started to cry again.</p><p>Braden\u2019s arm tightened around me and through the blur of tears I saw I\u2019d woken him.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t not happy,\u201d I whispered, licking the salt water off my lips. \u201cI was so happy I was terrified.\u201d</p><p>His warm fingers brushed my chin and I felt the gentle pressure of his touch as he tilted my head back so I would meet his questioning eyes. \u201cTerrified?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cJust because I\u2019ve come a long way, doesn\u2019t mean I still don\u2019t feel that way. You wouldn\u2019t let me explain. I\u2019m still terrified of losing all the good we have together.\u201d Had together.</p><p>Braden frowned as he sat up. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of losing our baby, so you shut me out before I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I sat up, glaring at him. \u201cYou shut me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were past all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me fucking explain!\u201d</p><p>He glowered at me but shut up.</p><p>I glowered back. \u201cYou know I\u2019m afraid of losing the people I love. But my kid, our kid, I already love this kid so much I can\u2019t breathe. The thought of something happening . . .\u201d</p><p>Braden shook his head slowly. \u201cYou kept avoiding talking about having kids. . . . I started to worry that you didn\u2019t want them. I thought with you running off to the castle it meant you were gearing up to shut me out because . . . you didn\u2019t want our kid. Then when you tried to explain, I was . . .\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou were what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared,\u201d he admitted softly, his eyes locked with mine. \u201cMy mother never wanted me, Jocelyn. Never. I was not a happy kid and I would never wish that kind of childhood on anyone, let alone my own kids. I promised myself if I ever had children I\u2019d be the kind of father mine never was and I certainly wouldn\u2019t marry a woman who wouldn\u2019t treat them like they were her whole world. So I didn\u2019t know how to feel about my wife not wanting our kid. I didn\u2019t know how to react to that and what it meant for us.\u201d</p><p>A knifelike pain cut across my chest. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re moving out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked incredulously, his eyes darkening. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letter.\u201d I lifted a shaky hand, pointing out to the hall. \u201cI found the letter in the guest room. The one asking the tenants of your old apartment to move out within the month.\u201d</p><p>A thick silence fell between us.</p><p>Braden slipped out of bed, staring at nothing for a moment before turning to me with a very familiar anger. \u201cThat\u2019s the second letter to those tenants. The first one told them they were being evicted because of the complaints I\u2019d received from residents of the building. The letter you saw was a standard notice telling them how much time they had to get out.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou thought without talking to you, or trying to work this shit out that I . . . that I . . . was leaving you!\u201d he yelled in disbelief.</p><p>Oh, no, he did not get to be angry anymore. I got out of the bed on the opposite side. \u201cYou froze me out. I was scared and confused and you left me on my own!\u201d My voice cracked as I yelled back at him, and the break lowered my voice. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let me touch you. You flinched from me.\u201d I watched his face soften. \u201cYou promised me I wasn\u2019t alone anymore, but instead you made me think you hated me. And I think I hate you a little for that.\u201d</p><p>I turned away so he wouldn\u2019t see me cry again.</p><p>Two seconds later he was turning me into his arms. \u201cFuck, baby,\u201d he whispered hoarsely. \u201cYou could bring a man to his knees.\u201d</p><p>There was so much relief in feeling his arms around me, his chest beneath my cheek. Inhaling his scent. Soaking him in. But I didn\u2019t hold him in return.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said gruffly, desperately, in my ear, easing me back to stare into my eyes. He brushed my hair off my face before cupping it in his hands. There was something like panic in them. \u201cJocelyn, I will never make you feel that way again. I promise. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He kissed me hard, tasting my tears. \u201cI was scared. I acted like an idiot but it was just because this is our kid. It means more to me than anything ever has. I fucked up. I fucked up this time, but I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart. I love you. You believe me?\u201d He pulled me against him, his hands running down my back. \u201cYou believe me?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to let go of the last few days. It would be so easy to hold on to the hurt and anger. But instead I looked back a few years when I was lying in Braden\u2019s arms, grateful he\u2019d forgiven me for everything I\u2019d put him through.</p><p>I lifted my arms and wrapped them around his back. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me again, this time slower, deeper. When he pulled back he was frowning. \u201cI fucked up,\u201d he repeated quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be times,\u201d he murmured against my lips, \u201cwhen we don\u2019t like each other very much, but I need you to know that I will never stop loving you. This time it was me who was terrified of losing you, and I pushed you away because I was afraid to hear what you had to say. If, God forbid, I ever hurt you again, tell me. Don\u2019t lock me out. Don\u2019t shut the shower door on my face. Scream at me. Don\u2019t let me get away with it until you\u2019re storing that shit up and looking at me like you\u2019re haunted. Because . . . I swear to God, that look in your eyes that night, it almost broke my fucking heart. We need to stop doing that to each other. Right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded, clinging tighter to him, relief and forgiveness melting my body into his. \u201cI promise. And not just for me, and not just for you. We have a baby to think of now too. Congratulations, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Braden\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cCongratulations, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOh, Jesus C, that took us long enough.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me up into his arms, so my feet left the ground. I automatically clung to his neck and wrapped my legs around his waist, only to find myself being lowered to my back on the bed.</p><p>Braden lay over me, his loving eyes staring straight into mine. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>I slipped my hands under his shirt, feeling his warm, muscled back beneath my fingers. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too,\u201d I told him thickly. \u201cI love you so much. Even when I didn\u2019t like you very much, I loved you completely.\u201d</p><p>His thumb brushed across my cheekbone. \u201cBack at you, babe. And I won\u2019t ever stop loving you. But just in case you have your doubts\u201d\u2014he threw me a quick, heated smile as his fingers curled around the waistband of my sweatpants\u2014\u201clet me show you how hard and deep . . . and desperately I love you.\u201d</p><p>I tilted my hips, giving him better access to slowly peel the sweatpants off. As soon as they were gone I wrapped my legs around his back and my arms around his shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s do this in the shower,\u201d I murmured hungrily against his mouth.</p><p>Holding me tight, Braden stood up and cupped a hand to my nape, bringing my mouth to his. We savored one another in that kiss, tasting each other, our lips growing swollen from the passionate makeout.</p><p>\u201cI love making out with you,\u201d I confessed, nuzzling his neck as he began walking us toward the bathroom.</p><p>He smiled in agreement and slowly lowered me to the ground once we were inside the bathroom. I pulled off my T-shirt and reached in to switch on the shower while Braden undressed. Divesting myself of my bra and panties, my hungry eyes roamed my husband\u2019s body as he slipped off his boxer briefs. My lower belly clenched with need as he pulled me gently to him, his pale eyes burning with desire as his hands stroked down my spine, to caress the curve of my bottom.</p><p>I sighed, running my own hands over his chest, before pressing soft kisses across his pecs, stopping to tease his nipple with my tongue.</p><p>He squeezed my ass, groaning and pressing his erection deeper into my stomach. I continued to explore him, my mouth trailing kisses across his skin, while my own hands brushed down across his hard abs, smoothed around his narrow hips, and grabbed his taut ass.</p><p>In retaliation, Braden let go of my bottom, stroking up my sides until he cupped both of my tender breasts in his hands. A pleasant pain shot through me when he kneaded them and I gasped, arching my neck. \u201cThey\u2019re tender,\u201d I whispered, reminding him of my pregnant state.</p><p>He kneaded them harder and I felt a rush of arousal shoot between my legs.</p><p>\u201cBraden,\u201d I moaned, pushing deeper against him.</p><p>To my disappointment he eased his hold on me.</p><p>I eyed in him question and he smirked, silently answering it by arching me over his arm and lifting my breast to his hot, wet mouth. I cried out at the sensation of his teeth gently scraping my nipple and then I was holding on for dear mercy as he sucked it deep into his mouth.</p><p>My breasts had never been this sensitive before.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I think I\u2019m going to come,\u201d I panted in disbelief, my hips undulating against him.</p><p>As if to test that theory, Braden sucked harder, circling my nipple with his tongue, while he squeezed and kneaded my other breast.</p><p>I was on fire, my whole body hot and stiff.</p> <p>And then I felt the ripple in my stomach and the slick wetness between my legs. I\u2019d just had a mini-orgasm from Braden playing with my breasts.</p><p>He lifted his head when he felt my body relax, his eyes questioning.</p><p>Breathing heavily, I smiled languidly, brushing his hair from his face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Braden coasted his hand down my stomach and I shivered, my sex clenching in anticipation. He slid two fingers inside me easily and his eyes darkened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soaked.\u201d He pumped his fingers and I rocked against them. \u201cThis is going to be fun, babe,\u201d he muttered darkly.</p><p>I held on to his shoulders, moving on his fingers. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t stop.\u201d I was close again.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you,\u201d Braden said, stopping the penetration. \u201cI want you to come on my tongue.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to argue with that.</p><p>In seconds I found myself inside the shower, my back against the wall, Braden on his knees. He hooked my leg over his shoulder and I dug my fingers into his hair as he lowered his mouth as the shower water sluiced down his back. Consumed with pleasure, with chasing orgasm, nothing else mattered but his tongue circling my clit, his fingers pumping inside of me. My body stiffened as the climax came rushing for me. I cried out my husband\u2019s name as I shuddered my release against his lapping, talented tongue.</p><p>Drowsy, languid, my hands slipped to rest on Braden\u2019s shoulders, moving down his chest as he stood up, kissing me in a wet erotic kiss. With one hand he gripped the back of my right thigh, with the other my ass and I somehow managed to hop up, wrapping my legs around him so he could ease his hot, throbbing dick inside of me. My inner muscles quivered at the pressure of him pushing deep and Braden groaned against my lips.</p><p>Our eyes held as he moved slowly in and out of me, our breathing growing steadily more shallow. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he growled, his grip on me hard as his thrusts came a little faster.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d I kissed him. I kissed him with everything I had and Braden bent his knees, his cock thrusting so deep into me as he surged up that my cry broke our lips apart.</p><p>My fingernails dug into his skin as he continued to fuck me with a slow intensity that was sure to kill me. All my muscles were stiff as he worked me toward another climax.</p><p>Braden\u2019s warm breath puffed against my mouth. \u201cCome for me, babe,\u201d he gasped, his hips flexing faster as it approached. \u201cI need you to come, Jocelyn.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue the pressure in my lower body blew out and I shattered on a muffled scream, my sex rippling around Braden. \u201cFuck,\u201d he grunted, pressing his face into my neck as he fucked me harder, faster, until his own shout of climax was muffled against my skin. His hips jerked against mine, shuddering hard as his cock flooded my womb with his warm release.</p><p>I stayed there, locked around him for a while as we tried to gain control of our breathing.</p><p>Finally, Braden lifted his head and before I could say it he smirked and murmured, \u201cBest. Shower. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Braden stared out at the view and then turned back to me with a pucker of confusion between his brow and a hint of annoyance in his eyes. \u201cAnd we\u2019re here why?\u201d</p><p>Standing beyond Mons Meg at Edinburgh Castle, I wrapped my arms around my husband\u2019s waist and pressed in close, tilting my head back to meet his eyes. \u201cSomewhere you got the impression that I only come here when I\u2019m in despair. I think that\u2019s why you shut me out. You were angry that I came here when I found out about our baby.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his grip on my hips tightening. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to rehash this, Jocelyn.\u201d</p><p>It was a week after our reconciliation and things since then had been tentative, a little fragile, but good. We were finding our feet again but this time as a pregnant couple. Braden was so excited to be a dad that he was really helping me work through my fears. I also talked to him about seeing Dr. Pritchard again and we\u2019d agreed to see her together, so he\u2019d understand what I was going through even better. Seeing a therapist was not on the list of things Braden ever wanted to do, but he was doing it for our family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rehashing,\u201d I promised him. \u201cI need you to know that I don\u2019t come here when I\u2019m in despair.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled, shaking my head. \u201cI come here whenever I need quiet. Some peace and quiet to process stuff. When I found out I was pregnant everything just filled my head. My mom and dad. Beth. You. Ellie. Elodie. Clark. Everyone I love. And the baby, our baby. I didn\u2019t know if I was scared or happy or sad or excited. It\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling to have all that crap colliding without focus. I came here to focus it so I could work out what I was feeling. But you showed up before I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd jumped to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Then I wanted to talk it out with you. I really did. I wanted your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was a complete bastard.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I brought you here. I brought you here so you\u2019d know that this isn\u2019t three years ago. When I need to work something out I won\u2019t run from you. But if I come here I need you to know that it\u2019s just a place I like to come for peace and quiet. I\u2019m not shutting you out of it. I want to share it with you.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head to speak quietly against my mouth. \u201cThis is your place. You don\u2019t need to share it with me. Just as long as you share what\u2019s going on with you, I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can definitely do that.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Braden ducked his head as he opened his coat and pulled a small package out of the inside pocket. It was a weird shape and very badly gift-wrapped. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Bemused, I took the present. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, still smiling. \u201cJust something to remind you of who you are and what a great mum you\u2019re going to be.\u201d</p><p>Grateful that he thought so, I quickly unwrapped the gift, my heart flipping over in my chest when I recognized it. It was a silver baby\u2019s rattle and if I turned it I\u2019d find my name engraved on one side and my little sister Beth\u2019s engraved on the other. It had been my rattle and when Beth came along I had my mom get Beth\u2019s name engraved on the other side so I could give it to my little sister. My mom had kept it in a silk-lined box, in the hopes that we\u2019d started a new tradition of passing it down through the family. It wasn\u2019t a story I\u2019d told Braden, even when I\u2019d rescued it from the storage facility in Virginia when we\u2019d gone there to clear out my family\u2019s belongings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even without knowing the story, he\u2019d known it meant a lot to me.</p><p>\u201cI got it out of the box with all the things you\u2019ve kept from your family, had it polished up.\u201d He turned it in my hand so Beth\u2019s name was facing upward. \u201cI was thinking if we have a wee girl, we could name her Beth.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing past the lump of emotion clogging my throat, I nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like that.

My breathing was heavy as I pulled back, my forehead pressing against his. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ve finally made it through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade it through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the crap.\u201d I grinned cheekily. \u201cDo you think we finally get everything about each other?\u201d</p><p>Braden shook his head, pressing another kiss to my lips as I clung to him. \u201cNo, babe. We\u2019re going to spend every day growing up. We\u2019ll learn new things about ourselves, never mind each other.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you that when your fear doesn\u2019t get in the way of your perceptiveness, you are an incredibly wise man, Mr. Carmichael?\u201d</p> <p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cAm I ever going to live this down?\u201d</p><p>I snorted, threading my arm through his as we started to stroll back down the castle hill. \u201cWhen I fucked up you joked about it inappropriately for months and then pulled it out every now and then when you wanted to make a point.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI\u2019ll allow you to emotionally manipulate me with it for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSix months.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. That was a fairly lengthy period of torture and it probably fit in better with our pregnancy time frame. \u201cOkay, six months. But I should warn you that it\u2019ll include more than emotional manipulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElaborate.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant. My requests, cravings, they may get a little outrageous.\u201d</p><p>His body shook with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying my child. I\u2019d probably take the blame if you murdered someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably do that anyway, pregnant or not.\u201d</p><p>Braden smiled softly down at me. \u201cNo probably about it.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I held on tighter. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you come shopping with me for maternity clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can handle it. In fact, I\u2019m rather looking forward to you having a bump.\u201d He smoothed a hand across my stomach, something he\u2019d taken to doing a lot.</p><p>\u201cMy bump? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a caveman thing,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cElaborate.\u201d I repeated his word back at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you want to know. You\u2019ve just recently stopped being pissed off at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraden . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped just as we were about to walk outside the castle entrance onto the esplanade. I let him pull me against him as he bent to whisper his answer in my ear. \u201cWhen every man sees our bump, they\u2019ll know I was the one you let inside you, they\u2019ll know you\u2019re mine and I\u2019m yours, and that growing inside you is our kid.\u201d</p><p>My lips parted as I pulled back to meet his eyes. \u201cThe idea of the bump turns you on,\u201d I said more succinctly.</p><p>He grinned unrepentantly.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me. I start showing during my second trimester, and I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s also when I\u2019ll get horny as hell.\u201d</p><p>Braden grabbed my hand as we began walking down the esplanade. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m expecting a lot,\u201d I teased. \u201cFilthy comments in restaurants, sex in bathrooms, cars, elevators, the changing rooms of maternity clothes shops . . .\u201d</p><p>My husband laughed, letting go of my hand to wrap his arm around my shoulders and draw me into his side. \u201cYou missed the couch, the kitchen table, the shower, the bathtub\u2014and the bed could work, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get a cab.\u201d I began walking faster down the Mile.</p><p>I felt Braden grinning at me. \u201cPregnancy hormones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraden-induced hormones,\u201d I grumbled, flagging down an oncoming black cab. I turned to him, my eyes glittering with anticipation. \u201cSince you fucked up last week, I\u2019m in charge. And on top. We\u2019ll see how it goes from there.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, as if it was such a hardship. \u201cAh, and so it begins.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
