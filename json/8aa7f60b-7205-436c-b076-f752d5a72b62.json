If Bram Rion thought that was news, it came two weeks too late.</p><p>Hovering on the edge of a bottle green armchair, Caden watched Merlin\u0092s grandson slam the door to his palatial home office, locking the Doomsday Brethren into the edgy silence with him. Each were warriors in their own way, most magical. All had the kind of mettle that would have been welcome in the Marine platoon in which Caden had served.</p> <p>Without Bram\u0092s Hollywood smile, magickind\u0092s Brad Pitt looked both jumpy and grave. In fact, all the wizards, and Marrok, the former immortal and King Arthur\u0092s champion, looked grim. The tension ratcheted up, and Caden\u0092s thoughts drifted to his absent brother Lucan, a Doomsday Brethren warrior.</p><p>Please God, let this end soon.</p><p>A loud crash upstairs thumped the ceiling, shook the walls. A woman screamed, terror bleeding from her voice. On the upper floor, a door crashed open, the shrieking grew louder, and footsteps pounded above him. She was running down the stairs. Heading out the door.</p><p>Tearing out of the library, Caden raced to the shrieking blond woman, ignoring Bram\u0092s shout calling him back. He grabbed the frantic witch by her shoulders. Though likely over two hundred, she looked deceptively young. Her wide green eyes were glazed with fear.</p><p>\u0093Wait. Please.\u0094 He caught her anxious gaze. \u0093My brother\u0097\u0094</p> <p>\u0093I can\u0092t.\u0094 Her voice quivered. \u0093He\u0092s big and feral and\u0097 snarled that I smell of another man. He ripped his ch-chains.\u0094 Her words broke with new tears. \u0093And lunged for my throat.\u0094</p><p>Caden closed his eyes and held in a curse. The fifth energy surrogate Lucan had frightened away in two weeks. Now what?</p><p>At the top of the stairs, Bram\u0092s sister Sabelle appeared. Her lace shirt and golden hair were askew, but her demeanor was calm. \u0093I have Lucan under control. Let her go.\u0094</p><p>Instead, Caden clasped the witch tighter. If he released her, what would become of his brother? \u0093He needs her. Without the energy she generates . . .\u0094</p><p>Caden couldn\u0092t finish the sentence. The thought.</p><p>\u0093He\u0092ll die.\u0094 Sabelle sighed. \u0093He misses Anka so deeply that it\u0092s unhinged him mentally. My Aunt Millie says she\u0092s never seen a case of mate mourning this severe.\u0094</p> <p>More dreadful news. Where was the freaking light at the end of the tunnel? Bram and Sabelle had dragged him away from his peaceful life in Dallas two weeks ago; the hell hadn\u0092t let up since. Frustration ate his gut like acid. He didn\u0092t want to fail Lucan. Years ago, he\u0092d been unable to save his younger brother. Damned if he\u0092d let his older one die, too.</p><p>\u0093If Lucan isn\u0092t taking the energy to survive from these women, how can he have enough strength to fight them?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Primal rage,\u0094 Sabelle supplied. \u0093When the surrogates come, it\u0092s as if he\u0092s defending an attack. It\u0092s a delusion, and we can\u0092t explain otherwise to him. All his senses, except smell, have shut down. Surrogates bring the smells of their other clients along unwittingly. Lucan fights back.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Maybe . . . it\u0092s time to consider that he wants death,\u0094 Bram murmured behind him.</p><p>Fury slashed through Caden. What kind of friend even thought that? Caden had held the hands of fallen comrades in Iraq and prayed for their recovery . . . even as some rattled their last breath.</p><p>\u0093My brother will not die like this! I will find Anka and bring her back.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It may be too late. Let the witch go,\u0094 Bram demanded.</p><p>\u0093Please,\u0094 the scared blonde pleaded.</p> <p>Caden shook with rage. He wanted to crush something, punch a wall, lash out at magic, which had again screwed up his life. But the sobbing witch in his grasp shrank back in fear, like he, too, was a monster.</p><p>For about the two hundredth time since returning to England a fortnight ago, Caden cursed magic. To a human male, the loss of a beloved wife could be emotionally devastating. But as a wizard, Lucan\u0092s loss had reduced a perfectly sane person to a rabid animal. The man upstairs wasn\u0092t the older brother Caden had idolized as a child.</p><p>Though he\u0092d left his childhood home a dozen years ago, and disavowed anything or anyone associated with magic, now that tragedy had struck, and he might lose his only remaining brother, a guilt seared Caden. The thought of never speaking to Lucan again? Unthinkable.</p><p>He must restore Lucan\u0092s mental health. To do that, he had to find Anka and return her to his brother\u0092s arms\u0097 quickly. And clearly, the witch Caden currently detained couldn\u0092t help.</p><p>With a sigh, he released her. \u0093Go.\u0094</p><p>She sprinted out and closed the door. Silence reverberated.</p><p>\u0093Come back to my office,\u0094 Bram said.</p><p>Caden whirled on the wizard. \u0093I won\u0092t give up on my brother, damn you!\u0094</p><p>With a twitch of Bram\u0092s finger, Caden was magically hauled back into the office. Caden seethed with resentment as Bram slammed the door behind them. He opened his mouth to give the wizard a furious earful, but Bram held up a hand.</p><p>\u0093I understand your frustration. But our difficulties aren\u0092t merely about you and your family. These problems affect us all.\u0094 He gestured to the other three men in the room. \u0093And the rest of magickind.\u0094</p><p>\u0093My brother is chained to a bed like a lunatic, Anka is missing, and we haven\u0092t a single clue where she\u0092s gone. We cannot make Lucan whole without her return. Nothing is more important.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I wish. Our other problems are many and grave.\u0094</p><p>Ice Rykard, another of the warriors, was a big man, but when annoyance stamped his square, hollow-cheeked face, like now, sane people backed away. \u0093You summoned me here to tell me what I already know?\u0094</p><p>As Ice rose to leave, Bram blocked his path. \u0093Something new has arisen. Prudence requires that we attend to it. All of us.\u0094</p><p>Bram refused to help his brother, then sought his assistance? Caden would have laughed if he weren\u0092t so furious. \u0093I came only to find my brother\u0092s missing mate\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Former mate,\u0094 Bram corrected. \u0093Their bond is broken.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Involuntarily,\u0094 Caden stressed. \u0093I\u0092ve no doubt Lucan still regards Anka as his, and they were in love. Why would she not welcome him back? I\u0092m here to find her so they can bond again, not solve your problems.\u0094</p><p>Bram sighed. \u0093Lucan is my best friend, and I want more than anything to make him whole again. But that is a mission of mercy. The other matters are of life and death.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If you do not help me find Anka, Lucan will die!\u0094</p><p>\u0093If we fail to act on this new problem, thousands, maybe millions, will die. Including Lucan.\u0094</p><p>Sacrificing one for many. Bram had shoved this \u0093necessity\u0094 down Caden\u0092s throat before. His patience was wearing thin. Exhaling, he rubbed gritty eyes. Every day, worrying. Every night, not sleeping\u0097he often paced, Lucan\u0092s mad countenance swimming in his mind. Meanwhile his brother\u0092s \u0093friends\u0094 worried about everyone else.</p><p>\u0093Please.\u0094 Simon Northam, or Duke, the youngest of the Doomsday Brethren, drilled him with a stare. \u0093We need you as much as Lucan. The sooner we tend to these issues, the sooner we can help him.\u0094</p><p>Caden felt four pairs of eyes locked on him. Except for the fact Bram had kept a roof over Lucan\u0092s head, he owed these men nothing. He\u0092d known them a mere fortnight, wanted nothing to do with magickind and their problems. But their stares accused him of abandoning them . . . and Lucan\u0092s cause. Guilt twisted in his gut.</p><p>Blast them! He merely wanted peace and solitude since witnessing half his friends dying in Iraq. Of the few who had survived, two had returned home, only to commit suicide. Another was in prison, unable to make the transition from shooting terrorists in a desert shithole to walking the dog in suburbia. The last had gone missing following a training exercise at his home base. The tragic death of Caden\u0092s younger brother nearly two decades ago had proved that magic\u0092s body count was even more shocking and heartbreaking. He\u0092d had enough of loss, of death. As soon as Lucan recovered, Caden would return to his sedate life as a staff photographer for a Dallas newspaper. No one died taking pictures of city council meetings.</p><p>\u0093The Doomsday Brethren means a great deal to Lucan,\u0094 Bram reminded.</p><p>Manipulative bastard.</p><p>\u0093Besides, you may soon need us. Your magic is coming . . .\u0094</p><p>Caden prayed that his sleeplessness was merely anxiety, stress, and not a harbinger of his own coming transition into magic. But there was no denying the electrical surges and flashes of emotion racing through his body of late. He feared that the witching hour\u0097in this case, his thirtieth birthday\u0097was approaching. \u0093Not if I can help it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You can\u0092t.\u0094 Bram shrugged. \u0093If you have the magic gene, it\u0092s coming.\u0094</p><p>Marrok, the human warrior-giant who looked every inch a medieval knight, from the slash of straight hair that reached his shoulders to the sword strapped to his hip, frowned at Bram. \u0093Does this new problem concern Shock? Have we yet heard from the varlet?\u0094</p><p>The shadiest member of the Doomsday Brethren had been MIA since their battle two weeks ago with the evil wizard Mathias, who sought to control magickind with the help of his minions, the Anarki. During that skirmish, Shock had suddenly appeared to switch his loyalties to the other side. No surprise there, given the man\u0092s dark background. Because Shock was both Anka\u0092s previous suitor and cozy with Mathias, Bram thought he might be willing to divulge Anka\u0092s whereabouts. Caden disagreed. Mathias had brutalized Anka after abducting her and forcing her to break her mate bond with Lucan. Shock had apparently done nothing to help her.</p><p>Bram, Ice, and Duke all shook their heads.</p><p>\u0093Nothing? That is vexing,\u0094 Marrok snarled. \u0093Surely he has told Mathias much about us.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s Mathias\u0092s quiet that disturbs me,\u0094 Ice cut in. \u0093Two weeks of it . . . Right dodgy. Makes me itch.\u0094</p><p>If Caden cared about magickind, he\u0092d agree. But his only mission was to determine what Mathias had done with Anka and return her in the hopes of restoring Lucan\u0092s sanity.</p><p>\u0093During our last battle, Olivia laid a bolt of power on Mathias that should have flattened the bastard,\u0094 drawled Duke. Clad head to toe in designer everything, he looked perfectly urbane and wealthy, the artful muss of his dark hair cut perfectly, just like his aristocratic features, all the way down to his cleft chin. \u0093It appeared to deplete his magic and should have prevented him from rising again, but . . .\u0094</p><p>\u0093This is Mathias,\u0094 Ice finished.</p><p>Exactly. If Mathias regained even half his power, the small but determined cabal of warriors assembled under Bram\u0092s direction were screwed, and every man in the room knew it. How could the Doomsday Brethren kill a wizard who had already returned from the dead once? He had an army of slaves at his disposal. Caden could count the Doomsday Brethren on one hand.</p><p>Bram winced. \u0093I\u0092m afraid, gentlemen, our problems are worse than that.\u0094</p><p>Marrok muttered, \u0093Would that we knew from whence Mathias found so many disposable recruits.\u0094</p><p>Those were troubling, indeed. Mathias had stripped the souls from human bodies to create walking dead Anarki, for the purpose of helping Mathias enslave magickind and destroy the Doomsday Brethren. During their last battle, the black-blooded zombies had been plentiful\u0097and immune to magic.</p><p>\u0093All true,\u0094 Bram conceded. \u0093But I called you here to discuss something even more critical.\u0094</p><p>Ice cast him a cutting stare. \u0093Your magical signature tells me you took a human mate last night? A problem, indeed.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s jaw dropped. Bram, one of the most pedigreed wizards today, had taken a human mate?</p><p>\u0093Wouldn\u0092t your grandfather be proud?\u0094 Ice sneered. \u0093Merlin prized that pure bloodline. Pity.\u0094</p><p>Bram charged toward Ice. \u0093Shut your bloody mouth, you fu\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Cease!\u0094 Marrok grabbed him and held him back.</p><p>Caden was inclined to help. Bram and Ice were always at each other\u0092s throats. If Bram needed wizards loyal to him for the Doomsday Brethren, why the devil had he picked Ice to join?</p><p>\u0093Piss off!\u0094 Bram growled.</p><p>\u0093We can fight no enemy if we are too busy fighting one another,\u0094 Marrok advised.</p><p>\u0093Beating in the tosser\u0092s skull would make me feel better.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What has you on edge?\u0094 Duke asked.</p><p>Caden wondered the same thing. Bram was usually the voice of sanity amidst all this magical muck. At the moment, he behaved as if he was crawling out of his skin, one step away from the mental ward.</p><p>\u0093Where is your mate?\u0094 Ice added fuel to the fire. \u0093I\u0092d like to offer her my condolences.\u0094</p><p>\u0093My mate is none of your concern. However, the Book of Doomsday is.\u0094 Bram hesitated, then rolled his shoulders. \u0093Last night, while I slept, she found it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Found it? Lying about?\u0094 Duke demanded.</p><p>\u0093It was hidden.\u0094 Bram rubbed the back of his neck. \u0093She must have searched for it.\u0094</p><p>An ominous gong clanged in Caden\u0092s gut. Magickind wasn\u0092t his issue, but if that book disappeared . . . everyone, magical and human, was at risk.</p><p>\u0093She cozied up to you to find the book?\u0094 Ice looked ready to laugh.</p><p>Bram didn\u0092t have to answer; the humiliation on his face did it for him.</p><p>\u0093Shut up!\u0094 Caden glared at the stubble-headed wizard, then turned back to Bram. \u0093What happened? Where is the diary?\u0094</p><p>\u0093She took it and disappeared.\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s quiet admission resounded through the room.</p><p>\u0093Fuck,\u0094 Ice muttered.</p><p>\u0093You have no idea where it is?\u0094 Caden struggled to pick his jaw off the floor. \u0093Where she is?\u0094</p><p>\u0093None.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Double fuck,\u0094 came Ice again.</p><p>The Doomsday Diary was the ultimate weapon in the magical war. Used properly, it was rumored to grant any wish, up to and including the world\u0092s annihilation. People had died in Mathias\u0092s quest to obtain it. Lucan\u0092s life was in shambles because of it. The Doomsday Brethren had formed and were fighting a war to protect it. If Mathias obtained the book and used it to bring about doomsday\u0097well, that was everyone\u0092s problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093I second what Ice said,\u0094 Caden muttered.</p><p>\u0093You had no magical protections on the book?\u0094 Duke asked.</p><p>\u0093Of course. Against anyone magical. I never imagined a human would know of the book\u0092s existence, much less that I had it. The only way she could know is if she\u0092s Mathias\u0092s pawn. I worry . . . What if he has the diary now? What will he do to her?\u0094 Bram paced, raking a frantic hand through his golden hair.</p><p>Marrok planted a friendly hand on Bram\u0092s shoulder. \u0093Use your bond to find her.\u0094</p> <p>With a shake of his golden hair, Bram sighed in frustration. \u0093I can\u0092t and I don\u0092t understand why. I should be able to . . . It\u0092s confounding me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You touched her, aye?\u0094 Marrok asked. \u0093Did you not use your powers to read her mind?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes . . . and no. I could read her body with my touch, but not her thoughts. I\u0092ve never encountered such a woman before.\u0094</p><p>Duke sighed. \u0093What the devil should we do now?\u0094</p><p>Panic? Caden kept the thought to himself.</p> <p>\u0093Not to add to our problems, but have you seen this?\u0094 Duke slid a newspaper in the middle of Bram\u0092s desk. The bold black headline screamed Supernatural Forces Battle in South London Tunnel.</p><p>Bram glanced at the paper. \u0093Out of This Realm? It\u0092s a rag. No one takes that rubbish seriously.\u0094</p><p>Not true. Back home, several of the reporters at the Dallas Morning News were addicted to the paper\u0092s imaginative stories. They were more creative than The National Enquirer\u0092s.</p><p>\u0093That may change after this issue\u0092s lead article. The byline belongs to a reporter named Sydney Blair. She\u0092s disturbingly close to the truth. Most news outlets wrote off the battle with Mathias as a foiled terrorist act, a gang initiation, or the work of a madman. Ms. Blair calls it \u0091an ongoing clash between powerful factions within magickind.\u0092 \u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s eyes bulged. \u0093How the bloody hell does she even know there\u0092s a magickind, much less an ongoing battle? Few in magickind know of Mathias\u0092s return.\u0094</p><p>Though Caden had eschewed magic long ago, even he knew the necessity of keeping magickind\u0092s existence a secret from humans. Witch hunts, trials for heresy, and burnings at the stake weren\u0092t distant memories for a society whose citizens often lived to be one thousand. The seventeenth century was, relatively speaking, last year. No one was na\u010fve enough to think that technology was any insurance policy against genocide. People still killed what they didn\u0092t understand.</p> <p>\u0093I consulted Peers and People of Magickind before coming here. I found no mention of her,\u0094 Duke said. \u0093She is no witch, nor is she mated to a wizard.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Human? Mayhap she\u0092s one of Mathias\u0092s soulless minions,\u0094 Marrok suggested.</p><p>\u0093If Mathias wanted to influence humanity, he wouldn\u0092t take over a tabloid reporter\u0092s mind to do it,\u0094 Bram assured. \u0093Besides, if she\u0092s still leading a human life, she could not do so looking like an undead Anarki. The other humans notice walking cadavers.\u0094</p><p>\u0093So she\u0092s fully human,\u0094 Duke surmised. \u0093And frightfully well informed.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Or perhaps . . .\u0094 Ice glared at him. \u0093She\u0092s getting her information from someone who rejected magickind and would celebrate its end.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Me?\u0094 Caden jumped in the big wizard\u0092s face. \u0093I\u0092ve no love for magic, true, but I would never advocate mass murder. Besides, ending you all would mean my brother\u0092s death. Would I be here saving him if I was willing to kill magickind?\u0094</p><p>Duke nodded, the cooler head prevailing. \u0093He\u0092s right.\u0094</p><p>Muttering, Ice backed away. Barely.</p> <p>Turning back to the newspaper, Duke went on, \u0093Whoever she is, she\u0092s dangerous. The rest of the article is equally disturbing. \u0091The bodies discovered in the tunnel are decomposed far beyond expected, given their recent deaths.\u0092 \u0094</p><p>\u0093This is no secret.\u0094 Marrok waved his words away. \u0093The media has been scratching over that like a mongrel with fleas.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Listen further,\u0094 Duke barked. \u0093 \u0091Out of This Realm has learned the bodies bear new wounds and fresh traces of gunpowder, suggesting they somehow fought in the battle, rather than merely being left behind as a macabre message. It appears as if they were actually more dead than alive prior to the battle, but able to fight due to evil magic.\u0092 \u0094</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s guessing,\u0094 said Bram.</p><p>But even he didn\u0092t sound convinced. Caden winced.</p><p>Duke shook his head. \u0093Here\u0092s more: \u0091According to an anonymous source, there\u0092s a mad wizard on the loose once more, allegedly fighting social injustice in the magical world. He\u0092ll stop at nothing to tear down the establishment and replace it with his version of anarchy.\u0092 \u0094</p><p>Caden shook his head. Poor magical bastards.</p><p>\u0093Who is this anonymous source?\u0094 Bram demanded.</p><p>Duke laced his fingers together with quiet concern. \u0093Ms. Blair claims it\u0092s \u0091a witch who recently found herself tangled in this magical war.\u0092 \u0094</p><p>\u0093A witch?\u0094 Ice spat. \u0093Who knows so much?\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s heart stuttered and adrenaline charged. \u0093Anka.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Or perhaps any of the other missing women, like Craddock\u0092s daughter,\u0094 Ice pointed out. \u0093But what witch in her right mind would spill sensitive secrets to a bloody reporter?\u0094</p><p>Who knew? Still . . . \u0093It could be Anka,\u0094 Caden insisted.</p><p>And possibly the first clue Caden had discovered to her whereabouts in a fortnight.</p><p>\u0093Whoever her source, Sydney Blair knows there\u0092s a magickind, that we\u0092re at war, and that Mathias is supposedly fighting the Social Order,\u0094 Duke insisted.</p><p>\u0093The moment anyone actually listens, humanity will hunt us. It\u0092ll make the Inquisition seem like a bloody holiday.\u0094 Bram raked a hand through his disheveled golden hair and continued to pace. \u0093And if Mathias reads this, her life may well be in danger. We must handle this situation immediately.\u0094</p><p>Bram leaned back against his desk. The morning sun slanted through the office\u0092s open shutters, showing just how much strain the wizard was enduring. He swallowed, then pinned a wily gaze on Caden that made his blood freeze. \u0093I know how we can deal with Ms. Blair. You\u0092ve worked at a newspaper.\u0094</p><p>Caden sent him a wary glance. \u0093So?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Offer your services as a photographer and shut her up, before she reveals anything more about magickind.\u0094</p><p>He didn\u0092t want to get involved. \u0093Why don\u0092t you visit her and do that wizard mind-reading trick of yours?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Only works if I\u0092m touching a woman\u0097deeply. Now that I\u0092m mated . . . well, I can no longer get that close to Sydney Blair, or any woman except mine. So you\u0092ll have to go and pry information from her the human way.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s thoughts raced. Perhaps he could placate them and help his brother. If he worked for Ms. Blair, he could discern if her anonymous source was Anka.</p><p>Bram smiled tightly. Bloody bastard had Caden by the balls and he knew it. In order to make Lucan whole, he must find his brother\u0092s mate. At the moment, the reporter was his best\u0097and only\u0097lead.</p><p>\u0093Have we come to the part yet where I spank you?\u0094</p><p>Sydney Blair closed her eyes as the last notes of \u0093Happy Birthday\u0094 echoed through the small conference room. Had her perpetually randy coworker, Jamie, actually suggested a little light S&amp;M with the entire staff of Out of This Realm looking on?</p><p>A dozen of the newspaper\u0092s employees twittered with nervous laughter, except her yummy new photographer, Caden MacTavish. Mortified, Sydney risked a glance at him. The taut arms bunched over his wide chest and the chilly blue of his watchful eyes made her wince.</p><p>Sydney slowly turned to the office lothario with a glare that let him know how little she appreciated his comment. He merely wagged his brows at her and grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>\u0093Have we come to the part yet where you leave?\u0094 Caden countered.</p><p>The words somehow sounded polite. Caden had that upper crust Londoner sound, though muted by time elsewhere. But he could still say most anything and sound civilized. His current expression, on the other hand, rivaled Attila the Hun\u0092s on a bad day.</p><p>\u0093You think you should be first to have a go at her?\u0094 Jamie challenged Caden. \u0093I\u0092ve seen how you stare.\u0094</p><p>Sydney went hot all over\u0097from more than simple embarrassment. Caden lit her up like a millennium fireworks show. She\u0092d be thrilled if the man had sexual thoughts of her. But in the few days she\u0092d worked with him, he had not appeared to notice her more than professionally, despite Jamie\u0092s delusions to the contrary.</p><p>\u0093Bad karma!\u0094 Aquarius, her flower-child assistant, scolded. \u0093Mellow!\u0094</p><p>Neither spared a glance for the little waif. Silver bracelets tinkling, Aquarius reached out to Caden. Whether she intended to soothe him or test his aura, Sydney didn\u0092t know. She shot a warning glance at her assistant. Now was not a good time for her healing-crystal/save-the-world routine.</p><p>\u0093You may find this concept hard to grasp,\u0094 Caden asserted, \u0093but some men are capable of admiring more about a woman than what\u0092s in her knickers.\u0094</p><p>Jamie scoffed. \u0093If he\u0092s a nancy boy.\u0094</p><p>Sydney smothered a laugh. Caden was definitely not gay. Despite that, she felt certain he\u0092d never considered what went in her knickers. \u0093Stop it, both of you! This is a birthday party, not a brawl.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s your wish?\u0094 asked Leslie from Circulation, trying to smooth the tension.</p><p>A romping shag with Caden, but since that wasn\u0092t likely to happen . . . head reporter had a lovely ring to it. Sure, she worked for a paranormal tabloid that few took seriously, but it paid the bills. Soon, she hoped to make a name for herself writing stories that traditional journalists eschewed. And people everywhere would recognize her once she found proof of the supernatural. Until then she would write about the world she believed must exist\u0097and her parents had utterly rejected. Besides, Out of This Realm was a scream to work at. Where else could she collect a salary for chasing Ripper ghosts and conducting interviews at the London Psychic Centre?</p><p>Her personal life, on the other hand? Disaster. How did one manage to become a sad spinster at twenty-eight? The endless string of dates from her uni days had been replaced with deadlines and staff meetings. Her last boyfriend . . . his pretty face had failed to compensate for the fact he had the IQ of a dead houseplant and the emotional range of a pea. Perhaps she should wish for a man.</p><p>For Caden.</p><p>Yummy waves of chocolate hair with caramel streaks, fathomless blue eyes, a body that belonged in magazines\u0097 and a reserved exterior that made her long to know the man beneath. Too bad the attraction didn\u0092t run both ways. She sighed.</p><p>\u0093She can\u0092t tell us her wish or it won\u0092t come true,\u0094 Holly, her editor, pointed out, then faced Sydney. \u0093Now stop fannying about and open your gifts.\u0094</p><p>Sydney looked at the gifts on the table, but her gaze strayed to Caden, who continued glaring at Jamie.</p><p>He was a puzzle, that one.</p><p>From the moment Caden had walked in the door, he\u0092d been fixated on that battle in the South London tunnel a few weeks back. He\u0092d said her story about the magical war was utter rubbish . . . but asked a load of questions, especially about her source. Not that Sydney would tell him\u0097or anyone else\u0097the woman\u0092s name. Impossible, anyway. She didn\u0092t know it.</p><p>Aquarius distracted the tense crowd by shoving a bright pink floral-wrapped box into Sydney\u0092s hands. From the number of packages stacked on the small round table in the conference room, it looked as if everyone had brought her something.</p><p>\u0093You shouldn\u0092t have gone to such trouble.\u0094</p><p>\u0093We want to show you how much we appreciate you,\u0094 said Leslie.</p><p>Aquarius started pouring cups of her infamous homeblended herbal tea as Sydney unwrapped gifts. A pair of delicate silver earrings, a relaxing massage at a local day spa, and a sumptuous Italian silk scarf trimmed in blue crushed velvet. Jamie gave her a gift certificate for a large pizza and a Blockbuster card\u0097both of which he\u0092d likely insist on sharing. Caden had given her a somewhat impersonal card and a small box of nice chocolates. She would have preferred a hungry kiss.</p><p>Wrapping paper and greeting cards littered the table when Sydney at last got to Aquarius\u0092s package. The young woman was practically vibrating with excitement. \u0093Open this! It\u0092s from me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You baked and organized and still got me something? You shouldn\u0092t have.\u0094</p><p>With the butterfly tattoo on her shoulder and her mesh and lace top, Aquarius didn\u0092t dress like a normal assistant and refused to make coffee\u0097too full of chemicals and caffeine. She wasn\u0092t good with a computer . . . yet. But Aquarius had a knack for stories, for juggling Sydney\u0092s hectic schedule, fielding the editor-in-chief, soothing paranoid readers and keeping internal chaos at a minimum. And despite being total opposites, she and Aquarius had become good friends. Sydney smiled at the thought.</p><p>\u0093Are you two going to start snogging or are you going to open that?\u0094 Jamie hollered.</p><p>After tossing another glare at Jamie, Sydney turned to the gift. It was square and slightly heavy. Aquarius had wrapped it in buttery yellow linen and an over layer of white lace\u0097 different from her usual recycled choice.</p><p>\u0093Open it. Go on,\u0094 she whispered.</p><p>An odd anticipation revved through Sydney as she plucked at the silky white bow and tore open the wrapping to reveal . . . a book. An old-fashioned book. A red leather cover with gilt framing and some sort of scripty-looking symbol on the front. Sydney tried to hide her confusion.</p><p>Caden elbowed in and gave the book a very hard stare.</p><p>Aquarius laughed and urged her, \u0093Read the card inside.\u0094</p><p>With a shrug, she opened the cover to reveal. Hmm . . . An empty book with ever-so-slightly yellowed pages and a little white square of paper with a formal-looking script that read:</p><p>On these magical pages, spill your sensual fantasy,</p><p>In a mere day\u0092s time, your wishes will become reality. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A kiss, a touch, a whisper, whatever you most desire,</p><p>In the arms of your lover, pleasure will burn hotter than fire.</p><p>What? Aquarius believed this book could make sexual fantasies a reality? Sydney would love that, and she believed in magic, but this little unassuming book? In her hands?</p><p>Caden prowled close beside her, elbowing in for yet a closer look. He stared hard at the little journal, and she could smell that musky, woodsy scent of his that drove her mad.</p> <p>\u0093May I see that?\u0094 he demanded more than asked, reaching for the book.</p><p>\u0093Certainly,\u0094 Sydney murmured, handing it over. The lowcut black jumper she\u0092d worn yesterday had done nothing to snag his attention. This book? He was enraptured.</p><p>Aquarius sent her a secretive smile. \u0093Syd, do you understand? It\u0092s\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093An old book,\u0094 Jamie hollered, edging in behind her.</p><p>\u0093What good is that?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093I appreciate each gift. Thank you, everyone,\u0094 Sydney said through clenched teeth. \u0093I suspect we should get back to work now.\u0094 Maybe that would make Jamie shove off.</p><p>Around her, the small crowd began to file out. Unfortunately, Jamie lingered. Sydney, her assistant, and Caden, still studying the book, also occupied the dusk-shadowed room.</p><p>\u0093If you want something special for your birthday, I\u0092ll make time for you this weekend,\u0094 Jamie offered with a leer as he dropped a hand on her hip and slid it toward her backside.</p><p>Sydney eased away and opened her mouth to defer to the mountain of work on her desk when Caden grabbed Jamie\u0092s wrist and squeezed\u0097hard.</p><p>\u0093Bloody hell!\u0094 He jerked away and glared at Caden.</p><p>Normally, such high-handed tactics would annoy Sydney. She was a grown woman and knew how to fend off male octopi like Jamie. But if Caden\u0092s unexpected caveman impression put the lazy sod off until she found a more private moment to tell him to get lost, splendid. If Caden was just the slightest bit jealous, even better.</p> <p>\u0093What the devil?\u0094 Jamie cried. \u0093Let go!\u0094</p><p>\u0093As soon as you do.\u0094 Caden tightened his grip.</p><p>Jamie released her immediately. \u0093Ring me this weekend if you want company.\u0094</p><p>As Caden watched Jamie\u0092s retreating back, he scowled. The waves of his silent disapproval towered over Sydney like a tsunami. She bit her lip.</p><p>\u0093Would you mind speaking to me in your office for a few minutes?\u0094 he said.</p><p>As always, the tone was polite. She wondered if he thought to warn her about the evils of Jamie. Like an overprotective brother lecturing his adolescent sister? Depressing thought. Did she have to jump on Caden while naked before he understood?</p><p>\u0093Fine.\u0094 Might as well get it over with.</p><p>Caden raised a dark brow at her sharp tone and gestured to the door. \u0093After you.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Wait!\u0094 Aquarius snatched the book from Caden and gave it to Sydney. \u0093Your gift! I should tell you about it.\u0094</p><p>Oh, the \u0093magical diary.\u0094 She couldn\u0092t leave without hurting Aquarius\u0092s feelings. Her confrontation with Caden would have to wait.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll be there in a minute.\u0094</p><p>After a long glance at her, then the book, Caden nodded and slipped from the room.</p><p>Sydney dug her fingernails out of her palms, so frustrated she feared she would draw blood. Being a petite redhead, she didn\u0092t have a centerfold\u0092s breasts and wasn\u0092t one of those model-like creatures men got all in a froth about. But Caden treated her almost asexually.</p><p>\u0093You want him,\u0094 Aquarius whispered. It wasn\u0092t a question.</p><p>\u0093I couldn\u0092t want him any more than if I\u0092d shot myself with Cupid\u0092s arrow.\u0094 She tossed her hands up in the air. \u0093He doesn\u0092t reciprocate.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You don\u0092t know that,\u0094 Aquarius argued.</p><p>\u0093Perhaps. He\u0092s impossible to read. So bloody private.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t think he\u0092s as immune to you as you imagine.\u0094</p><p>She shook her head glumly. \u0093I\u0092d love to believe that. No, I\u0092d love to experience it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You can.\u0094 Aquarius tapped the cover of the old book. \u0093He can be yours for the night.\u0094</p><p>Caden could have his pick of women. Besides being good-looking, intelligent, and polite, he had proven dependable thus far. He wasn\u0092t lazy and seemed to truly listen. What woman wouldn\u0092t want a total package? Yesterday\u0092s snug shirt had outlined a positively yummy chest. And he was probably devastatingly good in bed\u0097not that she\u0092d ever know personally.</p><p>Or could she?</p><p>Sydney frowned. The idea tempted her. Could this journal possibly be magical? It sounded awfully fantastical\u0097not that such a book existed, but that it had dropped into her lap. Supposing it had . . . would Caden truly be hers for the night after she jotted down a few ideas that involved scented massage oil, a big bed, and his naked body?</p><p>She cast a gentle glance at her assistant. \u0093You believe this book is real?\u0094</p><p>\u0093It made one of my fantasies come true,\u0094 Aquarius blurted. \u0093Remember Alex, that yummy neighbor I told you about? He asked me out when I wrote down exactly what I wanted.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Aquarius, he had an itch for you, so when his calendar opened up, he rang.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And read my mind?\u0094 Aquarius challenged. \u0093Until last week, I never knew making love under a waterfall would be so . . . invigorating.\u0094</p><p>\u0093A waterfall? Where did you find\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll never tell.\u0094 She smiled coyly.</p><p>\u0093Let me get this straight: This hunky bloke suddenly appeared and whisked you away to fulfill your fantasy, exactly as you wrote it?\u0094</p><p>Dreamy didn\u0092t begin to describe Aquarius\u0092s faraway expression. \u0093It was fantastic.\u0094</p><p>Sydney groped around for a chair. \u0093Maybe you need a holiday. You\u0092re past due.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m completely sane. Though I enjoyed Alex, he wasn\u0092t right for me\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No man ever is.\u0094</p><p>Aquarius frowned. \u0093There\u0092s a man out there. Somewhere. I\u0092ll know when I meet him.\u0094</p><p>Sydney had heard this before.</p><p>\u0093Point is, I don\u0092t need this journal.\u0094 Aquarius shoved it at to her. \u0093But you . . .\u0094</p><p>\u0093But me . . . what?\u0094 Sydney fisted her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u0093Well, if you want Caden, write your fantasy in here.\u0094</p><p>The idea was tempting. With her luck, Caden would find the fantasy she\u0092d written. Since she didn\u0092t think he wanted her, mortified wouldn\u0092t begin to cover how bad she\u0092d want to crawl into a hole and wait for a new millennium.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t think that\u0092s a good idea.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Neither is pining away. Look,\u0094 her voice dropped to a whisper, \u0093take the diary with you this weekend and write your deepest desire about Caden. Wait a day or two. If it doesn\u0092t come true, what have you lost? When I return from holiday, I\u0092m sure you\u0092ll have loads to tell me.\u0094</p><p>Caden marched into Sydney\u0092s office and barely refrained from slamming the door. The fiery sun setting over the jagged London skyline matched his mood. The Doomsday Diary, here? In human hands? He must steal it from Sydney, remove her from danger. He needed a plan. Now.</p><p>But he was besieged by an equally strong urge to punch both Bram Rion and Jamie What\u0092s-his-name.</p><p>Wanting to beat Bram to a pulp? Caden understood that well. Bram embodied so much of what he despised about magic: the blithe assumption of supremacy, unpredictability, the utter inability to compromise, and the total lack of awareness that it might be required. Magic\u0092s inequality chafed as well. In a human world, anyone could learn to defend themselves and grow stronger each day\u0097or buy a better weapon. In the magical world, a witch or wizard never had more power than they were born with, and if they found themselves at the mercy of someone more evil and powerful than themselves . . . God help them.</p><p>But Caden\u0092s reaction to Jamie he didn\u0092t understand. Nor could he grasp his own drive to possess Sydney so completely that she was unaware another male even existed. He\u0092d done his best to ignore it, hide it, but she\u0092d become a fever in his blood. The urge defied logic. He was on a mission. He was good at those, thanks to the U.S. Marine Corps. Focus. Get in, get out, get the job done, end of story. Don\u0092t do anything stupid.</p><p>Falling in life-altering lust with Sydney, particularly now, fell into the stupid category. Yet he couldn\u0092t stop. His assignment was to prevent Sydney from revealing more about magickind\u0097a move that would protect her too\u0097and discover if Anka was her source of information. Unfortunately, he was finding it difficult to focus on more than pushing the saucy reporter against a wall, kissing her senseless, then shagging her into sighing bliss.</p><p>Damn it all! He hadn\u0092t been na\u010fve enough to believe that his assignment at Out of This Realm would be easy, but he\u0092d had little success tracking down Sydney\u0092s source of information while stifling her stories. She was infuriatingly and admirably determined. Throw in the sudden and unexpected appearance of the Doomsday Diary? This had become what his platoon buddies called a cluster-fuck.</p><p>Cursing, he pulled his mobile phone from his belt and dialed an increasingly familiar number.</p><p>Bram answered immediately. \u0093You have news?\u0094</p><p>Did he ever, but first things first. \u0093How is my brother?\u0094</p><p>Bram hesitated. \u0093Weak. We\u0092re doing our best, but we\u0092re running out of options.\u0094</p><p>The wizard\u0092s words were a stab in the chest. \u0093Don\u0092t you dare let him die while I\u0092m in London doing your dirty work.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Believe me, if I had anyone else suited to this task, you would still be gnashing your teeth here at Lucan\u0092s bedside. Matters are too critical for me to be there. Duke can pass as a human, but who would believe that the Duke of Hurstgrove wants a job at a tabloid? That leaves a fifteen-hundred-year-old warrior, an attitude-challenged wizard, and you. You alone have both experience in photography and the human world.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your problem is mine only as long as my brother is alive. If he dies, I cease to care. Are you clear?\u0094</p><p>\u0093As if you\u0092d drawn me a picture.\u0094 Bram shot back. \u0093Believe me, as desperately as we need wizards for this fight, I\u0092ll happily release you when I can. I want only those committed to the cause.\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s intimation that he wasn\u0092t good enough annoyed Caden. He shrugged it off. What did he care if Bram didn\u0092t see him as a member of the team he hadn\u0092t wished to join?</p><p>He\u0092d wanted nothing to do with magic since his younger brother\u0092s death\u0097by his own mother\u0092s magic. An accident, yes. But he\u0092d been just twelve when Westin, barely toddling, had been stricken.</p><p>Since leaving home at eighteen, he\u0092d lived happily among humanity. Their ways seemed normal, comfortable. Being back among magickind now merely reminded Caden of all the reasons he loathed it. This gut-wrenching madness of Lucan\u0092s merely underscored everything.</p><p>\u0093Rion, do you honestly believe that you and a handful of wizards can defeat the most powerful magical creature in a millennium and his growing army?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps not, but we\u0092ll certainly fail if we don\u0092t try. Why do you care as long as Lucan stays alive?\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092d better.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m against this, but Sabelle insists on being his surrogate. Or attempting.\u0094</p><p>Brilliant! Though Bram\u0092s protective attitude was hardly a surprise. But Sabelle was a tough, courageous witch with the unusual ability to make others feel whatever she wanted with a touch. If anyone besides Anka could provide Lucan energy, it was Sabelle.</p><p>\u0093Tell your sister I appreciate her more than she can know.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No guarantee it will work.\u0094</p><p>It had to. \u0093Thank her anyway.\u0094</p><p>\u0093All right, then. What news have you to report?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve learned little about Sydney\u0092s source of information. She\u0092s guarding the name like a national secret.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Seduce her. Charm her.\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s suggestion made Caden grit his teeth. He didn\u0092t have Bram\u0092s easy way\u0097and he was completely enthralled with the woman he was supposed to bamboozle. He wanted her more than his next breath\u0097and was desperate to bury the feeling.</p><p>\u0093Her secret is the least of our issues at the moment. I\u0092m having a devil of a time stalling her next story. Before the bodies were removed from the tunnel, Sydney\u0092s previous photographer took a few pictures. Grainy and fuzzy, which works in our favor, but we know of no one else who arrived in time to snap any, so she\u0092s still scooped every other news source. People will pick up Out of This Realm in droves, I fear, if she prints it with a proposed story that these men comprise Mathias\u0092s unwilling Anarki army, out to dissolve the Social Order and eradicate the Doomsday Brethren.\u0094</p><p>Bram sounded ready to hit the ceiling. \u0093She knows about us? Where is she getting this information?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092d like to know that myself and have no clue. Unfortunately, it gets worse.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Worse?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. I found the Doomsday Diary. Sydney Blair acquired it fifteen minutes ago.\u0094</p><p>Bram cursed a stream of loud, ugly words.</p><p>\u0093On that, we\u0092re agreed,\u0094 Caden supplied.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re absolutely certain?\u0094</p><p>\u0093There can\u0092t be many old red books bearing Morganna le Fay\u0092s symbol.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Send me a picture.\u0094</p><p>Bram didn\u0092t trust him. Whatever.</p><p>\u0093Bloody hell. Better yet, steal it from her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She won\u0092t let it loose soon. It was a birthday gift from a dear friend.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Who?\u0094 Bram snapped.</p><p>\u0093Aquarius.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The astrological sign?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sydney\u0092s assistant,\u0094 Caden corrected. \u0093Is she your mate?\u0094</p><p>\u0093That wasn\u0092t the name\u0097describe her. Perhaps my missing \u0091wife\u0092 uses aliases.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Short, almost fey looking. Brown wavy hair to her waist, green eyes\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not even close. Which raises the question, if Sydney acquired the book from this woman who is definitely not my mate, how did she get her hands on it?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I was hoping you could shed some light.\u0094</p><p>\u0093None. Ask her. Maybe she\u0092ll know how to locate my mate.\u0094 Frustration oozed from every syllable. \u0093But we must recover that diary. Now.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I have good news and bad news about that. The bad news is that Sydney is a smart, tenacious reporter who\u0092s determined to keep writing \u0091fresh paranormal stories,\u0092 in her words.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Which means she may choose to write about the diary.\u0094 He groaned. \u0093How can there possibly be good news?\u0094</p><p>\u0093She doesn\u0092t know its purpose. Yet. She\u0092s been told that writing in the book will grant her sexual fantasies. And I\u0092m not sure she\u0092s convinced it\u0092s real.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Pray it stays that way, at least long enough for you to do whatever you must\u0097steal, sweet talk, or seduce her away from that book.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll work on that while determining the name of her source. You\u0092re coming to help, right? Use a bit of magic and . . .\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Can\u0092t. There was another Anarki attack two hours ago. I\u0092ve just left what was the Pullmans\u0092 estate. Burned to the ground. Their newly transitioned daughter is missing. Everyone else is dead. I have to report to the Council.\u0094</p><p>That wasn\u0092t good news. If the Anarki were attacking again, that meant Mathias was on the mend and his power rising once more. Caden didn\u0092t want to care, but . . . he rubbed his tired eyes with his fingers. After seeing so much war and death in his life, attacks on families, on women, troubled him.</p><p>\u0093What will you do next?\u0094</p><p>Bram sighed. \u0093What we have been: keep searching for Mathias, not to mention Shock and his brother, Zain, who appears to be the evil bastard\u0092s right-hand lackey.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Have you considered telling other magical families about this attack? They have to start protecting themselves.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093So you\u0092re going to pretend you care about magickind now?\u0094</p><p>Caden restrained a growl. \u0093I would not wish what\u0092s happened to my family on another.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Rumors are beginning to spread about Mathias\u0092s return, but the decision to officially tell magickind falls with the Council. They approve transcasts and issue edicts.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Certainly a few words on how best to defend yourself\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Which is why no such edict will be created any time soon. No one knows how to defend against Mathias, and the Council would rather err on the side of silence than inaccuracy. Bloody stupid bastards.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re one of them,\u0094 Caden pointed out.</p> <p>\u0093The lone voice of reason, I assure you. I\u0092ve long argued that we should communicate magical news via transcasts or the like frequently. But by the time the Council agrees to the verbiage . . .\u0094 Bram scoffed. \u0093It\u0092s old news.\u0094</p><p>That didn\u0092t surprise Caden. Dawdling old fools, Lucan had long said, even their Uncle Sterling at times.</p><p>Caden was curious why Bram stayed on the Council, likely enduring one frustration after another. But it was none of Caden\u0092s affair. He didn\u0092t want to become more entangled in the magical world. Already, he was in too deep.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ll come to assist with the diary once you\u0092ve helped the victims of the latest attack?\u0094</p><p>\u0093As soon as I can,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093Keep working on Sydney Blair.\u0094</p><p>Caden could think of any number of ways in which he\u0092d like to work on Sydney. Completely naked with her on her back, came immediately to mind. But that couldn\u0092t happen. Now he needed to focus on his brother. \u0093I will.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>CADEN RANG OFF WITH Bram just before Sydney\u0092s door burst open. In walked the source of his frustrations and fantasies, carrying the little red book.</p> <p>A fresh wave of lust blazed across his senses. An electric pulse revved down his spine, shuddered across his skin. He burned with need. What the devil was wrong with him? Lately, he\u0092d felt . . . off. Tired one minute, wired the next. His senses quickened, his fingertips tingled. The odd sweating out of nowhere . . . bloody awful, but it fit with his libido being ever ready.</p><p>What ailed him? A frustrating mission? The redheaded dynamo who drove him beyond sanity? Yes to both. The stress wasn\u0092t helping. And he missed his job and his adopted home in Dallas, away from all this hocus-pocus. But he feared the problem\u0092s true cause was magic. The urge to flee before it ripped away another loved one loomed large.</p><p>\u0093What is it, MacTavish?\u0094 She thrust one hand on her hip. The other held the Doomsday Diary casually. God, if she had any idea what that book could do . . . he had to wrest it from her as quickly as possible.</p><p>Surreptitiously, he withdrew his mobile phone from his belt, pretending to sort through the menus. Quickly, he snapped a picture.</p><p>\u0093Hey!\u0094 she protested.</p><p>\u0093Sorry. New phone. Was trying to silence it. Still learning.\u0094</p><p>She paused. \u0093What do you want? If you\u0092ve no need to talk, I have a pub stool and a pint waiting for me.\u0094</p><p>She was in a snit. Caden hoped she wasn\u0092t angry that he\u0092d dismissed Jamie. The thought that she might have any interest in that knuckle-dragger made him grind his teeth.</p><p>\u0093Right, then. I have some questions.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Shocking.\u0094 She crossed the room, slim hips swaying.</p><p>A caustic Sydney was a dazzling sight. He shouldn\u0092t stare, but she\u0092d snared him from the first, dug under his skin. Pink tinged her fair face, and her auburn hair tumbled across her shoulders. Those flashing brown eyes were a sucker punch to his gut.</p><p>Don\u0092t think about her. Think smart. Think mission.</p><p>He\u0092d rather think about having her naked underneath him.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll get to the point.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Lovely.\u0094</p><p>Sydney stood her ground and stared back with admirable moxie for someone who didn\u0092t reach his chin. She defended her stories with considerable passion and wit, fighting back when things got rough. The fact she was also smart and sexy made her damn near impossible to resist.</p><p>\u0093But let me first say,\u0094 she went on. \u0093If you\u0092re going to warn me about the evils of Jamie, I\u0092m a big girl.\u0094</p><p>He hadn\u0092t planned on it, but since she\u0092d brought it up. . . .\u0093Are you actually interested in him?\u0094</p><p>She shrugged defensively. \u0093Why do you care?\u0094</p><p>The possibility drove him mad. He\u0092d never been jealous of such a wanker. He\u0092d never been jealous, period. Splendid, a new low for him. And if the truth slipped out, she would know he wanted her in his bed, her nails in his back, screaming his name. She\u0092d given off clues that she felt similarly, so revealing his desire would be a match on kindling. Still, he must have latent masochistic tendencies because the urge to tell Sydney in excruciating detail exactly how he wanted her bombarded him. But if he let himself be distracted, he might never find Anka. And his brother could pass to his nextlife.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s none of my business, I grant you. We\u0092ve been working together just a few days, and I don\u0092t know you well. But I think you can do better.\u0094</p><p>Sydney cocked her head. \u0093Are you offering?\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s heart skipped a beat before blasting into a furious rhythm. Though every muscle in his body tensed at her suggestion, he doubted Sydney knew how close she was to feeling her desk against her back.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m merely saying that you\u0092re a beautiful, talented woman. You deserve more.\u0094</p><p>Sydney looked at him from beneath the veil of her ginger-shaded lashes. Cunning shone in those brown eyes. And desire. The seductive sight was a blow to his gut. Bloody hell, that was the kind of look that made him ache to give her everything she desired.</p><p>\u0093Why do you care?\u0094</p><p>The truth would land them both in trouble. \u0093If Jamie turns out to be an ax murderer, I\u0092m out of a job.\u0094</p><p>Sydney rolled her eyes. \u0093Prat. I\u0092m leaving. On Monday, we\u0092ll continue with the magical battle story. I might have the needed facts by then.\u0094</p><p>He tensed, but did his best to act casually. \u0093You\u0092ll be talking to your source over the weekend?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps. It depends on how willing she is to talk.\u0094</p><p>Not only did Caden need to find out if Anka was her source, he feared that Syndey\u0092s stories made her a target for Mathias. Now that she had the Doomsday Diary, he worried even more.</p><p>\u0093I have a great deal of experience at extracting information from interview subjects. If you brought me along\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Nice try, but no. Besides, I\u0092m not certain she\u0092ll emerge from hiding.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll protect her, if that\u0092s her concern.\u0094 And you.</p><p>She waved his suggestion away. \u0093You can\u0092t, not against magic. But this conversation leads me to wonder . . . if you have so much experience back in the States working for a \u0091reputable\u0092 paper, why have you chosen to work for Out of This Realm?\u0094</p><p>Clever. Caden wasn\u0092t surprised she was questioning his cover. Maddened . . . but not surprised.</p><p>\u0093As I mentioned when I started Monday, my brother is ill and requires my care. I don\u0092t know how long he\u0092ll need me, and a man has to make a living.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. What ails him again?\u0094</p><p>Explaining mate mourning to a human? A definite no-no. \u0093His physicians aren\u0092t certain, so I may be here for some time. While here, I could be very beneficial to you.\u0094</p><p>Beneficial, indeed. Sydney could picture it. Craved it, in fact. But if he was interested in anything beyond a platonic working relationship, he was doing a bloody good job of hiding it.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll keep that in mind,\u0094 she said finally. \u0093I\u0092m off for the weekend. Ta ta.\u0094</p><p>She turned to go, but he grabbed her arm. His hand felt warm, large. Real honest-to-goodness tingles shot through her body as he swung her around.</p><p>\u0093Wait! The continuation of the battle in the tunnel, will you run that story next week?\u0094</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath. \u0093If my source talks more over the weekend, I might have enough information. If not, I have a list of related stories I may be able to flesh out. Holly says circulation is up, and readers are eager for more about magickind.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Let me help you. Please.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Because . . . ?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your work is fascinating.\u0094</p><p>Really? He usually seemed annoyed. \u0093Why aren\u0092t you interested in my other stories?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Cheeseburger-addicted alien attacks London McDonald\u0092s? Stonehenge vandalized by ghosts? A vicar\u0092s conversation with Kurt Cobain?\u0094</p><p>\u0093The first story wasn\u0092t mine originally. I only followed up, as ordered. The other two might be perfectly legitimate. Who knows Stonehenge\u0092s secrets, and the vicar might have connections to the other side. How are those less credible than a magical war?\u0094</p><p>He hesitated, rubbing that square chin she\u0092d spent hours looking at of late. \u0093You have an information source who isn\u0092t in an asylum, for one. At least you haven\u0092t mentioned that she is. But given that she\u0092s a recluse. . . .\u0094</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s not mad, but she fears she\u0092s in danger,\u0094 Sydney replied tartly. \u0093Her fear may be nothing more than a punchline to you, but this poor woman has been terrorized\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not laughing. If she\u0092s afraid, I\u0092m a former U.S. Marine, skilled at hand-to-hand combat and trained as a sniper. I could lend a sense of security, which might persuade her to open up.\u0094</p><p>Truly? Sydney hadn\u0092t known any of that, but he had a military sharpness about him. \u0093Your shoulders are as wide as a mountain and you smile as often as a mortician. The woman was repeatedly raped. You\u0092ll scare the piss out of her, more like. You\u0092re not going. Anything else?\u0094</p><p>Caden clenched his jaw. \u0093You\u0092re making a mistake.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s mine to make. Arguments aside, a few of my friends are waiting for me at the pub \u0092round the corner. Join us?\u0094</p><p>Sydney held her breath. Spending the evening with Caden, knocking back a few, flirting . . . seeing where it led, would be one of the best birthday presents ever. Yes, he worked with her, and she knew she shouldn\u0092t shit where she ate, as the saying went. But something about him had her positively giddy.</p><p>He shook his head. \u0093I need to visit my brother. Enjoy your birthday.\u0094</p><p>Without him? It wouldn\u0092t be nearly as much fun. His refusal hurt more than it should. She wanted him. Short of stripping off and dancing naked for the man, how else could she show it? This conversation only proved that he wasn\u0092t interested.</p><p>But she\u0092d sure love to change his mind.</p><p>Sydney shooed him out and exited the room, Doomsday Diary in hand. Damn!</p><p>Still, he could ask Aquarius how she\u0092d acquired it and look for clues about the identity of Sydney\u0092s source. Since the redheaded reporter worked quite late usually, he hadn\u0092t yet had the chance.</p><p>Five minutes. He\u0092d give her that long to visit the loo, collect her things, and leave the old building.</p><p>While waiting, he sent the picture of the book to Bram. In moments, the wizard answered: Bingo! Grab it. Caden sighed. As if it were that simple . . .</p><p>While waiting for Sydney\u0092s departure, he popped by Aquarius\u0092s cubicle. Gone, damn it. Lights out, hippie tie-dye coat off its hook. He\u0092d never thought to ask where Aquarius was taking her holiday or when she\u0092d return. Caden winced against an oncoming headache. Well, he\u0092d simply focus on Sydney until the other woman returned. He could think of plenty of ways to keep busy with her.</p><p>Four minutes and fifty-eight seconds later, Caden moved nonchalantly down the hallway. Sydney\u0092s office was clear, thank goodness. Laptop shut down, lights off. Good.</p><p>If the woman wasn\u0092t going to take him along when she talked to her source, he had to find some way to learn the woman\u0092s identity. That was top priority. Bram would disagree . . . but so bloody what. Caden prayed Sydney knew Anka\u0092s location and was helping her. This might be his only chance to find his brother\u0092s mate, bring her home, and restore his brother\u0092s sanity.</p><p>Easing into Sydney\u0092s office, he shut the door. Total darkness enveloped him. The November sun set much earlier in London than in his adopted home, Texas. Though he\u0092d grown up in the UK, he\u0092d forgotten its long nights. It was past five and pitch black out, so he didn\u0092t dare turn the lights on. At least a faint glow from the streetlamps filtered in. He took out a pocket flashlight and flicked it on.</p><p>Sydney often jotted thoughts on little pieces of paper. Now, where would she keep those notes?</p><p>He opened a few drawers. Plastic spoons, snack crackers, chewing gum, a calculator, lots of red pens, and paper clips by the dozens. Some old news articles, now yellowing, about nothing of importance, but nothing in her handwriting, no addresses, nor anything that might lead him to Anka. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caden shut the drawers with a quiet sigh. Damn! Where else would she hide notes? He spun around to a short filing cabinet. Locked, both drawers. He reached behind him for a paper clip. This wasn\u0092t the first time he\u0092d broken into a filing cabinet. But as he shaped the little scrap of metal for his purposes, a burst of energy flooded his senses. His fingertips tingled. A wave of dizziness and a cold sweat followed. Then a distinct urge to pass his fingers in front of the cabinet and focus on mentally unlocking it.</p><p>Biting back a curse, Caden resisted the magical impulse. He\u0092d been having them for the better part of a year. Hated them, too. Ignored them and hoped that if he never succumbed to such urges, they\u0092d dissipate. But they were getting stronger.</p><p>Leaning against Sydney\u0092s desk, Caden focused on twisting the paper clip in the near dark. Despite a fumble or two, he managed to bend it into the shape he needed. Thirty seconds later, the filing cabinet was open. A quick prowl proved her files absent of information about Sydney\u0092s source. Damn, the little firecracker must keep her notes closer to her.</p><p>Pushing the drawer shut silently, he locked it up, then cast his desperate gaze at her laptop. Maybe she kept information there? He booted the machine up, only to be confronted with a prompt for a password. He had no idea what that might be.</p> <p>Again, instinct screamed at him to grip the machine, connect to it with his mind, coax it to tell him Sydney\u0092s secrets. Again, he refused. Instead, he began searching under her desk, inside drawers, for scraps of papers with passwords lying about. But as always, Sydney was sharp and organized, and kept her secrets hidden.</p><p>Time to guess. What did he know about her, besides the fact she was gorgeous, smart, and determined? He typed in her birthday, and the system rejected his attempt. Only two more attempts before the system locked him out, so he\u0092d better think smart.</p><p>Had she mentioned upcoming travel? Was she excited about Christmas? Did she have any pets? What was favorite color? Favorite food? All common fodder for passwords, but Caden found himself genuinely interested in the answers. Christ, he had it bad for her.</p><p>He\u0092d picked up an anonymous blonde a mere three days ago. And a well-curved brunette the night before that. And still he was hungry, crawling out of his skin for sex. But since meeting Sydney, he was utterly fixated on her. This intense attraction had to be magically enhanced. He didn\u0092t dare scratch the itch.</p><p>Focusing on the business at hand, Caden hovered his fingers over the keyboard again. Think, think. As his fingertips touched down, a wave of energy rolled through him, tingles drifted up his arms. Then knowledge burst across his brain. Cadensexy1. That was her password? Impossible.</p> <p>But in the absence of other ideas, he typed it in. Her desktop appeared a few moments later.</p><p>Sydney found him sexy. Knowing that notched up his arousal. Not good. His fire didn\u0092t need more fuel. He couldn\u0092t jeopardize this job. He needed it to complete his mission. Sex with her would have to remain a fantasy.</p><p>Even worse, his unintentional magic had revealed her password to him. He\u0092d never performed such an act before and feared it meant his transition from man to wizard was looming.</p><p>He scowled when he searched her computer from top to bottom and found nothing but old stories, months-old letters, and dull e-mails.</p><p>Caden extinguished the flashlight with a sigh. Now what? Figures that Sydney was too smart to leave important information unsecured. Waiting until Monday to move on this mission wasn\u0092t an option. Anka was alone, possibly in pain or danger. His favorite redhead would be crafting more stories over the weekend. Lucan was sliding closer to death. That damned diary of Morganna\u0092s . . . thank God she was no longer around to wield it, but the book in a human reporter\u0092s hands spelled disaster.</p><p>He had to talk to Sydney. Charm her, Bram had said. He\u0092d rather not use Sydney that way. He liked her too much. But time was short, and he didn\u0092t have enough of it to gain her trust.</p> <p>After a quick stop by the office manager\u0092s desk, Caden had the information he needed. Time to turn on the charm . . . he hoped.</p><p>The next morning, Sydney sipped tea, still fixated on Caden.</p><p>She fingered the spine of the little red book Aquarius had given her. Would it really make her sexual fantasies come true? Even if it did, she\u0092d be a pretty sad sack to magically coerce a man into bed who hadn\u0092t shown the slightest interest in her.</p><p>With a shrug, she tucked the book away in her nightstand and returned to the kitchen. Halfway there, she heard a knock at her door.</p><p>\u0093Who is it?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Caden.\u0094</p><p>Truly?</p><p>She couldn\u0092t run to the door fast enough. After fumbling with the locks, she jerked the door open and stared in surprise.</p> <p>Caden was there, in the flesh . . . and what incredible flesh it was. Tight black T-shirt, faded crotch-hugging jeans, and an expression that said he had more on his mind than business.</p><p>He swallowed. And stared. \u0093Is now a bad time?\u0094</p><p>\u0093N-no,\u0094 she stuttered.</p><p>After a lingering glance down her body, he swallowed again. \u0093Glad to hear it.\u0094</p><p>Sydney frowned at his odd behavior, then looked down at herself\u0097and gasped.</p><p>Her one indulgence was lingerie, of which she was wearing her latest . . . and skimpiest. Pale and silky, the lace-edged straps of the camisole hugged her shoulders. More lace tipped the low-cut V and hugged the swells of her breasts. Silk cupped her beneath their curves, just as she\u0092d like his palms to do. The faint outline of her nipples showed through the flesh-colored fabric. His gaze, his stance, hardened as he stared. She wondered what else did, and fought the urge to look down.</p><p>He had no such hesitation, his gaze traveling over the sheer boy shorts that showed off every inch of her legs. Sydney suspected he could see a hint of the fiery hair between, as well.</p><p>Blast! The sound of Caden\u0092s voice had made her utterly forget she was more than half naked before she answered the door.</p><p>\u0093Wait here.\u0094 Sydney jogged away and returned a moment later wearing a matching dressing gown. Frowning, she belted the flowing garment around her waist. It didn\u0092t cover everything, but enough to make her decent.</p><p>\u0093Do you want to come in or stare at me like a mutant in a circus freak show?\u0094</p><p>He swallowed. \u0093You don\u0092t look like a freak. At all.\u0094</p><p>That voice of his poured over her like melted chocolate, rich, warm, tempting. Sydney drank it in, though she wondered if he truly meant it. First, a look. Now, a compliment. Uncharacteristic, to say the least.</p><p>\u0093Is this a bad time?\u0094 he asked. \u0093Too early to talk?\u0094</p><p>She stepped aside and let him in. \u0093I\u0092m surprised you\u0092re here at all. Is something wrong?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Must something be wrong for me to want to talk to you?\u0094</p><p>On a Saturday morning? Yes. \u0093How did you find me?\u0094</p><p>Caden merely smiled. What the blazes did that smoldering look mean?</p><p>\u0093Why not simply call?\u0094 she rephrased.</p><p>\u0093You never gave me your number.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I never gave you my address, either. How did you get it?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I have my ways.\u0094</p><p>Very cryptic. But since he was here, maybe she could work his unexpected visit to her advantage, see if he had a bit more interest in her than she\u0092d suspected.</p><p>He shut the door and approached, standing close, almost touching . . . but not quite.</p><p>\u0093I want to talk to you,\u0094 he murmured. \u0093Say things I couldn\u0092t at the office.\u0094</p><p>Her belly fluttered. It sounded sexual. Until five minutes ago, she would have chided herself for wishful thinking. Now . . . ?</p><p>She remained close, and his warm breath hit her lips. His eyes locked onto her as if she was the only woman in the world. Forget flutters, her belly plunged to her knees.</p><p>Suddenly, he wanted to be cozy? They hadn\u0092t worked together long. It was possible he\u0092d simply been cautious. Maybe it was the reporter in her, but she needed to ask questions, get to the bottom of this.</p><p>\u0093Sit down and say whatever you\u0092ve come to say. Tea?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, thanks.\u0094 He settled himself on her sofa and stretched his arms clear across the back.</p><p>The wide span of his arms, coupled with those amazing shoulders, made her salivate in a way she shouldn\u0092t about a colleague. But he wasn\u0092t helping, drat him, by looking so sexy\u0097and staring as if she was edible.</p><p>\u0093Come sit beside me.\u0094 He patted the sofa cushion.</p><p>Sydney looked between the two empty chairs in the room, then again at the sofa. Gingerly, she settled in next to him. \u0093I\u0092m listening and I like having you here, but if your visit has anything to do with my source for the articles, I\u0092m not taking you with me to our meeting\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, nothing to do with that. But it\u0092s important and better said outside the office.\u0094</p><p>Right, then. Well, that made her curious, especially when his gaze skimmed down her body, lingering. Though she wasn\u0092t naked, his gaze made her she felt like it. \u0093Go on.\u0094</p><p>Caden hesitated. \u0093Maybe you should change.\u0094</p><p>He was suggesting that she put on more clothes after thoroughly looking his fill? Odd . . . his burning stare said he was two seconds from ravishing her; his behavior was cagey. Sydney prided herself on being able to read people, but Caden had her baffled.</p><p>Instinct told her that something was off. That same instinct told her she wasn\u0092t going to solve this mystery unless she played along.</p><p>Finally, Sydney left the room, sashayed down the hall, and shut her bedroom door. Caden lamented losing the stunning view. The woman revved his body thoroughly into overdrive. But he was here to find clues to Anka\u0092s whereabouts and the book\u0097and to make this magical nightmare go away.</p><p>Caden raced into action and began searching. If Sydney had an appointment to see the woman this weekend maybe he could find an address, a phone number, a name that would prove this goose chase worthwhile.</p><p>With the clock ticking, he started with a nearby antique secretary propped against the wall between her living area and her kitchen. Immediately he could see she hadn\u0092t stashed the little red diary here. Bills, pictures, a list of things to do, a little calendar with various dates written inside . . . like Aquarius being on holiday. No mention of where she was headed.</p><p>He sighed, righted everything, then dashed to the kitchen. Next to the phone he found a shopping list and a neat row of phone numbers for restaurants that delivered. Gads, the woman lived by lists.</p><p>Meanwhile, the damn clock was ticking, and he didn\u0092t care that she needed milk from the market and had a local pizzeria on speed dial. Ignoring an odd tingle and a cold sweat, he scanned the room and saw her handbag sitting on a little table near the front door. No time to be squeamish about invading her privacy.</p><p>He unzipped the flap, pushed aside her coin purse, keys, and lipstick. A notepad with a pen attached. He flipped it open. Eureka! It was littered with notes. Some large, some sideways, some in an odd shorthand he couldn\u0092t decipher. He lifted one page, another, a third . . . at the seventh, he paused. A whole page dedicated to the story of magickind she was slowly, foolishly revealing.</p><p>Saturday @ 4, A\u0092s place, one of her notes said. This Saturday? Who was A? Anka or someone else, like Aquarius? Had Anka been free long enough to have her own place? If she had, why hadn\u0092t she returned home? Where was this place? Was it possible that Mathias knew who she was and where she lived? Nothing else on the little scrap of paper answered any of those questions. Damn!</p><p>Just below that was a list of seemingly random thoughts under the heading possibilities. She had written yet another list with items like \u0093decomposition of bodies,\u0094 \u0093magickind living among humans,\u0094 \u0093magical war/other battles,\u0094 and \u0093origin of the magical diary.\u0094</p><p>Caden took a moment to absorb those horrific possible stories. Sydney had already written about the battle in the tunnel. Any of these would seem like natural follow-up. And if she wrote a single word of the Doomsday Diary in Out of This Realm, Mathias and the Anarki would hunt her down within hours. Mathias ate sweet morsels like Sydney for snacks. The thought made his blood freeze.</p><p>His reaction made little sense; he barely knew the woman, but Caden\u0092s first instinct was to protect her with his life. He knew he\u0092d die before letting Mathias hurt her. And he didn\u0092t want to question why.</p><p>Caden heard fumbling from the end of the hall. With a curse, he shoved the little notepad back into place, then crept to the living room, planting himself on the sofa before Sydney stepped in, wearing a pair of long, flowing pants and a curve-hugging sweater. He liked the lingerie better. But this outfit emphasized how small she was. If he was to lay her down and cover her body with his, he would completely envelop her and mold every lush little curve to him. . . .</p><p>Not a smart train of thought. He was losing what little spare room he had in his jeans, and Sydney\u0092s quizzical expression told him that she\u0092d done some thinking while she was changing. That was never good.</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s so urgent that you had to hunt me down over the weekend? That you couldn\u0092t say in the office?\u0094</p><p>She always got to the point. All the women he had dated who chatted endlessly and never really had a point\u0097they drove him mad. The one woman he wished would prattle and simply let him lead the conversation was having none of it. He sighed.</p><p>\u0093Sit beside me.\u0094 He patted the sofa cushion beside him once more. Charm her, he reminded himself.</p><p>She settled in, studying him as if she could read his thoughts. He tamped down on the urge to squirm.</p><p>\u0093The office is always hectic,\u0094 he commented.</p><p>\u0093We\u0092re in a deadline-driven business.\u0094</p><p>\u0093True, but that doesn\u0092t leave us much time to get acquainted.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093And you think that will improve our working relationship?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps, but that\u0092s not why I\u0092m here, Sydney.\u0094 He purposely dropped his voice an octave and leaned closer.</p><p>She raised a skeptical brow. \u0093Out with it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I want to get to know you, as a person. As a woman. Not as a reporter.\u0094</p> <p>She cocked her head and stared at him, the wheels in her mind obviously turning. \u0093For what purpose?\u0094</p><p>Bloody hell, was this woman immune to seduction? \u0093Are you always this direct?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Are you always this vague?\u0094 she countered.</p><p>This was becoming a proper mess. He was ill-prepared for pretending interest in a woman while he was actually mad for her\u0097yet hiding his desire. He had to be flirtatious, but no more. But his fierce desire was interfering with his mission. He knew how magical men instinctively found their mates, and he suspected that one kiss would be his doom.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m trying to say that you interest me without you filing a harassment complaint.\u0094</p> <p>That made her laugh. \u0093I\u0092ll tell you if you cross the line. Interesting how?\u0094</p><p>\u0093In just about every way imaginable.\u0094 That, he didn\u0092t have to lie about. The lingerie she\u0092d had on earlier told him without a doubt that she\u0092d have a gorgeous body he\u0092d kill to devour. She fascinated him with the wicked sweep of those little auburn brows over sharp brown eyes. The woman brimmed intelligence. The way she asked questions, deduced the truth quickly, but carried herself with undeniable sensuality, all dazzled him, along with her zest. Had he ever attacked each day with such passion? Certainly not since Iraq and being one of the few survivors of his platoon. Perhaps not even since Westin\u0092s death.</p><p>\u0093You sound as if you mean more than professionally,\u0094 she remarked.</p><p>He shrugged, hating the need to be coy. \u0093We work together, so the situation requires caution. I hoped we could . . . get to know each other first, then see if we wanted to pursue more.\u0094</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u0093This is the first I\u0092ve heard or seen of any interest beyond the professional.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve tried to keep unprofessional thoughts to myself at the office.\u0094 That was the truth, and hopefully enough for her curiosity.</p> <p>\u0093You\u0092ve had them?\u0094</p><p>Caden chastised himself for underestimating her tenacity. \u0093You\u0092re a beautiful woman.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Thank you.\u0094 His flattery only sharpened her gaze. \u0093But this seems . . . sudden.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I could tell you my first thought after meeting you, but it\u0092s definitely not fit for the office, nor terribly polite.\u0094</p><p>Sydney turned sideways, tucking one leg under her and anchoring her arm across the back of the sofa, her fingers so close to his shoulder. If he leaned toward her just a bit, she\u0092d be touching him. The thought blasted heat to his cock.</p><p>Then she smiled. \u0093That so? All right, I\u0092ll play. I\u0092ve had similar thoughts.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I thought so yesterday. In your office. It was in your eyes.\u0094</p><p>\u0093So that\u0092s why you decided to say something?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Yes.\u0094 It sounded reasonable, though he\u0092d sensed her interest a few days ago.</p><p>\u0093What do you think should happen next?\u0094</p><p>\u0093We should take it slow,\u0094 he murmured. \u0093Get to know each other, then decide if we want to proceed, so we don\u0092t jeopardize our working relationship.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hmm. Very wise and gentlemanly.\u0094</p><p>Caden exhaled, hoping she believed him. But one look at her, and he resisted the urge to wince. Something was going on in that head of hers.</p><p>\u0093But let me make certain I understand. I\u0092m to believe that you\u0092ve had lascivious thoughts since meeting me, but hid them until you . . . either broke into someone\u0092s filing cabinet to find my address or followed me home, which shows an amazing dedication to seducing me. Then you knocked on my door on a Saturday and looked at me as if you\u0092d like to strip me bare in the foyer. And you did all this so that we could take our relationship slowly? Have I got that right?\u0094</p><p>Well, damn. Caden clenched his fists as his brain went into overdrive. Now that she\u0092d seen through his ruse, how did he repair the damage and salvage his mission\u0097without risking their working relationship and his future?</p><p>\u0093What I\u0092d like to do and what\u0092s prudent are two different things.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Often, yes. But let me tell you what I think is happening here: You insulted Jamie because he\u0092s a slacker, and you object to them as a rule. Very against your military background. You want to be a part of the magickind war story for some reason, and are fixated on my source, and when I refused to let you tag along, you decided to resort to a halfhearted seduction in an attempt to hoodwink me into changing my mind. Is that closer to the truth?\u0094</p><p>Dear God. He\u0092d had undercover missions easier than this. Too smart, she was. \u0093No. What\u0092s happening is that I\u0092m far more attracted to a colleague than I\u0092m proud of, and the things I want to do with you would make even your pert little freckles blush. I tried to keep quiet because I need this job, but when I saw it was mutual, I couldn\u0092t hold my desire in. I didn\u0092t mention it at the office because it\u0092s inappropriate there. And as much as I\u0092d like to get you naked in the next three minutes, I don\u0092t want to simply shag you. That wouldn\u0092t help me to know you better. Yes, I\u0092m interested in your source about the magical war story because I understand war, and let\u0092s face it, a woman claiming such things is intriguing. But I\u0092m also not trying to rush you to bed because I don\u0092t want to build artificial intimacy simply to get my way. I want you to choose to make me your partner at the office, regardless of our personal relationship.\u0094</p><p>That sounded logical. And a bit too close to the truth.</p><p>Sydney sent him a considering stare. \u0093What do you recommend next?\u0094</p><p>Caden released the breath he\u0092d been holding. Maybe she believed him. Perhaps. He had to keep to his role. \u0093Lunch?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Actually, I was about to toss together a sandwich. You\u0092re welcome to join me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I meant to take you out.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Wouldn\u0092t staying here allow for more privacy? If we\u0092re going to get to know each other, that\u0092s much harder in public.\u0094</p><p>And much easier for him to put his hands all over her, as he was dying to now. \u0093Whatever you like.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perfect.\u0094 She rose to her feet and headed for the kitchen, grabbing ingredients as she dashed about. \u0093Tell me about your parents. Are they still alive?\u0094</p><p>He was supposed to be getting to know her, finding ways to make her trust him, not the other way around. \u0093They are, but I was a late-in-life baby. They\u0092re quite elderly. Yours? I want to hear about you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Later.\u0094 She waved off his question. \u0093So you\u0092re caring for your brother because your parents can\u0092t?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Precisely.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Other siblings?\u0094</p><p>Not anymore, and not for anything would he drag up that terrible story. \u0093None. You? Any siblings?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Only child. Stop changing the subject,\u0094 she admonished, opening a jar. \u0093Mustard?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Please. I really want\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093How much older is your brother?\u0094</p><p>Three hundred sixty-seven years. He suspected she wouldn\u0092t take that well. \u0093Upwards of a decade.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Significant, then. Tell me more about his illness.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Lucan is unconscious, they have little idea how to help him, and this isn\u0092t the Inquisition.\u0094</p><p>He rose and entered the kitchen. Sydney stood against the counter, spreading mustard on brown bread. He eased up behind her, placed his hands on her hips and whispered against her neck, \u0093I\u0092m here to get to know you.\u0094</p><p>With a saucy tilt of her head, she shot him a glance over her shoulder. \u0093As I\u0092ve said, no siblings. My parents are both professors. My mother teaches history at Oxford. My father once taught, but now conducts very important research to help create a purely artificial fuel source.\u0094</p><p>Caden winced, and Sydney laughed. \u0093You asked.\u0094</p><p>\u0093They sound very serious, indeed.\u0094</p><p>\u0093They\u0092re even more so in person, I assure you.\u0094</p><p>Something on her face gave Caden pause. \u0093And are they supportive of your career?\u0094</p><p>She hesitated. \u0093I\u0092m a bitter disappointment, and I\u0092m reminded of that every time I see them.\u0094</p><p>Though Sydney said it laughingly, he could read the pain on her face. She was hurt by their lack of support. It was foolish and stupid and dangerous, but he eased his arms around her. \u0093I think you\u0092re brilliant, and I have no doubt that someday you\u0092re going to be wildly famous for doing exactly what you love.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hmm. Flattery.\u0094 She didn\u0092t sound impressed.</p><p>But this, he truly meant. She\u0092d wowed him with her very first story. Though she knew nothing about magickind, she\u0092d somehow caught onto the nuances, what was important to the warring factions. \u0093Honesty.\u0094</p><p>He longed to kiss her mouth, mere inches from his, taste her, bring her closer to him, ease her pain. Inside, he damned his magical impulses for dangling this temptation in front of him and making her so forbidden. If she was, as he suspected, the mate magic intended for him\u0097no, he couldn\u0092t think about what could be or he\u0092d go mad.</p><p>The reality was, he was deep in this magical war. Not only did he want to avoid Lucan\u0092s fate, but he didn\u0092t want to place Sydney in danger. If he kissed her and succumbed to the need to Call to her as his mate . . . he couldn\u0092t bear the thought that, instead of reporting about a woman who had been repeatedly raped by Mathias, she might actually become one.</p><p>\u0093Are you going to stare at my mouth or kiss me?\u0094</p><p>Caden backed away. \u0093I\u0092m reminding myself to take it slowly. Perhaps I should help with lunch.\u0094</p><p>She sighed. \u0093There\u0092s some clementines and crisps in the cupboard.\u0094</p><p>After retrieving them, he turned to find Sydney setting up the little bistro-style table in her kitchen. She turned and grabbed two plates piled high with lettuce and fresh tomato. He held the chair for her. Sydney sent a raised brow at him, but sat.</p><p>\u0093So,\u0094 he said before she could start interrogating him again. \u0093Your parents don\u0092t love what you\u0092ve chosen to do with your life. My guess is that you work very hard to be the best and hope they will someday recognize your genius.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Thank you, Dr. Freud.\u0094 She sent him a quelling glance. \u0093Something like that. Though I know I can\u0092t live to please them.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No adult does, but you hate to disappoint them, right?\u0094</p><p>She swallowed her bite of sandwich and peered across the table at him. \u0093You came to get to know me, yet clearly you already do. Perhaps we skip the rest of this silly \u0091getting to know you\u0092 crap and go straight to bed?\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>AN HOUR LATER, SYDNEY knew for certain that Caden was following her when she ducked into a little jewelry shop\u0097 and he peeked in the window moments later. Not for an instant did she believe that he had window-shopped for a lovely pair of earrings or a belly stud.</p><p>In fact, today he had a hidden agenda. After professing his infatuation, what unattached, red-blooded man turned down sex so blatantly offered? Only the kind trying to dupe her. His sneaking after her now merely confirmed her suspicions. The only thing he\u0092d shown genuine interest in since coming to work with her? The magical war story. She suspected that he meant to steal it.</p><p>After she\u0092d refused to let him accompany her to visit her source, he turned up on her doorstep and suddenly professed romantic interest. How stupid did he think she was? She\u0092d called his bluff over lunch by inviting him to her bed, figuring she\u0092d determine whether he was feeding her crap or genuinely interested in her. She\u0092d personally hoped for the latter. Though he was a deceitful wanker, he was a sexy one.</p><p>His stuttered refusal was his loss. Caden lying about desiring her didn\u0092t hurt. All right, perhaps a bit. But she had to stop thinking with her emotions and get smart. He sought to scoop her, after all.</p><p>Over her dead body.</p><p>She was going\u0097alone, thank you\u0097to meet the battered witch, listen to more of the woeful tale that tore at her heart, and gather more information for her story. She shoved thoughts of her gorgeous, deceitful photographer aside.</p><p>Exiting to the street again, Sydney walked half a block. She\u0092d give Caden credit; she couldn\u0092t see him behind her, but she sensed him. As she rounded a bend in the road, she caught a glimpse of him, pretending interest in a street vendor who shivered in the November chill. He didn\u0092t look her way, but Sydney felt his attention.</p><p>Nonchalantly, she proceeded south, hunkering down into her coat until she found the right place. Once spotted, she dodged traffic and crossed the road, then entered a crowded, smoky pub. She sat on a stool near the back, far from the barkeep.</p><p>A dozen seconds later, Caden and a stiff breeze blew in. Sydney grabbed a discarded menu and pretended to read.</p><p>He wandered along the front of the pub, looking out the windows at the sidewalk, presumably not noticing her. Finally he sat at an empty table in the corner, grabbed a menu\u0097and peered at her over the top. She made a great show of checking her watch and her mobile, fidgeting and squirming.</p><p>Finally, a waitress popped by his table. What he ordered Sydney didn\u0092t know or care. Now was her chance.</p><p>She rose and headed conspicuously for the toilet. She wished she could see the look on Caden\u0092s face when he realized she wasn\u0092t coming back out. As the door to the loo shut behind her, the thought made her smile.</p><p>She\u0092d vanished. Out the window of the loo, he\u0092d guess. Brilliant.</p><p>He\u0092d underestimated both her cleverness and determination. Again.</p><p>Frustration crept in, and Caden raked a hand through his hair. How the devil could he find her source if she didn\u0092t trust him? But he was also concerned about Sydney. Didn\u0092t the girl realize that she was potentially in danger?</p><p>The mobile at his side rang. A glance at the display had him cursing not so softly.</p><p>\u0093What?\u0094 he snapped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Your delightful mood means things aren\u0092t going well, I take it?\u0094 Bram drawled.</p><p>\u0093Not exactly. The woman is too smart by half and knows everything I say is shit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re not being charming enough.\u0094</p><p>Caden gritted his teeth. \u0093Deception isn\u0092t my style.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093It\u0092s charm. Do you need me to demonstrate?\u0094</p><p>Though Bram was mated, the thought of him anywhere near Sydney made Caden feel uncomfortably homicidal. \u0093The same charm you showed your now-missing mate?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Leave my mate out of this,\u0094 Bram snarled.</p><p>If you return the favor.</p><p>As soon as the words blazed across Caden\u0092s mind, he sucked in a breath. Damn, he had to stop thinking about Sydney like that. He didn\u0092t want a magical mate. And now he had to distract Bram. \u0093Likewise, leave Sydney alone.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Are you having the urge to Call to this reporter?\u0094</p><p>Every time he neared her, his temperature spiked. She was a fever, and if he kissed her, he feared he\u0092d blurt the words that could bind them together. Not good signs.</p><p>Her proposition at lunch had boiled his blood. A hearty \u0093yes\u0094 had hovered on the tip of his tongue. Yes, he wanted her naked. Yes, he wanted to taste every inch of her fair skin, possess that sweet body. Yes, he wanted all that intelligence and sass. Yes, he wanted to be the one to protect her. But giving in to his urges would spell disaster. Too bad no one had given his instincts the memo.</p><p>\u0093Can we focus on the mission?\u0094 Caden unleashed his annoyance. \u0093She knows I\u0092ve scarcely said a true word to her since we met. She\u0092s seeing her contact this afternoon, knew I was following her, and intentionally lost me. Now, she\u0092s thinking of writing an article about the Doomsday Diary. What do you think will happen if she does?\u0094</p><p>Bram cursed. \u0093She\u0092ll get a very unpleasant, firsthand look at magic, Mathias-style.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Exactly.\u0094 Caden gripped the phone, the thought too terrible to contemplate. He would protect Sydney at any cost, do anything to silence that story. Keep her safe. As much as it chafed him to ask for Bram\u0092s help, he must.</p> <p>\u0093You need to step in,\u0094 he went on. \u0093I\u0092m compromised. Sydney knows I\u0092m interested in the magical war story and that my seduction wasn\u0092t real.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t.\u0094 Suddenly, Bram sighed, sounding frustrated. \u0093Another attack last night. Nearly everyone dead, two women missing. One transitioned just last week. Gossip and panic is beginning to spread around magickind about Mathias\u0092s return. The Council elders have their thumbs up their arses, as usual. They want me to quell the rumors. I\u0092m trying to be the voice of reason, but they don\u0092t wish to hear logic. Duke and I are visiting Privileged households likely to be attacked and preaching caution, but . . . it\u0092s frustrating to be forced to lie. I dare not leave the Council to their own devices for long. I\u0092d insist on transcasting the truth to magickind, but I don\u0092t have enough of the other Councilmen\u0092s votes behind me. In the meantime, Marrok is ferociously training us for the war we all know is coming. If I sent Ice to help you, he would simply flatten Out of This Realm. Besides, magic isn\u0092t a cure-all. I can\u0092t just wave my wand and have Sydney forget about the book and her story ideas.\u0094</p><p>Bram painted a bleak picture, and Caden nearly felt sorry for the bastard. What the hell good was magic? Oh, that\u0092s right, none. He\u0092d had proof enough of that early in life. Caden gripped the back of his neck and massaged at the tension gripping him. The damn tingles had returned. He was exhausted, yet his body craved sex. Lots of lovelies in the pub, several looking in his direction. But a glance south proved his cock was having none of them. It was fixated on Sydney. He sighed.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re going to have to fix this,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093Get closer to Sydney, however you must. Convince her with whatever necessary. Get that bloody diary out of her hands. Stop those stories. Nothing about the Doomsday Diary can appear in print.\u0094</p><p>Caden sighed. How the devil was he to do all that?</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll talk to her tonight,\u0094 he told Bram. \u0093I\u0092ll be waiting for her when she gets home. Until then, I should visit my brother for a bit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t spare any of the warriors to transport you, but I can send my sister.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sabelle\u0092s company is always a delight.\u0094</p> <p>Bram snorted. \u0093Spoken like someone who does not have to live with the minx.\u0094</p><p>They rang off, and Caden waited. Sure enough, within moments Sabelle walked into the pub. Every male head turned. Jaws dropped. One man even rose to his feet, looking as if he was in a trance. She held up a hand, and he wandered back to his stool instantly, looking a bit confused.</p><p>\u0093Do you get that reaction from men everywhere you go?\u0094</p><p>She shrugged. \u0093It\u0092s my grandmother\u0092s siren blood, not me. I could be the ugliest hag in creation and they\u0092d still respond that way.\u0094</p><p>But she wasn\u0092t. Far from it. Sabelle was truly stunning. Wars had been started over faces half so lovely. Centerfolds would kill for her body. The first time he\u0092d seen her standing in the middle of his living room in Texas, explaining that his brother was suffering, he\u0092d had to truly focus on her words, not his shock at her utter beauty.</p><p>But he\u0092d quickly learned that she wasn\u0092t just beautiful on the outside. Caden genuinely liked her. But he didn\u0092t want her.</p><p>\u0093If Bram hasn\u0092t passed the message to you, thank you for helping Lucan.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve known him all my life, Caden. He\u0092s a dear friend. I\u0092m not about to let him die senselessly.\u0094</p><p>A brave soul. \u0093Every other surrogate we\u0092ve sent has been terrified.\u0094</p><p>She shrugged. \u0093I believe, deep down, he would recognize me before he did any serious harm.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sabelle, he doesn\u0092t know himself.\u0094</p><p>With a nod, she conceded. \u0093Yes, well . . . it hasn\u0092t been going as well as I would like. The energy he\u0092s derived from my fear simply isn\u0092t enough. He expends it all thrashing and calling Anka\u0092s name. Lucan needs more.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Meaning?\u0094</p><p>\u0093With the previous surrogates, he growled that he scented another man, then tried to attack them. I think I might have a solution. You\u0092re welcome to observe.\u0094</p><p>Something in the witch\u0092s tone made him pause. \u0093Perhaps we should discuss this.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle shook her head, golden curls brushing her slender arms. \u0093I need to do this my way.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t want you risking your safety.\u0094</p><p>She patted his arm. \u0093I\u0092m fine. Why don\u0092t we meander outside and round the back? We\u0092ll attract less attention when we teleport.\u0094</p><p>Caden knew a firm change of subject when he heard one and gave up, for now. He nodded, and they made their way into the windy evening chill.</p><p>Once they were out of sight, Sabelle positioned them away from people, out of the light, wrapped her hand in his and poof! One minute he was standing in a dark alley, the next he fought a black, stomach-turning void. Bloody magic! Then he stood in Bram\u0092s foyer. And the man himself was there waiting.</p><p>\u0093Glad to see you\u0092re here. I was getting worried,\u0094 he visually inspected his sister, clearly reassuring himself that no harm had come to her.</p><p>She sighed. \u0093I\u0092m eighty-four, not four. I\u0092m perfectly capable of finding someone and bringing them here.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But not necessarily without avoiding trouble.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle rolled her eyes. \u0093If you\u0092ll excuse me, I have important things to do.\u0094 She clapped Caden on the shoulder. \u0093Entertain him for a bit, will you? I\u0092m worn out.\u0094</p><p>With that parting shot, she disappeared.</p><p>Bram cast him a rueful glance. \u0093I\u0092ll trade you a brother in mate mourning for a mischievous sister.\u0094</p><p>Caden almost laughed. \u0093Thanks, but no. Honestly, I don\u0092t want either problem.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You look exhausted.\u0094 Caden knew he shouldn\u0092t ask, lest he find himself deeper in magical muck. But as much as he disliked some of Bram\u0092s tactics, the wizard had taken his brother in, offered his home, his assistance, and now, his sister. \u0093Any luck finding your mate?\u0094</p><p>Bram winced, and the strain showed on the tired lines around his eyes and mouth. \u0093No, it\u0092s as if she\u0092s vanished. I feel . . . nothing except her absence.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But she has not broken your bond?\u0094 The last thing he needed was for Bram to be in Lucan\u0092s condition. Making his brother whole would be impossible.</p><p>\u0093No, thank God. She is still mine, yet all my attempts to trace her lead nowhere.\u0094</p><p>Odd, but then that was magic, difficult, baffling, and frustratingly cryptic. \u0093Do you know anything about her? Where she lives, her phone number, relatives\u0092 names?\u0094</p><p>\u0093As far as I can tell, everything she told me is a lie.\u0094 He scrubbed a hand over his tense expression. \u0093I\u0092m going to have to call one of those damn surrogates for energy. Mating is certainly effective; I don\u0092t want any woman but her. Somehow\u0097\u0094 Bram broke off with a shake of his head. \u0093Never mind. I\u0092ll work it out. Go see your brother.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If I haven\u0092t said thanks already\u0097\u0094 Caden choked out. He disliked being beholden to Bram, but the words needed saying.</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t. Lucan is like family to me, as is Anka. I only hope we can bring them back together.\u0094</p><p>Beginning to fear that was impossible, Caden turned to the giant staircase on his left. One step at a time, he trudged up, dread pulsing through him as he climbed to the top, then marched to the end of the hall where Lucan lay.</p><p>God, he\u0092d rather be anywhere but here.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he lifted his hand to the knob of the closed door, wondering how his life had become hellish so quickly. What must Lucan\u0092s be like?</p><p>Caden opened the door. Inside, the drapes were drawn, shutting out the weak twilight sun. The shadowed room smelled of sweat and rage and desperation. Lucan reeked of all three. He was a terrible, panting example of magic\u0092s cruelty.</p><p>Bracing his forearm against the doorjamb, Caden hesitated. Though their sibling bond dictated that he care for Lucan, he didn\u0092t want to walk in. When he\u0092d been a boy himself, he\u0092d helplessly watched Westin die. Laughing toddler one moment, corpse the next. A stab in the heart. The possibility of reliving the trauma of a sibling\u0092s death terrified him.</p><p>A growl sounded from the bed, and Caden took a cautious step into the dark bedroom. There Lucan lay still and chained, naked except for a pair of white briefs. He stared in horror at his brother\u0092s gaunt cheeks and pallid complexion. In the past days, his brother had deteriorated.</p><p>Swallowing his horror, Caden vowed that when he saw Sydney again, he\u0092d focus on nothing but his mission. He must find Anka and make Lucan whole again.</p><p>An adjoining door opened to his right, and Sabelle exited the bathroom in a cloud of humid, perfumed air. She wore a simple white dressing gown, damp hair pinned to the top of her head, water droplets still clinging to her golden skin. Determination stamped her regal features and movements as she strode to a chair beside the bed. When she glanced Caden\u0092s way and saw him staring at Lucan, regret softened her face.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s not always this way.\u0094</p><p>Her whisper was like a blade to his chest. She meant to be comforting, reassuring. Instead, her words only angered him more.</p><p>\u0093Caden,\u0094 Sabelle tried again. \u0093I believe his bond with Anka was true and deep. He\u0092s hurting now, but he had over a century of joy with a woman he loved. Any of us should be half so lucky.\u0094</p><p>\u0093To be reduced to an animal? You would feel lucky to endure this?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mate mourning for a woman works differently, so I can\u0092t say for certain. Males undergo a period of intense . . . adjustment. A witch suddenly alone is often compelled to seek out another wizard for comfort, protection, and energy. She doesn\u0092t remember her former mate, but there\u0092s a sense of loss, and she pines. Just not in this way.\u0094 Sabelle gestured to his brother.</p><p>Meaning that Anka could be anywhere, her memory of Lucan completely gone, and shagging someone else. If the mate mourning didn\u0092t finish Lucan off, that knowledge might.</p><p>Sabelle placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. \u0093I know this is unpleasant to you\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Horrific,\u0094 Caden corrected. \u0093He\u0097he\u0092s a lunatic and he\u0092s a burden to you. Will he ever again be himself?\u0094</p><p>Regret tightened her mouth, shadowed her eyes. \u0093His mate mourning is severe. We\u0092re trying. Honestly. I\u0092m\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Please don\u0092t think I\u0092m faulting you,\u0094 he said gently. \u0093I don\u0092t blame you or your brother in the least. I\u0092m . . . frustrated. He\u0092s gotten worse.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Until he takes energy, he cannot stabilize.\u0094</p><p>Caden paced. \u0093I feel helpless. I know I can\u0092t do anything to help except find Anka. Without her, is there any end in sight other than his death?\u0094</p><p>\u0093One day at a time. You\u0092re trying. We all are. Don\u0092t discount Lucan. He\u0092s strong. It\u0092s not uncommon for a wizard\u0092s mate mourning to end abruptly. Tomorrow, he could awaken perfectly fine.\u0094</p><p>Or this condition could kill him. Caden snorted. \u0093Magic could never be so kind.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Then give up on him.\u0094 She tossed her hands in the air. \u0093But I won\u0092t. Lucan is our friend. His death would kill my brother.\u0094</p><p>She didn\u0092t wait for a reply before she approached the bed and raised her hands to Lucan, lingering at one ankle, then the other. Then she made her way to the top corners of the bed, murmured a few words, and passed her fingers over each of Lucan\u0092s hands.</p><p>Suddenly, the chains binding him loosened a bit, allowing him limited movement.</p><p>With a roar, Lucan thrashed about, eyes wild. The whites were gone, his pupils mere dots in a sea of tumultuous blue.</p><p>\u0093Dear God, what are you doing?\u0094 He rushed forward to tighten Lucan\u0092s restraints again.</p><p>Sabelle stayed him with a raised hand. \u0093I\u0092m serving him.\u0094</p><p>Caden wished that didn\u0092t mean what he feared. \u0093Lucan could kill you. He nearly did the others because they weren\u0092t Anka.\u0094</p><p>\u0093With the surrogates, he smelled other men on them. He assumed they were enemies, come to kill him. So he attacked. I\u0092m attempting a new tactic. I\u0092m completely clean and washed with Anka\u0092s soap and shampoo, for good measure.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093But allowing him so much slack in the chains . . . isn\u0092t that dangerous?\u0094</p><p>\u0093When others have been feral, they\u0092ve had a need to dominate, according to my Aunt Millie. In this state, Lucan will require any woman he beds to be beneath him. Besides, I hope that having some freedom of movement will signal to him that he\u0092s not under attack and enable him to take me. He\u0092ll derive more energy if he does.\u0094</p><p>Caden swallowed. \u0093And you\u0092ll just let him . . .\u0094</p><p>She stared back at Caden over her shoulder. \u0093My body is a small thing to give to keep a dear friend alive. If embracing another eases him past his mourning, why would I not help him?\u0094</p> <p>Her selfless words hit Caden in the gut. This wonderful woman was risking herself. He adored her, yet was scared for her, all at once.</p><p>\u0093Does Bram know what you\u0092re about?\u0094</p><p>She shook her head. \u0093He\u0092d only be a hindrance.\u0094</p><p>Caden shook his head. Foolish, brave, amazing woman. \u0093What if Lucan attacks you?\u0094</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u0093You\u0092re here.\u0094</p> <p>He bit back a scream that he wanted no part of this, but Sabelle\u0092s courage made him feel like a coward. Lucan needed this to stay alive, and the witch was willing to risk her life and body to heal him. Though there was no risk to himself, Caden wanted no part of watching his brother siphon sexual energy from Sabelle. He railed against being here at all. The response shamed him.</p><p>\u0093Back way to the farthest corner of the room. If he smells you . . .\u0094 She winced.</p><p>No telling what Lucan would do, except that it wouldn\u0092t be good. Ridiculously grateful for that small reprieve, he shut the door and leaned against it, watching his brother and waiting.</p><p>Sabelle nodded, then dropped her robe. She wasn\u0092t wearing a stitch.</p><p>His jaw dropped. The witch wasn\u0092t just a pretty face; she had curves stacked everywhere, long legs, a lush backside, a long, narrow torso with a flat belly. Her breasts . . . the stuff of wet dreams.</p><p>Still, Caden had no urge to touch her. He couldn\u0092t when he had so much to fear. And such tumultuous feelings for Sydney.</p> <p>Kicking the robe away, Sabelle edged onto the bed and lay beside Lucan.</p><p>Immediately, he lunged for her, his eyes wide and frenetic and sightless. He sniffed at her, growled, and rolled her body beneath his, flattening her against the mattress, overwhelming her with his taut body.</p><p>\u0093Sabelle?\u0094 Caden called and darted for her.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m fine,\u0094 she vowed. \u0093Stay back.\u0094</p><p>Caden managed to do as instructed\u0097barely.</p><p>\u0093Female,\u0094 Lucan purred as he buried his face in her neck. His mouth devoured her skin as he panted, and his chest rumbled with sounds of approval. His nose began to roam her body. He used the slack in his chains to squeeze a breast, then cupped between her legs. \u0093Anka?\u0094</p><p>When Lucan panted and bit at her neck, she shuddered. Her eyes slid shut. Caden flinched and resisted the urge to rescue her. He gripped the edges of the portal behind him, fingers digging into the wood. Watching his brother sexually dominate her was both horrifying and repelling. If Caden had been against magical mating before, seeing this nightmare sealed the deal.</p><p>Sabelle wrapped her arms around him and encouraged, \u0093That\u0092s it. More.\u0094</p> <p>Lucan didn\u0092t respond; he could not hear. So she communicated by stroking his shoulders, filtering her fingers through his hair. She glided one palm down Lucan\u0092s back and arched toward him. With that urging, Lucan unleashed more of his inner beast, and his hands roamed her pale flesh. He tried to claim her mouth, but Sabelle dodged him, offering her neck. Finally, Lucan gave up, and dropped his mouth to her breasts, ravishing them. Caden winced, fighting his instinct to protect Sabelle, as Lucan pinned her down for his pleasure.</p><p>\u0093Anka,\u0094 he breathed against Sabelle\u0092s skin, fisted his hand in her wet hair. \u0093My Anka!\u0094</p><p>Lucan pressed against Sabelle intimately, thrusting his hips at her. Caden recoiled, yet he couldn\u0092t turn away for Sabelle\u0092s safety. For Lucan\u0092s sake, he wanted this to work, but watching his brother take from Sabelle utterly disturbed him.</p><p>\u0093Stop,\u0094 Caden demanded. \u0093You don\u0092t have to do this.\u0094 Sabelle opened her eyes and turned her head to meet his stare. \u0093I do, but if you can\u0092t stay, I understand.\u0094</p><p>The offer was tempting, but . . . \u0093Who will be your safety net?\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s chained. Go on. It\u0092s all right.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I won\u0092t leave you to face this alone. We neither of us know what he\u0092s capable of.\u0094</p><p>Her expression was like a shrug as she stripped away Lucan\u0092s briefs.</p><p>With an animal growl, Lucan completely covered her, his much bigger body all but swallowing her up. Chains rattling, he gripped her hips in his hands and lunged for her mouth, intent on fusing them together. Again, she dodged him.</p><p>\u0093Give me!\u0094 Lucan roared.</p><p>Caden lunged toward the bed again, but a glance from Sabelle stopped him in his tracks. His fingers, still gripping the door frame, turned numb. The witch was determined, and his brother needed her. But, oh God . . . this was terrible, painful. He could only imagine what Sabelle endured.</p><p>When Lucan could not kiss her, he grew more agitated, his hands clutching her cheeks and forcing her mouth under his. Sabelle pressed her lips together.</p><p>Panic crossed her face.</p><p>Frustration and fear gnawed at Caden\u0092s gut. \u0093Will kissing him turn him more feral?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle raised her head over Lucan\u0092s shoulder, dodging him again. \u0093If he tastes me, he\u0092ll know I\u0092m not Anka.\u0094</p><p>Of course. Every wizard knew his mate instinctively by taste. Their kiss, their tears, their cream\u0097whatever he tasted, it would carry the flavor of his mate. Lucan would sense it, or rather its absence, in Sabelle.</p><p>She distracted him by spreading her thighs beneath him, and arching her hips in invitation. Lucan hesitated. As he loosed a feral howl, he invaded her body.</p><p>Wincing, she cried out.</p><p>That was it. Caden could not stand about and do nothing. He ripped away from the door.</p><p>\u0093Stay back!\u0094 Sabelle shouted. \u0093If he smells you, he will assume we\u0092re attacking him and try to kill me.\u0094</p><p>Since Sabelle\u0092s position under Lucan made her vulnerable, he could kill her instantly.</p><p>Swallowing bile and his pride, Caden eased back. \u0093Work free of him, and I\u0092ll help you tighten the chains.\u0094</p><p>Lucan nudged her neck with his face, braced his hands on her hips, prepared to fuck her like a madman. But he paused.</p><p>Sabelle caressed his back and lifted to him again in encouragement.</p><p>Without warning, Lucan thrust forward savagely, sinking deep. He plundered her like a jackhammer on asphalt, pistoning into her in a non-stop rhythm. Sabelle cried out as she absorbed his onslaught.</p><p>\u0093Please let me stop him.\u0094 Caden would have begged if he thought Sabelle would listen.</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094</p><p>Caden closed his eyes, then forced them open. He was Sabelle\u0092s safety net, no matter how ugly this was, how angry the destructive forces of magic made him, he must watch.</p><p>At that moment, Lucan pressed his advantage. Grabbing her chin, he forced his plundering mouth over hers. It took only an instant before he lifted his head, let out a mighty roar, and wrapped his hand around Sabelle\u0092s throat and squeezed.</p><p>More than ready, Caden darted toward them. Lucan\u0092s arms flexed with muscle and fury as he tried to wring the life out of the witch. Her legs flailed, and she raised her arms, clearly trying to summon magic.</p><p>They did not need to compound one tragedy with another. There must be another way to help his brother. He\u0092d step up his efforts with Sydney\u0097anything but this.</p><p>With his own shout, Caden threw a forearm around his brother\u0092s neck and braced his knees on the mattress. Yanking at Lucan, he tugged his brother away from Sabelle. She gasped, and he was relieved to hear her catch her breath. But the relief was short-lived when Lucan broke loose, turned on him with the wild blue eyes of a madman, and attacked.</p><p>When riled, his brother had the strength of ten men, and Caden knew as soon as Lucan pinned him to the bed and grabbed his throat that, despite superior training, he was in for the fight of his life. He pushed at Lucan\u0092s chest and writhed, struggling against his brother\u0092s hold. But Lucan held a tight grip, nearly crushing his windpipe, cutting off his air. He choked, gasped, barely registering a shuffling beside him. While he didn\u0092t want to die, he prayed Sabelle got help, rather than putting herself in harm\u0092s path again.</p><p>Suddenly, Lucan went slack and collapsed in a heap over Caden like dead weight. He pushed his brother off him, then looked around for Sabelle, who was belting her robe around her waist, looking somewhere between embarrassed and contrite.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m so sorry,\u0094 she murmured, looking ready to tear up.</p><p>Caden shoved his brother away, then rose and held her awkwardly. \u0093For not succeeding? How could you have known?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, for being na\u010fve. I didn\u0092t believe he would actually hurt a loved one.\u0094 She dropped her gaze, bit her lip. \u0093He would have killed us both if we hadn\u0092t worked together.\u0094</p><p>\u0093How did you do stop him?\u0094</p><p>\u0093A quick spell. You intervened enough for me to use my hands and cast it. Lucan is not just asleep but unconscious. I hope that, in my panic, my spell didn\u0092t hit him too hard.\u0094 She winced.</p><p>Another instance of magic potentially backfiring, and he still had the original problem to tackle. \u0093You did what was necessary to save us both.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It wouldn\u0092t have happened if I hadn\u0092t loosened his chains, had kept him from kissing me. I . . .\u0094</p><p>Sabelle began to sob. Caden wrapped his arms around her gently and let her cry. He didn\u0092t want magic in his life, didn\u0092t want to be here, but the least he could do was help the woman who had bravely put herself in harm\u0092s path to aid Lucan.</p><p>Caden held her tighter, swearing that he would never have a mate to mourn, never put others through this magical torture. He wanted to ask her what they could do next to care for Lucan, but now wasn\u0092t the time. The burden sat squarely on his shoulders. Caden had to find Anka and not rely on Sabelle\u0092s sacrifices.</p><p>\u0093Never again.\u0094 He took her face in his hands and wiped her tears away. Guilt crashed into him. He should have said no from the start. \u0093Ever. We\u0092ll find another way.\u0094</p><p>\u0093This may be the only way to keep him alive.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That can\u0092t be true. You did your best, but\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093What is going on here?\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s gaze zipped to the door and the sound of the growl. Ice filled up the portal, wearing an unpleasant scowl that said he hadn\u0092t yet decided whether to offer help or rip Caden\u0092s head off. The big, skull-shaved warrior prowled into the room, his green gaze settling on Sabelle\u0097and getting more furious by the instant. He looked like a man about to pound flesh first and ask questions later. He also radiated a territorial vibe Caden couldn\u0092t miss.</p><p>Caden backed away from Sabelle. No need to compound the problems already swirling in the room.</p><p>\u0093What the fuck is this?\u0094 If patience and politeness were virtues, Ice possessed not an iota of either.</p><p>Sabelle raised her chin. \u0093I was caring for Lucan.\u0094</p><p>Ice looked between Lucan on the floor, then Sabelle with her wild, tangled hair, the hem of her short robe, and the blue imprint of fingers on her neck.</p><p>Fury roared across Ice\u0092s face as the menacing warrior turned on him. \u0093Your prick of a brother did this to her? Did you stand and watch, you motherfucking pervert, while he hurt her?\u0094</p><p>Before Caden could think of an explanation, Ice clobbered him with a right cross, then followed up with a mean uppercut to the abdomen. Caden doubled over and nearly vomited. He could fight the warrior in hand-to-hand and, being better trained, could probably win. But Caden remained still. Why defend his actions?</p><p>\u0093Were you hoping to have a go at her next? I\u0092m going to rip your throat out with my bare hands. Neither you nor your brother will touch her again.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Ice, stop!\u0094 Sabelle demanded.</p><p>To his surprise, the big warrior whipped his fists to his sides, despite looking ready to pulverize any who touched Sabelle again.</p><p>\u0093It was my choice to serve Lucan and have Caden stay.\u0094 Clenched jaw, Ice cursed. \u0093He hurt you. I won\u0092t allow that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t need your approval. Lucan is not in his right mind, and he\u0092s my friend.\u0094 She turned to Caden, who rubbed his assaulted gut. \u0093Go. I need to gather myself, clean up before I face my brother.\u0094</p><p>She swallowed and, for the first time, looked genuinely nervous.</p><p>Caden grabbed her hand. \u0093I cannot thank you enough for your effort. On behalf of my brother, I\u0092m sorry . . . for what he put you through. I will talk to Bram\u0097\u0094</p><p>Ice shouldered his way between them and shoved Caden back. \u0093Do not touch her.\u0094</p><p>Rather than tempt fate, Caden stepped away.</p><p>Sabelle sighed. \u0093I\u0092ll talk to my brother. Tell him I\u0092ll be down shortly.\u0094</p><p>With a sigh, Caden turned away. At the portal, he glanced back to see Sabelle send Ice a fiery glare. No one said a word, but he had a feeling that the possessive male was about to get a serious dressing down. Caden\u0092s guess? Sabelle wanted plenty of distance between her and Ice. His other guess? Ice wasn\u0092t about to let that stop him.</p><p>Long after dark, Sydney finished her interview and reached home, completely drained physically. Emotionally, she was wired. So much food for thought. That poor woman remembered so little of her adulthood, and Sydney could only imagine how horrific her torture had been. Despite being victimized, the self-professed witch knew that she\u0092d left loved ones behind. The woman had sobbed about the open wound inside her, about the guilt and incompleteness that hollowed her.</p><p>Being unmoved by such a soul-baring was impossible. It made Sydney question everything in her life. She\u0092d put men and dating on the back burner to concentrate on her career. But at times, like tonight, she felt so alone. Her body and heart ached. But now, sitting in her darkened living room, not just any man would fill up the empty place inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only Caden.</p><p>Why? She barely knew him. A few days shouldn\u0092t be enough to make her crave him. But she wanted him in a way that was beyond both her experience and her ability to describe. She didn\u0092t just want, she needed to feel his mouth demanding carnal pleasure from her, to see desire in his eyes, to have him wrap her in his arms afterward and hold her tenderly. The thought of taking him in her hands, watching his pleasure build, then sharing herself with him and revealing how much he meant to her, made her ache. What the bloody hell was it about the man? They shared good chemistry . . . but this was more.</p><p>Sighing, she uncurled herself from the sofa and meandered back to her bedroom. She might as well tuck herself in early, catch up on sleep. Maybe this odd need would go away.</p><p>Good advice, but Sydney gravitated straight to the picture window in her bedroom. The night danced across the moonlit skyline, a vision of urban romance with St. Paul and the London Eye lit up. The sight magnified her loneliness. In the silent blue dark, with faint sounds of humanity below, she admitted that she didn\u0092t want anyone but Caden.</p> <p>If he wanted her, it wasn\u0092t with the same passion.</p><p>As she turned away from the window to her bed, heavy tears filled her eyes again. Swallowing, she stared up at the ceiling and willed them away. Not now. Later, she would give in to her loneliness and her need for chocolate. If she started now, she feared she\u0092d cry until her nose turned bunny red and her eyes swelled for days.</p><p>Determined to leave the pity party behind, Sydney went through her bedtime ritual. If she felt sorry for anyone, it should be that poor witch, who was haunted by a man she couldn\u0092t remember\u0097and wanted to so desperately. Her plight had touched something inside Sydney. Though her own parents were happy, she\u0092d always been unlucky in love. And now she wanted no one but Caden.</p><p>Sydney crawled into bed. She closed her eyes and pictured him lying beside her, touching her, rolling over and demanding her body with just one look from those piercing blue eyes. In her mind, he murmured how much he wanted her, how much she meant to him, and she melted.</p><p>Foolish. She shook her head to clear away the fantasy. He wanted her story, her sources, her information, much more than he wanted her. She must dislodge the fantasy and get to sleep.</p> <p>A distraction. She needed one now to take her mind off the melodrama of her own PMS-induced depression or whatever it was.</p><p>A good book would do the trick. Or maybe she should spend a little time with her new \u0093magical\u0094 diary. She snorted, but she opened her nightstand drawer and glanced at it.</p><p>She\u0092d expected Aquarius to fix her office in a Feng Shuifriendly arrangement or give her a half-hour session with an astrological counselor. But a magical journal that granted fantasies? The concept was intriguing and unexpected, but a bit far out\u0097even for Aquarius.</p><p>What do you have to lose? her assistant had asked. Her dignity. Her sanity. Her hunky photographer when he laughed in her face if he ever saw what she wrote.</p><p>But how would he? She kept the book in her bedroom\u0097a place he\u0092d likely never enter. Besides, the possibility that she actually held a magical diary was as likely as little green men taking over Britain next week. So how would he ever know?</p><p>As she snuggled down into her blankets, she wondered what Caden would be like as a lover. Soft? Dominating? A challenge? Intense\u0097she\u0092d bet that much. Caden didn\u0092t seem the type to do anything halfway.</p> <p>At the thought, need gripped Sydney low in her belly. She felt hot and cold, light-headed and heavy-limbed as a new vision gripped her imagination. What if, yesterday morning, he hadn\u0092t come to her flat to search for information, but to ravish her? What if, when she answered the door in her lingerie, he\u0092d been overcome with passion and taken her right there? Mmm, heaven. Sinking into the vision, she imagined them breathing together\u0097a sharp inhalation at the end of each plunging thrust. With strong fingers, he\u0092d grip her hips as if he couldn\u0092t get deep enough, wouldn\u0092t be satisfied until he claimed her completely. She closed her eyes and let the fantasy consume her. A drop of sweat trickled down his brow, onto her chest. Jaw set, he threw his head back and moaned that no other woman affected him this way.</p><p>Yes, she knew he\u0092d turned her down and been more interested in the contents of her stories than her knickers. But it was her fantasy.</p><p>Maybe . . . writing her wishes about Caden would be cathartic. If she got them out of her system, perhaps she could sleep and wake tomorrow with this odd obsession gone.</p><p>Sydney peeked at the diary. Flushed and tingling, she picked up the red book. To hell with caution. She would worry later about what would happen if Caden ever read her wishes. Or the unlikely chance that she could actually compel him to her bed magically. If that happened, she\u0092d deal with the damage to her heart then. Plus, she\u0092d earmarked the book as a potential story. If she was considering writing about the little volume, shouldn\u0092t she research it?</p><p>Impulsively, she grabbed the little book and wrote:</p><p>Dear Magical Diary,</p><p>I have this fantasy. Mad, really. But I dream of Caden MacTavish storming my door, ordering me naked, ravishing my body . . .</p><p>An hour later, Sydney sighed as she put her pen aside and closed the book. Desire dampened her palms, the valley between her breasts, the cleft between her thighs. Oh, now she really ached for Caden and the delicious fantasy she\u0092d just written.</p> <p>Imagination was a powerful aphrodisiac. As the words flowed from her mind onto the page, Sydney felt as if she\u0092d slipped into a trance. She could nearly feel Caden\u0092s mouth caressing her nape, his fingers rolling her nipples, his erection sliding a burning path deep inside her. She could almost hear him say that he could not resist her for another minute, look at her like she alone mattered to him.</p><p>The compelling fantasy left her with an urgent need for satisfaction. And while she wanted Caden to sate her, he wasn\u0092t here. Nor was he likely to suddenly appear and make this all a reality, despite Aquarius\u0092s claims.</p><p>Sydney reached for the light, intent on dousing it so she could find her own relief. But she happened to glance at the book first. There, in script that was not hers, were two lines she had not written:</p><p>Sleep, dream, anticipate . . .</p><p>The fantasy you imagine will soon be your fate.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>SUNDAY MORNING CAME, AND though his head throbbed after drowning images of last night with whiskey, Caden knew he must ask someone to teleport him to London. He hated relying on magic, but without a clear idea where he was or how to get back to London, he was stuck.</p><p>\u0093You look like hell,\u0094 Bram offered.</p><p>No shit. Caden pried open one eye, wincing at the sunlight, and stared back at the Doomsday Brethren\u0092s leader. The wizard looked surprisingly disheveled and exhausted.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re unlikely to win any bloody pageants, either.\u0094 Caden snorted, then sobered as he remembered Sabelle and her sacrifice. \u0093Bram, about your sister . . . she\u0092s taking a great deal of risk to help my brother and . . .\u0094</p><p>He didn\u0092t want anything tragic to befall Sabelle, but how could he tell Bram to make her stop when she might be the only person separating Lucan from death?</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re worried.\u0094 Bram sighed. \u0093I\u0092m not surprised. She\u0092s always been too brave.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Helping Lucan is very dangerous.\u0094</p><p>Bram frowned. \u0093She\u0092s your last recourse. I understand your discomfort. Even Ice had words with me last night about the matter. But, in truth, she\u0092ll heed none of us and do exactly as she likes.\u0094</p><p>Before Caden could argue, a series of gongs and whistles sounded, startling him.</p><p>Bram stiffened and swore. \u0093What the hell does he want?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Who?\u0094 Caden scanned the room in confusion. There was no one about but the two of them.</p><p>\u0093Shock Denzell. That sound is his magical calling card.\u0094</p><p>Instead of mentally easing the barriers around the estate, Bram stomped down the stairs and darted out the open door. There, in the distance, stood a cross between a bodybuilder and a Mack truck. Something out of a Terminator movie. Big, bad, and hiding behind dark sunglasses, Shock stood with arms crossed over his leather-clad chest, wearing an unapologetic fuck-off glare.</p><p>\u0093Why are you here?\u0094 Bram stalked out to meet him. Caden followed in curiosity.</p><p>\u0093Let me in.\u0094</p><p>Caden stiffened. The man had been Lucan\u0092s rival for Anka. Since Caden had been avoiding everyone magical for years, he didn\u0092t know the intimate details of his brother\u0092s life. He hadn\u0092t seen Lucan\u0092s mate since he was a young boy. But one thing he knew: His brother hated Shock.</p><p>\u0093After the way you supported your old chum Mathias a few short weeks ago?\u0094 Bram stopped before the wizard, arms crossed. \u0093I think not.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Are you bloody stupid?\u0094 Shock whispered. \u0093Who put the Doomsday Diary back in Olivia\u0092s hands that night? Who helped her focus her magic so she could blast Mathias with her power?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Trying to convince me you\u0092re a hero?\u0094 Bram drawled, skeptical brow raised.</p><p>\u0093Pull your head out of your arse, Rion. Think.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Right now, I simply can\u0092t. Your boss is making my life hell and I would rather fry your brain and be done with you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re a stubborn sod, you know that? I\u0092m being cautious in case I\u0092ve been followed. Zain is suspicious and eager to please Mathias. Let me in so we can\u0092t be overheard, and I\u0092ll explain.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Are you alone?\u0094</p><p>Caden whirled on Bram. Trust Shock? \u0093Are you mad?\u0094</p><p>The wizard ignored him.</p><p>Shock threw his arms wide as if to illustrate his solitude. \u0093Yes. If I weren\u0092t, I know you\u0092d try to kill me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093There would be no try about it.\u0094 Then Bram closed his eyes, frowning in concentration. A minute later, he pierced Shock with a cold stare. \u0093You have three minutes to explain where the bloody hell you\u0092ve been. If you pull anything, nearly every Doomsday warrior is here and would be glad to help me off you. If I dislike your answer, I\u0092ll shut you in a room with Lucan, and God help you then.\u0094</p><p>Shock scowled, looking puzzled, but began hiking through the foggy morning, toward the house. Caden wondered how the devil Shock could possibly be confused.</p><p>\u0093I say we skip his explanation and let Lucan take him apart. I\u0092ll help.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The option has appeal, but I want to hear this.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Honestly,\u0094 Caden whispered, holding him back. \u0093Who benefited most when Anka disappeared?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Shock, clearly. But Olivia herself saw Anka with Mathias.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And who does Shock likely work for? Perhaps I\u0092ve been chasing Sydney\u0092s source foolishly. Maybe Shock has Anka under our noses and in his bed.\u0094</p><p>Bram paused. \u0093I don\u0092t think he\u0092d advocate a scheme that allowed Mathias to abuse her. Shock Called to Anka. A wizard\u0092s first instinct is to protect the woman he sees as his mate. Besides, during the battle in the tunnel, Shock delivered the Book of Doomsday to Olivia, not Mathias. The big question is, why?\u0094</p><p>Likely for his own purposes. Caden gritted his teeth. Bram was going to think whatever he wished until something convinced him otherwise; he\u0092d learned that much about the wizard in the last few weeks. Fine. Shock would show his true colors soon enough.</p><p>A few moments later, they entered the foyer, the click of Shock\u0092s boots surprisingly quiet for someone who so nearly qualified as a giant. Caden sized him up, hate poisoning his blood. Shock must know something about Anka\u0092s whereabouts. He was likely hoping Lucan would die and leave behind a grieving widow looking for someone to cling to.</p><p>\u0093What the fuck are you staring at?\u0094 Shock challenged him.</p><p>\u0093Trash.\u0094</p><p>The big wizard set his jaw, mouth tight. \u0093I haven\u0092t come here to fight with you.\u0094</p><p>In a way, Caden wished he would. If it weren\u0092t for the magic thing, Caden believed that he could take Shock and teach him a lesson or two, despite the fact Shock was big and mean. Caden had fast reflexes, good training, and fury on his side.</p><p>\u0093You can\u0092t beat me. I could crush you without magic. Learn to mask your thoughts, neophyte.\u0094</p><p>That was it; Caden had had enough. A part of him wanted to avenge his brother. He\u0092d done precious little else for Lucan in years. What if he died before Caden could make amends? The other part of him simply hated his leather-clad swagger.</p><p>As he lunged for Shock, Bram stuck out an arm, blocking his chest and, using some sort of damn magic, pushed him against the wall.</p><p>\u0093You two aren\u0092t doing this now.\u0094 Then he turned to Shock. \u0093Say what you came to.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I want everyone to hear, Ice, Marrok, Duke, Lucan.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Ice and Marrok are here. I\u0092ll call for Duke.\u0094 Bram paused. \u0093I\u0092ll play along that you know nothing about Anka.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Anka?\u0094 Shock\u0092s face lost the challenging sneer. \u0093What about her?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your boss took her from my brother,\u0094 Caden spat, frustration at the last few weeks boiling up. \u0093He broke their bond, raped her, and now she\u0092s missing.\u0094</p><p>Shock froze. Violence filled the air as his mouth thinned into a white line. \u0093What?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Terriforz,\u0094 Bram supplied. \u0093It appears Mathias overtook Anka\u0092s mind and forced her body to crave what she mentally rejected. Now, we can\u0092t locate her.\u0094</p><p>Shock looked at the ceiling, drew in a deep, noisy breath. Caden had the distinct impression the wizard was collecting himself.</p><p>When he looked back at them, rage had transformed his face. Even with the sunglasses, Caden discerned horror and anger\u0097and bloodlust.</p><p>He whirled on Bram. \u0093How is this fucking possible? How did I not hear about this?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Actually, that\u0092s our question for you. After all, you and Mathias are chummy these days.\u0094</p><p>Shock shook his head. \u0093We\u0092re playing bloody head games. Don\u0092t you know that he became the most feared wizard of our time because he\u0092s damned devious? He\u0092s suspicious and keeps many secrets. Do you have any leads on Anka\u0092s whereabouts? Can Lucan help?\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bram shrugged. \u0093No. Lucan is mad with mate mourning, Anka was with Mathias . . . then disappeared.\u0094</p><p>\u0093So you don\u0092t even know if she\u0092s alive?\u0094</p><p>Caden hadn\u0092t wanted to entertain the notion that she might be otherwise. But deep down, in a sick region of his stomach, he worried. She had been alive a few days following Mathais\u0092s abduction, but since . . . the ruthless bastard may have killed her and disposed of her body.</p><p>Bram shook his head.</p> <p>\u0093What\u0092s been done to recover her?\u0094 Shock barked.</p><p>Not a word about Lucan or what he\u0092d endured. Prick. \u0093I\u0092m looking. She belongs to my brother, and I will\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Piss off,\u0094 Shock shouted. \u0093If your brother hadn\u0092t stolen her away, she would have been my mate, safe in my house. I will find her.\u0094</p><p>Over his dead body. He must find Anka before Shock did.</p><p>\u0093How?\u0094 Bram challenged. \u0093Can you ask Mathias?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Call the others. I\u0092ll explain.\u0094</p><p>Within a few minutes, Ice and Marrok crowded into Bram\u0092s office. Arguments ensued. Accusations were hurled. Shock didn\u0092t have many fans among the Doomsday Brethren. In fact, he was generally regarded as a traitor. Caden smiled in grim satisfaction.</p><p>It took a few moments more, but Duke arrived, looking more than a bit disinterested in Shock\u0092s excuses.</p><p>Once everyone was seated, Shock brushed everyone\u0092s attitudes aside and paced at the front of the room, excess energy rolling off of him.</p><p>\u0093First, I had no notion about Anka.\u0094 Shock looked up and speared Caden with a glance. \u0093I will do everything I can to find her. You have my word.\u0094</p><p>The word of a wizard, especially this one, meant little to Caden, but arguing that point would only belabor the conversation.</p> <p>\u0093You all assumed the worst of me,\u0094 Shock began. \u0093Given my family name, I\u0092m not surprised. But I never imagined that the lot of you would be that thick.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Meaning?\u0094 Bram raised a haughty brow to let Shock know he was treading thin ice.</p><p>\u0093Do you daft fools really believe you\u0092re going to defeat Mathias in a fair fight? We\u0092re five; seven if we count junior and the lunatic.\u0094</p><p>Again, Caden gnashed his teeth to restrain the urge to pound Shock.</p><p>\u0093Mathias,\u0094 he went on, \u0093has a growing army we barely know how to fight. A handful of able-bodied fighters against a sea of willing suicide killers. Did you honestly believe we could win without a spy? Without someone to rot the Anarki from the inside out?\u0094</p><p>Damn it all. Caden really hated this bastard. But he made sense.</p><p>Bram raised a sharp brow. \u0093So you abandoned us abruptly because you saw an opportunity to pretend to join Mathias\u0092s cause, earn his trust, and eventually stab him in the back?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Exactly. I visited my brother in your holding cell after Lucan and Duke captured him at Marrok\u0092s cottage. I got an earful of Zain\u0092s hero worship for Mathias and a load of alarming information that made me realize we cannot win without being one step ahead. The only way to do that is to have a mole on the inside.\u0094</p> <p>Marrok crossed his enormous arms across his chest. \u0093If that is so, why did you not warn us that Mathias had killed my mate\u0092s father, then masqueraded as Gray so he could lure her to bring the diary to him? Or that he planned to attack in the tunnel?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Or have any bloody clue what had happened to Anka or where she is now?\u0094 Caden challenged.</p><p>He cursed. \u0093Mathias knows I\u0092ve never backed others with his views, so he\u0092s leery of my support. Trust will take time to build. I\u0092m making progress. Be patient.\u0094</p><p>Be patient . . . while the Doomsday Brethren were left to wonder whether Shock was being honest or using these words as a ploy so he could betray them. A quick glance around proved warriors\u0092 attitudes were anywhere from considering to accusatory.</p><p>\u0093Let\u0092s pretend for a moment that any of us believe you,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093The first thing I would say is\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Pretend you believe? Piss off. The lot of you!\u0094 He pinned Bram with a narrow-eyed glare. \u0093In case you\u0092ve forgotten, you asked me to join the Doomsday Brethren. I don\u0092t need your distrust.\u0094</p><p>Shock charged toward the door. Marrok blocked it.</p><p>\u0093Out of my way, human.\u0094</p><p>Marrok leveled him with a stare that would make a normal man shiver. \u0093I will let you leave when Bram tells me you can pass. Not before.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can zap the life out of you,\u0094 he sneered.</p><p>Marrok drew his broadsword. \u0093Not before I sever your head from your body.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Gentlemen,\u0094 Bram placated. \u0093Enough. As you always say, Marrok, we cannot defeat Mathias if we are too busy fighting one another. Because I have no better option and you know it, we will continue with your \u0091plan,\u0092 Shock. For now. I want regular reports, and they\u0092d best be useful. Provide me ideas about the means necessary to defeat Mathias, information like the size of his army and any vulnerabilities. And do it quickly. If you do, we\u0092ll get on just fine. Betray me, and I will find you, then kill you slowly and without mercy.\u0094</p><p>Caden smiled. \u0093With that I\u0092ll be happy to help.\u0094</p><p>Monday morning arrived, as did Caden at nine sharp, sticking his head inside Sydney\u0092s office. He looked generally out of sorts and agitated. Pity for him. If Caden liked doormats, they weren\u0092t going to get on very well.</p><p>Since he couldn\u0092t read her lascivious thoughts or know what she\u0092d written in her \u0093magical\u0094 diary, his visit must be about the magickind story again. She sighed.</p><p>Even so, one glance at him was like a punch to her stomach. He looked incredible in charcoal slacks, a crisp white collar, and a burgundy sweater that accentuated his outdoorsman\u0092s coloring and deep-blue eyes. She must stop mooning like an adolescent. The man was trying to steal from her, no matter how gorgeous he looked. Wanting someone who sought to use her was both stupid and self-destructive.</p><p>She sent him a bland expression, then looked back to her computer screen. \u0093What is it MacTavish? Angry that I lost you at the pub?\u0094</p><p>He shook his head. \u0093No. I want to talk to you. I have since Saturday, but prefer not to talk in the office.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Well, I\u0092ve work to do, so if you\u0092ve something to say, speak up now. And this best be good.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I came to see you last night.\u0094 His stare was hot, direct. It nearly melted her.</p><p>The thought of Caden in her flat again, as she\u0092d written in the diary, made her shiver with longing. Stupid. She\u0092d best keep her head with this one\u0097or she\u0092d find herself out of a story.</p><p>\u0093Did you? I fell asleep early. But after feeding me a load of shit about having inappropriate feelings for me, I\u0092m shocked that you dared to knock on my door again.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That wasn\u0092t a load of shit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093So you stopped by to . . . what? Proposition me after you\u0092d already refused sex?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No. To apologize for trying to force you to take me to your contact. If I want your trust as a partner, that wasn\u0092t the way to earn it.\u0094</p><p>The sincerity in his words pried her gaze away from her e-mails and back to Caden. Granted, this could be another ruse to earn her trust, but he looked earnest.</p><p>\u0093All right, then. Tell me, why are you pursuing this story so hard?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve no wish to steal it. I know you think I do. I swear, I\u0092m not working for a rival or hoping to plaster it across the Internet with my byline.\u0094</p><p>She propped her chin on her hand. \u0093Really? Then why is your curiosity insatiable?\u0094</p><p>He shrugged. \u0093I\u0092m not alone. According to our last staff meeting, so is your readers\u0092.\u0094</p><p>\u0093True, but your interest seems a bit more intense.\u0094</p><p>He sighed, looking reluctant. \u0093I\u0092m worried. Mathias sounds powerful. If you print this story, will he or his army be able to track your source down? How do you know she isn\u0092t critical to Mathias\u0092s success and that he won\u0092t come after her again if you even hint at this woman\u0092s location? Who or what will keep her safe? Is she going with Aquarius on holiday or staying at Aquarius\u0092s place? Will she be safe? If he can\u0092t find her, what about you? Won\u0092t he pursue you to lead him to her?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t imagine that anyone magical reads\u0097\u0094 Sydney stopped and scanned her memory. \u0093Aquarius\u0092s place? I never said that.\u0094</p><p>Instantly, Caden stiffened. \u0093You did. The other day.\u0094</p><p>Sydney thought again. \u0093No. I had something like that written down, though. On the notes in my handbag. You snooped.\u0094 Oh, the lying snake! \u0093You came to my flat Saturday, not because you\u0092re interested in me, but because you were prying through my notes. See, you merely want to talk to my source so you can scoop me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s not true.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You turned down a blatant invitation for sex and repeated things I wrote only in my notes. You apologized to get back in my good graces. It\u0092s clear what you\u0092re after.\u0094</p><p>Instead of guilt, desire ripped across his expression. He raked his hands through his hair, practically oozing frustration. Sydney had never seen him so agitated.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re wrong.\u0094 Through clenched teeth, he vowed, \u0093If I had been less of a gentleman, I would have very gladly taken you up on your offer, fucked you like mad, and shown you not just that I want you, but precisely how.\u0094</p><p>That low-voiced growl, the way his stare seemed to burn the clothes from her body . . . The man made her a walking hormone. Her knickers suddenly went damp, and the way he stared at her, Sydney wouldn\u0092t be surprised if he knew it. She fought to shake off the insane need that scalded her blood, but no such luck. Too bad. She wasn\u0092t about to let him use her desire against her.</p><p>\u0093I challenged you to a game of chicken, and you flinched. Now I know what you\u0092re really about, you poacher. I won\u0092t fall for your manufactured lust and let you steal my story.\u0094</p><p>Caden stormed around her desk and towered over her. His gorgeous body put off heat like an oven, and a scent that made her melt into a puddle of lust. His mouth hovered bare inches above her own, and against her better judgment, Sydney trembled.</p><p>\u0093Manufactured?\u0094 he growled. \u0093What I feel is very real. If I was on top of you, plunged deep, while you were screaming my name, you\u0092d know better.\u0094</p><p>Her insides trembled, and she resisted the urge to fan herself. \u0093Prove it.\u0094</p><p>Caden cursed, something low and ugly. \u0093I can\u0092t. I want to. God, but it\u0092s beyond complicated.\u0094</p><p>Ah, the excuses. \u0093I\u0092m a smart girl. I think I can keep up.\u0094</p><p>Caden swallowed. How much of the truth did he dare tell? Nothing about his quest for Anka, clearly, but the rest. . . . Honesty would be best\u0097or Sydney would see right through him.</p><p>\u0093Desire roils in my gut for you. I\u0092ve never known anything like it. Sometimes, it\u0092s all I can do to stay away.\u0094 His voice shook. He was hard as steel, but she wasn\u0092t looking there. Instead, Caden realized he\u0092d grabbed the arms of her chair, and his face hovered just above hers. She blinked. Her rosy lips parted. He gripped the plastic armrests until he thought they\u0092d break. Damn it, the urge to kiss her nearly overpowered him.</p><p>When had he ever bared such personal feelings to a woman? The question rattled him because he knew the answer was never.</p><p>Sydney rolled her eyes. \u0093C\u0092mon, MacTavish. I handed you sex on a silver platter\u0097twice\u0097and you refused.\u0094</p><p>It had been one of the most difficult things he\u0092d ever done.</p><p>Being this close to Sydney was revving up his libido. If he didn\u0092t get some distance between them, he\u0092d take her up on her offer here and now. God help her if he ever unleashed all this want on her.</p><p>He took a deep breath and a step back. \u0093Not from lack of desire, but a sense of responsibility. We work together. My life now, with Lucan\u0092s illness, is beyond complex. Once he recovers, I\u0092ll be returning to Texas, so beginning anything with you\u0097that would only be temporary and unfair.\u0094</p><p>She frowned. \u0093You\u0092d hardly be my first fling. Or my last. I didn\u0092t ask for commitment.\u0094</p><p>Caden ground his jaw as he imagined another man\u0092s hands on her. The more time he spent with her, the more homicidal that thought made him feel. \u0093If I touched you, I would want more. Need it. That, I know.\u0094</p><p>She sucked in a shocked breath. \u0093What does this have to do with your behavior Saturday? It\u0092s not as if you tried to follow me to my contact because you want to shag me.\u0094</p><p>He looked down at his boots and weighed his answer. Again, he stuck as close to the truth as he dared. \u0093No. I followed you because I worry about you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Me? Not the contact?\u0094</p><p>God, this woman was blazingly tenacious and determined to pry every bit of truth out of him she could. \u0093I don\u0092t want to see anyone hurt, but I\u0092m most concerned about you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Because I\u0092m crossing town or talking to a woman who fears her own shadow?\u0094</p><p>That ever-logical side that drew him to her also proved to make her a stubborn pain in his arse. \u0093Not just a woman, a witch. You don\u0092t know what she\u0092s capable of or if Mathias is still after her. Or could pursue you, simply for writing this story.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps. But I won\u0092t let that stand in the way of the truth.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know,\u0094 he said honestly. If he knew one thing about Sydney, it was that her dedication was unquestionable. \u0093Which is exactly why I didn\u0092t say it sooner. I want to protect you. This may offend your feminist sensibilities, but it\u0092s the soldier in me.\u0094</p><p>Sydney sent him a skeptical glare, but it wasn\u0092t untrue. While protecting her hadn\u0092t been Caden\u0092s primary motive, it had been on his mind.</p><p>She snorted. \u0093I admit, you\u0092re oozing macho.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I didn\u0092t want to tell you because I knew you\u0092d reject the need for a bodyguard.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. Let\u0092s say I believe that you\u0092re merely concerned about me because you have feelings for me that you think would be unfair to act on. What next?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Save my sanity, please. Let me protect you\u0097at least a bit. Tell me what\u0092s happening with the magical war story, so I can be prepared.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hesitated, sent him a long measuring glance. \u0093All right.\u0094</p><p>Caden wasn\u0092t sure she truly believed him, but at least she was talking. He let out a huge sigh of relief. Yes, he wanted to find Anka, right Lucan\u0092s life, return to Dallas. But he did feel the urge to protect Sydney. He would miss her\u0097worry about her\u0097once he\u0092d gone.</p><p>\u0093Did your source give you more information?\u0094 he asked, sitting in the office\u0092s guest chair once more.</p><p>\u0093A bit.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Enough for another article?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not certain yet.\u0094</p><p>She was holding back . . . and he didn\u0092t blame her. He\u0092d handled things badly before. Today hadn\u0092t been loads better, but a least she no longer looked hostile. \u0093Will you share what you know? Please.\u0094</p><p>For a long moment, Sydney did nothing but stare, as if trying to read his thoughts. Finally, she shrugged. \u0093Since you\u0092re my photographer and assigned partner, I\u0092m supposed to work with you. And you\u0092ll read the details when they\u0092re printed.</p><p>\u0093According to my source, the magical war is escalating. Mathias rose from an exile that was supposed to be like death and last forever. Apparently, no one knows how he did it, but everyone knows he wants to overthrow a terrible class system that oppresses the poor. His goal is to help them rise up.\u0094</p> <p>Caden had never heard such a load of tripe. \u0093Or so he says.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. But it makes for a juicy story. Holly wants me to play the angle that since he\u0092s arisen like a savior, magickind will embrace him. The battle in the tunnel a few weeks ago was one of many to throw off the oppressors, and stay tuned for more details.\u0094</p><p>He couldn\u0092t let her print any of that, though he couldn\u0092t tell her why without revealing too much. Besides, Sydney was an independent creature. The minute he told her to do one thing, she\u0092d do the opposite.</p><p>\u0093So you\u0092re glorifying the man who raped this poor woman?\u0094 he asked.</p><p>She paused, then wrinkled her nose. \u0093That\u0092s been my objection, but Holly likes the angle that this witch was an enemy of his utopia and he dealt harshly with her. I couldn\u0092t see another slant.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mathias is no hero. You know bollocks about combat.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Admittedly.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The psychological game is more than half the battle. The aggressor needs the masses on his side, and if he\u0092s in the wrong, he must lie. What if Mathias is bamboozling these magical people? What if he\u0092s claiming to be their savior, but merely wants power for his own gain? What if he\u0092s convinced the poor that he can lift them up, but it\u0092s a huge ruse?\u0094 He clenched his fists, and his shoulders tensed, as if he was barely restraining himself from pounding on the desk. \u0093And what if he raped that poor woman because she belonged to someone fighting on the right side, and Mathias knew he could crush that man by brutalizing his woman?\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s jaw dropped, then she scrambled for a notepad. \u0093You\u0092re bloody good at this. Much more interesting than Holly\u0092s suggestion.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If I talked to your source, in addition to protecting you, perhaps we could craft a better story together.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t.\u0094 Sydney didn\u0092t miss a beat, just continued jotting down notes. \u0093I\u0092ve told you, the poor witch is terrified. A man, especially one like you, would send her scurrying to dig her own grave. She\u0092d never talk again.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Tell me about her. Maybe I can find some way to ease her fears,\u0094 he went on. \u0093You could assure her that I would never harm her. She trusts you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Very little. She jumps at a shadow. No offense, but you wear that soldier mien a bit too well. You could never soothe her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps I should talk to her on the phone first, allay her worries, and pave the way for a face-to-face meeting. For your safety, I\u0092d rather you not meet with her again unless I\u0092m there.\u0094</p> <p>Pausing, Sydney looked up from her notes. \u0093She doesn\u0092t want her picture taken.\u0094</p><p>Caden couldn\u0092t tell if she believed him or would delay meeting with her source without him. And he could neither lose his only possible lead to Anka nor allow Sydney to risk herself.</p><p>\u0093So I won\u0092t take it.\u0094</p><p>Sydney shrugged. \u0093Convincing her will be a challenge. Besides, she\u0092s gone for a bit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093With Aquarius on holiday? Where?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t know. Their plans weren\u0092t set. Said something about Paris, perhaps.\u0094</p><p>Damn! Aquarius and Anka, if she was indeed Sydney\u0092s source, could be anywhere.</p><p>\u0093I have a bad feeling about this story,\u0094 he murmured. \u0093I beg you to hold off unless I can be certain you\u0092re safe.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I think you\u0092re worried more than necessary. It\u0092s . . . sweet of you, but Holly wants another story now. I\u0092m a big girl and I can take care of myself.\u0094</p><p>Tamping down his frustration, he reached for logic. He had to get through to this woman, stop this story. \u0093Where is the picture your previous photographer took of the battle aftermath? Can I have a look?\u0094</p><p>Sydney frowned, then rifled through one of the folders on her desk. When she found the photo, she slid it across the desk to him. \u0093Here.\u0094</p><p>He slid it back in front of her. \u0093How many dead bodies do you see?\u0094</p><p>She glanced at the picture, then away. \u0093It\u0092s too dark and grainy to tell.\u0094</p><p>\u0093More than a few?\u0094 he challenged.</p><p>She hesitated, as if sensing his point before he made it and already looking for a way to refute it. \u0093Yes.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Dozens, in fact. Wouldn\u0092t you say?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps.\u0094 She shrugged.</p><p>\u0093No. Obviously. These were men. Judging from their uniforms, many were soldiers, which means they were trained in combat. And they are dead in droves.\u0094 He paused, letting the words sink in. \u0093If Mathias wanted this story hushed, do you think he\u0092d have any compunction about killing you?\u0094</p><p>Sydney didn\u0092t answer, but Caden knew by the look on her face that she understood his point.</p><p>\u0093By all accounts, there was blood everywhere. Severed heads and limbs, multiple gunshots, and a lot of death. What do you know about avoiding those?\u0094</p><p>Looking about, she fiddled with a pen, tapped her toes. She didn\u0092t like the truth.</p><p>\u0093Sydney?\u0094</p><p>\u0093All right. Nothing. But you can\u0092t fight off magic.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know how to use a gun. Before you do anything for this story, especially visit the madman\u0092s victim, take me with you. That\u0092s all I ask.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll . . . think about it.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>TOWARD THE END OF the day, Holly stomped into Sydney\u0092s office, brows and hands both raised in an expectant expression. People often underestimated her because of her Kewpie doll looks\u0097and always paid the price.</p><p>\u0093Where is the latest installment in the magical war saga?\u0094 Holly asked. \u0093I\u0092ve got loads of e-mails. You won\u0092t believe how interested readers are.\u0094</p><p>Wrong. Seems everyone was, especially her hunky freelance photographer. But this morning, he\u0092d conveyed interest in more than the story with his body taut and passionate words. Whether that interest was a scam remained to be seen. God knows, it had nearly melted her on the spot. She wanted to believe him.</p><p>\u0093I have a draft of the story,\u0094 Sydney said. \u0093Maybe by tomorrow or Wednesday.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What? No, I need it now. It has to be to copy editing no later than tomorrow morning to make the next issue.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know. It\u0092s . . . well, I\u0092m not happy with it, actually. The angle troubles me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093We\u0092ve been over this. I gave you a perfectly good angle.\u0094</p><p>Sydney grimaced. \u0093And I still don\u0092t like glorifying a rapist.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Most people who read us think we\u0092re total rubbish or are lunatics themselves. It\u0092s not as if they\u0092re going to be questioning your journalistic integrity.\u0094</p><p>Sydney felt compelled to get this right. Some of the stories she wrote she knew weren\u0092t real. This felt not only real but critical. \u0093But it\u0092s got my name on the byline. And I know this angle is wrong. Then there\u0092s safety, both the source\u0092s and mine. What if this Mathias character really is real? What if he\u0092s not a savior but a villain?\u0094</p><p>Holly shrugged. \u0093Whatever his reason, would a wizard trying to take magickind in hand really be spending his time reading human tabloids and compiling his hit list?\u0094 Holly frowned. \u0093What\u0092s made you change your mind? After our conversation last night, you seemed set with the story.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Well, I talked to Caden. He made me look at the story in a new light.\u0094</p><p>\u0093His version won\u0092t sell more copies of the paper.\u0094</p><p>Sydney disagreed, not that no one expected accurate reporting from them. Many believed all their stories were fabricated. But Sydney had a different feeling about this one.</p><p>\u0093This poor witch makes me want to print the truth. With it, maybe her family will find her. Or we can prevent more women from being raped, even if Mathias leads a good cause, he\u0092s got a terrible human rights policy. And Caden\u0092s angle sounded interesting, even plausible.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If Caden\u0092s thoughts are causing you to hesitate on turning in an already good story, then he\u0092s given you crap. Why are you letting that man crawl into your head?\u0094</p><p>Good question. She should be focused on her story, told from her perspective. But his concerns for her safety were valid. His insistence was compelling. She felt in those moments as if she\u0092d seen the real Caden, not necessarily his words, but a caring side he usually hid from others. \u0093Something about him isn\u0092t spot on, yet\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093You mean besides trying to talk you out of fine stories? Is he doing his job properly?\u0094</p><p>\u0093He is. Amazing pictures. Crisp. Beautiful angles, even on terrible subjects. His work is like art. That\u0092s not what troubles me. It\u0092s the man himself.\u0094</p><p>Holly frowned, her blond hair falling from her ponytail. \u0093Meaning? Oh hell, you two aren\u0092t having an office shag, are you?\u0094</p><p>Sydney lowered her head to hide the flush she felt crawling up her face. Shagged him, no. Like to? Absolutely. \u0093No. I just need pointers on working with him more effectively.\u0094</p><p>Her editor raised an arched brow. \u0093If you can\u0092t get on with a man that dishy, I\u0092m not certain there\u0092s any hope for you. Smile, flirt, if you must. But tell him what pictures you need. Get the job done.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s not that simple. His behavior . . . I wondered for a bit if he took this job to scoop me on the magical war story.\u0094</p><p>Holly stood up straighter. \u0093Why do you think that?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not certain anymore, but at first, he literally talked of nothing else and showed no interest in any of my other stories. He forever asked questions and hounded me about my source. I told him to bugger off.\u0094</p><p>Holly smiled. \u0093How did he take that?\u0094</p><p>Sydney grimaced. She didn\u0092t mean to put Caden in a bad light, but Holly was more than a boss; she was a mentor too. Perhaps Holly could help her put this mess into perspective. She couldn\u0092t get her editor\u0092s opinion without being honest.</p><p>\u0093Over the weekend, he came to my flat, expressing interest in me romantically, but I assumed he was lying and threw him out. So he waited for me to leave my flat and tried to follow me to my meeting.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Prat. I ought to sack him now.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I thought the same thing. I particularly doubted his reason for returning to the UK. I\u0092m still suspicious of his brother\u0092s mystery illness. Do you know anything about it?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, since that\u0092s personal, I didn\u0092t ask.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I did. He said next to nothing except that it was his reason for returning here after over a dozen years away. He went on sabbatical from a prestigious job to work here, but never talks about his brother. He doesn\u0092t sneak away to call or visit the hospital. He\u0092s reluctant to talk about his brother\u0092s ailment. It\u0092s odd.\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s quiet, that one. So you fear he\u0092s trying to scoop you and made up an ill brother to explain why he\u0092s working here? Tried to get romantic with you so you\u0092d share your source?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Though it sounds far-fetched, I thought so, but now I wonder. Maybe I\u0092ve been tired and paranoid. But he says he\u0092s concerned for my safety, that Mathias could be dangerous. And why help me find a better angle for my story if he only wanted to steal it? Bloody puzzle. Just in case, I\u0092m doing my best to keep him at bay. I don\u0092t want the man getting my information and selling it elsewhere.\u0094</p><p>Holly nodded. \u0093Good thinking. Does he behave guiltily?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Oddly, yes. Guiltily . . . hard to say. Still waters run deep. Until he suddenly became agitated today, I don\u0092t think I\u0092ve ever seen a man more still.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Agitated? Do you think he\u0092s violent?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No. But I can\u0092t shake the feeling that something isn\u0092t right. I can\u0092t prove he wants my story. He argued very passionately that he doesn\u0092t, but I can\u0092t fathom another reason for his odd behavior.\u0094</p><p>Her editor frowned. \u0093This story is too important to us. Keep your notes to yourself. Lock everything up. Don\u0092t leave your computer untended without password protecting it. And drop off the current one to copy editing tonight.\u0094</p><p>Sydney hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u0093Good. Other papers are starting to get interested. In fact, I had a call from a rival today, feeling me out on the same thing. Which reminds me! I\u0092ve also had a ring from another bloke, claiming to have pictures of the tunnel and the bodies no one else has. Odd name . . .\u0094 Holly\u0092s brow furrowed as the wheels in her head turned. \u0093Zain Something-or-another!\u0094 She shrugged. \u0093I\u0092ll chat with him, see what he\u0092s got and if we want to acquire it.\u0094</p><p>That should have made Sydney feel better, but didn\u0092t. The fact remained, Caden worked beside her for a cause she could only guess at, while her interest in him had grown. \u0093Brilliant.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s next?\u0094</p><p>\u0093In the magical war story? I don\u0092t know. This trail is starting to get cold. I don\u0092t think my source can tell me much more. And if I told her I was a reporter, I think she\u0092d stop talking altogether. So unless there\u0092s another magical battle, I\u0092ll have to try some related stories. I have the supposed \u0091magical diary\u0092 that Aquarius gave me for my birthday. When she returns from holiday, I\u0092ll ask about its origins.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Have you tested it out?\u0094</p><p>A mental image of a naked Caden pressing her body to a wall and taking everything he wanted from her burned across her brain. She\u0092d written that nearly forty-eight hours ago.</p><p>Sydney sighed in disappointment. \u0093Yeah. I don\u0092t think it works.\u0094</p><p>With a gasp, Caden sat up in his darkened room, bathed in sweat. Oh dear God. That had been the most vivid dream of his life. Of all the times to have X-rated dreams, why now? And why about Sydney Blair?</p> <p>Closing his eyes, he relived her greeting at the door wearing a wisp of lace hardly worth mentioning. What happened next\u0097wild against the wall after she stripped slowly for him\u0097was straight out of his fantasies.</p><p>He could have that tonight, have her. Now. She\u0092d offered a mere two days ago and would have gotten naked with him that moment if he had accepted her proposition. There were a thousand reasons he shouldn\u0092t and only one that compelled him: that bloody mating instinct that told him he\u0092d found his \u0093the one\u0094 and screamed at him to take her.</p><p>Exhaling, still trying to recover his heartbeat, he looked down at his erection in the shadowy dark. Insistent. Painful. Fueled by the oldest magic there was.</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>He wouldn\u0092t sleep again tonight, not while he ached and his blood was on fire and visions of Sydney against him burned into his thoughts. He could endure a sleepless night; it wouldn\u0092t be his first. But tomorrow, he\u0092d have to face Sydney at the office, his brain continually tripping over all the delicious ways in which she\u0092d clawed his back as he thrust deep into her in his dream. He knew the musky scent of her arousal, the faint tang of her skin, the throaty groan she made when she came, and the peace of being with her and knowing she was safe and whole. And his.</p> <p>Closing his eyes, he lay back in his empty bed. Thinking about Sydney this way wasn\u0092t going to help him get back to sleep or deal with her tomorrow. He turned to the clock. Eleven p.m.? He sighed, frustration cutting him like a razor.</p><p>Bloody hellacious day. After verbally boxing with Sydney, he\u0092d come home exhausted yet thrumming with sexual energy. All day, thoughts of stripping Sydney of her evil little skirt and finding out exactly what she had beneath plagued him. Once at home, however, the need for sleep had pulled him under. He\u0092d crashed into bed around seven. The previous two nights, he\u0092d slept nearly twelve hours. Very unlike him. So was having erotic dreams and waking up after a mere four hours of sleep because his body demanded her.</p><p>Go to Sydney, something in his head whispered. You ache for her. She wants you.</p><p>\u0093And then what?\u0094 he muttered to the empty room. He still had to work with her. And after what Lucan had endured, he didn\u0092t want a magical mate, especially one intent on exposing Mathias.</p><p>But Sydney haunted him. He wanted\u0097needed\u0097to feel her naked under him, to know she was his. He was bloody obsessed. To make matters worse, his transition was coming.</p><p>Obviously, magic wasn\u0092t going to leave him alone. His change from man to wizard wasn\u0092t coming tonight, but it was coming soon. There wasn\u0092t a damn thing he could do to stop it. If male and born with the magical gene, somewhere around thirty, you transitioned and you endured. His birthday was in eight days.</p> <p>Caden shivered in the November chill, despite his overheated body. He reached for the blankets and groaned when they brushed his naked cock. The sensation made him grit his teeth and fist the blankets. The ache nearly flattened him with need for Sydney.</p><p>Madness. He had to stop this. Had to put her out of his mind, douse his sex drive, get some sleep so he could function tomorrow.</p><p>Reaching beneath the covers, he took himself in hand and stroked his turgid length once. Again. Again, rapidly picking up speed and pleasure. After his dream, it didn\u0092t take much, and he soon felt ready to burst. A vision of Sydney, bare and wanton, blazed across his mind as his muscles tensed. His breathing ratcheted up; his hand moved faster. He dug his heels into the mattress and arched as the need detonated into a bliss that had him shouting at his peak.</p><p>As the orgasm subsided, he cursed, still panting. He was every bit as hard and needy as he had been before masturbating. Visions of Sydney still gyrated in his head. Yet he was so damn tired. Drained.</p><p>He closed his eyes, and the dream came back.</p><p>\u0093Touch me,\u0094 she whispered in his slumber. \u0093Here.\u0094 She guided his hand over her breast, inviting him to toy with her hard nipple. \u0093And here.\u0094 She brought his hand all the way between her legs, to where she was moist and burning and ready.</p><p>Again, he wrapped his fingers around his erection. Like steel, as if his orgasm had never happened. Jerking his hand away, Caden cursed. He didn\u0092t want more self-pleasure; it wouldn\u0092t help, not when he craved a certain redheaded reporter and her honest, intelligent grit.</p><p>Damn magic for ensuring he couldn\u0092t ignore his feelings for Sydney.</p> <p>He rose and took a quick shower, tossed on a T-shirt, jog pants, and trainers. Then he hesitated.</p><p>He couldn\u0092t just cross town in the middle of the night, pound on Sydney\u0092s door, and demand sex. It made no sense, especially after he\u0092d raised her suspicions. She might even refuse to let him in her flat.</p><p>If he made love to her . . . well, the whole event was fraught with personal danger, magical landmines. He refused to take a mate and risk Lucan\u0092s fate. So he couldn\u0092t kiss Sydney, taste her at all. Nor could he risk this job. He needed this job too badly for his mission to fail merely for a shag.</p><p>But what he felt for sassy, smart Sydney was more than sex. Far more. He connected with her in a way he couldn\u0092t explain, and Caden feared that, once he had her, the random women at the pubs he\u0092d been using to balance his sexual energy would no longer do. Already, his fixation on Sydney frightened him.</p><p>Definitely, he should stay home. Undress, go back to sleep, stop thinking about the sharp, sexy redhead. He raced to the kitchen of his little rented flat near the paper\u0092s offices. Shadows darkened the room, faintly illuminated by London\u0092s lights. There, on the counter, were his keys. He needed to leave them there, refuse temptation.</p><p>In his dream, Caden had been unable to resist Sydney. What he felt now was ten times stronger.</p><p>With a curse, he grabbed the keys, shoved them in his pocket, then stormed out the door.</p><p>After midnight, Sydney unfolded herself from the couch and stretched. Lace and silk cupped her torso, the ribbon laces of her mini-corset rubbing the soft flesh between her breasts. The tiny sheer thong hugged her hips. She adored the feel of soft, feminine things against her skin. But her exposed cheeks \u0091round back were a bit nippy. Time for bed, anyway.</p><p>Grabbing her robe from the arm of the sofa, she made for the hallway with a yawn. Her next installment of the magical war story would run later this week. She hoped she\u0092d taken the right approach in rewriting it as Caden suggested before turning it in. Contrary to Holly\u0092s opinion, Sydney did think the angle made a difference.</p><p>All night, she\u0092d thought of Caden. She\u0092d half-expected the diary to work. Hoping that tonight was the night, she\u0092d donned her sexiest lingerie, but as she\u0092d told Holly, Aquarius\u0092s claims that the diary was magical seemed to be crap.</p><p>She took two steps down the hallway, before someone banged a fist on her door. Frowning, she darted for the foyer. Her telly was off and she didn\u0092t have a yappy dog, so whoever stood at her door couldn\u0092t be complaining about noise. Maybe someone needed help?</p><p>Racing the last few steps to the door, she called, \u0093Who is it?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Caden. Open the door, Sydney. Now.\u0094</p><p>Her surprise was quickly washed away by that voice. A bit angry. Insistent. And dripping sex. She shivered.</p><p>Her jittery fingers closed around the lock and unlatched it, then fumbled to grab the knob. Before she could turn it, the cold metal rotated in her palm and the door flew open.</p><p>Caden filled the doorway, breathing hard, his entire body tense. Those blue eyes lit on her mouth like a laser. Hot. Sydney tingled.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she struggled to find her voice. \u0093Why\u0097\u0094</p><p>He kicked the door closed. The crash boomed in her little foyer, resounding in her ears, echoing her racing heart as he reached behind his head, gathered his baggy white shirt in his fist, and yanked it over his head. Tossing it to the floor, he stood silently. Watching. Primed. His muscled chest and shoulders rose and fell with each hard breath. His abdomen rippled. Veins and tendons stood out across his forearms and hands.</p><p>Her mouth was agape, and she couldn\u0092t stop staring. Oh my Lord, she\u0092d known he was gorgeous, suspected he was well put together. But this male animal was far more than she bargained for. Dangerous. Pushed to the edge.</p><p>Sydney had never wanted any man more. She swallowed.</p><p>\u0093You know why I\u0092ve come.\u0094</p><p>If she hadn\u0092t guessed by now, his sexual growl told her everything.</p><p>Had he reconsidered her proposition? Or was it even possible the magical book had persuaded him?</p><p>\u0093What about a fling being unfair to me because you\u0092re returning to Dallas?\u0094</p><p>Those burning eyes of his lit a path of fire from her face to her breasts, then . . . between her legs. She felt his stare like a physical caress, as if he\u0092d reached out and rubbed his fingers over her flesh. Sydney steadied herself on the table beside her. Her robe, once slung over her arm, floated to the floor.</p><p>\u0093I . . . can\u0092t stay away. God knows I tried. Do you want me?\u0094</p><p>She shouldn\u0092t. This was mad. Dangerous. \u0093Yes.\u0094</p><p>His gaze skated over her lingerie once more. \u0093Take it off. All of it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Here?\u0094 Her voice squeaked, and she cursed herself. She was never meek, never backed down, and rarely showed vulnerability. She also didn\u0092t sleep with men she\u0092d never dated. But Caden . . . apparently, she had a whole new set of rules for him.</p><p>He lifted a brow, stepped closer, and reached for her. Sydney got the distinct impression that if she didn\u0092t get her silky things off fast enough, he\u0092d dispense with them quickly\u0097and without a lot of care, just like the fantasy she\u0092d written in the magical diary. Her womb clenched at the thought.</p><p>It took her two tries, but she plucked at the tie between her breasts and loosened the soft corset. Breathing ragged, she shimmied it over her hips, exposing her breasts to the cool night air and his rapt gaze.</p><p>He zeroed in on the hard tips. Usually a pale peach, tonight, for Caden, they were a deep coral. His possessive stare made her ache.</p><p>With a new lover, she often worried they\u0092d find her smallish breasts disappointing. The way Caden\u0092s gaze latched onto her, and he clenched his fists as he stepped closer made her insecurity evaporate. The worry was replaced by pure heat\u0097a wall of it as his chest loomed close and his temperature rivaled an inferno.</p><p>\u0093The rest,\u0094 he growled, eyeing the nearly transparent thong with malice.</p><p>A thrill zipped up her spine as she hooked her thumbs in the waistband of her little panties and lowered them down her thighs, over her calves, until she kicked them away, leaving her entirely exposed.</p><p>He took a step closer, then another, and placed his palm flat against the wall beside her head. His chest brushed hers, scalding hot. Sydney gasped.</p><p>\u0093Touch me,\u0094 she whispered. \u0093Here.\u0094</p><p>Trembling, she guided his hand over her breast. A moment later, his thumb and forefinger put delicious pressure on her nipple. Her breath caught as the cascade of hot tingles sizzled through her body, lighting her up. Her head slipped back to lean against the wall. She closed her eyes. This was her fantasy, only better.</p><p>\u0093Look at me.\u0094 His voice was a rumble in the shadows. He stood, brightened only by the little lamp on her foyer table, just enough to highlight his serious six-pack and the molten demand in his eyes.</p><p>Caden nodded his approval, and a fresh wave of delighted surprise swept over her. Until today, she\u0092d always thought of him as controlled, of having his emotions buried. Now, he strained against his own leash, the edges of his restraint frayed. One unexpected move, and he might unchain a whole mountain of alpha male on her. Goodie.</p><p>\u0093And touch me here.\u0094 Latching onto his wrist, she ushered his hand between her legs, where she was moist and burning and needy.</p><p>He seemed more than happy to accommodate her, his fingers dipping into her slit to gather moisture, then rub it over her clit. Their gazes locked as an aching ball of tension clenched low in her belly. Awareness of him lapped at her as the sensations he gave overwhelmed her. She gripped his arms, reveling in the taut, solid feel of him as his fingers filled the aching emptiness inside her. Yes, she needed this. Needed him.</p><p>He pumped his fingers into her, catching that spot high and inside that had her clawing his back, panting his name, hoping she never had to let him go. How could he do that in two minutes or less? And could he please do it again?</p><p>\u0093If you don\u0092t want me to fuck you now, you have three seconds to say no.\u0094</p><p>Sydney didn\u0092t hesitate. \u0093I said yes when you walked in the door.\u0094</p><p>He took a deep breath, air filling his chest, his massive shoulders rising like he was preparing for something big. Then, in a few short movements, he plucked at the drawstring of his pants and toed off his trainers. No boxers or tightie whities for him. Everything about the sight was impressive.</p><p>While she was still staring, he crouched in front of her and placed a hot, open-mouthed kiss on the flat of her abdomen, then wound up her body to suck and nip at the hard tips of her breasts. He gripped her thighs in his large hands as his mouth marched up to the column of her neck. She arched to give him better access, and he laved her with hot kisses that feathered a shiver all down her spine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sydney hadn\u0092t finished processing the thrill of his mouth on her skin and the knee-melting male scent of him when he lifted her against him and braced her back against the wall.</p><p>\u0093The bedroom is just down the hall,\u0094 she whispered, though secretly thrilled that he wanted to take her rough and urgent against the wall, just as she\u0092d written.</p><p>\u0093Here. Now.\u0094</p><p>He lowered her to his upthrust erection, probing until he found the creamy welcome he\u0092d ensured with his fingers. Then he paused, stared into her eyes. The connection between them locked into place, jolting her. The ticking of her grandfather clock in the next room and his harsh breaths filled her ears. Her belly tightened; her heart knocked against her ribs.</p> <p>Roaring through clenched teeth, he pushed her down onto his shaft, arching up to meet her, driving deep. She gasped, long and astounded, as he filled her completely, stretching her nearly to the point of pain. But that pain quickly turned to pleasure. The feel of him, hot and large, clasped deep in her body, overwhelmed her.</p><p>She drew in a shuddering breath. \u0093More.\u0094</p><p>No need to ask him twice. With his chest, he kept her pinned in place as he brushed his mouth across her shoulder and impaled her again. His arms and shoulders flexed as he lifted her up and pushed her back down, leaving a trail of fire. The veins and tendons rose in his biceps and neck. And the pleasure was unlike anything she\u0092d ever imagined. Like opening a door and finding infinity, bright and endless and stunning.</p><p>He established a hard rhythm, holding her wide open with her legs over his arms. Her arms curled around him, her nails in the hard flesh of his back, as she moved with him.</p><p>Soon, her thighs trembled as she approached orgasm again, this one far bigger. Breathing? Impossible, and she didn\u0092t care, not when her entire body rushed headlong to the kind of fulfillment she\u0092d only read about. Again, he filled her, sliding deep, the slick friction of his stroke driving her quickly to a point from which she could not hold back.</p> <p>Sydney moaned, and she felt Caden\u0092s mouth near her ear.</p><p>His labored breathing sent a fresh bolt of shivers down her spine.</p><p>\u0093I feel you,\u0094 he whispered between thrusts. \u0093So tight.\u0094 Another surge deep inside her that had her clawing him again. \u0093So ready.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. Yes!\u0094</p><p>His pace was nearly violent as he pumped again. More incredible than her fantasy even. And Sydney couldn\u0092t stand it anymore.</p><p>\u0093Let go,\u0094 he roared.</p> <p>Those two words were all she needed to see stars behind her eyes, to fall off the cliff into a drugging release. He cried out, his fingers digging into her backside, his mouth clamped on her shoulder as a warm spray jetted inside her.</p><p>\u0093Oh, shit,\u0094 she panted. \u0093We forgot a condom.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m clean.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I am, as well. But not on birth control.\u0094</p><p>He hesitated, and something regretful crossed his face. \u0093With me, pregnancy is not an issue.\u0094</p><p>Sydney opened her mouth to ask what that meant. Was he sterile? Had a vasectomy? Before she could voice her questions, he brushed erotic kisses down her neck until she shivered.</p><p>When he finally came up for air, he murmured, \u0093Where\u0092s the bed?\u0094</p><p>Caden woke in the predawn, wrapped around a warm raspberry-scented body. Silky hair like fire streamed down a narrow feminine back. Soft. Everything about her felt that way as she lay against him, sleeping peacefully. Sydney.</p> <p>Despite taking her against the wall earlier, then twice again in the bed, he awoke full of energy and ready for more of her. She was no longer a craving, but an addiction.</p><p>He\u0092d been so bloody careful with her. No kissing of that sweet, lush mouth or tasting of the wet flesh between her thighs\u0097no matter how badly he\u0092d ached to or how loud the voice in his head screamed at him. But it didn\u0092t matter. Everything in him cried out to take her again. And again. And he feared that if he kissed her, the dangerous, ancient words swirling in his head would fly out of his mouth. If they did . . . presto chango. He\u0092d be mated in the blink of an eye, bound his entire life only to her, only able to derive his energy, obtain sex, and feel love with her. And if she didn\u0092t accept his Mating Call, or chose to break their bond someday . . . well, his brother was a living, breathing example of the result.</p><p>He wanted no part of magical anything, but seeing what Lucan had endured, Caden wanted no part of mating, in particular. Quick shags from random beauties suited him. Putting himself in a position to be feral and out of his mind without Sydney? Unthinkable.</p><p>Deep in slumber, she shifted, stretching against him with a sigh, her firm little backside brushing him in dangerous places. He hissed as a fresh jolt of lust pounded him. Then she settled back against him, her body limp and trusting. His temperature rose. She was definitely not helping his restraint.</p><p>Cripes, he had to get out of here. That bloody dream, a stupid whim, had brought him to Sydney\u0092s flat. He wanted to exit stage left immediately. But this was a prime opportunity to search her place again, find something useful to his mission, then retreat, before he did something really foolish, like succumb to the screaming need to kiss her and prove all his instincts right.</p><p>Gently, he rose, moving away from Sydney by degrees, careful not to wake her. Then he edged off the bed, onto his feet. He\u0092d start with her notes\u0097and that bloody magical diary, if he could find it. Something he could take and call this fiasco a success.</p><p>On his feet, he padded across the hardwood floors and found his clothes where he\u0092d left them in the foyer last night wadded on the floor. With a curse for his unusually impulsive behavior, he donned everything, then began searching.</p><p>A quick inventory of the front rooms proved that she hadn\u0092t brought her laptop home. No notes, no scraps of paper with handy information, no Doomsday Diary. Bugger!</p><p>That meant he was going to have to return to Sydney\u0092s bedroom and risk waking her. He debated leaving now, forgetting the mission for the moment. But if he was smart and avoided more personal contact with Sydney, he would not have another opportunity to search her flat.</p><p>In the bedroom, he ignored the voice in his head asking if disregarding Sydney was even possible and worked methodically. Nothing in her wardrobe except a neat row of clothes on hangers arranged in outfits. Her sexy chocolate skirt and soft cream blouse were wrapped in plastic from the dry cleaners, hung beside the bold black and white dress that clung to her small, curved frame like a dream and always made him wonder exactly what she had beneath. Now that he knew, how would he ever stay away?</p><p>Drawing in a bracing breath, he forged on. A scan of her bathroom made him smile, despite the less than optimal situation. Orderly rows of lotions and perfume bottles. Sticky notes of lists stuck to her mirror, reminding her to buy toothpaste and return a DVD rental. Always organized.</p><p>Focus, he warned himself. Notes, names, Doomsday Diary.</p><p>With no place left to search except the area immediately around the bed, he walked toward her like a man on a death march. He wasn\u0092t quite convinced that he wouldn\u0092t shed his clothes again, slide back into her bed and into her body.</p><p>Swallowing, he approached her side of the bed. Don\u0092t look at her, he warned himself. Too late.</p><p>Her pale skin glowed in the moonlight streaming through the window. A burst of that glorious red hair covered her shoulder, and few of her pale freckles peeked from between the shining strands.</p><p>Damn, he sounded like a bloody poet. He was dying to kiss her\u0097and didn\u0092t dare.</p><p>Caden performed a cursory check of her dresser and found nothing except more lingerie in all types and colors that weren\u0092t contributing to his ability to focus. But nothing more.</p><p>A few steps closer and he reached her small night table, on which he saw a stack of books. The top one was a book about paranormal research, the one beneath about the ghosts of Jack the Ripper\u0092s victims. But he was most interested in the little red volume at the bottom.</p><p>Quietly, he shuffled the top two books to the side, then lifted the last. Small, red, gilt-edged, graced with an entwined ML symbol on the front. Bingo!</p><p>He didn\u0092t open it. No time. No need. It wasn\u0092t as if he wanted the bloody thing. He would return it to Bram so he could focus on finding Anka.</p><p>The night table had a little drawer, and he opened it, hoping to find something about Anka there.</p><p>The drawer contained some little reading glasses, a decorative bookmark, and an ambitious reading list. But that was Sydney. Unfortunately, the little drawer held nothing about her source, and he resisted the urge to slam it shut.</p><p>Sydney moaned, stirred, leaned across the bed, her arm outstretched as if she was searching for him. A little crease of a frown appeared between her eyes. Was she awake enough to realize he was gone?</p><p>Time to go. Leave now. He found nothing here in her apartment that would lead him to Anka. He\u0092d try again at the office in a bit. A quick glance at the clock on her night table told him it was nearly six in the morning. He\u0092d arrive early at Out of This Realm\u0092s offices and search there.</p><p>But now he had to grab the book and go before she woke up and started asking questions that he couldn\u0092t answer.</p><p>With a last lingering glance, Caden turned and ducked out of Sydney\u0092s bedroom, Doomsday Diary clutched in his hand. A few more steps to the front door, then he\u0092d ride the Tube home and call Bram. Recovering this bloody book ought to make the wizard happy, even if it didn\u0092t help Lucan.</p><p>Caden was playing that conversation in his head as he opened Sydney\u0092s front door and stepped over the threshold, into the foggy London morn.</p><p>An instant later, the book dissolved in his hands.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>POOF! THE BOOK WAS gone. Disappeared.</p><p>What the devil! He patted his shirt, his pants\u0092 pockets, but . . . nothing. The Doomsday Diary was gone.</p><p>Stepping inside and easing the door shut, he scanned the house and made his way to Sydney\u0092s room. He spotted the familiar red volume on her night table, stacked once more under the other two books. And he cursed.</p><p>Grabbing the book once again, he hoped more than believed that some magic would permit him to leave with the volume this time. But as he stepped over her threshold, it dissipated once more. A quick glance in Sydney\u0092s room again revealed the book had found its way back to the bedside table.</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair. Bloody magic. Illogical, unpredictable crap. Why the devil couldn\u0092t he remove the book from Sydney\u0092s flat? No doubt there was some vexing magical reason. Caden hoped Bram could explain it, but couldn\u0092t spare time to call the wizard now.</p><p>As he turned to leave Sydney\u0092s flat again, the rustling of sheets nabbed his attention. He glanced over his shoulder in time to see her sit up and halfheartedly hold the sheet over her breasts. \u0093Going somewhere so early?\u0094</p><p>Sydney could be tough as nails, but after last night, she looked vulnerable to him. All that moxie of hers protected a sensitive inner core. Suddenly he could see that she wanted to be cared for, wanted a man to find her worthy, be the center of his universe. In that moment, he wanted to be that man for her.</p><p>Instead, he was ducking out, and she knew it. Pain lanced deep in his chest when the dawn light illuminated the tension in her soft brown eyes. Lying to her, though necessary, felt like a bomb detonating in his belly.</p><p>\u0093Of course you are,\u0094 she answered herself, and drew the sheet higher over her breasts. \u0093You\u0092ve had your night with me. Curiosity fulfilled. Another notch in your bedpost. It\u0092s not as if you made me any promises.\u0094 She hung her head, looking very much like she\u0092d berate herself for giving in to him the moment he\u0092d gone. \u0093Go.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Syd\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t say anything. No doubt I\u0092ll find someone else and forget last night, and that will be that.\u0094</p><p>Like hell she would! His reaction was instant, undeniable, and violent.</p><p>Caden backtracked and cupped her cheek, aching inside. Staying wasn\u0092t smart; it would only tempt him to claim the lifelong mate magic intended for him\u0097one he feared would be his undoing. Yet seeing her dejected was agonizing. But making her his for always had consequences he couldn\u0092t handle\u0097and she may loathe. Staying with her would change their lives forever\u0097not necessarily for the better.</p><p>If he left her without a word now, their relationship would be over. He\u0092d rather give himself a lobotomy with a rusty knife before crushing her, as her expression said his departure would. To complicate matters, every bit of ground he had gained, the little bit of trust he had managed to resurrect, would disappear as quickly as the Doomsday Diary had if he simply walked out.</p><p>If he wanted to find Anka, escape this magical freak show, and avoid hurting Sydney, he must stay a bit longer, reassure her, get the necessary information, then devise a way to leave that would not crush her heart\u0097or leave a hole in his.</p><p>\u0093Sydney, I\u0092m not some lothario sneaking off the morning after. I need to change clothes for work, and I\u0092d like to call and check on my brother before I go in.\u0094</p><p>Her face softened a bit. She\u0092d never worn her emotions so openly, and it was disarming. Could he read her now because he knew her better? Or even more, because he felt connected to her?</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not stopping you. Go.\u0094</p><p>Damn it! He should, but he couldn\u0092t.</p><p>He sank onto the bed, sitting beside her half-supine form. He couldn\u0092t resist holding her hand. \u0093It would be better if I did not smell like sex at work. Our boss may not appreciate it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It doesn\u0092t take long for Holly to catch on.\u0094 Sydney sent him a halfhearted smile.</p><p>\u0093Not only do we not want her angry, we have important work to do.\u0094 Caden took a deep breath and plunged in. \u0093This magical war story could be quite dangerous. Let me protect you. Please. Don\u0092t meet your source again without me. I\u0092ll find a way to set her at ease and\u0097\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Caden,\u0094 she chided. \u0093Leave work at the office. Any time alone we spend should be about us. I\u0092ve just spent the night with a man I want to know better. If this isn\u0092t a one-off, shouldn\u0092t we be getting to know each other? Tell me something about you.\u0094</p><p>I\u0092m going to be magical soon, and I\u0092m fairly certain that if I kissed you I would issue you a Mating Call that would shock you to your pretty toes. How do you feel about being a wizard\u0092s mate and living a thousand years?</p><p>Caden cleared his throat. If he said too much . . . it would only connect them further. Their eventual separation would hurt more later. \u0093I want to move back to Texas. I miss Mexican food.\u0094</p><p>A reluctant smile spread across her face. \u0093We Brits don\u0092t make it well?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093I\u0092ve seen dog food with more appeal.\u0094</p><p>Sydney laughed. \u0093That\u0092s harsh.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The truth often is.\u0094</p><p>Some of the uncertainty left her eyes, and he saw that flash of the Sydney he knew. \u0093That\u0092s not personal. You\u0092ve never spoken of your parents, while you know all about mine.\u0094</p><p>\u0093As I said, my parents are elderly and frail. They live outside of York.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Are they able to come visit Lucan?\u0094</p><p>\u0093They don\u0092t know about his condition.\u0094 That was another thing that made him feel like shit. \u0093I don\u0092t dare tell them. I fear them knowing their elder son is . . . unwell would be too much to bear at their age.\u0094</p><p>She nodded sympathetically. \u0093What will you do if the worst happens?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Lucan is receiving good care from experts. He\u0092s strong, and I\u0092m by his side. I must believe he will pull through.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Thank you for sharing that. I\u0092m sorry about your brother. What can you tell me about his condition?\u0094</p><p>Nothing. Some part of him wanted to open up to Sydney, share his burden with her. The urge was nearly as compelling as his need to make love to her last night. Damn, that was a dangerous sign, especially since that sort of sharing would only lead to heartbreak\u0097on both sides.</p> <p>Finally, Caden said, \u0093His disorder is mental. He\u0092s a danger to himself and others now.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Oh my God.\u0094 Empathy softened her dark eyes.</p><p>\u0093Certainly you see why I didn\u0092t want to admit something like that the day we met.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry. I have a nasty habit of prying. The curse of being a reporter.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I understand.\u0094</p><p>\u0093While I\u0092m prying, I wonder if you\u0092d answer another question for me.\u0094</p><p>He stiffened. Already he\u0092d said more than he should. With Sydney, he was walking a tightrope. He had to seem engaged, but not invest so much that he couldn\u0092t leave later. It was already going to hurt like hell. Using her left a bad taste in his mouth, but staying by her side until he got the information needed to get his brother\u0092s life back was critical. Adoring her as he wanted would only mean a broken promise later.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll try.\u0094</p> <p>Sydney seemed to sense the change in his tone and bit her lip. \u0093Why move to the States? Why leave for so long if your parents are elderly? Why join the U.S. Marines? Why\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093One at a time.\u0094 He held up a hand to stay her with an indulgent glance. \u0093I moved away at eighteen. Went to school for a bit, met some Marines and decided I wanted to join them. I obtained a green card, quit school, went to basic.\u0094 He shrugged. \u0093My parents and I . . . didn\u0092t see eye-to-eye about my future, and a decade ago, putting distance between us seemed like a good idea.\u0094</p><p>A huge understatement. Caden\u0092s mother, once a gifted seer like many women in her line, kept insisting that Caden would someday embrace his considerable magic and distinguish himself as a champion. Rubbish!</p><p>By the time she\u0092d started making such predictions, Westin was dead, and Caden wanted nothing to do with magic, especially not hers. After leaving home, he\u0092d judiciously avoided magickind, lurking in the States and lived among humans, seen life through their eyes\u0097and he\u0092d never wanted life another way since.</p><p>\u0093So you moved to another country?\u0094</p><p>Put like that, it sounded extreme. \u0093They had Lucan to carry on the family traditions. I wasn\u0092t interested.\u0094</p><p>\u0093A family business?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Ah, something like that,\u0094 he hedged. \u0093Anyway, I joined the Marines because it was far, far from home, and I wanted to fight\u0097something my parents had always been against.\u0094 At least in the human sense. \u0093I made some great friends.\u0094</p><p>With the Marines, he\u0092d fit in for the first time in his life. Sure, his platoon had ribbed him about being British and having a teacup up his ass and the like. He missed them like hell.</p><p>But no one in his platoon had known about his magical family or had expectations of him becoming any sort of wand-waving Superman. He was great with automatic weapons, could wipe the floor with most in hand-to-hand, and was without peer in explosives. He\u0092d been happy to help Bram and the Doomsday Brethren learn some of those skills. But lending his magic . . . hell, he didn\u0092t have any. Nor did he want to.</p><p>\u0093Are you still friends today?\u0094</p><p>Caden sucked a fresh breath of pain. \u0093Most all are gone. Many died in Iraq. Some committed suicide after coming home. Another went to prison. One is missing. I\u0092m one of the few left standing.\u0094</p><p>She was the first person he\u0092d told. No one else had asked or cared. Sharing his sorrow with her was dangerous, but felt good. Sydney threw her arms around him, as if she knew exactly how much pain it had cost him to lose friends like Walt, who everyone called T-Rex because he\u0092d been huge and his footsteps lumbering. Or Brian, the prankster with the weird tattoos. Damn hard to believe that Brian went missing under mysterious circumstances two months ago and was presumed dead.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry,\u0094 Sydney murmured. \u0093I never meant to bring up something painful.\u0094</p><p>Gently, Caden pulled away\u0097though he desperately wanted to stay. For a brief moment in her arms, the hurt of the past and the worries about tomorrow had been absent. He\u0092d simply lived in the peaceful moment. But now it was time for reality.</p><p>\u0093I won\u0092t ask if that satisfies your curiosity, since I know better. But I should get going,\u0094 he said, unable to resist filtering his fingers through her soft hair one last time. His fingers trailed away with regret.</p><p>Sydney grabbed his wrist. \u0093Kiss me. We never got to that last night.\u0094</p><p>So tempting. He craved her taste, but the increasing sweats, sex drive, and tingles told him that he\u0092d soon be a wizard. Like any wizard, he\u0092d have the ability to sense his mate by taste\u0097if he didn\u0092t already have that \u0093gift.\u0094 Unless he wanted to tie himself to Sydney forever, kissing her was forbidden. And mating aside, if he kissed her when he had no intention of staying, it would be more cruel, not less.</p><p>He put a hand over his mouth. \u0093Not before I find a toothbrush. You\u0092ll thank me later.\u0094</p><p>A frown wrinkled her brow. \u0093You say the right things, but why do I get the feeling that once you walk out the door, you\u0092ll never be like this with me again?\u0094</p><p>Caden tried like hell to keep his expression neutral, but when she stared back in distress, he guessed he\u0092d failed Subterfuge 101. How the hell could he answer her?</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s . . . um, a complicated time in my life now, with my brother, my parents, and there\u0092s more. If it weren\u0092t for all that, everything between us would be different. I would choose to be with you and never let you go.\u0094</p><p>He forcibly pressed his mouth shut. Stop. There. Now. The canned response he should have given her about being interested and taking it one day at a time? Not in his vocabulary at that moment. What had possessed him to be so honest?</p><p>Despite not lying\u0097or perhaps because of it\u0097she looked ready to cry. She clutched the sheet tight against her breasts. \u0093Are you turning away because I won\u0092t give up my source? Did you hope to shag it out of me?\u0094</p><p>Regret sliced him to the bone. \u0093No, but mixing business and pleasure wasn\u0092t wise.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Then go. We\u0092ll forget last night ever happened.\u0094</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Her expression was a kick to the heart. He was heartily sick of playing this wretched game with her. \u0093Sydney, later, if my life becomes less complicated . . .\u0094</p><p>Sydney shut her eyes and shook her head. \u0093Just go.\u0094</p><p>Reluctantly, he turned and left her bedroom with a last glance over his shoulder at her pale curves barely concealed in the white sheet, surrounded by a halo of that fiery hair. He nearly couldn\u0092t find the fortitude to leave, knowing his chances of ever holding her again were slim.</p><p>But he forced himself to put one foot in front of the other and disappear down her hall.</p><p>Halfway to the door, he heard her murmur, \u0093We both know there\u0092s no \u0091later\u0092 for us.\u0094</p><p>The truth was like an upper cut to his abdomen. Caden braced himself against the wall and, fists clenched, fought the urge to return to her.</p><p>Damn it! Leaving was for the best. Still, if he\u0092d wanted to escape with his heart intact, he was about twelve hours too late.</p><p>Sydney sat behind her desk that morning, struggling to focus. At the moment, weak sunlight barely leaked through her office windows, and it was an ungodly seven in the morning. But it wouldn\u0092t be long before Caden arrived, and she had to look at him. Work with him. Not touch him.</p><p>Last night had been, in a word, incredible. Passionate, giving her one jolt of pleasure after another, keeping her trembling and needy, Caden had been the lover she\u0092d always wanted and never had. Well, except for the fact he hadn\u0092t kissed her. Odd, that. Then again, they\u0092d been so busy doing other amazingly luscious things.</p><p>But they were done now, she feared. And the sense of rightness that had sparked last night was gone. Whatever was going on with his brother, in his life, he was letting it come between them.</p><p>Then again, maybe it wasn\u0092t him. Maybe last night had only happened because she\u0092d wished it into reality, a byproduct of the fact she\u0092d written her fantasy about him in that damned red book. Right down to the connection that had made her heart leap. If that was true, how ridiculous and pathetic. She deserved her heartache.</p><p>Penning her wish in the book and having it come true seemed fantastic, but then, she wrote of such things all day. And believed more than a few. She\u0092d never imagined something amazing would happen to her, but maybe this had.</p><p>Sydney covered her face and tried to fight tears. Damn it, even knowing he had some hidden agenda, she had still written of her desire for him, then succumbed to his touch completely. Stupid! And no matter what he said, her refusal to give up the name of her source played a role in his abrupt departure. Every part of their conversation this morning\u0097 except the brief moments he\u0092d discussed his brother and his platoon\u0097had felt off somehow.</p><p>Work. She had to focus on that. Her fling with Caden had been brief, perhaps even manufactured. Just because they\u0092d clicked surprisingly well didn\u0092t mean it was some spectacular affair of the heart. They\u0092d shagged. She\u0092d never allowed any man to break her heart, and he wouldn\u0092t earn that distinction after a single night.</p><p>Launching her e-mail, Sydney vowed to focus. She perked up right away when she received an e-mail from her informant at the Coroner\u0092s Office, a friend from her uni days. The woman finally had news regarding the bodies of the partially decomposed soldiers in the tunnel discovered just over two weeks ago. The e-mail simply read Call me before nine.</p><p>Heart pounding, palms sweating, Sydney rang Chloe\u0092s mobile phone.</p><p>\u0093 \u0092lo,\u0094 answered a groggy man.</p><p>\u0093Is Chloe there? Sorry to ring so early.\u0094</p><p>After a moment of shuffling and a giggle, Chloe answered, \u0093Syd?\u0094</p><p>Chloe had been happily married for nearly four years to a handsome devil named Blake. Sydney would be jealous if she hadn\u0092t always regarded Blake as the big brother she\u0092d never had.</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s your news?\u0094 Sydney asked, dispensing with pleasantries.</p><p>\u0093Good morning to you, too.\u0094 Chloe laughed. \u0093Very unofficially, here\u0092s what I know about the bodies discovered in the tunnel.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Following the November fourteenth skirmish I\u0092ve been writing about? The magic thing?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Exactly,\u0094 Chloe confirmed. \u0093Tests have identified all the bodies. Are you sitting?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. On with it, you tease!\u0094</p><p>\u0093You know me too well.\u0094 Chloe shot back, then sobered. \u0093All the bodies were of servicemen\u0097from all over the world, including seven of the eight American soldiers who mysteriously disappeared on September nineteenth from a training exercise at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. They were all part of the Marines Special Operations Command.\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s jaw dropped. As the surreal words sunk in, she muttered, \u0093Bugger! Special Forces . . . I remember hearing about the disappearance of those soldiers!\u0094</p><p>\u0093The higher-ups at the office are all being very hush-hush. But that in itself says something. Next of kin are being notified now, but their identities aren\u0092t being released to the media yet, so I can\u0092t give you that or my boss would be suspicious.\u0094</p><p>Chloe had already delivered more than expected. She owed her old friend a pint or two at least. \u0093Of course. Anything else you can give me?\u0094</p><p>\u0093You know from our previous conversation that the bodies were decomposed weeks beyond what their battle wounds suggested. Your grainy photos showed that several were decapitated, a few others shot or stabbed. But they bled as profusely as if they were alive. And they bled black.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Black?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. It\u0092s a complete mystery. There\u0092s no blood type. Everyone was identified by fingerprints, distinguishing marks, or dental records.\u0094</p><p>Sydney paused. What would cause such a thing? New disease? Black blood sounded crazy, but working at Out of This Realm, she\u0092d quickly learned that nothing was impossible. \u0093Odd.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Very,\u0094 Chloe agreed. \u0093Assuming your story is real, do you have any theories about which side the poor bastards fought for?\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093No. I\u0092ve heard little about the other side, this Doomsday Brethren. My source says they\u0092re good, but they\u0092re fighting Mathias, who claims to be battling for equality. Yet he raped a woman until she was little more than a broken shell. But does his evil automatically make the Doomsday Brethren good? If I had to guess, I\u0092d say the soldiers were Mathias\u0092s. If he cares so little as to repeatedly rape a woman, I doubt he\u0092s above kidnapping a few well-trained soldiers and using them in his army.\u0094</p><p>Chloe hesitated. \u0093Do you really think this is all true, not merely this terrorized woman\u0092s hallucinations?\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s possible, I suppose. But there\u0092s enough fact here to make me pause. Call me if you hear any more.\u0094</p><p>They rang off, and Sydney jotted down a few notes\u0097 which quickly grew frustrating. She had another story to crank out this week on the magical war, and she wanted it to be about Chloe\u0092s information, slanted accurately, but she had so many questions. How did these soldiers fit into the grand scheme of the war? Had they been used for magical purposes? How were they persuaded or forced to fight and give their lives for this cause? Perhaps she could run with the facts as they were, but the pieces of the puzzle didn\u0092t fit. She needed to talk to her source again and see what else the witch might know.</p> <p>Sydney placed a quick call to Aquarius. When her assistant didn\u0092t answer, she left a voicemail, apologizing for the interruption of her holiday and asking for a ring back indicating whether Aquarius\u0092s guest would talk again.</p><p>Not long after she placed the phone back in the cradle, she felt a presence in the doorway.</p><p>Caden.</p><p>\u0093Good morning,\u0094 she said, forcing a businesslike tone. \u0093Did you need something? I\u0092m off to a busy start, so spit it out.\u0094</p><p>He stepped in and shut the door behind him, planting his fists on her desk and leaning closer. \u0093Sydney, I\u0092m\u0097\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Stop.\u0094 She put up a hand, refusing to reveal that the sight of him had her blood pumping and her heart aching. If they talked about last night, she\u0092d risk tears. \u0093I just have one question: Why did you come over last night? What made you leave your flat in the middle of the night and come all the way crosstown to mine? Was it the sex or something else?\u0094</p><p>He paused, scrubbing a hand over his face. A weariness she\u0092d never seen dragged down his eyes, mouth, shoulders. For a moment, Sydney\u0092s heart went out to him, until she reminded herself that she couldn\u0092t feel for him and keep her heart unscathed. Something about Caden called to her, and she wasn\u0092t certain he suffered the same affliction. He\u0092d risen from her bed, dressed, left, and as far as she could see, suffered no side effects other than lack of sleep. It wasn\u0092t as if she was looking for a down-on-one-knee proposal, just the truth.</p><p>\u0093Pure impulse. I was attracted to you from the first. I tried to keep to myself because we work together, my life is complicated now, and I can\u0092t give you a tomorrow. But I came over last night because I could no longer stay away. I tried to talk myself out of going to your flat, but every moment I was away from you, I became more obsessed with making love to you.\u0094</p><p>Had that been the magical diary compelling him to come to my door? Sydney swallowed. No. It was just an old red book, right? This had to be about her story. She believed in magic, yes. But not involving her.</p><p>\u0093Did you come because you wanted to persuade me to divulge my magical source?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, but if you\u0092d like to make me a full partner in this story, I\u0092d love that.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093And what, you thought being my partner in the bedroom would help you get there faster?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn it! I dreamed of you, literally, in the precise lingerie you wore for me last night. I dreamed of tearing it off, of the sweet taste of your breasts, of your body clutching my cock, of the groans you made when you came for me. How the bloody hell was I supposed to stay away from you after that?\u0094</p><p>Oh God. Sydney sat back with a gulp. \u0093Would you . . . um, say you felt compelled?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. But I take responsibility for mucking up everything.\u0094 Caden stopped, leaned closer, peering at her as if trying to unravel a puzzle. \u0093Wait. Did you write about me in that bloody book Aquarius gave you?\u0094</p><p>She wanted to crawl under the desk and stay for a decade. \u0093Don\u0092t be absurd.\u0094</p><p>How had he guessed so quickly? Had her words really brought him to her door? God, she felt like an idiot!</p><p>\u0093Forget I asked about last night. Let\u0092s focus on work.\u0094</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u0093What made you open the door and let me in?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093It\u0092s no secret I wanted you. But as you said earlier, itch scratched. Moving on.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I said no such thing,\u0094 he growled.</p><p>Hadn\u0092t he, just hours ago? Hadn\u0092t he said repeatedly they had no future? Of course. He hadn\u0092t been there of his own free will in the first place. \u0093Don\u0092t play games.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Which is exactly what you\u0092ve done by cheapening last night.\u0094</p><p>He was right; she had cheapened last night, most likely. In a way she hoped he never discovered. \u0093Sorry.\u0094</p><p>She couldn\u0092t expect an emotional response from Caden when she\u0092d used a magical diary to break his natural reticence. He\u0092d come to her flat and shagged her because that had been her wish, not because he felt any eternal devotion.</p><p>\u0093Forget I mentioned it. Work is piling up this morning, and I\u0092m stressed.\u0094</p><p>Caden gnashed his teeth and looked away. \u0093Is it going to start another fight if I ask if there\u0092s anything I can do to help?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094 Because if he stayed with her in this small office, she was in grave danger of wrapping her arms around him and pleading for his affection.</p><p>Before he could respond, Sydney\u0092s phone rang. The caller ID had her sighing in relief. Aquarius.</p><p>Sydney picked it up and answered, \u0093Thank God you\u0092ve called. Can you meet me?\u0094</p><p>Caden wasn\u0092t certain who Sydney was talking to and, at the moment, didn\u0092t much care. Frustration ate at him. Everything about this situation was wrong, and he had no idea how to fix it. And now Sydney was on the bloody phone with God knew who, discussing God knew what. For all he knew, she was making a date.</p><p>On second thought, he did care who she talked to; he needed to know who to kill.</p><p>Quickly, Sydney covered her earpiece, \u0093Can you give me a moment?\u0094</p><p>With an angry jerk, he turned to leave. But he couldn\u0092t make himself walk away. If Sydney was in the process of replacing him in her bed mere hours later . . . well, he wasn\u0092t a masochist by nature, but something in him needed to know. He couldn\u0092t keep her, but he couldn\u0092t stand the thought of losing her.</p><p>With a distracted push, Sydney eased the door nearly shut. Caden leaned closer to the slightly ajar door and listened.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m here,\u0094 she said. \u0093Lunch sounds great. Can you meet me at eleven-thirty at that um . . . Blue whatever the name was?\u0094 She paused. \u0093Perfect. I\u0092ll see both of you then.\u0094</p><p>Both of them? Was she contemplating dating more than one man?</p><p>\u0093Work is fine. I know you\u0092re supposed to be on holiday. I don\u0092t want to bog you down, but I need help with this week\u0092s story. It\u0092s still developing. I also need to ask you about that magical diary you gave me for my birthday.\u0094</p><p>Oh, so she was talking to Aquarius and going to meet her\u0097and a friend?\u0097for lunch. Caden sighed with relief. Not only because Aquarius was in town, but because Sydney was still single. He couldn\u0092t stomach the thought of her with another man, and it would be wise to refrain from violence before eight a.m.</p><p>\u0093What can you tell me about that book? Its origins? Does it have any ties to the magical world I\u0092ve been writing about?\u0094 She spoke in low tones.</p><p>Caden closed his eyes and concentrated very hard, hoping to hear both sides of Sydney\u0092s conversation. Aquarius loudly answered yes to Sydney\u0092s last question, then her voice dropped again. He picked up a word or two about someone named Emma, whoever the bloody hell that was.</p><p>Then Sydney spoke again, \u0093Perfect. I\u0092m still working on the ongoing war angle of this story, but would you mind if I wrote this week\u0092s article about the book?\u0094</p><p>Her words jolted Caden, as if someone had put ten thousand volts through his body. Damn and blast, he couldn\u0092t let Sydney write that. The danger to her if Mathias read the article. . . . Caden\u0092s blood chilled and his breath stopped as he imagined everything the terrible wizard would force her to endure. Hadn\u0092t he convinced her yet that this angle was dangerous? That she could be a target?</p><p>Hand on the knob to her door, Caden prepared to charge in. He could not let her write about that bloody book. Not this week, not ever.</p><p>Before he could push the door open, someone tapped his shoulder. Caden whirled to see Holly, Sydney\u0092s editor. Well, damn. This looked bad.</p><p>\u0093I was just going to ask her a question.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And it\u0092s taken the last two minutes of intense eavesdropping to decide what to say?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No. Well, she . . . I don\u0092t think\u0097\u0094</p><p>Holly held up a hand to stop him. \u0093Come with me.\u0094</p><p>Caden looked back at Sydney\u0092s closed door. He didn\u0092t have much choice. Later, before Sydney left for lunch, he\u0092d talk to her, make her see reason, convince her not to run that story.</p><p>With a sigh, he followed Holly.</p><p>\u0093Do you have anything personal in your cubicle?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Just my camera. Why?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Get it.\u0094 She walked him to his desk, where he retrieved his camera and keys. Other than that, he\u0092d brought nothing.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s all, then? I\u0092ll walk you to the door.\u0094</p><p>A chill went up his spine. \u0093The door?\u0094</p><p>Holly sent him a glare that said the jig was more than up as she escorted him to the front. \u0093C\u0092mon, MacTavish. You\u0092ve used every angle to learn her source. Hitting on her, going to her apartment, eavesdropping. It\u0092s clear you want to scoop her and\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No! God, no. I swear. Holly\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Save it. You\u0092re sacked.\u0094 Holly opened the paper\u0092s front door. Weak morning sun glared in his eyes, blinding him. \u0093Get out. Now.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>CADEN MADE IT BACK to his flat, rage barely in check. The minute the door slammed behind him, he shouted a string of curses. He\u0092d been sacked and he had no idea where to find the mystery \u0093Blue\u0094 restaurant at which Sydney, Aquarius and whoever would have lunch. Translation: Mission failed. He\u0092d never learned if Sydney\u0092s source was Anka. Damn it all, no Anka meant no return to sanity for Lucan, and no going back to Texas for him. Sydney was going to pursue a dangerous story, and he was no longer there to protect her.</p><p>As a Marine, failure wasn\u0092t something he tolerated well. Logically, he knew he should be glad. Now that he was no longer employed at Out of This Realm, Bram would have to assign the mission to someone else. Eliminating lies and subterfuge thrilled him. But not completing a mission rankled. He\u0092d continue searching for Anka another way, of course. He didn\u0092t recall any magical detectives from his childhood, and he knew from his own mother that seers could be notoriously unreliable. He needed another plan, one that removed Sydney from danger.</p><p>He reached into his pocket and picked out one of the white summoning rocks Bram had given him, then thrust it back. Like anything magical, Caden had come to hate these after Westin\u0092s death. Once he\u0092d been old enough to learn to bewitch one, he\u0092d been completely against it, despite Lucan offering to teach him. Having lived among humankind for so long, tossing a pebble in the air, calling someone\u0092s name, and having them appear moments later seemed creepy and abnormal.</p><p>He knew his magic was coming. Today, he\u0092d awakened energized and refreshed for the first time in weeks. Within hours, the shakes, the sweats, and the never-ending sex drive had kicked in again. Signs of his coming change. But until magic forced unwanted powers upon him, by God, he was still a man.</p><p>Grabbing his mobile phone, he punched in Bram\u0092s number. He\u0092d tell the sod to assign someone else to this errand. He was out of the James Bond business.</p><p>But being sacked also meant he had no more reason to see Sydney each day. After the way he\u0092d left her this morning, she was angry and hurt. That made him wince.</p><p>Had her anger been strong enough to sabotage his job? Sydney had long suspected he was trying to scoop her story. Holly had reiterated the same suspicion, and he\u0092d seen precious little of the editor. The woman couldn\u0092t have fabricated that worry by herself. Sydney had likely helped her reach that conclusion. Because of his abrupt departure this morning?</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t lament the loss of the job. The loss of the woman? God help him, that was a stab in the heart.</p><p>If he kissed her and opened his burgeoning magical senses to Sydney, he was certain they would demand he speak the Call. And given his complete lack of restraint with Sydney, he would have blurted the words, caution be damned. That quickly, magic would have forced a mate on him.</p><p>Caden required self-control, and Sydney stripped him of it more easily than he liked. Losing her after mating himself to her would only leave him ripe for the kind of lunacy that could kill him. Worse, magickind was fast becoming a dangerous place\u0097one in which she didn\u0092t belong. She would be safer if she stayed away from him. And stopped writing stories likely to catch Mathias\u0092s notice.</p><p>\u0093MacTavish?\u0094 Bram answered, sounding irritable. \u0093It\u0092s nine a.m. on a Tuesday, and you\u0092re ringing me? Tell me\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve been sacked.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What?!\u0094</p><p>Caden reiterated the morning\u0092s events, leaving out the fact he had spent the night in Sydney\u0092s arms and bed.</p><p>After he was finished, Bram sighed. \u0093We didn\u0092t need this setback.\u0094</p><p>\u0093As some of my American friends say, I screwed the pooch.\u0094 And that burned his hide. \u0093Damage done. Now you\u0092re free to send someone else in to snuff the stories. I just ask that whomever you send protect Sydney.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093We\u0092ve discussed this. My options are limited.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Send Sabelle. She and Sydney would get on well.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Impossible. My sister is tied up with Council business.\u0094</p><p>Caden frowned. \u0093She\u0092s not a member of the Council.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093But she does have a certain charm for the old codgers who sit beside me that I apparently lack.\u0094</p><p>Despite the gravity of the situation, Caden laughed at the image. \u0093She is far prettier.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She smiles and flatters and makes them feel young again. It\u0092s a needed skill. Word of all the Anarki attacks is leaking out and the rest of the Council is demanding I stop them.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The rumors or the attacks?\u0094</p><p>\u0093The former, but I know that can\u0092t happen until I stop the latter, which they\u0092re still refusing to publicly acknowledge.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093And you\u0092re trying to persuade the Council to make a statement to magickind at large, explaining the real danger, correct?\u0094 Caden grunted. \u0093Good luck.\u0094</p><p>The group of elders had never moved quickly or advocated a less-than-traditional path. It could take them months, even years or decades, to reach a consensus on a public statement about Mathias\u0092s return. By then, Mathias may have already taken over magickind. Stupid sods.</p><p>\u0093I need it. And Sabelle.\u0094 Bram sighed. \u0093I could send Shock, I suppose. He can skim Sydney\u0092s thoughts\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Absolutely not! How do I know he won\u0092t deliver her to Mathias? I will not have that turncoat anywhere near my . . .\u0094 Mate. The word nearly rolled off his tongue. \u0093Former coworker.\u0094 There, that sounded better.</p><p>And like a pitiful lie.</p><p>Though Shock was bound to Anka, despite the fact she\u0092d rejected his Call and he could, therefore, not touch Sydney sexually, the thought of Shock anywhere in the same postalcode still made him murderous.</p> <p>\u0093Do you think Sydney is your mate?\u0094 Bram asked pointedly.</p><p>\u0093I haven\u0092t tasted her.\u0094</p><p>Bram hesitated. \u0093For everyone\u0092s sake, I hope she isn\u0092t. You\u0092re preparing for transition. I sense it. You\u0092re irritable and tense. You\u0092ve been tired a great deal, haven\u0092t you? And the urge for sex is overwhelming, right?\u0094</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t answer. Why tell Bram he\u0092d hit a bull\u0092s-eye? The sod likely knew it anyway.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ll need to find a witch to transition with. You\u0092re going to need sexual energy to power your coming magic.\u0094</p><p>Grinding his teeth, Caden turned away. Yes, he knew he needed sex\u0097and a lot of it\u0097to create the energy necessary to transition. If he had issued the Call to Sydney, only she would do. But he hadn\u0092t. If he could restrain himself a bit longer, he wouldn\u0092t. Problem was, he didn\u0092t want some nameless witch.</p><p>\u0093I have not issued the Call to mate,\u0094 Caden reiterated.</p><p>\u0093Unless that changes, you have no problem.\u0094</p> <p>Wrong. \u0093She believes in this story and is suspicious of everyone. No one is more suspect than Shock. You come,\u0094 Caden suggested.</p><p>The thought of Bram charming Sydney made him want to grind his teeth into powder, but the wizard was newly mated. He couldn\u0092t woo Sydney. And he wouldn\u0092t turn her over to Mathias.</p><p>\u0093I told you, I can\u0092t, not until I complete the Council\u0092s demand for magickind to stop spreading rumors\u0097even if they\u0092re the truth.\u0094 Bram snorted. \u0093This assignment also allows me to quietly warn Privileged families that Mathias is likely to target them and demonstrate to his Deprived followers that he embraces their bid for equality.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s shit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But I cannot defer this duty. There have been four Anarki attacks in the last three weeks. If the Council won\u0092t send a transcast, I must warn people unofficially. I am spending what little free time I have trying to locate my errant mate.\u0094</p><p>In Bram\u0092s shoes, he\u0092d be doing the same. \u0093Keep Shock away from Sydney.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Then stop her from writing articles.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve been sacked. How do you propose I do that? Sydney may very well write an article about the Doomsday Diary. Just this morning, she was inquiring about its origins.\u0094</p><p>\u0093For the last bloody time, charm the woman!\u0094</p><p>\u0093I tried. It\u0092s . . . complicated.\u0094 And he wasn\u0092t spilling a single detail.</p><p>\u0093Uncomplicate it,\u0094 Bram snapped.</p><p>\u0093This was your fucking mission to start with. I did my best and, as much as I hate failure, I admit to it. This morning, I tried to steal the Doomsday Diary from Sydney, but when I attempted to leave her flat with it, the book dissolved in my hands. Twice. Why?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Dissolved?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Completely. Moments later, it appeared again on the nightstand from which I took it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093In other words, it would not leave Sydney\u0092s flat with you. Interesting . . . but I think I might know why. You\u0092re male. You\u0092ve heard me say the book is an object of feminine reverence? That means the book responds only to women.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I didn\u0092t try to use it.\u0094</p><p>Bram hesitated. \u0093Stealing it may work the same way. We\u0092re learning as we go, but it makes sense. Eons ago, Marrok paid a woman to steal it from Morganna. After she did, she gave it to him. Marrok kept it in the same cottage for centuries. Then came Olivia. She brought the book to my estate and hid it. I assumed at the time that anyone could transport the book, but, given your experience, clearly not. Neither Marrok nor I could write in it when Mathias abducted Olivia. Sabelle, however, could. A wish to fix a button was granted instantly. Her wish to save Olivia was not, and we discerned that whoever uses the book must have both great power and great desire to fulfill the wish. My mate stole it from me. Somehow, it fell into this Aquarius\u0092s hands, and she gave it to Sydney. Female to female to female. When you tried to steal it from Sydney\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not female.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Exactly.\u0094</p><p>Caden sighed. Interesting, but . . . \u0093I\u0092ve barely met Aquarius, so I don\u0092t know about her, but Sydney is definitely human, not magical.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Apparently having two X chromosomes is more important than having a magical one.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Even more reason you should send someone else in my place, Olivia, perhaps, and let me look for Anka elsewhere.\u0094</p><p>Bram huffed. \u0093Is giving up what the Marines taught you? Last I heard, failure wasn\u0092t an option.\u0094</p><p>Blast it, the wizard was right. Caden hadn\u0092t asked for this mission, but the guilt of failure ate at him. Nor did he want to leave Sydney unprotected. But what else could he do? So, like any good tactician, he resorted to a diversionary tactic.</p><p>\u0093I may have some information about the book and how Aquarius acquired it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m listening.\u0094</p><p>Caden gripped the phone. \u0093I don\u0092t know how she fits into the equation, but Aquarius mentioned someone named Emma.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What did you say?\u0094</p><p>The violence of Bram\u0092s question took him aback. \u0093EEmma?\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re certain?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I overheard a telephone conversation, but reasonably so, yes.\u0094</p><p>The wizard didn\u0092t hesitate. \u0093You have a new mission: Besides getting that book away from Sydney, make her tell you more about Emma. Immediately.\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s sudden command was somewhere between stunning and what-the-hell?</p><p>\u0093You don\u0092t have time to help me when you\u0092re throwing me to the wolves, but when I mention some woman\u0097\u0094</p><p>A loud chirp, a flap of wings, followed by a woman\u0092s panicked voice interrupted the beginnings of Caden\u0092s tirade. Some witch had compelled a bird to deliver a message to Bram. And from the sound of it, the message was urgent.</p><p>\u0093I must go. I\u0092ll send you help to obtain the book since you\u0092re not female. But get all the information you can about Emma, then call me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn it, I\u0092m not your errand boy.\u0094 Caden shouted. \u0093Who is Emma?\u0094</p><p>\u0093My mate. That\u0092s the first clue I\u0092ve had of her since she disappeared. And I\u0092m going to find that woman if it\u0092s the last bloody thing I do.\u0094</p><p>After the worst Tuesday ever, Sydney was more than happy to escape back to her flat. She shed her clothes as she headed back to her bedroom. She shed tears just as easily.</p><p>Dear Lord, her careless words had gotten Caden sacked. Granted, he had been eavesdropping, and suspicion that he\u0092d been trying to scoop her still lingered. She\u0092d tried to talk Holly into taking him back. No luck. And Caden had likely assumed that she\u0092d tattled to her editor because he\u0092d hurt her by leaving her bed this morning. He\u0092d think her spiteful and never want to see her again.</p><p>That possibility crushed her. She must find Caden, set matters straight. Already she missed him with a yearning she didn\u0092t understand. It was impossible to fall in love in a few days with a man who had begrudgingly shared himself. Blast, he had never even kissed her.</p><p>Even if the man wanted nothing more to do with her, she couldn\u0092t tolerate the thought that he might believe that she\u0092d had him sacked in a scorned woman\u0092s act of vengeance. Under normal circumstances, she would ring him up and explain and apologize. But she had no means of getting in touch with Caden\u0097no idea where he lived, no mobile number . . . nothing.</p><p>Sydney bit her lip. Well, except that magical diary.</p><p>Had the fact she had written in it previously brought Caden to her door? Or had it been mere coincidence?</p><p>She couldn\u0092t know for certain unless she experimented.</p><p>With a sigh, Sydney reached for her mobile and called Aquarius.</p><p>As soon as her friend and assistant picked up, Sydney blurted, \u0093Did the book work for you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mellow, boss lady. Like I said at lunch, it works. From what you said, you discovered that yourself.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Maybe it was coincidence.\u0094</p><p>Aquarius laughed. \u0093Though I love magic, I was skeptical at first. I wrote about Alex a few times before I truly believed.\u0094</p><p>This morning, she\u0092d felt wretched and unintentionally manipulative. Had she made a man who didn\u0092t truly want her come to her flat and have sex with her? She still winced at the possibility.</p><p>\u0093It seems like such a pathetic thing to do, write a fantasy so it will come true, regardless of what he wants.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I understand being worried about bad karma.\u0094</p><p>That wasn\u0092t exactly her issue, but close enough. \u0093But if I\u0092m going to report about the book, I should test it again. Caden is the only man I fantasize about. I can\u0092t move forward with the story about the identities of the bodies in the tunnel yet. I need to shore up a few facts. I didn\u0092t have the heart to ask your cousin any more questions after she broke down at lunch today. She looked so pale and tired. Is she all right?\u0094</p><p>\u0093As well as can be expected, but she won\u0092t talk anymore, Sydney. When she asked me if you were a journalist, I couldn\u0092t lie. She knows she\u0092s said too much, and when I admitted you\u0092d written stories based on her information, she became terrified that Mathias will find her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I promise, I\u0092ve never given details about her identity.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She says it\u0092s too risky for her, for magickind, and for you. Mathias is ruthless.\u0094</p><p>Damn it! Sydney gripped the phone. She needed that source . . . yet the witch\u0092s fragile physical and mental state not only raised Sydney\u0092s pity, but concern. Aquarius\u0092s cousin was one shock away from a breakdown. Sydney would have to find another means of researching this magical war.</p><p>As soon as she made this week\u0092s deadline\u0097and got in touch with Caden.</p><p>Sydney and Aquarius rang off. She sank onto the edge of her bed, unstacked the books on her desk, and lifted the one at the bottom. The little red one. She turned to the page where she\u0092d written her previous fantasy about Caden making love to her.</p><p>Last night when she\u0092d arrived home from work, the words had been on the page, mocking her for her stupidity in believing that magic would ever fall into her lap. Tonight, the page was blank. The words were gone. Disappeared. She peered at the spine, but no signs of a ripped page. No erasure marks. Just one perfect, pristine page after another.</p><p>What did that mean? That her fantasy had come true so the words had . . . vanished?</p><p>No. There must be some logical explanation. The pages were stuck together or she wasn\u0092t seeing the ink right in this light or, heaven forbid, Caden had found the page while he was here last night and carefully removed it.</p><p>Sydney bit her lip. Whatever was going on here, she wanted to talk to Caden, and hoped that he wanted her beyond what she\u0092d written.</p><p>Before she could lose her nerve, Sydney grabbed a pen, then carefully crafted a \u0093sexual fantasy.\u0094 That is, if a fantasy of Caden darkening her door to have an honest conversation with her counted as sexual. She couldn\u0092t resist adding a line wishing that he\u0092d make love to her if he genuinely desired and cared about her.</p><p>Sighing, Sydney put the pen down. Moments later, fresh ink appeared on the next page:</p><p>Sleep, dream, anticipate . . .</p><p>The fantasy you imagine will soon be</p><p>your fate.</p><p>Twice now, the book had responded. Sydney shivered. Apparently something paranormal had happened to her . . . and might happen again. As she closed the book, her thoughts spun.</p><p>What if the diary was unable to make emotional fantasies come true? What if it didn\u0092t grant conversation, just sexual wishes? She had asked for honesty, not pillow talk.</p><p>Crap! She\u0092d written in pen, and couldn\u0092t erase the words. But honestly, she didn\u0092t want to. If it brought Caden here so they could talk\u0097and she could apologize\u0097she\u0092d put the brakes on anything else until she was certain it was truly mutual.</p><p>The question was, how long would she have to wait before she saw him? And what would happen once she did?</p><p>After a basically sleepless night, Sydney trudged into the office the following morning, lugging her briefcase in one hand and her extra enormous coffee in the other. Wednesday. Technically, only one more day before her next story was due to copy editing. Bloody hell, she hadn\u0092t even started it. She was waiting. On Caden. Would the magical book work?</p><p>\u0093Morning, Syd!\u0094 Holly popped her head in her office, blond curls framing her face in a way many women paid hundreds of pounds to reproduce, her cupid\u0092s bow mouth painted an eye-catching red. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Morning, Holly.\u0094</p><p>Sydney wanted to be angry at Holly for Caden\u0092s dismissal, but after her description of his eavesdropping, she understood Holly\u0092s position.

Meet Zain Denzell.\u0094</p><p>As if Caden could be replaced with any warm body . . .</p> <p>In the doorway, Holly stepped back. A man edged forward, tall, lanky, and scruffy. He sported inky black hair, a goatee, a crooked nose, and an office-inappropriate T-shirt that said \u0093Wanted: Meaningful Overnight Relationship.\u0094 But the eyes . . . those were sharp, almost dissecting. Sydney had the immediate impression that Zain was used to people underestimating him, and he preferred it that way.</p><p>\u0093Hello.\u0094 She walked around the desk and stuck out her hand.</p><p>Zain approached, something between a walk and a swagger, then took her hand. She had a brief impression of slightly damp palms. He didn\u0092t give off the demeanor of someone with large stature, but still hit her square in the chest, as if he was important somehow.</p><p>\u0093Nice to meet you,\u0094 he said with a nod, then backed away.</p><p>\u0093Likewise.\u0094</p> <p>Biting her lip, Sydney studied him. Not as easy on the eyes as the last one, but he\u0092d be less distracting. Zain\u0092s deference seemed a bit practiced, but she supposed anyone young trying to succeed in the news business learned to bow and scrape in a hurry.</p><p>Suddenly, he smiled. \u0093Too awkward? Sorry. I\u0092m a loner and not used to mingling with others, especially before noon.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re fine.\u0094</p><p>Holly clapped her hands. \u0093Great, now that the introductions are over, why don\u0092t you and Zain spend thirty seconds forming a meaningful work bond, then start making me money?\u0094</p><p>With that cheerful demand, Holly left, shutting the door behind her. Sydney rolled her eyes, and Zain laughed.</p><p>\u0093Is she always that . . .\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Brash? Absolutely. If you hear people talk about Cruella, you know who they mean.\u0094</p><p>Zain rubbed his hands together. \u0093We still have a few moments; tell me about you.\u0094</p><p>Sydney perched herself on the edge of her desk. \u0093I\u0092m a reporter with deadlines who doesn\u0092t have time for crap. You may not believe my stories, but if so, I don\u0092t want to hear it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No. I believe. Especially the magical war story.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s right. You\u0092re the one Holly told me had pictures of the bodies in the tunnel. How did you get them?\u0094</p><p>Zain hesitated. \u0093I have a source who claims to be involved. That\u0092s why I wanted to work here. I think we can blow the doors off this story and make big names for ourselves.\u0094</p><p>She stood up straight, her interest in Zain zooming. \u0093A source involved in the magical war? And you don\u0092t think he or she is mental? Tell me more.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t, really. He didn\u0092t meet with me. I got a note, you see, that basically said, \u0091be here at this time.\u0092 I was, and found the bodies just after the battle.\u0094 Zain shrugged.</p> <p>Odd. \u0093Was this note delivered to your home?\u0094</p><p>He winced, looking a bit sheepish. \u0093It just . . . appeared in my flat.\u0094</p><p>Like poof, as in magic? \u0093Has it happened again?\u0094</p><p>Nodding, Zain explained, \u0093The last one said something big was coming and he\u0092d let me know.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why you?\u0094 Sydney asked. \u0093Why not someone already working on this story?\u0094</p><p>Zain lifted a shoulder. \u0093I don\u0092t know. Maybe because I\u0092ve always been interested in magic.\u0094</p><p>Possible, but it sounded convenient. Sydney\u0092s guess was that Zain wanted this job, and had invented a reclusive source to get it. The pictures in the tunnel? For all Sydney knew, he could have Photoshopped them. Time would tell.</p><p>Repressing a smile, she sank back to the edge of the desk. \u0093I\u0092m working on a new angle about the battle in the tunnel. You know, where you took the pictures of the bodies? I\u0092m having some difficulty. The last article I wrote\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Was rubbish,\u0094 he blurted, then looked sheepish. \u0093No disrespect intended. But you got it all wrong. Mathias is the good guy in the magical world. He wants to end oppression.\u0094</p><p>Sydney slanted him a considering stare. \u0093I have a source, too, who claims Mathias repeatedly raped her. He doesn\u0092t sound like a great bloke.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Energy,\u0094 Zain said. \u0093Powerful emotions, commonly sex, fuels their magic, or so I\u0092ve been told. They must have it frequently. She may have called it rape to win sympathy, but these people shag like mad to keep themselves charged up.\u0094</p><p>Talk about rubbish. First, Aquarius\u0092s cousin had an abused demeanor, not a satisfied one. She\u0092d seen nothing to suggest the woman had engaged in mutually consensual sex. The rest sounded like a tall tale. If it was true, why would his source have confided this sort of information, when it had nothing to do with the war?</p><p>\u0093Interesting.\u0094 She gave him a tight smile. \u0093For my next story . . .\u0094</p><p>The words I\u0092ll just need a few pictures of this red book that grants sexual fantasies stuck in her throat. He might wonder how she\u0092d acquired such a thing. And if he was the sort who would lie about his inside information, maybe he would try to steal the book from her. After Caden\u0092s words of caution and everything that had befallen Aquarius\u0092s cousin, it made sense to be cautious.</p><p>He sat forward, attentive, focused on her. Now she knew how an animal at the zoo felt.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve got it under control,\u0094 she said finally.</p><p>He frowned. \u0093You don\u0092t need me this week?\u0094</p><p>\u0093My last photographer already took pictures,\u0094 she lied. \u0093But bring your snapshots of the bodies. I\u0092ll look at those for my next piece. This week, I\u0092ve got another story. Oh, and if you can, ask your source why, if Mathias is the good sort, abducted foreign soldiers were found among the dead in that tunnel. And what does he make of the Doomsday Brethren?\u0094</p><p>The afternoon both flew and dragged by. Sydney crafted a story about the magical diary. Googling turned up sites about Aleister Crowley, Harry Potter\u0097even a supposedly magical cat. The book she possessed couldn\u0092t belong to any of these people. Finally, buried a few pages down, she found some scholar\u0092s works about a supposed magical diary dating back to King Arthur\u0092s time. She was no expert, but the markings on the book were too old to belong to Crowley, Potter was fictional, and as much as she loved the fantastical, the cat was beyond even her belief. The Arthurian angle fit best.</p><p>A grueling seven hours and a missed lunch later, Sydney submitted her story about the book. She hoped she\u0092d gotten it right. If not, she had until tomorrow to retract it and invent another, in case Caden failed to appear.</p><p>She dug her keys from her handbag and unlocked the door to her flat, her mind on the story and Zain. Had she done the right thing by submitting that story and not accepting Zain\u0092s help? Odd that the man hadn\u0092t seemed at all puzzled when she\u0092d mentioned the Doomsday Brethren. Then again, maybe he\u0092d been following her stories.</p><p>Deep in thought, she turned to shut the door. There Caden stood in the shadowed portico, looming large.</p><p>Sydney gasped, hand over her chest. He looked out of sorts, sweating, agitated. She might have wondered if he was taking drugs, but he hated losing control too much for that.</p><p>\u0093You scared me.\u0094 She lowered her hand and gestured to him. \u0093Come in. Thank God, you came. I\u0097I\u0092m so sorry about Holly and\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t bloody care about the job.\u0094 He took a step in, shed his coat, then shut the door behind him, his eyes boring into hers. \u0093I couldn\u0092t stay away from you.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>CADEN FISTED HIS HANDS at his sides, trying to keep them to himself. Sydney looked gorgeous and fiery in a short black skirt and a shiny, coppery blouse. The former clung lovingly to her hips; the latter provided a mouthwatering glimpse of cleavage. She\u0092d swept her long hair back into some feminine knot that made his fingers itch to unravel it as he unraveled her. The remnants of reddish gloss stained her plump lips.</p><p>Without thinking, he found himself crossing the room to taste her lush mouth\u0097and any other part of her she\u0092d let him.</p><p>No! Down that path lay disaster. Damn it, he was here to end this mission, for Sydney\u0092s safety\u0097and his own heart. He could not do something irresponsible. Already, this was going to hurt.</p><p>Blast Bram and his grand schemes. Caden had only agreed to this one because it would keep Sydney safe. But she would also hate him forever.</p><p>\u0093We should talk.\u0094</p><p>She nodded and locked the door behind him, then headed for the kitchen, casting a nervous glance over her shoulder as she went. Damn. Caden wanted to be rational in her presence. A gentleman. But the urge to fuck her until she screamed his name, coupled with the gut-wrenching fear this was the last time he\u0092d see her, made that impossible.</p><p>\u0093Tea?\u0094 she asked.</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 he scratched out.</p><p>\u0093Something stronger?\u0094 She reached to the top of a cabinet and pulled out a bottle of whiskey.</p><p>Very dangerous. If he clouded his judgment with alcohol, no telling how little conversation and how much sex they\u0092d have. He owed her his best behavior.</p><p>He shook his head. \u0093Sit down.\u0094</p><p>Sydney bit her lip, then crossed the room. She settled on the sofa, and he sat beside her, intentionally keeping space between them. Bloody hell, she smelled like peaches and jasmine and softness. He swallowed as need clawed at him. Everything about her called to him. It was sharper tonight, painful almost. His body shook. As hot as he felt, he would have sworn it was July during a swelter, not late November.</p><p>\u0093Why are you here?\u0094 she whispered. \u0093If it\u0092s to pick up where we left off\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094 He would restrain himself, talk to her. Keep her safe. \u0093I came to explain.\u0094</p><p>She raised a ginger brow.</p><p>\u0093I swear, I haven\u0092t tried to steal your magical war story. Who would I sell it to?\u0094</p><p>\u0093We have competitors who are ruthless and not picky about ethics.\u0094</p><p>Though he\u0092d known she suspected he plotted to steal from her, her suspicions still hurt. \u0093I\u0092m not one of them. Please trust me on that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Holly caught you eavesdropping. What were you doing?\u0094</p><p>Bloody hell, Sydney proved over and over how sharp and direct she was. As always, he admired\u0097no, desired her\u0097for it. \u0093I wasn\u0092t planning to steal your story. I wanted to know what was happening with you. If . . . you were seeing another man.\u0094</p><p>Another man? Had he been jealous? \u0093There\u0092s no one else. For the record, I did not ask Holly to release you. In fact, I spoke to her before we ever . . .\u0094 Sydney scrubbed her hand across her face. \u0093Holly is my trusted mentor, so I asked for advice. Whatever you believe, I never thought she\u0092d sack you. I asked her to take you back, but after she caught you eavesdropping, she refused.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I understand. It\u0092s all right.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If you weren\u0092t stealing, then why all the questions about my story? Why romance me?\u0094 Sydney bit her lip and hesitated. \u0093Was any of it real?\u0094</p><p>God, he wanted to avoid answering that telling question and just ask her if Anka was her source. But that was impossible. Sydney would ask too many questions. And the first would be, how did he know Anka, a magical woman? If he was honest and said that she was his brother\u0092s former \u0093wife,\u0094 Sydney would know he was close to magic. She would want more information about magickind that wasn\u0092t his to give or safe for her to know. Or she could think he was one of Mathias\u0092s minions, looking to torture Anka again. If Sydney thought that, she would shut him out completely. But he owed her as much of the truth as he dare give.</p><p>\u0093Everything I felt, every touch, every concern, was real. Being with you . . . was incredible. This is a terrible time in my life for romance. I should\u0092ve stayed away. But you\u0092re damned hard to resist.\u0094</p><p>She flushed, and he smiled.</p><p>Then he sobered. How the devil could he answer her questions about his interest in the story? Damn. He felt rotten. Tired, hot, and aroused, his thoughts were sluggish and his body demanding. Worse today than yesterday by far. Bloody transition.</p><p>Sydney still looked at him expectantly, and the more information he gave her, the stickier the explanation. Lies upon lies upon lies, and he hated them. The truth was no better. The more he gave her, the more she\u0092d put in another story, further jeopardizing her.</p><p>Finally, an idea hit him like a bolt. A godsend. He sighed in relief.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m looking for a witch named Anka.\u0094 He watched Sydney\u0092s face, but it remained impassive. If she knew Anka, she hid it well. \u0093Nothing has helped my brother\u0092s condition, and I spoke with a . . . healer who believed that Anka had magical powers that could help Lucan. I\u0092ve tried everything else to make my brother whole, to no avail. Anka disappeared recently, and when I started reading your stories in the paper, I wondered if she was your source.\u0094</p><p>Not a lie . . . just not the whole truth.</p><p>Regret and sadness crossed her face. \u0093I can\u0092t tell you if the woman you\u0092re seeking is my source. As much as I want to help your brother . . .\u0094 She grimaced. \u0093I can\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>Caden nodded. \u0093I know. Working with you under false pretenses was wrong. I didn\u0092t mean to be dodgy. I was desperate.\u0094</p><p>He refused to coerce her into compromising her ethics and giving him her source\u0092s name. She\u0092d resent him, and he couldn\u0092t tolerate adding more fuel to the anger she\u0092d feel after tonight. Already he felt guilty for doing his best to stop the story that could help her prove her merit to the world and her stodgy parents.</p><p>Somehow, he must devise another way to locate Anka, and he could barely think beyond his exhaustion and need to touch Sydney. But now he must deceive her again. The knowledge burned, though this was for her own safety\u0097and that of magickind.</p><p>\u0093The other reason I came was to prove I have no designs on your story. I\u0092ve found two people who are experts on that old book Aquarius got you, the one you want to write about.\u0094 He nearly choked on the lie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093You told people about it?\u0094 She rolled her eyes. \u0093Doesn\u0092t matter. They can\u0092t beat me to press.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I told people who can help you understand the book. I swear, no one has designs on your story.\u0094</p><p>She hesitated. \u0093All right, but everything I\u0092ve written is conjecture. If you brought me experts . . . I\u0092ve already turned the story in, but I\u0092ve got a bit of time\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093A story about the book?\u0094 At her nod, his stomach lurched. Dear God. With that article, she was painting a huge red target on her forehead for Mathias. He forced himself to relax. \u0093Well, you have until tomorrow afternoon to change it, right?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Unless Holly puts it up as a web story first. She\u0092ll let me know in the morning.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Call her and tell her to hold it. You\u0092ll want to, once you talk to my connections. Olivia Gray owns a local art gallery and is an expert in antiquities. She\u0092s handled something remarkably similar before.\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s face softened and excitement bloomed. \u0093Really?\u0094</p><p>Feeling guilt sear him again, he managed to nod. \u0093I also spoke with Simon Northam. He\u0092s\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093The Simon Northam? The Duke of Hurstgrove?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093You know him?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know of him. Who doesn\u0092t? Hello! Magazine named him England\u0092s sexiest bachelor. He\u0092s filthy rich and intelligent and . . . he knows about this book and is willing to talk to me?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. Antique books are a passion of his. They both need to examine the book. In your presence, of course.\u0094 Right before they take it. \u0093Will you let them? They can either come here or meet you at the pub \u0091round the corner. I told them I would call if you were willing.\u0094</p><p>Sydney hesitated, biting her lip. The sight distracted Caden, who restrained the urge to lean across and kiss her. Giving into that impulse? Disaster. He didn\u0092t want to be magically compelled to mate. Sydney was human. She didn\u0092t belong in the middle of this magical war. And if she accepted his Call, her lifespan would match his. Who would want to live centuries fraught with danger, surrounded by people who could kill her in the blink of an eye when she had no way to fight back? And did he want to risk losing her and winding up like Lucan? No and no.</p><p>\u0093I want to talk to them. But no pictures. The book doesn\u0092t leave my sight. No one writes anything down.\u0094</p><p>Caden nodded, even as the pain of deceiving her again lanced him. Though it was for her own good, it ripped his insides. \u0093And you\u0092ll call Holly?\u0094</p> <p>A heartbeat passed, another. He\u0092d do anything to keep that article out of the paper and keep her safe.</p><p>\u0093If I like what Olivia and Hurstgrove say, I\u0092ll call and tell her to hold the story so I can make some modifications. If I don\u0092t hear anything interesting, it\u0092ll run as is.\u0094</p><p>Caden released a shaky breath. He hoped that gave them enough time to take the book and somehow convince her to pull the story. He\u0092d have to devise a new way to find Anka. Because he refused to keep hurting his pretty redheaded firecracker.</p><p>\u0093Thank you. I hope you find Olivia and Duke\u0092s information helpful.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Duke?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Simon\u0092s nickname.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Simon, is it? How well do you know him?\u0094</p><p>Well enough to have fought a battle by his side. Well enough to have endured Marrok\u0092s physical training with Duke until they nearly dropped. Of all the Doomsday Brethren, Caden liked Duke most. He didn\u0092t bark orders, like Marrok. He wasn\u0092t half mad, like Ice. Or a manipulative sod, like Bram. He was reliable, unlike Shock. Duke was quiet, shrewd, and tough when necessary. Having a bazillion pounds hadn\u0092t made him pretentious at all.</p> <p>\u0093We met a few weeks ago,\u0094 he hedged. \u0093He\u0092s a friend of my brother\u0092s.\u0094</p><p>Sydney shook her head. \u0093This is surreal. I appreciate you introducing me to Olivia and \u0091Duke.\u0092 But regardless of what they say, I still can\u0092t give you the name of my source.\u0094</p><p>Caden wished otherwise, but he respected her loyalty. \u0093I know.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If you want me to meet these people, why come here alone?\u0094</p><p>Because he wanted to see her. Talk to her. Touch her one last time.</p><p>Her lips parted expectantly, and he tensed, stepped closer. It would be so easy. . . . Lean in, close his eyes, press his mouth to hers, let magic and fate take over. He\u0092d have someone who would be his \u0091til death parted them.</p><p>What if she didn\u0092t want that? Or want to live a millennium? Committing to him wouldn\u0092t be for a typical fifty years, after all. What if they discovered they didn\u0092t like each other in a few hundred years, or for that matter, two decades, or two months? Or what if the war took her from him tomorrow and he slid into mate mourning madness?</p><p>\u0093Caden?\u0094 she prompted.</p><p>Impossible to be totally honest with her, but he had to be as honest as he could and leave with the cleanest conscience possible.</p><p>\u0093As I said, I can\u0092t stay away from you. You\u0092re an amazing woman.\u0094</p><p>She swallowed. The moment pulsed between them, thick, tense. Caden leaned in farther, drawn by her fruity jasmine scent, by those chocolate eyes that were melting him by the second. No, no, no! His internal temperature kicked up\u0097 right along with his amped-up sex drive. He hadn\u0092t touched her and already he felt unbearably aroused. He cupped her cheek with shaking hand, trailed his thumb over her lips. Her mouth looked like heaven.</p><p>\u0093This isn\u0092t a good idea,\u0094 she breathed raggedly.</p><p>She was affected, too. The knowledge seared him.</p><p>Caden caressed his way from her shoulder to her nape. \u0093Stop me.\u0094</p><p>Her breathing picked up speed. \u0093Why do you want this?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I think of you. Constantly. For once in my life, I\u0092m not in control. I shouldn\u0092t do this. I know it. Yet, I can\u0092t stop.\u0094</p><p>That was the complete truth.</p><p>Sydney breathed hard. \u0093This is a terrible idea.\u0094</p><p>Agreed, but that didn\u0092t douse his need.</p><p>When she paced nervously to her little dining room, he followed. \u0093I never meant to hurt you. I wanted to help my brother, but then I got caught up in you. I wasn\u0092t always honest. I apologize. But I can\u0092t tell you I don\u0092t want you. That would be the biggest lie of all.\u0094</p><p>Sydney pressed her lips together and looked at him over her shoulder. Her expression said she was staving off tears. \u0093I have never had serious feelings for any man. But in less than a week, you\u0092ve changed everything. Letting you leave here Tuesday morning was one of the most difficult things I\u0092ve done, but I refused to fight for something you didn\u0092t want. Now you\u0092re back. What\u0092s changed?\u0094</p><p>Even in matters of the heart, she whittled away the crap and asked the tough questions. But it was a fair question. Something had changed inside him. More dreams of Sydney, his magical instincts and admiration growing stronger, that damn persistent ache in his chest, fear he\u0092d never see her again\u0097none of it was letting him leave her.</p><p>\u0093What I feel is too strong to ignore. I tried, God knows. It\u0092s such a difficult time in my life, and a pull this strong can\u0092t be natural.\u0094</p><p>Caden edged closer, pressing his body against her back, his erection against the taut curves of her backside. He gritted his teeth, trying to stay focused. His energy, which had been lagging all day, shot up the moment he pressed himself to her. Unfortunately, so did his need.</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t fight it,\u0094 he murmured.</p><p>Her breath hitched on a sob. \u0093Me, either.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve known you to be smart, sexy, ambitious, tough, compassionate . . . and brutally honest. I appreciate you for it.\u0094</p><p>He cupped her chin in his hand and turned her face in his direction. When she stared over her shoulder, he saw her eyes glossed with tears. Her cheeks were red, her lips a swollen invitation to paradise.</p><p>\u0093But I don\u0092t want to hurt you,\u0094 he murmured. \u0093You will, if you spend the night and leave again in the morning without a backward glance.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t think I can leave you again. My connection to you is stronger than my will.\u0094</p><p>God, if he was going to confess that, why not just kiss her? Issue the Call that was instinctually bred down into every wizard\u0092s bones and be done? He\u0092d never known or paid attention to the words of the Call until meeting Sydney. Now, they slid through his head with frightening regularity.</p><p>\u0093You truly want to be here?\u0094 Her voice trembled.</p><p>Yes and no . . . but more yes. \u0093I don\u0092t think I could leave, even if you tossed me out.\u0094</p><p>His mobile phone, tucked in his pocket, rang. He glanced at the display and cursed. Duke.</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t answer that,\u0094 Sydney said, startling him.</p><p>Want darkened her eyes. His body tightened, leapt in response. He shouldn\u0092t do this. She deserved better. But he\u0092d likely never again touch her, and the knowledge was killing him.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re certain?\u0094</p><p>After a slight pause, she gave him a shaky nod. \u0093I may regret this tomorrow, but you\u0092re right. I\u0092m honest and I want you.\u0094</p><p>With a press of his thumb, he silenced the phone\u0092s ring, then set it on the table.</p><p>Bloody hell, he wanted to kiss Sydney. So damn badly. Those parted rosy lips were mere inches under his, moist and enticing. Somehow, for both of them, he had to resist. Otherwise, he\u0092d blurt the Call. The words were a constant chanting in his head. Become a part of me . . .</p><p>He pressed his mouth to her jaw, the side of her neck. She scooted around, trying to inch her mouth under his again.</p><p>A distraction. They both needed one before things got out of hand.</p><p>Caden nibbled at the shell of her ear, breath harsh. She shivered. But her body trembled harder when he reached around her other shoulder and his fingers found the buttons to her little attention-getting blouse. He undid the first, the second, none too gently, then slid his hand inside, beneath her bra, to cup her breast. Under his palm, her heart beat like a wild drum. She pressed her backside against him and moaned. Beautiful, sweet woman.</p><p>As I become a part of you . . . the Call continued in his head.</p><p>He shoved the words from his mind and focused on the rest of the buttons. They parted for him in a fluid unveiling of skin, sighs, and desire. When he peeled the garment away, he couldn\u0092t keep his hands from devouring all the soft cinnamon-freckled skin on her soft abdomen, until he molded his palms over her lace-covered breasts.</p><p>She threw her head back onto his shoulder and gasped. He smelled her fruity-jasmine scent, which had haunted him for two days. But now there was more. Musk. Desire. He could smell her arousal. Because of his coming transition? Was he simply more attuned to her? Didn\u0092t matter. It kicked blood straight to his cock, and he pressed against her, dying to fill her up and be one with her.</p><p>Sydney reached up between his hands and he heard a little click. Suddenly her bra eased away from her breasts.</p><p>Grabbing one strap, he tore it off and tossed it across the room. Then he filled his hands with her bare breasts, the little beaded nipples scorching his palms. God help him. He\u0092d always adored women, but this . . .this was more. Beyond control. Sydney set him on fire, pushed him past restraint. Amazed him.</p><p>Soft, feminine arms reached around him to clasp at the back of his neck, which pressed her breasts even deeper into his hands. Words kept popping into his head.</p><p>And ever after, I promise myself to thee.</p><p>He rolled her nipples between her fingers, and she moaned. His body shook. Fire raged inside him, barely in control. He wanted\u0097no, needed\u0097more from Sydney. Everything. Now.</p><p>Lowering his hands to the curve of her waist, over her hips, he encountered the side release of her skirt. He could have easily lifted it, but he liked the idea of her being bare for him.</p><p>He yanked the zip down, then shoved the garment over her hips. What she wore beneath\u0097black, lacy, small\u0097easy to shred with his hands.</p><p>Now she was naked, all warm flesh and breathy sighs, arched, exposed. His.</p><p>Caden had his shirt off in a moment. Sydney tilted her head, giving him the naked flesh of her neck and the soft curve of her shoulder. He put his mouth to her, dying for any taste of her he could afford.</p><p>He ripped into his jeans, discarding them and everything beneath, laving his tongue across her skin. He savored her addicting salty honey flavor. He moaned into her ear, and she shivered against him.</p><p>\u0093Sydney?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 she breathed as his lips trailed across her shoulder blade. \u0093Now.\u0094</p><p>That was all Caden had to hear.</p><p>Taking her hip in one hand, he guided his erection to her slick sex with the other and pressed in slowly. Tight, like an amazing glove fit just for him. So perfect.</p><p>Each day we share, I will be honest, good, and true.</p><p>Caden shook his head, trying to dislodge the words that kept circling in his brain. This was about savoring their last touch, not claiming her forever. But Sydney\u0092s hot grip short-circuited him. Instead, he sank in, gave himself over, let pleasure take him dangerously higher.</p><p>Beneath him, Sydney panted. Her body softened. The smell of her arousal grew stronger, so strong he swore he could almost taste her. Every instinct he possessed urged him to kiss her\u0097her mouth, her sex\u0097any part of her, every part.</p><p>He fought the urge, clenching her hip in one hand and wrapping the other around her body until his fingers found her clit. Draped over her back, Caden worked the delicate bud of nerves. Grazing, circling, slow caresses designed to drive her mad, while he filled her with deep, possessive strokes.</p><p>Soon, she tightened on him. Her fingernails dug into his wrist. Her pants became groans, then wails. And his body tensed, dying to feel everything about her, release himself into her completely, give himself, body and soul.</p><p>If this you seek, heed my Call.</p><p>The words no sooner crossed his mind when Sydney clamped down, cried out, and her body surrendered to his completely. God, he wanted to see her face, watch her expressive dark eyes as pleasure overtook her, kiss her mouth, and claim her as he came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even the thought sent him straight over the edge, into a white-light abyss that burned into his brain brighter than anything he\u0092d ever experienced. Ecstasy jolted him, an unrelenting vise of need he\u0092d strangled since he\u0092d last been inside her. Now freed, the pleasure clawed down his spine, up his cock. He shouted, mesmerized by her feel, her smell. He drank her in, as if he was destined to know her above all others. Remember her only.</p><p>From this moment on, there is no other for me but you.</p><p>\u0093That was . . .\u0094 Sydney didn\u0092t finish the thought.</p><p>Straight from his heart.</p> <p>\u0093It was,\u0094 he panted, afraid to speak his thought aloud.</p><p>Now that the time to part had come, he wondered if he could keep her, tell her the truth, let her decide if she wanted to deal with magickind and the war. Or should he let her go, try desperately to forget her and know he\u0092d likely never mate?</p><p>He didn\u0092t want to think of such things while still buried within her. Not while he had his arms about her. But that wasn\u0092t reality. The phone vibrating on the table beside them was. Duke, again. No doubt wondering where the hell they were.</p><p>His breathing had not yet recovered when he withdrew from Sydney with a curse, then picked up the phone. He didn\u0092t bother with pleasantries. \u0093We\u0092ll be there in ten.\u0094</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t wait for a reply, but simply hung up.</p> <p>\u0093Are you all right?\u0094 He caressed her shoulder, down the line of her spine, admiring the sleek curve of her waist, then pulled her body against his, front to her back.</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod. \u0093What happens after this meeting? With us?\u0094</p><p>Though a fair question, it stabbed him. Putting distance between them would be best for her, but could he stay away?</p><p>\u0093After this meeting, we\u0092ll talk.\u0094</p><p>Caden guided Sydney into the crowded pub with a hand at the small of her back. Pathetic. Twenty minutes after one of the most amazing sexual experiences in his life and the only thing it had done was make him greedy for more. Now was the time for business.</p><p>He hoped he could focus.</p> <p>The walls of the crowded pub seemed to close in, pressed with tables and bodies and the smell of ale. He started to sweat again, shake. His energy waned with every step. He\u0092d like to think he\u0092d simply needed a bit of a nap after an orgasm that had nearly blown his head off. Given his urge to hold Sydney close and drown in her again, he knew better.</p><p>\u0093Where the hell have you been?\u0094 Duke grabbed his elbow and barked in his ear.</p><p>Sluggishly, Caden turned his head. The wizard looked incredibly brassed off. Splendid.</p><p>A few feet in front of him, he was vaguely aware of Olivia introducing herself to Sydney and smiles being exchanged. Olivia led Sydney to another table. He barely let her go with a growl. The women began chatting.</p><p>\u0093Sit down,\u0094 Duke commanded.</p><p>Perhaps he should and rest his head. He needed sleep. Badly.</p><p>He swayed on his feet, the room spinning. Duke peered into his face, then sniffed. \u0093Never mind. I know what you\u0092ve been about. Sex at a time this critical?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Piss off,\u0094 he growled, then collapsed onto a stool.</p> <p>\u0093Damn it!\u0094 Duke hissed. \u0093Look at me.\u0094</p><p>Caden slowly opened unfocused eyes. \u0093Wha . . . ?\u0094</p><p>Duke pinched the bridge of his nose. \u0093Have you been sweating all day? Shaking?\u0094</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u0093Craving sex?\u0094</p><p>A snort punctuated Caden\u0092s answer. \u0093Last two weeks.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You just shagged her and you\u0092re already exhausted?\u0094</p><p>In the battle between Caden and his heavy eyelids, the eyelids won. \u0093Watch your mouth.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Answer me.\u0094</p><p>Somehow, Caden found the energy to nod.</p><p>\u0093Fuck.\u0094</p><p>Usually, the titled wizard was every bit a gentleman. Caden winced at Duke\u0092s curse.</p><p>\u0093Your magical signature is beginning to take shape. Black, blue, and gray. But there\u0092s something yellow and white trying to merge with it.\u0094 Duke turned his attention toward Sydney. \u0093Is she your mate? I know you haven\u0092t spoken the words but . . .\u0094</p><p>Caden nodded. He\u0092d finally admitted what his body had been telling him since virtually the moment he\u0092d met her. It wasn\u0092t a happy admission.</p><p>\u0093Your transition from human to wizard is upon you. We\u0092ve got to find a female to go through it with you. You\u0092ll need great amounts of sexual energy.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sydney\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Is a reporter! If you transition with her, you\u0092ll bed her like a madman for the next few days, then emerge as a wizard involuntarily displaying your special power, which will likely be impossible to hide. How do you know she won\u0092t print it in her human newspaper? You cannot choose her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Want her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know,\u0094 he soothed. \u0093But you can\u0092t have her for your transition. Not for your mate, either. She\u0092ll learn too much and expose us to humanity. I\u0092ll call Bram. Certainly, he\u0092ll know a witch who will help you.\u0094 Duke reached for his mobile.</p><p>Caden\u0092s sluggish brain took in Duke\u0092s words. Everything inside him rebelled. Drudging up all his energy, he grabbed Duke\u0092s phone and banged it against the table. It chirped and broke into a dozen little pieces of plastic and wires.</p><p>Duke recoiled, looking around to see who had noticed. \u0093Have you gone mental?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I want Sydney.\u0094</p><p>Duke clenched his jaw tight, but then a fresh tremor overtook Caden\u0092s body, rocking every muscle. The wizard closed the short distance between them and draped an arm around his shoulders. \u0093Let\u0092s go.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s wrong with him?\u0094 Olivia. Caden knew that voice.</p><p>\u0093Guess,\u0094 Duke barked. \u0093Mr. Hormones destroyed my mobile. Use yours to call Bram. Tell him I\u0092ll be babysitting for a few days.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Get him out of here quickly,\u0094 Olivia said to Duke. \u0093People are staring. They probably think he\u0092s having a seizure. \u0094 She turned to Sydney. \u0093Perhaps we can continue our discussion\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sydney comes with me.\u0094 Caden raised his head and glared daggers at Olivia. Marrok would kill him for it later, but now all that mattered was keeping Sydney at his side. He turned his heavy stare on Olivia, willing her to understand.</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s wrong with him?\u0094 Sydney looked stunned and concerned.</p><p>\u0093If you\u0092ll go with Caden and help him, I\u0092d like to take the book and examine it overnight,\u0094 Olivia said.</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094 Sydney\u0092s refusal was a crisp syllable that didn\u0092t surprise Caden at all. \u0093Ring me tomorrow. We\u0092ll meet again. Tell me what\u0092s ailing him.\u0094</p><p>Duke and Olivia shared a glance. No way to answer her. Caden didn\u0092t care what they said. He only knew that he was burning up from the inside and that he needed these clothes off and Sydney under him. Immediately. She would soothe him. Only she would do.</p><p>He lifted his head and sent a burning gaze to her. \u0093Need you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m here.\u0094</p><p>Olivia edged Sydney away. Caden lurched across the feet separating them. Duke dragged him back with a yank and got in his face.</p><p>\u0093You do not, under any circumstances, kiss her. Or get oral with her. No tasting at all. No speaking the Call. Is that clear?\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u0093BUGGER OFF,\u0094 CADEN SNEERED, then staggered toward Sydney.</p><p>She steadied him with an arm about his shoulders. Dear God, he was an inferno. She gasped. Fear knotted her gut. What the devil was wrong with him?</p><p>\u0093He needs a hospital!\u0094 she barked at Duke and Olivia.</p><p>Duke sighed, and Sydney recognized his expression; she\u0092d seen it on other male faces prior to conversation: dread.</p><p>\u0093No. He needs a bed with you beside him.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What? If he\u0092s ill, the last thing he needs is sex!\u0094</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue the virtues of modern medicine, but Caden nuzzled her neck. She shivered and momentarily lost focus, until a cultured voice brought her back.</p><p>\u0093That, my dear, is the very thing he needs.\u0094</p><p>She could not have heard Hurstgrove right. \u0093I don\u0092t understand. Is this what his brother has? Some sexual compulsion?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094</p><p>A horrible thought skittered through her head. What if she had done this to him by writing the latest fantasy in the book?</p><p>\u0093We can\u0092t talk here,\u0094 Hurstgrove went on. \u0093I\u0092ll explain when we reach your flat. Can you . . . care for him?\u0094</p><p>If Caden needed her, Sydney wanted to be there for him. She owed him, really, in case her midnight fantasies had put him in this state. But he was more than an obligation to her.</p><p>Though Caden hadn\u0092t always been honest with her, she understood his reasons for subterfuge. If she\u0092d had a sibling and a few lies could save their life . . . she would likely have done the same. Besides, she sensed Caden needed her on a deeper level. Maybe helping him through this ailment would enable her to see all the way to his core and bring them closer.</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 she said finally.</p><p>\u0093Thank you.\u0094 His eyes closed in relief. \u0093Very much. Let\u0092s go.\u0094</p><p>She didn\u0092t understand what was happening, but now wasn\u0092t the time for a lot of chatter. After Caden had recovered, absolutely. She\u0092d want every detail.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll come along, in case you need help.\u0094</p><p>From curious to bizarre. Help in bed? \u0093I\u0092ve got sex covered, thank you.\u0094</p><p>Despite her confusion, when Caden nibbled on her ear, Sydney shivered. He was insistent, almost feral. The female in her basked at the intensity of his desire, though she didn\u0092t fully understand.</p><p>\u0093I need you,\u0094 Caden breathed, caressing a palm up her hip, under her shirt, to cup her breast. \u0093With me . . .\u0094</p><p>As his touch burned her sensitive skin, Sydney met his gaze. Blistering blue supplication radiated from him, along with anxiety. Whatever ailed him, he wasn\u0092t in complete control\u0097and that terrified him. Never had Caden seemed vulnerable, and even if her writings had nothing to do with it, she wouldn\u0092t deny him.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll be in the next room to make sure he doesn\u0092t get . . . out of control.\u0094 Hurstgrove yanked Caden\u0092s hand off her, then pushed them toward the door.</p><p>Sydney risked a glance around. People were staring\u0097 loads of them. Her cheeks heated up as if she flushed twenty shades of red. How many had seen Caden\u0092s intimate display of public affection? Duke didn\u0092t have to push her again; she dashed out of the pub, dragging Caden along. Olivia held the door open.</p><p>Outside, Sydney halted in the stinging November wind. She and Caden had walked to the pub. How the devil was she going to get him to stroll back to her flat when he was solely focused on unbuttoning her shirt?</p><p>A moment later, Duke provided a solution, sprinting toward a very posh black SUV and opening the door. Sydney climbed into the backseat, and Caden followed with a growl, his predatory blue eyes glowing in shadow. Those eyes told her that he wanted her in every way possible. Though his condition concerned her, Sydney\u0092s belly flipped with desire.</p><p>With a feral smile, Caden grabbed her legs and swung her sideways until she reclined across the seat. She gasped as he covered her until most of her body lay beneath him. Then he lifted her skirt.</p><p>\u0093Caden,\u0094 she whispered, trying not to surrender entirely to the delicious feel of him and the fact he needed her. \u0093Wait! My flat is five minutes\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t wait.\u0094 His voice was rough. \u0093Need you.\u0094</p><p>There again, that vulnerability. She wouldn\u0092t abandon him. Somehow, she had to make him understand that she was only putting him off until they were alone.</p><p>\u0093Just a few minutes longer.\u0094</p><p>Caden growled and wrapped his body around hers. Sydney supposed she should be mortified, but desire, both to hold and heal him, trampled her modesty. He\u0092d never insulted her intellect or her profession\u0097she couldn\u0092t say as much for her last date, let alone her parents. And given her brief conversation with Olivia, she knew Caden had truly brought her experts to talk about the unusual book she possessed. And how many men would move across an ocean and go to such lengths to help a brother? She\u0092d been suspicious and judged him without really knowing him or understanding his behavior.</p><p>The fear she\u0092d seen earlier on his face resurfaced, and he reached for her. His expression confessed his need for her\u0097 body and heart. \u0093Help me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Of course. Five minutes.\u0094</p><p>He growled.</p><p>Two slams penetrated her consciousness, and she turned her head to see Duke and Olivia settle in the front seat, resolutely not looking their way.</p><p>\u0093Did you call Bram?\u0094 Duke asked Olivia.</p><p>Who? Sydney wondered. The thought dashed away when Caden took her blouse in hand and ripped it in two. She gasped as the remnants of her top drifted to the floorboard.</p><p>\u0093Not here!\u0094</p><p>He didn\u0092t listen. His mouth latched onto her breast through her bra. Her nipples, still tender from their last encounter, leapt to full, aching attention. She stifled a moan. God, she hoped no one was watching, but couldn\u0092t tear herself away to check.</p><p>\u0093I left him a message,\u0094 Olivia whispered.</p><p>Duke cursed softly. \u0093Damn. This is going to take a while.\u0094 He glanced in the rearview mirror, then looked away. \u0093Where do you live?\u0094</p><p>With the feel of Caden, the smell of his musk and desire, she didn\u0092t worry what Duke saw. Then Caden planted soft, open-mouthed kisses all over her abdomen and began edging lower.</p><p>With an impatient roar, he pushed her skirt up around her waist. Cripes, she was wet. Caden latched onto her breast again and his fingers dove under the silk between her thighs.</p><p>Peeling out and away from the curb, Duke cursed again. \u0093Quickly. Where do you live?\u0094</p><p>Moaning between a kiss and a touch, Sydney rattled off her address, and he darted away, programming his GPS accordingly. Three minutes later, he reached her building. Caden was trying to work her knickers off with one hand, her bra off with the other, kissing the flat of her belly in between. She was trying not to help him along, only because she couldn\u0092t walk to her flat naked.</p><p>\u0093Car park?\u0094 Duke barked.</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 Sydney managed to croak out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duke pulled close to the walk, then turned to Olivia. \u0093Can you park this? Call Marrok and tell him your location. Suggest that Sabelle fetch you as soon as possible. I hate to leave you alone, even for a moment.\u0094</p><p>Olivia laid a soft hand on his shoulder. \u0093I\u0092m fine.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Bad people still want their bloody hands on you, my little le Fay. You\u0092re in danger. Be careful.\u0094</p><p>Le Fay? Like Morganna le Fay?</p> <p>A smile curved the beauty\u0092s mouth. \u0093You\u0092re like the annoying big brother I never had.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Big brothers know best. Now go.\u0094</p><p>At Olivia\u0092s nod, Duke exited the vehicle, doffing his sweater. When, the back door opened, he leaned in. Sydney wriggled to lower her skirt, which earned her a growl from Caden. Hurstgrove never looked her way.</p><p>\u0093Come with me.\u0094 Duke grabbed Caden by the neck and yanked him to his feet. Caden fought, hitting his head on the top of the door.</p><p>\u0093Careful!\u0094 she insisted.</p> <p>As soon as he cleared the vehicle, Caden snarled and whirled, throwing wicked punches in the air.</p><p>Duke spun him around, then clamped his arms around Caden\u0092s middle. \u0093Put this on.\u0094 He tossed her his sweater. \u0093Go. Open your door. We\u0092ll follow.\u0094</p><p>Sydney skipped the lift and headed for the stairs, uncertain that Duke could contain Caden during the ancient machine\u0092s long ascent.</p><p>Behind her, Caden grunted, straining to be free. She swallowed. His desire was contagious. Want hiked up her breathing, cramped her sex. But terror crept in. What if she couldn\u0092t help him? What if her efforts to reach his heart didn\u0092t heal him? What if this was all due to that damn book?</p><p>Suddenly, Duke huffed. \u0093Bloody hell!\u0094</p><p>Glancing over her shoulder, Sydney found Duke doubled over\u0097and Caden charging for her. He pinned her to the wall a moment later, grabbing her thigh in one hand and nipping at her throat with his lips. She felt his erection pressed against her. Her anticipation skyrocketed, and she palmed her way under his shirt, eager to feel the hot, bare skin of his back.</p> <p>\u0093Not in the hall,\u0094 Duke admonished. \u0093Let\u0092s get behind closed doors, shall we?\u0094</p><p>Oops! No matter how badly she wanted Caden, Hurst-grove was right. Admittedly, it was odd to be nearly ravished in front of a stranger, and she was hardly in the humor to provide a peep show for her neighbors. But caring at the moment was bloody hard. What woman didn\u0092t have a fantasy or two about a man being so overcome with passion he was hardly himself? Even more, the fact Caden had asked her to be the anchor in his storm added to her thrill.</p><p>So when Caden pressed against her and whispered that he couldn\u0092t wait to be alone with her, inside her, she melted all over again.</p><p>With a curse, Duke managed to pry Caden away and push him up the stairs. They trudged toward her door.</p><p>As they reached it, Duke tried to soothe her by patting her shoulder. \u0093After you\u0092re inside and together, all will be well.\u0094</p><p>Suddenly, Caden shoved her behind his big, hot body, then whirled to face Hurstgrove, then clasped his hand around the duke\u0092s throat. \u0093You will not touch her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Right.\u0094 Duke held up both hands in surrender. \u0093Won\u0092t do that.\u0094</p><p>Caden growled and let go, then turned back to Sydney. Possessiveness? Yes, it was in his eyes. She\u0092d always been certain that this relationship meant more to her heart than his, but now . . . now she questioned that. Was she finally seeing the emotions he\u0092d kept hidden behind his barriers?</p> <p>Hoping yes, she raced for her door, inserting her key with trembling fingers. He was right behind her, pressing her to the wood, breathing hot and hard in her ear.</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t leave me, Sydney.\u0094</p><p>She finally managed to turn the key, and they spilled inside the little flat. Caden roared in after her, his expression a pledge that he meant to have her. Heart trumpeting, she drew in a ragged breath. Duke followed them in, shutting and locking the door, his gaze discreetly focused elsewhere.</p><p>Hurstgrove spotted the hallway leading to her bedroom and gestured to her. \u0093Take him.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Be with me,\u0094 Caden murmured. \u0093Now. I need you.\u0094</p><p>Sydney wanted that more than anything, but needed some information about his condition first. \u0093We\u0092re here. Explain. Why is he suddenly a randy octopus and why does he want my help?\u0094</p><p>Duke mussed his expensively coiffed hair by raking a hand through it. He cursed something ugly. Then he glanced at Caden, feverish and sliding his hands over her arms, across her abdomen, burning her up with his touch.</p><p>\u0093This is off the record. If one word of this appears in your tabloid, I will use all my wealth and connections to shut it down and unemploy you permanently.\u0094</p><p>His intimidation tactics startled Sydney\u0097and annoyed her. If he hadn\u0092t been Caden\u0092s friend and she hadn\u0092t seen his concern in action, she\u0092d have tossed him out on his ear. Yes, he was wealthy and powerful, but if she stumbled upon a hidden truth, she wanted to tell it. Still, she had no doubt Duke could make good on his threats.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t like being bullied.\u0094 She glared at Duke.</p><p>\u0093Understood. But you\u0092re dealing with something very dangerous you can\u0092t possibly understand.\u0094</p><p>Her heart stopped. \u0093Caden\u0092s condition is that serious?\u0094</p><p>Duke hesitated. \u0093Not exactly. It\u0092s everything you\u0092ve been writing about.\u0094</p><p>Caden had warned her of that repeatedly, seemed gravely concerned about her safety. \u0093In what way? What does magic have to do with him?\u0094</p><p>At that moment, Caden planted his mouth on her neck, hand under the sweater, and whispered of his need. She shivered, her mind whirling and her body aching. But Duke\u0092s words demanded a few moments of attention before she lost herself in Caden\u0092s touch.</p><p>\u0093We\u0092re out of time. All I can say now is that Caden has been touched by magic and he\u0092s chosen you, and you alone, to provide a healing touch. He\u0092ll reject all others, I suspect.\u0094</p><p>The fact he\u0092d chosen her was both thrilling and surprising, but . . . \u0093Touched by magic? Cursed?\u0094</p><p>Sydney thought again of the book and all she\u0092d written and winced.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m certain that\u0092s how he sees it. By joining with you, he can convert the energy you generate together into something that heals him.\u0094</p><p>\u0093How do you know?\u0094 Sydney managed to gasp out as Caden gripped her hips and pressed into her, clearly ready for a night of sin. She wasn\u0092t at all immune to the idea.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve been through this. He needs you now. Please,\u0094 Duke cajoled. \u0093He\u0092s going to require everything you\u0092re willing to give. Just don\u0092t kiss him. It would be catastrophic.\u0094</p><p>\u0093To his health?\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s hands maneuvered up her belly, to the sweater and began lifting it. Sydney tried to wriggle away, but his grip was like iron. He wanted her. Now.</p><p>Duke nodded. \u0093And perhaps yours.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Does this have anything to do with the book?\u0094 Sydney hated to think she\u0092d done this to him. He\u0092d be furious and hate her\u0097and rightfully so.</p><p>Caden had apparently tired of talking. He tore Duke\u0092s sweater from her body and urged her down the hall. When she resisted, he scooped her up and carried her.</p><p>\u0093What the\u0097Caden!\u0094</p><p>With a grunt, he kept going.</p><p>\u0093Give him what he needs for as long as you can,\u0094 Duke called out.</p><p>\u0093I will!\u0094</p><p>Now her only questions were: How long would that be? And did she have everything necessary to heal him?</p><p>\u0093So what happens now?\u0094</p><p>Duke whirled toward the voice. Olivia. He hadn\u0092t heard her come in the door.</p><p>\u0093That was locked.\u0094 He frowned.</p><p>She shrugged. \u0093I\u0092ve been working on my simple magic. Locks are a breeze for me now.\u0094</p><p>Despite the tense situation, he smiled. \u0093Marrok always says you\u0092re mischievous. I see why. Is Sabelle coming for you?\u0094</p><p>A thud reverberated through the room, like something\u0097 or someone\u0097had hit the wall. Moments later, a murmur, a rip, then a sigh. Clearly, they weren\u0092t wasting any time. Duke winced.</p><p>\u0093Soon,\u0094 Olivia answered, flushing a pretty shade of pink. \u0093She\u0092s helping Bram elsewhere now. Marrok asked me to wait with you for a bit.\u0094</p><p>With a nod, Duke sat on the sofa. Olivia followed suit.</p><p>On the other side of the wall, sighs turned to moans.</p><p>He hesitated. \u0093I suppose you won\u0092t settle for the short version of upcoming events.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You know better.\u0094</p><p>Duke settled his elbows on his knees and peered over at the violet-eyed beauty. She was striking and soon would be a powerful witch once she went through Caden\u0092s current plight.</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s transitioning, and I suspect he\u0092s been fighting the need for some weeks, so he\u0092ll need a tremendous amount of energy. It\u0092s going to be long and difficult. And dangerous. It\u0092s made worse because he\u0092s fighting the urge to Call to her.\u0094</p><p>Olivia\u0092s eyes threatened to pop from her head. \u0093A human reporter? Has he completely lost it?\u0094</p><p>Her American expressions often amused Duke, but now wasn\u0092t the time. \u0093I\u0092ve warned him. I also placed a secret repelling spell over her mouth. It\u0092s not foolproof and won\u0092t hold for more than a few days, but it\u0092s all I can do for now. My biggest concern is whether she\u0092ll be strong enough to pull him through this transition.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It doesn\u0092t take a lot of physical strength for a female to have sex,\u0094 she pointed out.</p><p>\u0093Perhaps stamina is a better word.\u0094</p><p>Olivia frowned. \u0093How long will they be at this?\u0094</p><p>A loud feminine moan penetrated the walls, followed by a male voice muttering in encouraging tones.</p><p>Duke managed to hide his grimace. \u0093The average is two days.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But it can be longer?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes.\u0094 He scrubbed a hand over his face. Frightening the girl who had yet to undergo her own transition was something he wanted to avoid, but being dishonest benefitted no one. \u0093My transition came two years early. In my ignorance, I fought it. My parents knew little about magic, since mine came from my grandmother, who had long since disappeared. So when I transitioned, it was harsh, as I suspect Caden\u0092s will be.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And yours took longer?\u0094</p><p>Before he could answer, a thumping against the wall startled him. The sound echoed through Sydney\u0092s little living room once, twice, again, then settled into a rhythmic pace. Bloody hell.</p><p>\u0093Three days,\u0094 he confessed. It was one of the few times his body and magic had completely overridden his decorum. For those few days, no amount of sex had been enough, no act too wicked. He\u0092d rejected food, water, family.</p><p>\u0093The poor woman must have been exhausted after three days. I can see why you\u0092re worried for Sydney.\u0094</p><p>When Duke had transitioned, his emotions had not been engaged with a woman, as Caden\u0092s were. He\u0092d started with a woman he\u0092d been casually dating. When she fell into an exhausted sleep, he hadn\u0092t thought twice about opening the door to growl for another.</p><p>But he said nothing. Still, something on his face must have shown his discomfort.</p><p>\u0093More than one woman?\u0094 Olivia choked.</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u0093Four.\u0094 And the last had nearly had to be replaced.</p><p>A good thing, he thought in retrospect. At the end of every transition, each witch\u0092s or wizard\u0092s special power, unique to them, emerged\u0097without any warning when or what would manifest. When his special power had emerged, if the woman he\u0092d been with hadn\u0092t been mostly unconscious, she would have screamed in utter terror.</p><p>\u0093What happens if Sydney isn\u0092t strong enough to pull him through?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Let\u0092s hope for the best, shall we?\u0094</p><p>Olivia didn\u0092t look comforted. \u0093Are you trying to avoid telling me that he could die?\u0094</p><p>He patted her hand to reassure her. \u0093You will be better prepared. Bram will tell Marrok well in advance what\u0092s to come and how to behave. My family was not so lucky. Do not fear; your transition will come off splendidly.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not worried about me. Marrok will do everything in his power to get me through. But I\u0092m worried about Caden.</p><p>What if Sydney can\u0092t? Who will\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Replacing her doesn\u0092t seem to be an option. Caden is dangerously attached, and I can only hope we find some way to separate them before he cements the bond by issuing the Call or\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. Yes!\u0094 Sydney wailed on the other side of the wall.</p><p>\u0093We won\u0092t ever be able to part them,\u0094 Olivia finished.</p><p>\u0093He\u0092ll kill anyone who tries. A wizard will fight for his mate to the death.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But she\u0092s a reporter who could spill every one of our secrets. Caden says she\u0092s ambitious and plans to use her current job as a stepping stone to something big. Blowing the magickind story open is disaster for us. She already knows too much about the war and Mathias and\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Could make genocide of our kind a terrible reality. But the way he looks at her, I fear it won\u0092t be long after this transition before they form a mate bond.\u0094</p><p>She grimaced. \u0093Well, there must be something productive we can do while we wait. We need the Diary. Shouldn\u0092t we look for it while Sydney is . . . busy? If we find it, I\u0092ll be able to grab it and go.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Good thought. In the past you\u0092ve been able to feel its power. Do you sense it here?\u0094</p><p>With a scowl, Olivia rose and wandered around the little flat. \u0093I don\u0092t feel it in this room.\u0094 She meandered into the kitchen, the foyer, into every corner of the apartment on the near side of Sydney\u0092s bedroom door, then sighed. \u0093If it\u0092s in this flat, Sydney is keeping it in her bedroom. I can\u0092t feel the surge of the book\u0092s power unless it\u0092s close, and definitely not through the door.\u0094</p><p>Duke pinched the bridge of his nose. \u0093If you go into the bedroom to search while Caden is transitioning, he may perceive you as a threat.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And try to kill me. Spectacular.\u0094</p><p>He patted her shoulder. \u0093And if I let anything happen to you, Marrok would kill me. Why don\u0092t we return to the sofa and wait . . . and hope disaster isn\u0092t around the corner?\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caden rolled away from Sydney and immediately fell into a deep sleep. She cracked open an eye. The sun was setting. Again. She hadn\u0092t left this room in two days\u0097she\u0092d scarcely left the bed. Every muscle in her body ached beyond description. She\u0092d never questioned how many orgasms a woman could have in a day, but Sydney wondered idly if the Guinness people would be interested in chatting with her.</p><p>Joking aside, this time with Caden was no laughing matter. Besides his unusual affliction, her feelings for her sexy former photographer had grown each minute they shared. She\u0092d soothed his fear, and he\u0092d rewarded her with a treasure trove of sparking smiles and sumptuous touches. She still didn\u0092t understand this sex marathon and planned to question Duke about this \u0093curse\u0094 later. Now, she was too exhausted to care. She needed to use the toilet, eat, bathe, and sleep\u0097in that order. Unfortunately, she wasn\u0092t sure she was capable of moving a muscle.</p><p>At a soft knock on the door, she grabbed the sheet to cover her nakedness. Truth be told, she\u0092d been naked for nearly forty-eight hours. Even the sheet felt unnatural and abrasive against her. Caden\u0092s skin, however . . . she could get used to waking beside him every morning.</p><p>The knock sounded again, jarring her out of her reverie. She covered Caden\u0092s bare backside and murmured, \u0093Come in.\u0094</p> <p>Not surprising, Hurstgrove peeked inside her bedroom.</p><p>\u0093It got quiet. I thought I should check on you.\u0094</p><p>He looked nearly as tired as she. He wore the same clothes and needed a shave. He\u0092d stripped off his tie, unbuttoned his shirt at the collar and wrists, turned the cuffs back to reveal capable hands and strong forearms. He couldn\u0092t be comfortable snoozing on her small sofa, yet he, a real duke, was inquiring after her.</p><p>\u0093Tired,\u0094 she whispered. \u0093I need food and a bath, a few days\u0092 sleep, then I\u0092ll be fine.\u0094</p><p>Duke cast a sidelong glance at Caden. \u0093Has anything unusual happened yet?\u0094</p> <p>Besides shagging a caveman on aphrodisiacs and losing my heart?</p><p>\u0093If you don\u0092t count his incredible stamina as unusual, no.\u0094</p><p>He stepped in the room, regret shaping his features. \u0093He\u0092s not going to tire for some time.\u0094</p><p>Sydney hadn\u0092t needed Mr. Pedigree to tell her that. \u0093If anything, he\u0092s gaining momentum.\u0094</p><p>That was an understatement. The first night, Caden had made love to her every few hours. The following day, every other hour. Tonight, every hour on the hour. She could nearly set a watch by him. Currently, it was three forty-nine. Bugger.</p><p>\u0093If you can no longer cope, I wouldn\u0092t blame you. I can find a replacement\u0097\u0094</p> <p>\u0093No!\u0094 Vehemence rocketed through her body. Very obviously, Caden was no novice in the bedroom, but while she was with him, Sydney intended to be his only woman. \u0093I\u0092m not certain what\u0092s happening, but I won\u0092t have any other woman near him. I have very few minutes to see to my needs before Caden awakens. Give me a moment, will you?\u0094</p><p>Duke hesitated. \u0093Has he kissed you?\u0094</p><p>She stopped and sorted through the jumble of the last two days. \u0093No.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Or tasted you in any other way?\u0094</p><p>What did he mean? Oh. Oral sex. She flushed. \u0093He\u0092s been far too busy.\u0094</p><p>Relief crossed Duke\u0092s face. \u0093I hope this runs its course in the next few hours. If you\u0092re certain you don\u0092t want help\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No!\u0094 And never again if she could help it. \u0093If there\u0092s time before he awakens again, you\u0092re going to explain this to me in detail.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Agreed. I\u0092ll grab you some protein bars and water. You bathe. Quickly.\u0094 Duke cast a glance at Caden. \u0093He\u0092s stirring.\u0094</p> <p>Sydney peered at the man beside her. He rolled closer, an absent hand feeling its way for her side. If she wanted any creature comforts, now was the time.</p><p>Rising as quickly as her protesting muscles allowed, she grabbed her robe from the back of her door and ambled down the hall to her little bath. She ran a hot tub to soak away sore muscles and brushed her teeth. A moment later, Hurstgrove knocked, then brought in protein bars and an energy drink.</p><p>\u0093Where did you get this?\u0094</p><p>He paused. \u0093Olivia brought them by. I hope you don\u0092t mind.\u0094</p><p>At the moment, she could hug him. She was famished. Sydney didn\u0092t have a lot of weight on her bones anyway, and since she could scarcely remember her last meal, she figured that she had lost at least half a stone.</p><p>\u0093Wonderful. Thank you.\u0094</p><p>Conscious of the ticking clock, she shut the door in his face and locked it, shedding her dressing gown with one hand and tearing into the protein bar with the other. She scarfed the first one down. It was little better than coated cardboard, but she lunged for the second and grabbed the energy drink, chugging it down in less than a minute.</p><p>After a quick visit to the toilet, she sank into the hot bath, savoring her last few bites of the second protein bar. She noticed he\u0092d also brought a plastic container. When Sydney ripped into it, she practically inhaled the baby carrots and apple slices she found within.</p><p>Belly not exactly sated but no longer rumbling, she grabbed the shampoo and scrubbed her hair. Soap next. She attacked her body with it, scouring until her sensitive skin glowed.</p><p>A glance at the clock she kept on her counter told her it was three fifty-seven. Not much time before Caden awoke and demanded her body again. And she gave a bit more of her heart.</p><p>Feeling marginally revived, she rinsed and unplugged the drain, then reached for a towel. She never got it.</p><p>A thump at the door made her pause. \u0093Hurstgrove?\u0094</p><p>Not a word. Instead, another thump. A grunt. Then the slam of a body and the crash of the door striking the wall.</p><p>Caden filled the doorway, naked, magnificent. With hungry eyes and an erection only a blind woman could miss, Sydney had no doubt what he wanted.</p><p>Despite her exhaustion, her wobbly legs, and the tenderness in places she\u0092d never been sore before, she wanted him again. To touch him in this moment and know he was all hers. It was pure insanity, but pointless to deny.</p><p>He took a huge step into the little bathroom and grabbed her hand, hauling her out of the tub and into his arms. \u0093Sydney.\u0094</p><p>Her damp skin made contact with his hot, dry flesh, and she sizzled\u0097inside and out. What was it about this man? Intelligence, yes. Loads of it. Good looks, naturally. But she sensed his soldier\u0092s core of honor. Even when he\u0092d lied to her, he\u0092d done it for a good cause. He been uncomfortable with the subterfuge, which explained why she\u0092d seen through him. Despite his mission, he\u0092d done his best not to hurt her, even refusing the sex she\u0092d so blithely offered and he so clearly wanted. The fact he\u0092d endured this fever of heat and sex had likely been her fault. An aftereffect of writing in that blasted book.</p><p>To make matters worse, when this ailment of Caden\u0092s was over, he would likely resume life without her. He still had his brother\u0092s illness to deal with, and they no longer worked together. But at least she could enjoy the moment with Caden, savor every last touch. Yes, she was exhausted. But damned if she was going to let another woman finish what she\u0092d started.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m here for you,\u0094 she whispered in his ear.</p><p>The words set him in motion. He secured his hands under her arms and lifted her straight up, demonstrating incredible strength in his flexing forearms and biceps. Then he brought her against his body. Automatically, she curled her legs around his waist, her arms clinging to his shoulders. The tip of his penis probed her swollen folds.</p><p>He began to sink into her. Slowly at first, like honey drizzling across something warm and sugary. He eased his way in, grazing sensitive tissues as he filled her. Sydney gasped, digging her nails into his hard shoulders.</p><p>Finally, she sank down to the hilt, then he lifted her up, up until the tip of his erection was barely tucked inside her. She wriggled, trying to bring him inside again. He resisted.</p><p>Then he stepped forward and pushed down. Bam! The electric sensation jolted every nerve in her body. God, in this position, Caden felt enormous and more intent than the many times he had made love to her in the past two days. This time, there was something different about him, more concentrated, compelling, certain.</p><p>Another step and he lifted her, only to shove her down with his next stride. The amazing sensations ricocheted through her body again. After days of sex, she should be completely desensitized. Instead, she was more sensitive with each touch.</p><p>Once back in her room, Caden kicked her door shut and lowered her to the bed, still buried deep inside her. Then he grabbed the far side of the mattress and used the leverage to impale her with long, broad strokes.</p><p>\u0093Feel me,\u0094 he entreated with a growl.</p><p>How could she not? Oh. My. God. Pleasure soared in seconds under his unrelenting demand. Sydney thrust against him, feeling passion catch fire in her blood. In response, Caden wrapped one arm around her, grabbing her backside and canting her hips up to his even more. And on his next thrust\u0097she screamed.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s it,\u0094 he growled in her ear. \u0093So tight, so perfect.\u0094 Then he picked up the pace, going from frenzied to frantic. The bam, bam, bam of the headboard against the wall was like a chant in her ears. \u0093Damn it, it\u0092s near.\u0094</p><p>Orgasm? The answer didn\u0092t matter when pleasure began to overtake her. The burning ache that had been brewing deep in her womb raced in a hot flood to her clit. It built\u0097bigger than anything she had yet experienced. She clawed at him, bit his hard shoulder, felt her passage tighten on his erection. Which only ramped up the friction and sent her closer to the edge.</p><p>The bed shook, as did her body. Every nerve ending sat on the edge of a huge precipice. Suddenly, she was holding her breath, anticipating, needing. She lost her breath, the edges of her vision went dark.</p><p>And then it hit her, mowing her down in a burst of ecstasy and emotion, red-hot pleasure piercing her entire body. As a buzzing wound through her head and her vision tilted, a starburst of every feeling inside her seeped into her embrace. She rained kisses across Caden\u0092s shoulder, his neck. And knew that, even if he left her, she would belong to him forever.</p><p>The thought slammed her beleaguered brain just as Caden wrapped both arms around her as if she was his life jacket in a storm-tossed sea. His grunts became a shout of completion that made her ears ring as he pounded into her, one breath-stealing thrust after the other. As he did, Sydney felt the heat of his release inside her.</p><p>The shouts turned to sobs, and his body shuddered as he rolled onto his side, taking her with him, arching his back, his face wrenched up in pain.</p><p>\u0093Oh God! No! Oh my\u0097\u0094 Then he screamed.</p><p>When Sydney realized why, she followed suit at the top of her lungs.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u0093WHAT IN THE BLOODY HELL is going on here?\u0094 Sydney screeched as she leapt from the bed, clutching the sheet against her bare breasts.</p><p>Her voice brought Caden back from the blackness and through the fog. His thoughts swam through exhaustion and confusion. What was she screaming about?</p><p>\u0093Do you have a kinky twin fantasy?\u0094 she demanded.</p><p>What the devil? He frowned. \u0093No.\u0094</p><p>Her gaze bounced between him and some point in the room just beyond him. Her words rattled around in his head, but figuring them out wasn\u0092t nearly as appealing as a twelve-hour nap.</p><p>\u0093Really?\u0094 she demanded. \u0093When did he get here?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Who?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Him!\u0094 She pointed behind him.</p><p>With a sinking feeling that cut into his mellow haze, Caden looked over his shoulder. On the far side of the bed sat another man. It was like looking in a mirror. Except when Caden moved, his mirror image merely sent him a questioning stare.</p><p>A corporeal clone. Caden\u0092s heart stopped in his chest. Welcome to magickind.</p><p>\u0093Fuck!\u0094 he muttered. Creating another self explained the feeling of being torn in half.</p><p>\u0093Is this how you\u0092ve managed to shag me senseless these past few days? Did you two take turns popping in and out of my bedroom, snickering at me behind my back and high-fiving each other as you passed in the hall?\u0094</p><p>Ugly picture. But what else would she think? And how could he answer? He shook his head, straining for an explanation he could give, but his fuzzy thoughts would not cooperate.</p><p>What other explanation did he have? Gee, I transitioned into my magic and duplication is my unique power. Not only would that freak her out, but all the associated explanations he\u0092d owe her. . . . He winced. Still, he had to say something. She looked so scared, clutching that white sheet to her as if it would save her. Caden hated to hurt or frighten her more. Nor could he afford to give her more fodder for the paper.</p><p>\u0093Take a deep breath. Sit beside me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t want to sit! I want a bloody explanation now!\u0094</p><p>No doubt. But what? He looked over his shoulder again, and the other him shrugged.</p><p>\u0093She deserves that much.\u0094</p><p>Not only did he look like a real man, but was apparently capable of his own thoughts and speech. Brilliant. \u0093What are you, my bloody conscience? I know she deserves an explanation. Can you think of one that makes sense?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sydney gave you one . . . brother.\u0094</p><p>Conscience? More like the bloody devil on his shoulder.</p><p>Caden gritted his teeth. Fun. His mirror blithely said things he\u0092d contemplated himself, but then censored. The other him had yet to master that skill, it seemed.</p><p>\u0093Piss about if you like, but I\u0092m telling the truth.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I want the truth,\u0094 Sydney demanded.</p><p>Perhaps, but the truth was dangerous for him, for her, and for magickind.</p><p>He scowled at his clone. \u0093How do I make you go away?\u0094</p><p>The other him shrugged, then regarded Sydney. \u0093I\u0092m sorry, sweetheart. I know this is a shock.\u0094 He rose and wrapped the bed\u0092s little throw around his waist, approaching Sydney with the kind of caution one would when approaching a wounded lion. \u0093But no one meant to hurt you.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Ha! You probably laughed as you shared me, like it\u0092s some bloody joke.\u0094 Her posture screamed anger, but that vulnerable crack in her voice went straight to Caden\u0092s heart.</p><p>\u0093I promise,\u0094 Caden said. \u0093That isn\u0092t so.\u0094</p><p>The other him stepped closer and cupped Sydney\u0092s shoulder. The sight of any male hand on her, even a duplicate of his own, was an unwelcome sight.</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t touch her,\u0094 Caden warned with a growl.</p> <p>\u0093He\u0092s already had it all. Why be squeamish now?\u0094 she shot back tartly. Then she turned to the other him. \u0093Get your bloody hand off me.\u0094</p><p>Sydney clasped his wrist and shoved him away. When he tried to hold on, her fingernails raked his forearm, drawing blood. The clone hissed.</p><p>\u0093Ouch!\u0094 Caden looked down at his own wrist, and though he didn\u0092t see the scratch that appeared on his clone\u0092s skin, he felt the pain. Very odd.</p><p>She zipped her gaze over to him. \u0093I don\u0092t know what\u0092s going on here, you wanker. Wankers,\u0094 she corrected. \u0093Bloody circus. Explain or get the hell out.\u0094</p><p>Caden pressed his lips together, still minus a plausible explanation he was at liberty to divulge. Instead, he leaned closer and cupped her shoulder. \u0093It\u0092s . . . complicated.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093No, it\u0092s easy. You shared me with your twin, you bastard!\u0094 Sydney slapped him.</p><p>Face stinging, Caden reared back, wincing. He whirled, shocked to see an angry palm print on his clone\u0092s cheek that likely mirrored his own.</p><p>He felt his clone\u0092s pain, but did not sustain injury. The clone, however, suffered both. Confounding, but then, magic always was. Westin\u0092s death alone proved that.</p><p>\u0093Say something.\u0094 Tears began to seep from her eyes.</p><p>Nothing he said would make sense. Caden sighed. \u0093I\u0092m sorry.\u0094</p><p>Bloody lame answer, his clone sneered inside his head.</p> <p>Splendid. Now he could converse mentally with the unwanted prat.</p><p>She stomped her foot and grabbed a dressing gown littered on the floor near the bed. With angry movements, she thrust it on. \u0093Piss off\u0097both of you!\u0094</p><p>As she marched from the bedroom, Caden\u0092s mind reeled. Sydney would quickly find Duke, who was likely still loitering on Sydney\u0092s sofa, and say she saw two Cadens. News of his ability to clone would go straight to Bram, who would find a use for him in this bloody war. No, thank you.</p><p>Squeezing his eyes shut, he tried to remember everything he\u0092d learned of magic as a young boy. He\u0092d blocked out most, but bits, especially when Lucan had visited, returned.</p><p>Power and passion. Both were important in magic. A wizard had to have the magical ability to cast the spell they sought. Equally important was the desire for the outcome. In this case, he hoped that magic wouldn\u0092t be so cruel as to saddle him with a power he couldn\u0092t control. As much as he hated magic, he needed the clone gone.</p><p>Forearms straining with the tight clench of his fists, he focused on merging himself back into one essence, visualized his clone assimilating into his form. He heard a sucking noise, felt a slam against his back, followed by a pounding in his head. Bloody hell, every muscle hurt worse than before, and he felt slightly nauseous. But when he looked around, the blanket about his clone\u0092s waist was in a heap on the ground and the being was gone.</p><p>So was Sydney.</p><p>He stumbled into his pants and raced out of her bedroom, calling her name. To his relief, she hadn\u0092t gone far.</p> <p>Duke had caught her after no more than a few steps and blocked her from escaping down the shadowed hallway.</p><p>The other man looked up when Caden raced out of the bedroom. \u0093What the devil is going on here? She\u0092s babbling something about kinky twin tricks.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Exhaustion.\u0094 Caden said the first thing that came to his belabored brain.</p><p>He hated hurting Sydney or making her look foolish. When would this magical nightmare end? Now that he\u0092d transitioned, would it?</p><p>\u0093Liar!\u0094 She wrested free of Duke\u0092s grip and turned on him. \u0093I saw two of you.\u0094</p><p>Duke shot him an arch look.</p><p>Caden ignored him. \u0093Sweetheart, you\u0092ve had a busy time of it. We\u0092re both tired\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I may be tired after two days of shagging, but I\u0092m not daft.\u0094</p><p>Caden shook his head. \u0093Sydney, we should\u0097\u0094 Two days?</p><p>If he\u0092d been busy that long\u0097so had Out of This Realm.</p><p>\u0093Damn!\u0094 Caden turned to Sydney in horror, fearing the answer before he asked the question. \u0093Did you ring Holly and tell her to pull the story about the book?\u0094</p><p>Sydney blinked. \u0093No. Don\u0092t change the subject.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Fuck! It\u0092s Saturday?\u0094 Caden demanded of the other man.</p><p>\u0093Yes.\u0094</p><p>The latest edition of Out of This Realm had come out that morning.</p><p>\u0093Did the article print?\u0094 Duke asked with a wince.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m certain it did,\u0094 she snapped back. \u0093I\u0092m not saying another word until you explain your twin.\u0094</p><p>Duke repeated the curse as well, embellishing it with several creative accompaniments.</p><p>Wiping a hand across his tired face, Caden wondered what else could go wrong. He\u0092d already transitioned into magic he didn\u0092t want. Sydney had seen his clone and knew damn well she hadn\u0092t been hallucinating. He was exhausted and wanted to sleep for the next week. Instead, he had to deal with the fact the public\u0097including Mathias\u0097could now read about the Doomsday Diary.</p><p>\u0093What did the article say?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why were there two of you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn it, woman!\u0094 Duke thundered. \u0093Answer him. This is life or death.\u0094</p><p>Sydney looked like she wanted to argue, but Duke\u0092s face deterred her. \u0093I wrote that it\u0092s red and reputed to be the creation of Morganna le Fay. That it has the ability to grant people\u0092s . . . wishes.\u0094</p><p>A more than adequate description for Mathias to identify the diary. Caden renewed his F-bombs. Duke followed suit.</p><p>\u0093What? It\u0092s all true,\u0094 Sydney spat.</p><p>Bram would be furious. Sydney would be in danger. Things were going to hell fast. And he feared matters would only get worse.</p><p>He had to fix this or he\u0092d likely get eternal rest because either Bram or Mathias would put him six feet under. And the latter would make certain Sydney joined him.</p><p>\u0093Where is the book now?\u0094</p><p>Sydney narrowed her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest. \u0093Why?\u0094</p><p>Caden looked at Duke, who stared back. He knew exactly what the other man was thinking: How the bloody hell should they answer that?</p><p>\u0093Remember that curse I told you about?\u0094 Duke asked.</p><p>\u0093Yes?\u0094 She arched a brow.</p><p>\u0093No!\u0094 Caden stepped closer to her, his manner gentle. \u0093This isn\u0092t about a curse, but a madman who would do anything to obtain that book, even kill you.\u0094</p><p>With a step back and a considering frown, Sydney regarded him. \u0093How would you know this? From Scotland Yard, are you? What about that curse?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Nothing.\u0094 Caden risked another glance at Duke, who nodded almost imperceptibly. \u0093We\u0092ve simply had some experience with these affairs.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Madmen in general or ones after my book? The average person isn\u0092t going to believe the article. Likely, they\u0092ll all think I\u0092m mad. I know better. And why should I believe a word you say when you\u0092ve yet to explain my unexpected houseguest?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Dear God, spare me such a woman,\u0094 Duke muttered.</p><p>Caden and Sydney both shot him a glare, then he took her by the shoulders. \u0093I know you\u0092re angry and uncertain, but have I ever put your life in danger?\u0094</p><p>She hesitated. \u0093No.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Now is not the time to explain. Grab your book. We\u0092ll need to find Aquarius. She knows where it came from, how it came to be unprotected.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why would a book need protecting?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Do you think it\u0092s a normal book?\u0094 Caden shot back.</p><p>Sydney flushed. So she knew it wasn\u0092t. Had she written in it about him? She\u0092d said no when he had asked before, but now he wondered.</p><p>\u0093Go get it,\u0094 Duke barked. \u0093We\u0092re wasting time. Even now, we\u0092re in jeopardy.\u0094</p><p>Duke was right. Mathias could be breathing down their necks at any moment. He brought Sydney closer for a moment, terrified at the thought of the evil wizard after her. How much good would Duke and an exhausted, newly transitioned wizard do in fighting off an Anarki army? Highly unlikely that he\u0092d be able to conjure a duplicate on purpose. And damn it, he didn\u0092t want to use magic to fight. He\u0092d rather stick with the training he\u0092d received in the Marines.</p><p>Sydney broke his hold. \u0093Until you explain everything, I am not budging an inch.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Pick her up and throw her over your shoulder, or by God, I will,\u0094 Duke ordered.</p><p>As much as it pained him to force Sydney, it was for her own good. With a curse, he bent at the knees and hoisted her onto his shoulder in a fireman\u0092s carry, careful to keep her dressing gown over her pert little ass.</p><p>\u0093Put me down, you bloody bastard! I\u0092m going to string you up by your stones, then take a rusty knife to you.\u0094</p><p>Wincing, Caden turned to Duke. \u0093The book is on her night table. Grab it and put it in her hands.\u0094</p><p>With a sharp nod, Duke turned and disappeared. A moment later, he reappeared, holding the Doomsday Diary, then shoved it into Sydney\u0092s grasp.</p><p>They made their way toward her front door, Caden pinning Sydney\u0092s struggling form onto his shoulder, Duke following in silent solidarity. Sydney more than broke the silence with a string of wretched curses. He hated to hurt her, but better she be angry than dead.</p><p>Three feet from the door, someone on the other side banged. Adrenaline burst into his blood stream. Caden paused, clutching Sydney. Duke drew his wand.</p><p>\u0093Caden, are you bloody in there? If you\u0092re not dead, I\u0092ll kill you myself.\u0094</p><p>Bram. Shit!</p><p>Heaving a sigh, Duke swerved around him and wrested open the door. Sure enough, the Doomsday Brethren\u0092s leader stood on the other side, holding a newspaper in one hand. His other was clenched in a fist.</p><p>\u0093Does someone want to tell me what the devil is going on here?\u0094 His gaze bounced back and forth between Caden and Duke.</p><p>\u0093Who the blazes are you?\u0094 Sydney lifted her head and looked at Bram.</p><p>\u0093Bram Rion. I\u0092d say it\u0092s a pleasure, but you\u0092ve been nothing but a thorn in my side since you started writing about those bodies in the tunnel.\u0094 Clenching his teeth, he slapped the newspaper on a nearby table and tore his attention away from Sydney to glare at Caden. \u0093One small mission. Keep her quiet. And you failed miserably.\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s just transitioned,\u0094 Duke cut in.</p><p>\u0093Transitioned?\u0094 Sydney asked.</p><p>No one answered. Bram hesitated, cast another glance at Caden, then nodded before turning back to Duke. \u0093Why did you stay all this time?\u0094</p><p>Duke set his jaw. \u0093Babysitting hasn\u0092t been fun. I still need Marrok\u0092s training\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Exactly.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I have no doubt other crises have erupted in the past two days. It\u0092s been damn difficult to hold my impatience while nature took its course. But if she\u0092d been unable to finish the task . . .\u0094</p><p>Bram nodded in resignation.</p><p>\u0093What are you blathering about?\u0094 Sydney wriggled and screamed until Caden let her down\u0097right in the middle of the three. But she didn\u0092t back down. Not his Sydney.</p><p>For a foolish moment, Caden was actually proud of his little firecracker. Even in the face of three large men and an incredibly bizarre situation, she didn\u0092t cower or stop asking questions.</p><p>\u0093Later,\u0094 he said. \u0093We have to get out of here now.\u0094</p><p>Sydney crossed her arms over her chest and shook her head. \u0093You\u0092ve promised answers. I\u0092ve yet to receive them. I refuse to leave until I do. And the next one who tries to lift me over their shoulder will lose an arm.\u0094</p><p>\u0093We\u0092ve no time for this.\u0094 Bram cursed. \u0093You\u0092re inexorably in the thick of things, so I\u0092m going to give you the condensed version and trust that you want to save your own backside enough to keep quiet. There is a magickind, the three of us are all wizards, and every bloody one of those stories you\u0092ve been writing has put us in danger. We don\u0092t need exposure to humans so they can unleash a witch hunt. Nor do you want Mathias coming after you. But that\u0092s exactly what will happen now that you were stupid enough to write this.\u0094 Bram held the paper up again. \u0093As if that isn\u0092t enough, you shared a byline in another story with Mathias\u0092s second in command.\u0094 At her incredulous gasp, he went on. \u0093Zain is loyal to the very villain you\u0092ve reviled. Didn\u0092t tell you that, did he?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Zain?\u0094 Caden whirled on Sydney. \u0093Zain Denzell?\u0094</p><p>Slowly, Sydney nodded. \u0093Holly hired him as your replacement. He said he had photos of the magical war, information . . .\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll bet he did.\u0094 The thought of Zain anywhere near Sydney froze Caden\u0092s blood.</p><p>\u0093No doubt he also had nefarious plans for you,\u0094 Bram interjected. \u0093I understand that Mathias repeatedly raped your source for these articles. If he finds you, he\u0092ll do the same to you. Then kill you for the sport of it. When you were writing this, did you wonder if any of it was real? It is. Welcome to the war, cupcake.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Piss off!\u0094 Caden demanded. \u0093She didn\u0092t know.\u0094</p><p>Bram grunted, but thankfully shut up.</p><p>Bloody hell. Reeling with a mixture of fatigue and shock, Caden thrust out an arm to steady himself. Holly had hired Zain as his replacement? And Bram telling Sydney virtually everything?</p><p>\u0093Congratulations. You\u0092ve just put her in even more danger,\u0094 Caden spat.</p><p>Bram raised a pale brow. \u0093Don\u0092t start. All you had to do was shut her up and get the book before every bloody Out of This Realm reader discovered our secrets and magickind\u0092s greatest weapon. You failed.\u0094</p><p>Caden reared back. He\u0092d done his best to help. He knew it had been inadequate. But he had tried. Bram\u0092s disdain felt like a slap in the face.</p><p>\u0093Let\u0092s cease this ridiculous sparring and get out of here before Mathias looks up your girlfriend and fries us all,\u0094 Duke suggested, his voice on edge.</p><p>His admonishment broke the tension between Bram and Caden. Sydney didn\u0092t catch on\u0097or didn\u0092t want to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093This is really real? I\u0092d wondered. Believed. But . . . magickind and Mathias and this book, it\u0092s all connected and not a by-product of a tortured woman\u0092s mind?\u0094</p><p>Bram rolled his eyes. \u0093Someone get the girl a prize.\u0094</p><p>Sydney stared at Bram. \u0093Prove it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093As soon as we\u0092re no longer sitting here like targets at a practice range, certainly.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Don\u0092t patronize her,\u0094 Caden growled. \u0093She\u0092s had three minutes to adjust to magickind. You\u0092ve had four hundred years.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Four hundred!\u0094 Sydney\u0092s jaw dropped.</p><p>Everyone ignored her.</p><p>Frustration pouring off him, Bram cocked his head, pulling at tense muscles in his shoulders. \u0093Bugger off. I\u0092m only three hundred ninety-eight. And Duke is right; we need to get out of here. I\u0092ll yell at you once we\u0092re safe.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not leaving,\u0094 Sydney protested. \u0093It\u0092s my book and my flat and my article. I\u0092m not going anywhere without answers.\u0094</p> <p>Duke rolled his eyes. \u0093You\u0092re certain about this one? Seems more trouble than she\u0092s worth.\u0094</p><p>Caden pulled Sydney against him. \u0093I won\u0092t leave her here.\u0094</p><p>\u0093God, no. She\u0092ll be dead by noon if you do\u0097after she\u0092s told Mathias all she knows.\u0094 Bram elbowed Caden aside and grabbed Sydney\u0092s wrist. \u0093If you want to live, come with us.\u0094</p><p>Sydney hesitated, then looked back at Caden.</p><p>\u0093Please,\u0094 he cajoled, extricating her from Bram\u0092s grip. \u0093If you\u0092ve ever believed a single word I\u0092ve said, believe that I would die if Mathias hurt you. And he will, given the chance.\u0094</p><p>She bit her lower lip, then nodded. \u0093All right.\u0094</p> <p>Caden exhaled the tense breath he\u0092d been holding. It would be all right. She would be all right. Whatever else happened, he\u0092d have the assurance of knowing she was safe from the clutches of a madman who would use her in the cruelest way possible until she broke, then discard her without a backward glance.</p><p>\u0093Thank you.\u0094 He enfolded her against his chest, resisting the urge to press his mouth to hers. Need burned him like a fever, and the words of the Call were echoing in his brain. Instead, he buried his face in that fiery mane of hers and resisted\u0097barely.</p><p>\u0093Enough. Let\u0092s go,\u0094 Bram said.</p><p>Collectively, they turned for the door and Sydney found a familiar elfin-looking flower child standing there, crying.</p><p>\u0093Aquarius!\u0094 Sydney broke free from Caden\u0092s hold and ran for her friend.</p><p>The other woman welcomed Sydney, then clutched her as if in pain.</p><p>\u0093Poppet, what\u0092s the matter?\u0094</p><p>Bram lifted Sydney away from Aquarius and grabbed the other woman, who reared back with watery eyes.</p> <p>\u0093Mellow,\u0094 she suggested. \u0093Your aura is full of anger and\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t give a bloody damn.\u0094 Bram grabbed the book from Sydney\u0092s hand, then barked at Aquarius, \u0093Who gave this to you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t say.\u0094</p><p>Bram clenched his teeth and fists. \u0093Is this the day for difficult females?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Bring her with us,\u0094 Duke suggested. \u0093Question her later, but we\u0092re burning daylight.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed.\u0094 He grabbed Aquarius by the wrist. \u0093Come along.\u0094</p><p>Aquarius wriggled free. \u0093Forcing me . . . bad karma.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve had a run of it lately. A bit more won\u0092t matter.\u0094 Bram shoved her toward the door again.</p><p>The small woman planted her heels. \u0093I came to see Sydney.\u0094 She cast fearful green eyes at the other woman. \u0093My cousin, have you seen her?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094 Sydney tensed.</p><p>Aquarius gulped. \u0093I popped out earlier. When I returned she was gone. I hoped perhaps she\u0092d come here.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s heart stopped. Gone?</p><p>\u0093Was she your source?\u0094 Caden demanded.</p><p>Sydney hesitated, and he could practically hear her thoughts churning until she finally nodded.</p><p>Caden leapt to life and grabbed Aquarius by the shoulders. \u0093What is your cousin\u0092s name?\u0094</p><p>The little brunette pressed her lips together in a silent protest.</p><p>\u0093Please!\u0094 Caden implored. \u0093I think\u0097I\u0092m almost certain she\u0092s my brother\u0092s missing wife.\u0094</p><p>God, it finally felt good to ask a direct question. Now that Bram had spilled the truth, he no longer had to think of an angle that wouldn\u0092t arouse suspicion or give away magickind\u0092s existence.</p><p>At his side, Sydney gasped. He looked her way, not sure what reaction he might find. The compassion softening her face hit him in the chest. Seeing that side of her now, when he needed it, only added to his need to keep her by his side.</p><p>Aquarius cocked her head. \u0093If she\u0092s your brother\u0092s wife, what is her name?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Anka. Anka MacTavish. Please.\u0094</p><p>Tearing up, Aquarius nodded. \u0093She couldn\u0092t recall her last name. We hadn\u0092t seen each other since childhood. A few weeks ago, she came to me near death, shortly after\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mathias raped her.\u0094</p><p>Dread swelled inside him. He\u0092d never met Anka, but felt terrible for all she\u0092d endured, and what that knowledge would do to Lucan, if he lived. Knowing that she was alone again, where Mathias might find her. . . . He shuddered. Why had she left relative safety?</p><p>Aquarius nodded. Sydney enfolded her friend in her arms. Fresh tears ensued. \u0093It was awful. Took her over a week to heal enough to stand. She could remember little beyond her first name and girlhood memories. That\u0092s why she came to me. That, and the fact Mathias has no idea I exist.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Any chance she\u0092ll return?\u0094 Caden grilled.</p><p>\u0093Not certain. She\u0092s never left alone before. Too frightened. But I think she left of her own free will. Nothing in my flat was disturbed. The air didn\u0092t feel violent or scary. Lately, she\u0092s been having dreams of a happier past. I offered to help her find the parts of her she\u0092d lost, but she was afraid of Mathias harming me and the loved ones she\u0092d left behind.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She left no note?\u0094 Caden asked.</p><p>Aquarius eased back from Sydney\u0092s embrace and shook her head. \u0093She communicated most with Sydney, as if telling her everything was cathartic.\u0094 The petite woman clung to Sydney\u0092s hands. \u0093Though she never told you her name, you helped her merely by listening.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s stomach plummeted and he tasted the bile of fear and failure as he stared at the ceiling. Dear God, to have come so close to Anka only to lose her again. Then there was the fact he\u0092d failed Lucan and everyone else.</p><p>\u0093How long has she been gone?\u0094 he asked Aquarius. \u0093An hour? Two?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No more than that,\u0094 she assured. \u0093She\u0092s weak and hurting, so she can\u0092t have gone far. I don\u0092t know why she\u0092d leave.\u0094</p><p>Bitter disappointment pounded into Caden. So bloody close. He\u0092d known, known, Sydney\u0092s source of information was Anka. And he hadn\u0092t been able to reach her fast enough, build trust with Sydney. He\u0092d been too fixated on fighting his feelings for his little firecracker reporter. Then too consumed by his transition. If they didn\u0092t find Anka soon, she and Lucan would pay the price.</p><p>\u0093She can go far, very quickly.\u0094 A fact Caden mourned, even as he spoke the words.</p><p>\u0093A pop here, a pop there.\u0094 Duke sighed. \u0093With proper energy, she could have teleported to India by now.\u0094</p><p>Or she could have already been captured by Mathias, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u0093Teleported?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Later,\u0094 Bram growled.</p><p>Sydney turned back to Caden. \u0093You were trying to save her all this time?\u0094</p><p>Caden turned to her. \u0093Yes. I told you all I could. I know I gave you no reason to believe me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry.\u0094 Her voice shook. \u0093I\u0092m so sorry. Lucan must be beside himself.\u0094</p><p>An understatement. Caden raked a tired hand across his face. There was no time to rest now. He had to keep moving forward and hope they found Anka before her trail went cold.</p><p>He squeezed Sydney\u0092s hand, and turned to Anka. \u0093Did she leave anything behind?\u0094</p><p>\u0093She brought nothing with her. The clothes on her back were bloodied shreds. I burned them.\u0094</p><p>Duke clapped him on the back, startling Caden. \u0093We\u0092ll find her. We\u0092ll all help. I know what this means to you. But now we must go.\u0094</p><p>The other wizard\u0092s words moved him. Perhaps he was overwrought and exhausted from the past two days, but Duke had stayed by his side, no matter what. Like one of his platoon buddies would have.</p><p>\u0093Agreed,\u0094 Bram said to the group. \u0093Mathias is many things, but not stupid. It won\u0092t take him long to track you down, Sydney. And then\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093And then, we\u0092ll take the Doomsday Diary and kill her,\u0094 said a frighteningly familiar voice.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>AQUARIUS GASPED. SYDNEY AND the men whirled, and her eyes opened wide when she spotted a familiar man and a dozen vicious berobed figures behind him. \u0093Zain!\u0094</p><p>Before Sydney could process why he was standing at her doorstep with a bunch of blokes in robes behind him, their faces in shadow, he reached through the crowd and grabbed her hair. With a firm fist, Zain yanked her back against his front, positioning her like a human shield. He was wiry and deceptively strong. She struggled, fighting both the hold and the sudden pain. In mere seconds, he wrapped his other hand around her throat and squeezed.</p><p>\u0093Let her go!\u0094 Caden demanded, lunging for her, fury carved into his face.</p><p>Constricting her throat, Zain dragged her out of Caden\u0092s reach and surrounded himself with the cluster of hooded figures he\u0092d arrived with. The pressure on her windpipe raked her with panic and her eyes stung with tears. Sydney wished like the devil that she\u0092d been more cautious when Caden had warned her of the danger.</p><p>Zain clutched her throat tighter, burying his face in her neck. He inhaled long and loud. Then he growled, the sound ripe with disgust.</p><p>\u0093You smell like him.\u0094 He tossed his head at Caden. \u0093Every pore. Everywhere. The stench of integrity.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What the hell do you want?\u0094 Bram demanded.</p><p>\u0093As if you have no notion.\u0094 Zain\u0092s laugh was humorless. \u0093Give me that book you\u0092re holding, or the bitch dies.\u0094</p><p>Sydney went cold. What would Zain do to her? At the office she\u0092d gotten an odd vibe from him, but was he a killer? Apparently so, given his implacable voice and cruel grip. Why would he kill her for a little journal that granted sexual fantasies?</p><p>Or was the book capable of more?</p><p>\u0093Seriously evil aura,\u0094 Aquarius murmured to Caden.</p><p>Ignoring the flower child, he reached for Sydney, fear for her in his fierce expression. His efforts to save her went straight to her heart, even as she worried Zain would hurt him, as well. Sydney wheezed, gasped for air. She flailed, feeling as if he would crush her throat and kill her at any moment.</p><p>Barreling past two of the freaks in robes, Caden charged to her rescue, elbowing one in the temple, punching the other in the nose. They crashed to the ground in a heap. Caden stepped over them and lunged for her. Bram and Duke were right behind him, felling more of what must be Anarki.</p><p>With a curse, Zain flicked his wrist and opened his free hand. Caden slammed into an invisible wall between them. Again he tried, and again, he crashed against it.</p><p>How the devil had Zain done that?</p><p>Bram flicked a wrist and a burst of light headed toward Zain\u0097before stopping abruptly. Sydney blinked twice. Definitely magic.</p><p>She\u0092d been right all these years. The paranormal existed! Now she had to stay alive long enough to write about it.</p><p>\u0093Oh, you can block magic now. Been learning parlor tricks from Mathias?\u0094 Bram taunted.</p><p>Zain tensed. \u0093I\u0092m learning from a master. And learning well.\u0094</p><p>Caden roared, trying to shove his way past the force field once more, his face mottled red with rage. His blue eyes drilled into Zain\u0092s, vowing retribution.</p><p>\u0093Let her go!\u0094 Caden insisted. \u0093She knows nothing.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She wrote the article. Your master is holding the book in his hand,\u0094 he said, then turned to Bram. \u0093It\u0092s a simple transaction: the book for the girl.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Give it to him,\u0094 Caden barked at Bram.</p><p>The blond wizard shot him a long-suffering expression that demanded he be reasonable. \u0093Zain may have trained up a bit, but he\u0092s a snot-nosed tot compared to me, inferior in both bloodline and ability. Isn\u0092t that right?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I know the newly transitioned whelp is two seconds from losing his shag if you don\u0092t cooperate.\u0094 Zain squeezed her neck a fraction tighter, and she choked, clawing for air. \u0093Did you know I have the ability to heat a human up from the inside, boil their blood, cook their organs? I\u0092m a human microwave oven.\u0094</p><p>Sydney would have gasped, if she had the air. Unwelcome gray danced at the edge of her vision. She didn\u0092t know if Zain could follow through on such a threat, but that death sounded too horrific to tempt fate. Caden looked somewhere between panicked and nuclear. And Bram was dangling the damn book just beyond Zain\u0092s reach.</p><p>\u0093There\u0092s something to be proud of,\u0094 Bram quipped.</p><p>Finally, clawing at his skin, Sydney managed to loosen Zain\u0092s grip on her a fraction. She gasped in a huge breath, then rasped at Bram, \u0093Shut up! It\u0092s my book. Bloody give it to him.\u0094</p><p>Zain loosed his grip a bit more. \u0093Good girl.\u0094</p><p>Bram rolled his eyes. \u0093Sorry. If he wants it, he\u0092s going to have to fight me first. If he\u0092s stupid enough to try to kill you, I\u0092ll take the book, disappear forever, and his boss will flay him alive for failing. Again. So, are you feeling stupid?\u0094 he asked Zain.</p><p>\u0093You holier-than-thou fuck!\u0094 Zain snarled. \u0093If you leave here with the book, you\u0092ll disappear forever, no matter what I do. If I kill Little Red, however, the younger MacTavish could turn completely mental, like the elder, which reduces the able ranks of your Doomsday Brethren even more. You\u0092re the stupid one. You have three warriors, one of them unable to fight after I kill Red, and I\u0092ve got ten Anarki remaining. Do you really think you can defeat us?\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s confidence didn\u0092t slip an inch. Sydney began to suspect he was off his trolley. Zain had a very good point; they were totally outnumbered. The fact Zain was talking about her death as if it was a fait accompli hardly comforted her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093For God\u0092s sake, give him the bloody book!\u0094 she snapped at Bram.</p><p>He merely raised a superior golden brow at her. Duke\u0092s expression was no less assured. Were they utterly mad?</p><p>Now that she could breathe, Sydney stomped her foot on Zain\u0092s instep at the same time she rammed her elbow into his abdomen, grateful for the self-defense class she\u0092d taken last year. Zain grunted in pain. In the ensuing moment of surprise, she darted away and ran toward Bram, hand outstretched for the book.</p><p>The wizard held it away from her, then shot Caden a glare. \u0093Control your woman or I will.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093You\u0092ll pay, bitch!\u0094 Zain shouted as he worked to stand upright and charged Bram.</p><p>As Caden restrained her, Sydney railed at him. But something inside her savored his touch. His arm around her, holding her close, breath in her ear, made her feel alive. Safe.</p><p>Quickly, he shoved her behind him. The blond wizard tossed the book at Duke, who caught it in an efficient grab. Before she could blink, Bram waved his hand. Something that looked like a magic wand appeared.</p><p>A wand, seriously? How Harry Potter.</p><p>Sydney had barely completed the thought when Bram brandished the wooden stick, jolting Zain with a burst of energy that hit him like a live wire, making the other man jerk and sizzle. Some of his minions rushed toward Bram and Duke, wands suddenly in some upraised hands. The others . . . Oh, God! Now that they stepped into the light, she saw they were little more than skeletons with rotting flesh dripping from gray bones, staring out from under their hoods. Their eyes promised pain.</p> <p>\u0093Retreat!\u0094 Bram demanded, waving his wand with an efficient flourish that made two of the robed figures crumple into unconscious heaps next to those Caden had subdued earlier.</p><p>Someone dragged Sydney close with an arm about her waist while Caden clung to her. She screamed until she turned and saw that the second arm belonged to Duke. Bram reached out for Aquarius, who\u0092d been watching in wide-eyed, uncharacteristic silence.</p><p>Before Bram could secure Aquarius against his side, one of the mutants in robes grabbed the little woman and tossed her in Zain\u0092s direction, waves of her light brown hair streaming behind her like a flag. She shrieked, the terrified sound making the hair on the back of Sydney\u0092s neck stand up.</p><p>\u0093No one is leaving!\u0094 Zain insisted as Aquarius landed against him.</p><p>He absorbed her smaller body with a grunt, then trapped her in his arms, gripping her below the breasts. Aquarius jerked, gasped, green eyes popping wide. Suddenly, she loosed a bloodcurdling scream. A moment later, her face turned red, then purple, then swelled into something terrible.</p><p>Sydney wriggled against the arms holding her back, struggling to reach her friend. Between Caden and Duke, their grips were unyielding.</p> <p>\u0093Do something. Save her!\u0094 Sydney screeched.</p><p>As her words pinged off the walls, Aquarius\u0092s eyes rolled into the back of her head and she fell limp in Zain\u0092s arms, her entire body bloated, skin blistered. Was she even breathing?</p><p>\u0093No!\u0094 Sydney flailed and cursed, redoubling her efforts to get free.</p><p>Neither man budged an inch.</p><p>Retaining his grip on her, Caden kicked one of the corpse-like attackers, delivering some martial arts trick that snapped the minion\u0092s spine in half. Blood spurted everywhere. Black blood, just like Chloe had described. Sydney gaped on in horror.</p><p>\u0093Humans converted to magical zombies, just like the dead soldiers in the tunnel. Oh. My. God,\u0094 she whispered.</p><p>\u0093Yes, Anarki. Conscripted men minus a soul.\u0094 Caden kicked another half-dead creature who tried to sneak up on Bram. Again, the body broke apart and bled black as he collapsed.</p><p>Bram, who had been fighting off the others in robes, rushed to her side again. All around was a pile of unconscious Mathias followers, some rotting, some not, littering the ground. Now, only Zain and two of his robed peers stood.</p> <p>\u0093Put the girl down,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093Call off what\u0092s left of your lackeys. They\u0092re no match. Let\u0092s fight this fairly, you and I.\u0094</p><p>Zain scoffed. \u0093I don\u0092t give two fucks about fighting fairly. The girl is alive.\u0094 He jostled Aquarius in his grip, and she bounced like a rag doll, making Sydney cry out. \u0093But only just. Give me the book and I\u0092ll let her live. If not . . .\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s heart nearly stopped.</p><p>\u0093Give it to him!\u0094 she screamed at Bram.</p><p>Bram huffed, rolled his eyes. He wasn\u0092t budging.</p><p>The book must be more powerful than Aquarius had indicated. In her head, she knew that putting it in Zain\u0092s hands would be as good as putting it into Mathias\u0092s, but her friend . . . if Bram didn\u0092t comply, Zain would kill her.</p><p>To her surprise, he eased the book toward Zain, who reached for it while retaining his hold on Aquarius. Sydney cast an anxious glance at her friend. God, she looks so still, so dead. Sydney held in a cry.</p><p>At the last second, Bram pulled the book back into his protective clutch and slung the tip of his wand toward Aquarius. The little woman was suddenly caught up in a sweep of wind, like a giant vacuum that sucked her toward Bram.</p><p>But Zain was having none of that. He brandished his wand at Aquarius, too, and her body jolted as she stopped, jerking in midair. She keened, the sound rife with pain.</p><p>Around her, Duke dispatched the final two Anarki with a pair of spells, both normal looking men who clutched wands in their frozen fists.</p><p>\u0093Your Anarki are all unconscious. You\u0092re alone,\u0094 Bram pointed out. \u0093Give up or fight me.\u0094</p><p>Suddenly, he shoved the book into Sydney\u0092s hand. Startled, she grasped it. Her eyes met Bram\u0092s blue ones, sharp with warning. Do not give it to Zain. He\u0092d described it as a weapon of some sort, but what about Aquarius?</p><p>Zain paused, looking uncertain for the first time. Bram took advantage of the opening and lunged, hooking one arm around the other man. With his free hand, he grabbed Aquarius.</p><p>\u0093Go!\u0094 he shouted at Duke.</p><p>Instantly, Duke\u0092s arm tightened around Sydney. A sense of falling assailed her. Like being in a dark, endless well. She thrashed about, looking for escape, but Duke and Caden both held her tight. She squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>Long moments later, the sensation stopped. Cautiously, Sydney opened her eyes to a stunning office, filled with weak afternoon sunlight, pricy artwork\u0097and a roomful of men so menacing, she took a step back.</p><p>\u0093Who the hell are these people, where am I, and how did I get here?\u0094</p><p>\u0093The Doomsday Brethren,\u0094 Caden whispered in her ear.</p><p>Truly? \u0093Anka has spoken of them. Only a bit, but . . .\u0094 She hadn\u0092t been sure of their role earlier, but now? These imposing wizards fought on the side of right.</p><p>\u0093I teleported you here,\u0094 Duke said quietly. \u0093This is Bram\u0092s office.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Good. How am I getting home?\u0094 She put a hand on her hip.</p><p>The blokes all looked at one another, then Caden sighed. \u0093We\u0092ll work it out.\u0094</p><p>Oh. She got the feeling that her concept of home had just changed. If the Anarki knew where she lived and believed that she had possession of a magic book . . . no \u0093if \u0093 anymore, really. There was danger, just as Caden had said. She\u0092d landed in the middle of it. Caden had tried to talk her out of running the story on the book. Though he\u0092d given her no substantial reasons, she wished she\u0092d listened. But now that danger wasn\u0092t imminent, her inner journalist was thrilled to be embroiled in the paranormal.</p><p>Her next story for Out of This Realm would turn heads and win awards!</p><p>First, she had to help Aquarius and get the information she needed, then make haste to somewhere safe. Then perhaps once the article printed and she brought forth proof this magickind existed, her parents would have to look outside their academic box and take her seriously. Dare she even hope they\u0092d be proud for bringing in a story no other journalist had?</p><p>Holding Zain in one arm, Bram appeared a few meters away and dropped the unconscious wizard on the ground. In the other arm, he held her friend cradled against his chest, the little woman so heartbreakingly still.</p><p>\u0093Aquarius!\u0094 She dashed for her friend.</p><p>As soon as she drew close, the big blond wizard snatched the red diary from her hands.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s mine!\u0094 she protested.</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094 Bram\u0092s tone didn\u0092t invite argument. \u0093It was stolen from us. Thank you for returning it. We will keep it safe.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093After what you saw today, do you honestly believe you can defend yourself against the kind of garbage who will hunt you for this?\u0094 He held up the journal.</p><p>The wizard had a point. She might be able to fend off a normal man, but Zain wasn\u0092t normal. None of the wizards she\u0092d seen today were, Caden included.</p><p>She had been making love with someone magical. Oh. My. God.</p><p>As if the thought had conjured him by her side, Caden took her by the hand and led her to a love seat. \u0093Let him have it, firecracker. Please.\u0094</p><p>What would she do with it? Coerce Caden into bed again? Be a target for Mathias? Sydney nodded.</p><p>Bram accepted with a smile, then nodded to all the men in the room. \u0093You\u0092re all here. Excellent.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Waiting for news of the book,\u0094 said another, a big bloke with a goatee, a sword at his side, and the look of a battle-hardened warrior. \u0093Thank God you recaptured it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed.\u0094 Then he stuck his head out the door and yelled, \u0093Sabelle!\u0094</p><p>A moment later, a breathtaking blonde appeared\u0097literally out of nowhere\u0097looking tired and disheveled.</p><p>Bram narrowed his eyes. \u0093Where have you been?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Nowhere you\u0092d disapprove of, big brother. Merely helping Lucan.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s brother? Bram\u0092s sister knew him?</p><p>\u0093You had assistance, yes?\u0094 Bram prompted.</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 Sabelle assured.</p><p>\u0093Did he take your energy?\u0094 Caden asked, sounding choked and desperate.</p><p>Sydney\u0092s heart went out to him. Then she realized . . . Zain had been telling the truth about Caden\u0092s magical people shagging to rev themselves up. Which explained a lot about his stamina with her. And why his brother was bedding Bram\u0092s sister. His wife was the missing Anka.</p><p>\u0093Some. He\u0092s a bit stronger than the last time you saw him. I\u0092m trying.\u0094 Sabelle laid a soft hand on Caden\u0092s forearm.</p><p>Sydney didn\u0092t like the gorgeous woman touching him. At all.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she said, \u0093Could someone explain to me how we\u0092re going to help Aquarius?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Aquarius?\u0094 Sabelle asked. \u0093Sydney\u0092s friend.\u0094 Bram held up the limp figure in his arms.</p><p>She wanted to cry. They desperately needed to get Aquarius some medical care, or . . . no, she wouldn\u0092t think the worst.</p><p>Suddenly, Bram handed the book back to her. Sydney stared at him as she took it cautiously. Was he mad? Hadn\u0092t Caden just pleaded with her to let Bram keep it?</p><p>\u0093Give this to my sister.\u0094 His tone didn\u0092t invite argument.</p><p>She held the little book to her chest. \u0093You just told me I couldn\u0092t handle it, now you give it back, then ask me to hand it to another woman who doesn\u0092t look equipped for battle either?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Do. It,\u0094 he ordered through clenched teeth. \u0093The book must pass from female to female. The sooner you cooperate, the sooner we can focus on helping your friend.\u0094</p><p>If she didn\u0092t, would they withhold care? Sydney didn\u0092t want to learn the answer the hard way. Not understanding Bram\u0092s female-to-female comment, Sydney glared at the beautiful woman and slapped the book into her hands.</p><p>Sabelle gripped it tightly. \u0093I will guard it with my life.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hopefully, that will not be necessary,\u0094 Bram said grimly. \u0093Just hide it until I\u0092m free. For now, call for Aunt Millie. Have her meet you upstairs.\u0094</p><p>Bram glanced at Zain on the floor, then kicked him aside. When he stepped away, Sydney could see another big bloke on the sofa, shrouded in sunglasses, leather, and bad attitude.</p><p>\u0093Shock.\u0094 Bram sounded almost surprised to see him. \u0093You\u0092ve returned, then?\u0094</p><p>What kind of name is that?</p><p>\u0093As of a few minutes ago. I have news.\u0094 The man took up the whole sofa.</p><p>Bram nodded. \u0093Good. Will you take the injured woman upstairs? Ice, take Zain to our lovely barred accommodations below. And filch his wand.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t we just kill him?\u0094 asked a menacing figure with hair trimmed nearly to his skull.</p><p>Shock growled in response. Bram raised a hand. \u0093No, Ice, we can\u0092t. He has useful information.\u0094</p><p>With a sigh, Ice picked the unconscious Zain up as if he was holding a big pile of refuse, slammed the body over his shoulder, then disappeared.</p><p>The big man on the couch finally rose to his feet. Holy cow! Shock was enormous, easily topping every other man in the room, except perhaps the one with the goatee and sword. Gingerly, he took Aquarius in his arms. He dwarfed Sydney\u0092s friend, but his gentle grip reassured her. The man\u0092s gravelly voice didn\u0092t.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll do your bidding this once, but kick Zain again, and I\u0092ll cut off your bloody stones.\u0094</p><p>Sydney didn\u0092t care how big and bad Shock was. If he was going to defend Zain, he was going to hear from her. \u0093Zain nearly murdered my best friend. A swift kick is the very least he deserves.\u0094</p><p>Shock whipped his head around to face her. She couldn\u0092t see his eyes behind the dark sunglasses, but she had an impression of cold fury.</p><p>\u0093He may be a shit, but he\u0092s my brother. Who the hell are you?\u0094</p><p>Caden came to her rescue, putting an arm around her shoulder and sending the other man a challenging glare. \u0093She\u0092s not to be harmed.\u0094 Shock raised a questioning brow, black above the rim of his glasses. \u0093Do you think you\u0092re a big, menacing wizard now that you transitioned all of ten minutes ago?\u0094</p><p>Transitioned? From a man to a wizard. Was that why he\u0092d needed so much energy? Why there\u0092d been two of them afterward, his new and old self? What had happened to the other Caden? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093You two.\u0094 Bram pointed to Caden and Shock. \u0093Bury the animosity. We\u0092ve no time for it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re simply going to trust him and hope he doesn\u0092t fuck you over?\u0094 Caden challenged.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s my problem. Marrok has warned us repeatedly about these rows. If we\u0092re too busy fighting one another, how will we ever unite against our common enemy?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Agreed.\u0094 Caden nodded. \u0093Only because focusing on Mathias, Zain, and the Anarki will better help me find Anka and keep Sydney safe.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Fine.\u0094 Shock rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u0093Good.\u0094 Bram nodded. \u0093Shock, take Aquarius upstairs. Please. We haven\u0092t much time to save her.\u0094</p><p>If it\u0092s not already too late. The unspoken words hung in the air.</p><p>Bram sighed. \u0093When that\u0092s done, return here. Sabelle, follow and wait for Aunt Millie. Sydney, you\u0092ll want to stay with your friend, I presume? Go with them.\u0094</p><p>With that, she was dismissed. She cast a gaze toward Caden, feeling lost in Wonderland without a map or any bleeding clue what to do next. He squeezed her hand and nodded.</p> <p>\u0093I\u0092ll find you soon. I promise.\u0094</p><p>What choice did she have? Aquarius\u0092s life hung in the balance, and her friend might need her if she had any hope of pulling through. But the reporter in her wanted to stay behind. Something told her the men were about to have a conversation she\u0092d kill to hear. But as the door to that museum-quality office closed behind her, Sydney knew she wouldn\u0092t get that chance. At least not today.</p><p>The giant, Shock, laid Aquarius on an enormous four-poster bed with a sumptuous beige silk coverlet. He took a half step back, still staring. His expression seemed to ask the same question tearing through Sydney\u0092s mind: Would she live? The worry was like an awl gouging out her composure.</p><p>For Aquarius, she had to be strong.</p><p>Sydney grabbed her friend\u0092s hand, edging Shock aside. He adjusted his sunglasses on his face, then glanced her way. \u0093Need anything more?\u0094</p><p>How would she know? Sydney could barely comprehend that this giant\u0092s brother had nearly fried her friend\u0092s insides. But Shock looked at Aquarius with something like compassion.</p> <p>Olivia, the woman she\u0092d met in the pub, entered the room and grabbed Sydney\u0092s hand while answering Shock. \u0093If we do, we\u0092ll let you know. We\u0092re fine for now.\u0094</p><p>Shock hesitated, brushed a knuckle down Aquarius\u0092s arm, then turned away. Staring after him as he left, Sydney wondered what that was all about.</p><p>The question must have shown on her face because Olivia said, \u0093Don\u0092t try to figure him out. You\u0092ll give yourself a headache. I\u0092ve been living here with my mate Marrok for about six weeks, so I see the guys often. Except Shock. He completely baffles me.\u0094</p><p>She lived here? \u0093Marrok?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yeah. Big, bossy warrior, carries a sword.\u0094</p><p>Indeed. Sydney remembered him vividly. Imposing bloke. Hard to imagine that the tiny, violet-eyed beauty belonged with such a man. But lately she\u0092d seen far more unusual things.</p><p>\u0093Smashing.\u0094 Sabelle breezed into the room, rubbing her hands together\u0097the only indication of her nervousness. \u0093Aunt Millie will be here shortly.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s got heart magic and can do a bit of healing,\u0094 Olivia whispered to her.</p> <p>\u0093Precisely. Sorry.\u0094 Sabelle sent her a rueful grin. \u0093Ask me questions when I don\u0092t explain. I\u0092m a bit topsy-turvy at the moment.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle might regret that offer someday, but Sydney intended to take advantage of it.</p><p>\u0093How long until this aunt shows up?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m here, dear,\u0094 a spry voice said from behind her.</p><p>Sydney whirled to see a little woman with lively blue eyes wearing a dotty lace dress and a straw bonnet. This was Aquarius\u0092s savior?</p><p>\u0093No offense, but wouldn\u0092t a doctor be more effective?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not with a magical malady.\u0094 Millie took Sydney\u0092s hand in hers. \u0093Let me have a look, then.\u0094</p><p>The lady with the thick, pale bun ambled past Sydney and put bony hands across Aquarius\u0092s chest. Then frowned. \u0093Does the girl have any magic?\u0094</p><p>Olivia and Sabelle both turned to her. Sydney shrugged. \u0093I-I don\u0092t know. Does it matter for her healing?\u0094</p><p>\u0093A bit.\u0094</p><p>Sydney blew out a breath, then realized that Aquarius had rarely talked about her family. She mentioned friends and lovers, her failed uni days, karma, and her hopes for the future. But the family, she\u0092d carefully danced around that.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s possible. Caden\u0092s brother\u0092s wife is her cousin, and Anka is a witch, right?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes, but your friend may not be magical. It isn\u0092t automatic. I\u0092ll just have to hope I get it right.\u0094 Millie sighed, then closed her eyes.</p><p>Long, agonizing moments of silence passed. The woman skimmed her hands above Aquarius\u0092s belly and chest, making only occasional murmurs. Sydney had no idea what the devil they meant. And in the meantime, her friend\u0092s breathing had grown more labored. The purple, swollen color remained. Her lips were blistered, her lids nearly swollen shut, her skin cracking.</p><p>\u0093Can you help her?\u0094 Sydney finally asked, losing patience.</p><p>The older woman looked up with regret in her eyes. \u0093I\u0092m sorry. I\u0092ve never seen anything like this. The damage is extensive.\u0094</p><p>The little woman\u0092s answer slammed Sydney\u0092s composure. She covered her mouth with her hand as the little woman left. Somehow, Millie\u0092s poise had made her hope that she could solve Aquarius\u0092s crisis. To hear otherwise crushed her.</p><p>\u0093I think I know someone who might be able to,\u0094 Olivia said. \u0093A moment, please.\u0094</p><p>She disappeared. Sydney had no notion what to do or say, so merely grabbed her friend\u0092s hand and held it tightly in her own.</p><p>\u0093Fight,\u0094 she whispered to Aquarius. \u0093It\u0092s bad karma for you to leave me all alone.\u0094</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat, and tears stung her eyes. Guilt stabbed her. If Sydney had listened to Bram when he\u0092d said to get out, Aquarius would be well. If I hadn\u0092t struggled to escape Zain or if I\u0092d found some way to protect my friend, no harm would have befallen her. But Sydney couldn\u0092t change any of it now. All she could do was hope.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s not your fault,\u0094 Sabelle offered, stroking her shoulder. Sydney blinked.</p><p>\u0093How\u0097how did you know?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can read your thoughts. Sorry. Thought I should give you fair warning. But I\u0092ve delved into your friend\u0092s mind. Deep. She\u0092s worried about you.\u0094</p><p>The tears started flowing in earnest. Only a friend like Aquarius would be near death and still worry about someone else.</p><p>\u0093I feel so helpless. Aquarius would at least have some healing crystal, sacred chant, herbal tea. All I\u0092ve got is my hand.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And the power of your friendship. She feels it.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle\u0092s understanding sank into Sydney. Even if she thought the gorgeous blonde was full of rubbish and trying to soothe her, Sydney appreciated the gesture. Perhaps Sabelle wasn\u0092t so bad after all\u0097as long as she kept her hands off Caden.</p><p>\u0093In the future, I will. He\u0092s all yours, I promise.\u0094</p><p>Sydney hiccuped, smiling despite her tears. \u0093You\u0092re not intimidated by me surely?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Caden and Bram both said you\u0092re tough, but no. My attentions are . . . engaged elsewhere.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Olivia said you wanted to see me,\u0094 a voice growled from the door.</p><p>Sydney turned, along with the other two women. Ice stood there. His behemoth shoulders bulged out of a black tank. An expressive mouth and the dark stubble dusting his otherwise sleek head, along with the faded fatigues, made him an intimidating figure. And when Sydney looked at him, the hunger in his expression, directed purely at Sabelle, blasted her like a heat wave.</p><p>The blonde merely blushed and cast a demure glance down. Then she sent Ice a nervous smile. \u0093I think Olivia believed you might be able to help.\u0094</p><p>He frowned as he glanced at Aquarius. \u0093I know blast and damn about her condition.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Zain cooked her from the inside out,\u0094 Sydney blurted.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not a healer.\u0094 His craggy face gentled in apology.</p><p>\u0093But Olivia sent you.\u0094 Sydney couldn\u0092t understand why she had if Ice couldn\u0092t help.</p><p>He shrugged uncomfortably. \u0093To stand guard?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle edged around Sydney and approached Ice, drawing in a bracing breath. \u0093Your nickname, does it imply ability? Maybe . . .\u0094</p><p>At his scowl, Sabelle broke off. Sydney\u0092s thoughts raced. Did Ice have some ability to cool down Aquarius\u0092s insides?</p><p>He swallowed, hesitated, then nodded. \u0093But I don\u0092t know how to heal.\u0094</p><p>Ice turned away, and Sydney moved to chase him down, anger flashing through her. He\u0092s giving up, just like that? Aquarius may not mean anything to him, but her friend meant the world to her. Sabelle pulled her back and held up a steadying palm. Then she stopped Ice herself, wrapping her hand around his huge biceps.</p><p>\u0093Please . . .\u0094</p><p>Sabelle looked up at Ice, beseeching blue eyes wide open. Renewed hunger stormed his face. The wizard wanted her. Badly. And he was letting her see it. Sabelle didn\u0092t back down; she gripped him tighter, though Sydney sensed that the witch was overwhelmed by Ice. Yet she held her ground for Aquarius\u0092s sake, a woman she did not know.</p><p>Initial impressions be damned. Sabelle had just earned herself a new friend.</p><p>Ice huffed, then groused, \u0093I need a conduit. I can create objects of ice, but transferring it to something living is beyond me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can try,\u0094 Sabelle assured, her hands dropping from his biceps.</p><p>\u0093How?\u0094</p><p>The blond witch licked her lips. \u0093I\u0092m part siren. I can often influence people\u0092s feelings by touching them. If you can pass the feeling onto me . . .\u0094</p><p>Part siren? There was such a thing? And they could change other\u0092s feelings? Wow, the material she\u0092d have to put in her next article.</p><p>Ice retreated. \u0093Your brother will object.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Bram can\u0092t always have his way.\u0094</p><p>He clenched his jaw. \u0093Sabelle, I have to touch you to use you as a conduit.\u0094</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath, clearly nervous. And excited. She stared at Ice as if he was the forbidden fruit. \u0093Touch me how?\u0094</p><p>Desire leapt in his gaze again. \u0093As much as you\u0092ll let me. The more contact, the more successful I\u0092m likely to be.\u0094</p><p>The witch paused.</p><p>\u0093Worried my insanity is contagious, princess?\u0094 Ice challenged with a dark raised brow.</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 Sabelle snapped, then glanced at Aquarius, who labored for each breath. The witch bit her lip. Something about Sabelle\u0092s demeanor told Sydney that her reticence wasn\u0092t about Ice\u0092s intimidating demeanor, but the sexual vibes floating between them.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll do it.\u0094 Sabelle said in a voice that cracked and wobbled.</p><p>\u0093Relax and trust me. You can\u0092t be afraid, no matter what.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle gave a shaky nod. Sydney suspected that Ice\u0092s request was easier said than done. Either way, she wished they\u0092d hurry. Aquarius\u0092s clock was ticking down.</p><p>\u0093Do we need anything else?\u0094 the blond witch asked.</p><p>\u0093Just put your hands on her and concentrate. Whatever happens, don\u0092t move away from me.\u0094</p><p>The gorgeous witch positioned herself at the side of the bed, arms out so that her hands rested on Aquarius\u0092s torso. She drew in a deep breath, as if bracing herself.</p><p>Ice moved in behind her, stopping a mere breath away.</p><p>\u0093Ready?\u0094</p><p>She nodded, but her body tensed. And no wonder, the sexual tension between them was thick and undeniable.</p><p>Closing the last bit between them, Ice wrapped his arms around Sabelle\u0092s middle, just beneath her breasts. His legs shadowed hers, thighs to thighs, shins to calves, his feet braced around hers. The woman\u0092s breath caught when Ice dropped his head, resting his cheek against her neck. His breath fanned the little tendrils of hair at her nape. Some of the hair artlessly piled on her head slipped free of its clip, caressing Ice, and she leaned back into him.</p><p>Neither moved, yet their bodies seemed to meld together.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m going to blast you with cold, like an inanimate object. Try to pass it through you to her.\u0094</p><p>Like some sort of energy transfer? It didn\u0092t escape Sydney that if Aquarius were awake, she would embrace this holistic energy healing bit and give it two thumbs up on the karma scale. But Sydney herself held her breath, willing this to work.</p><p>Sabelle closed her eyes. A moment later, she stiffened, gasped. Then she tried to jerk away from Ice.</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 he growled. \u0093Stay with me. Pass it through. See where she needs cooling and give it to her.\u0094</p><p>With chattering teeth, Sabelle tried to nod. Her hands turned white, then blue. Sydney frowned. The chill seemed to be coating Sabelle outside, but not reaching inside her so she could transfer it to Aquarius.</p><p>\u0093Please,\u0094 Sydney cajoled. \u0093Can you . . .\u0094 But she didn\u0092t know what to tell Sabelle to do.</p><p>Olivia rushed back into the room and gave her hand a supportive squeeze.</p><p>Ice wrapped his arms around Sabelle tighter, touching his lips against her ear. \u0093Take it in, princess. Send it through.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle squinted, trying to focus inward, judging from her expression. Ice gripped one hip, pressing himself closer until there wasn\u0092t a breath of air between them. The other hand he splayed across the flat of her stomach, fingers stretched from just beneath her breasts, all the way to her navel. Sabelle\u0092s head fell against his shoulder, eyes closed.</p><p>\u0093Feel me?\u0094 he whispered.</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 she gasped raggedly. Within seconds, color pinkened Sabelle\u0092s skin and flushed her cheeks.</p><p>But Aquarius looked unchanged.</p><p>\u0093What the devil?\u0094 Sydney perched on the other side of the bed, close to Aquarius. Another look at Sabelle\u0092s face shocked her. Face dreamy, lips parted, head tilted back against Ice\u0092s shoulder, she looked . . . aroused.</p><p>\u0093Fuck!\u0094 Ice jumped away from her suddenly, as if scalded. \u0093You sent me a blast of heat.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I-I don\u0092t know why.\u0094 Sabelle glanced away, but Sydney could see her eyes. They looked unfocused, dilated\u0097and guilty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was aroused and didn\u0092t want to admit it. Understanding dawned on Ice\u0092s face. As it did, his expression said that he was mustering all his self-control to resist getting naked with her.</p><p>Grabbing her elbow, Ice turned her toward him, and with a finger, he lifted her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u0093Princess, talk to me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Leave it be.\u0094 She tried to jerk away.</p><p>He held tighter. \u0093Not until you explain what just happened.\u0094</p> <p>Ice knew that Sabelle\u0092s arousal had melted his chill, but he wanted to hear her say it. And it frustrated the hell out of Sydney. Aquarius would not live if they didn\u0092t think of something fast.</p><p>\u0093It didn\u0092t work. That\u0092s all.\u0094 Sabelle turned back to Sydney, all traces of sensuality gone from her expression.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s not all,\u0094 Ice challenged. \u0093I felt more.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle said nothing for a long moment, then whispered, \u0093You know it\u0092s impossible.\u0094 Her expression turned contrite.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry.\u0094</p> <p>With that, the witch all but ran out of the room, Ice looking after her with a need so stark, it was painful. Olivia\u0092s gaping mouth told Sydney that she wasn\u0092t the only one flabbergasted by what had just happened.</p><p>Nor did she think Ice would simply let Sabelle run from him now that he knew the attraction was mutual.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>THE MINUTE ICE RETURNED to the room, Bram began pacing in front of his ornate desk, looking at each man. Caden felt the gravity\u0097and disapproval\u0097of that stare. He bristled. Admittedly, if Caden had still been a Marine, and Bram his superior officer, he would have deserved an ass chewing.</p><p>But he had his own problems\u0097his transition, Sydney\u0092s attack, Lucan\u0092s illness. He wanted to shout that he owed Bram nothing. But the situation was no longer that simple. The man\u0092s sister was keeping his brother alive at great personal expense.</p><p>He also couldn\u0092t deny that, without Bram, Zain likely would have killed Sydney. Caden knew little magic\u0097and preferred it that way. Knowing it would be unnecessary once he returned to Texas, but today . . . leaving wasn\u0092t an option. Because there was no mistaking the fact Sydney\u0092s fate had changed utterly. As long as the Anarki believed she had the diary, true or not, they\u0092d hunt her relentlessly.</p> <p>Then there was the fact that Anka was alone and unprotected, with little idea where she belonged. As much as Caden despised it, he needed Bram\u0092s help now more than ever to find her so they could right Lucan\u0092s life.</p><p>\u0093Today, many things changed. Caden transitioned. The Anarki began hotly pursuing the book once more. We have a prisoner. Again.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Unlike last time, we won\u0092t let him escape,\u0094 Ice growled.</p><p>Shock ground his teeth and set his jaw, but nodded. \u0093As long as he\u0092s here, I should keep a low profile. If he gets free, he may convince Mathias that I\u0092m on your side.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Agreed. Caden, tell the others what you learned about the book when you tried to steal it.\u0094</p><p>Quickly, he explained his failed attempts to steal the book from Sydney, stressing the fact it literally disappeared from his hands when he left her flat.</p><p>\u0093This underscores what we\u0092ve suspected about the Doomsday Diary: It can only be \u0091owned\u0092 by females. Several of us have tried to write in it. Nothing. So it cannot be utilized by a man, either. Which begs the question, does Mathias know this little twist?\u0094</p><p>\u0093How? That cursed book has scarcely left my sight in fifteen hundred years, and I knew this not until today,\u0094 Marrok said.</p> <p>\u0093True. But we don\u0092t know if Mathias has other means.\u0094 Bram turned to Shock. \u0093Does he?\u0094</p><p>Every eye in the room turned to stare at their supposed double agent.</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t say for certain.\u0094 He shrugged leather-clad shoulders.</p><p>Nice and vague. Naturally. Why would Shock tell the Doomsday Brethren anything useful?</p><p>\u0093We\u0092ll work on him. Discern what he knows. Perhaps talk to Zain, as long as he\u0092s going to be gracing us with his presence below.\u0094</p><p>Shock nodded. \u0093Zain\u0092s capture will hurt the Anarki. Physically, Mathias is still weak from Olivia\u0092s blast in the tunnel a few weeks past. He\u0092s recovering, mind you, but slowly. Zain has been elevated to acting head fiend, so his absence will be felt.\u0094</p><p>Ice clenched his fists. \u0093I wish they could feel me blasting them all to hell.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Me, too,\u0094 Bram chimed in. \u0093Crippling their operation is a start, but\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s not as crippled as you think,\u0094 Shock advised. \u0093He\u0092s ramping up the Anarki. The ranks of half-dead are swelling enormously. I don\u0092t know how. His followers are abducting soldiers from all over the world and converting them very quickly. More arrive, angry and belligerent, each day. It isn\u0092t long before their souls are gone and they\u0092re sporting robes.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why soldiers?\u0094 Caden asked.</p><p>\u0093Think, you sod. Well trained.\u0094</p><p>Caden let the insult slide. He was too infuriated about Mathias forcing servicemen into his ranks to respond to Shock\u0092s petty shit.</p><p>\u0093How many, a few dozen?\u0094 Bram asked.</p><p>\u0093A few hundred. At least. The speed of the conversions defies logic.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Each one usually takes days, perhaps weeks.\u0094 Bram\u0092s blue eyes threatened to bulge.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve overheard Mathias talking about an object he recently acquired. I\u0092ve offered to help Zain and the others for appearance\u0092s sake.\u0094 He shrugged. \u0093They haven\u0092t taken me up on it yet.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mathias isn\u0092t converting them?\u0094 Bram sounded surprised.</p><p>\u0093Too weak.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Ah. I thought surely he\u0092d be up for some mass torture. He so enjoys others\u0092 pain. Nice to know we\u0092ve deprived him of his fun. Does he stay abed, then?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. He is draining women of their energy daily. I can hear their screams.\u0094 Shock blanched, swallowed.</p><p>How could any normal man stand to listen to a woman being brutalized? Then again, Shock wasn\u0092t normal. Did those events truly disturb him?</p><p>\u0093I hate it, but if I blow my cover many will die,\u0094 Shock added somberly.</p><p>Caden fisted his hands, hating the bastard more every minute. But he was right.</p><p>Bram paced, his thoughts clearly racing. \u0093This can\u0092t go on. The Council isn\u0092t willing to admit that Mathias has returned. Against my best advice, I\u0092ve been ordered to quell the rumors and I\u0092ve had some success. But clearly, no one except us will help magickind. It\u0092s imperative we devise a game plan to defeat Mathias that bloody works.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Now that Zain has been captured,\u0094 said Shock, \u0093the Anarki will be in disarray, even with the new army, if Mathias isn\u0092t strong enough to lead them. I can give you all you need to stage an attack on his secret location.\u0094</p><p>Or all he needed to lead the Doomsday Brethren into a trap.</p><p>\u0093If he\u0092s weak, and the ranks are in chaos, perhaps the time is right.\u0094 Bram regarded the others. \u0093Duke? Marrok? Ice?\u0094</p><p>Duke crossed his arms over his chest, and despite recently having battled a dozen men, he still looked surprisingly GQ. \u0093We\u0092ll need to train a bit more. But the idea sounds reasonable.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Aye,\u0094 Marrok added. \u0093The strategy must be sound. I want nothing left to chance.\u0094</p><p>Ice merely gave a humorless laugh. \u0093I\u0092m always in favor of kicking Anarki arse.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What if he\u0092s leading us into a trap?\u0094 Caden couldn\u0092t keep his suspicion silent. Bram didn\u0092t want dissension. But good God, could they not see the obvious?</p><p>The men cast measuring glances at Shock. He stood tall, arms crossed, legs akimbo.</p><p>\u0093Think what you want. Ignore me if you like.\u0094 He shrugged. \u0093Just a suggestion.\u0094</p><p>\u0093A calculated risk I think we must take,\u0094 Bram replied.</p><p>Caden tried not to let his jaw hit the ground. \u0093What about Anka? We can\u0092t just leave her alone and afraid, by herself.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What do you mean?\u0094 Shock growled and he grabbed Caden by the arms and shook him.</p><p>Caden jerked free, fighting the urge to plow a fist in the man\u0092s jaw. \u0093Don\u0092t bloody touch me!\u0094</p><p>\u0093He means,\u0094 Duke added, \u0093that we discovered Anka had been staying with her cousin Aquarius all these weeks and apparently left a few hours ago of her own free will.\u0094</p><p>Relief swept across Shock\u0092s face. \u0093She\u0092s alive?\u0094</p><p>\u0093And belongs with my brother,\u0094 Caden pointed out.</p><p>Shock sent him a tight smile. \u0093Not necessarily.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Stop bickering!\u0094 Bram demanded. \u0093Caden, you, Duke and Ice go out now and search for Anka. Marrok, Shock and I will stay behind to formulate an attack plan. We\u0092ll advise you when it\u0092s ready.\u0094</p><p>Exhaustion wound like molten lead through Caden\u0092s veins, weighing him down. The adrenaline from the battle was wearing off, and all he wanted to do was lie down and sleep for a week, preferably with Sydney wrapped around him. But Anka needed him.</p><p>Suddenly, Bram turned to him. \u0093Now that you\u0092ve transitioned, your magic will be helpful to the cause. You\u0092ll need a wand. Normally, your family would\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No one in my family is in any position to give me one.\u0094 Thank God.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll do it,\u0094 Bram offered. \u0093Give me an hour or two and I\u0092ll present it to you.\u0094</p><p>As much as he hated to admit it, Caden owed Bram, especially now that he\u0092d lent more warriors to the search. He\u0092d even offered to perform this sacred family ritual with him. But Caden wanted as little involvement with magic as possible. Besides, taking a wand from Bram made his position in both magickind and the Doomsday Brethren feel permanent.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t need or want a wand. I still prefer to be a man, not a wizard.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But you are a wizard.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Only if I choose to exercise my powers. And I don\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>Hours later, Caden woke slowly to an unfamiliar room and an unfamiliar bed, the effects of last night\u0092s exhaustion slowly fading. A familiar warmth lay beside him. Sydney. It was reckless, but he snuggled up to her. After spending fruitless hours looking for Anka, he\u0092d returned to Bram\u0092s after midnight, fatigued to the core, and found her cozy in a big bed. Wanting her warmth, to reassure himself of her safety, he\u0092d joined her. In the past, he\u0092d talked to Sydney, argued with her, touched her, worried about her. But he really hadn\u0092t had the opportunity to simply lie with her and hold her in his arms. Right away, he knew he\u0092d missed something special.</p><p>Soft, warm, quiet\u0097at least for her. Burying his face in her hair, he smiled . . . until the noises below woke him. Men\u0092s voices. A shout\u0097Bram. The slamming of a door. Then outside the clank of metal on metal, the report of firearms. Marrok was training the others. He frowned.</p><p>A moment later, Duke popped his head in the door and said, \u0093Everyone is outside. Well, everyone but Shock.\u0094</p><p>Typical. The elder Denzell brother claimed to be a double agent, but why would Shock turn against his family, allow his own brother to be captured, and battle the rest of his class to defeat the man who supposedly wanted to uplift them? As far as Caden could see, unless Shock had a hidden altruistic streak his \u0093loyalty\u0094 to Bram made no bloody sense.</p><p>Briefly, Caden pondered staying beside Sydney. More than once, he\u0092d wanted to tell Bram to shove his request for training. But they\u0092d struck a deal when he first arrived: His help in exchange for theirs in finding Anka.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll be there shortly,\u0094 he said, then glanced regretfully at Sydney.</p><p>He owed her answers\u0097loads of them. Inadvertently, he\u0092d plucked her from her ordinary world and plopped her down in the middle of a war zone. And given that Mathias\u0092s minions knew exactly where she lived, she couldn\u0092t go back now. Until the threat ended, he\u0092d do whatever necessary to keep her out of harm\u0092s way.</p><p>Carefully, he rolled away from her, extricating his arm from beneath her neck, unwrapping his legs from hers. Now separate, he sat up, trying not to disturb her. After yesterday\u0092s ordeal, she needed rest. Time to adjust.</p><p>A feminine hand touched his bare back. \u0093Where are you going?\u0094</p><p>\u0093To help with the combat training. Go back to sleep.\u0094</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. She looked so sweet and sleep-tousled. Until he stared into her eyes. There a million questions lurked\u0097along with an equal number of worries. The reporter in her was clearly determined to get answers. But the woman in her looked unsettled, and for the first time, afraid.</p><p>\u0093Wait. You\u0092re in midst of a war.\u0094 Her voice was raspy and heavy with sleep. \u0093And I\u0092ve just realized that includes me now.\u0094 She bit her lip, looking lost and confused.</p><p>That expression squeezed his chest. Caden eased back on the bed and took her hand. \u0093I\u0092m sorry. I didn\u0092t want this for you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s happening here, really? What is this war truly about? What are you fighting against? Anka spoke of oppression, but Mathias doesn\u0092t seem to be the answer.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sydney, I only meant to answer your questions about the past few days at your flat, perhaps the book\u0092s real purpose. What you\u0092re asking for is very dangerous knowledge.\u0094</p><p>She huffed in frustration. \u0093Without the larger picture, it\u0092s impossible to take in. I wanted the paranormal to be real. Believed in it. Part of me is happy to be proven right. The other part . . .\u0094</p><p>When her brave face crumpled, Caden couldn\u0092t deny her. He opened his arms and folded them around her. \u0093Is scared, I know.\u0094</p><p>Sydney went to him eagerly, cuddling against his chest. \u0093I never imagined knowing the truth would be so dangerous. I only saw the accolades and Pulitzers. Never the down side.\u0094</p><p>His first instinct was to tell her that nothing good could come from her knowing all of magickind\u0092s secrets. There\u0092d only be more danger.</p><p>\u0093But I have to know. If I\u0092m involved now, what good will come from burying my head in the sand and not understanding the danger?\u0094</p><p>None. She was up to her pretty neck in magical war. Ignorance could only get her killed.</p><p>\u0093The war is about oppression on the surface, but that\u0092s bunk. Oppression exists in the magical world, yes. There are two distinct classes, the Privileged and the Deprived, and other than here in Bram\u0092s house because the war demands it, they don\u0092t mix. It\u0092s simply not done, since some long-ago magical Council separated the classes for \u0091safety\u0092s\u0092 sake. That has to change. The Council needs to stop being feudal and update their laws. But Mathias uses that division as an excuse to cause chaos. Ultimately, he\u0092s just another powermonger.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Mathias wants that book badly. How does he think it will help? Power-hungry tyrants aren\u0092t usually looking to fulfill their sexual fantasies.\u0094</p><p>She blinked up at him, brown eyes sober and open. He noticed that she wore a little white negligee, likely courtesy of Sabelle or Olivia. It dipped off one shoulder to reveal creamy skin dotted with cinnamon freckles. His unruly libido stood at attention, but he tamped it down. Now was hardly the time.</p><p>\u0093The book grants wishes, sexual or otherwise. It\u0092s known as the Doomsday Diary because, in the hands of a woman powerful enough, it could bring about doomsday.\u0094</p><p>Sydney cocked her head. \u0093Woman, not a man?\u0094</p> <p>Caden shook his head, preparing to launch into a history lesson. \u0093You were right when you wrote in your article that King Arthur\u0092s half sister, Morganna le Fay, created the book. She used it as a means to curse people. The theory is that if a witch writes in the book, her wish will come true. A powerful witch could work seriously dangerous magic with it. As with all magic, the one casting it must have the power and the passion to back it up.\u0094</p><p>Sydney frowned, looking somewhat perturbed. \u0093So it grants wishes only when a witch writes in it?\u0094</p><p>\u0093As far as I know. But perhaps any woman can. We don\u0092t know everything about it. The diary disappeared a millennium and a half ago, and just a few weeks past, Bram discovered Marrok had been keeping it all that time.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You mean in his family, right? He-he can\u0092t be that old.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Incredible, isn\u0092t it? Morganna cursed him with immortality, using the diary. He stole it from her to try to uncurse himself, but nothing worked until he met Olivia. Bram tracked down the book and Marrok when he realized Mathias was returning from exile.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093What did he do to earn his exile?\u0094</p><p>\u0093This is not the first time he\u0092s tried to control magickind by foul means. If someone doesn\u0092t stop him, he\u0092ll oppress everyone and likely go on a killing spree that will make Ted Bundy look like an angel.\u0094</p><p>She gasped as the words sunk in. \u0093Wow. You tried to tell me that Mathias was no savior.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I couldn\u0092t explain exactly why without giving away magickind\u0092s secrets to a human. I never meant to drag you into this muck.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Human? You say that as if you\u0092re another species. Though I suppose you are. Those two days we spent in my bed\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I transitioned from man to wizard,\u0094 he admitted the inescapable truth.</p> <p>\u0093I suspected as much after yesterday\u0092s discussion.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s not something I asked for or wanted. I spent a lot of years praying the gene would pass me by. If I hurt or upset you as I transitioned, I apologize.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You were urgent but careful. Tell me the truth.\u0094 She turned her profile to him and stared at the wall. \u0093Was I bedding more than one of you during those two days?\u0094</p><p>Caden winced. This would be a tough admission, but she deserved it. \u0093You weren\u0092t. I would never abuse your trust by sneaking a copy of myself into your bed.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Then why did I see two of you? Did I see your human self and your magical self at once? Can you separate them at will? What happened to your human half?\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s not like that. At the end of any magical being\u0092s transition, the power that is uniquely theirs materializes, whether they want it or not. Mine is the ability to . . . ah, clone myself.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Amazing.\u0094 Sydney sat back against her pillows and drew her knees to her chest. \u0093Yet you seem less than thrilled. If anyone should be rattled about all this, it\u0092s me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Little firecracker, given where you work and the stories you\u0092ve been developing, you were much more prepared for magic\u0092s emergence in your life than I. Until Sabelle appeared in my living room to tell me that Lucan was ill, I\u0092d been blissfully ignoring it all.\u0094</p> <p>She frowned. \u0093Until Lucan\u0092s illness, you avoided this war. You weren\u0092t fighting?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094</p><p>Her expression jerked into a frown. \u0093So for weeks\u0097 months\u0097the war has been raging, your people dying, and you stayed away?\u0094</p><p>Damn, when the woman put it like that, he sounded cowardly. \u0093They aren\u0092t my people.\u0094</p><p>\u0093They are now.\u0094</p><p>In name only. \u0093I have a life and a job in Texas. I merely stepped into my brother\u0092s shoes in the Doomsday Brethren until we find Anka. He\u0092s in no condition to fight.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Any luck finding her last night?\u0094</p><p>Regret skittered through him. He didn\u0092t know what else he could have done to locate his brother\u0092s mate, let alone something that would have rescued her before she\u0092d been thrust alone in a dangerous world. \u0093No.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry. I know you\u0092re concerned.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Thank you.\u0094 He rose reluctantly from the bed. \u0093I should go. Will you be all right? Sabelle and Olivia should both be about.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Perhaps they\u0092ll help me find a shower and a toothbrush?\u0094</p><p>He smiled softly. \u0093I\u0092ve no doubt. Then they\u0092ll direct you to breakfast and keep you company for a bit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hmm. Actually, I think I\u0092d like to work on my next story.\u0094</p><p>He froze. \u0093You can\u0092t write about everything I\u0092ve just said.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not until Mathias is vanquished and all is safe,\u0094 she assured. \u0093I would never do anything to endanger you or your friends. I want to stay and help them, in fact. But this is amazing material.\u0094</p><p>He shook his head. \u0093Bram will fight your printing a word.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll be careful, change names and places . . . whatever needed. But a story of oppression and war and heroism is something all humans will relate to, even if it\u0092s about magickind. Besides, getting this story into the open may benefit magickind too.\u0094</p><p>Caden raked a hand through his hair, largely to keep from grabbing her and shaking sense into her. \u0093By inciting panic? How do you think humans will react when they know the bloke next door could be a wizard? Twenty-first century witch hunts aren\u0092t that far-fetched.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re being paranoid. Hysteria like that hasn\u0092t happened in hundreds of years. I\u0092ll make certain it doesn\u0092t happen. I would never let anything happen to these people.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You can\u0092t write this story.\u0094</p><p>Why the devil didn\u0092t he tell her to work it through Bram, let him be the bad guy? Magickind wasn\u0092t where he belonged. Why was he feeling protective?</p><p>\u0093You\u0092d have me bury the biggest story of my career?\u0094 She crossed her arms over her chest. \u0093The one incredible story that could make me and show my parents that I\u0092m every bit as successful\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093And even if Mathias is defeated, magickind\u0092s story will still be dangerous to tell, for everyone. No.\u0094</p><p>She sucked in a breath and stood, her small curves outlined in gossamer ivory. \u0093That\u0092s not your decision.\u0094</p><p>Caden wanted to refute that. Since transition, his instincts about Sydney had been clawing at him. Seeing her so passionate stirred his libido. Battling her defiance brought out his every instinct to claim her and make it his decision.</p><p>Sydney swept past him, and he grabbed her arm, holding her at his side. At the soft feel of her, his cock stiffened. Instantly. She should not affect him so quickly. He\u0092d had enough sex to be content for a few days, surely. But even the hint of her surrender made heat slide over his skin and pool in his groin. Thick desire muddled his mind until he could only think of possessing her\u0097completely. Duke and Bram and the others could wait.</p><p>Caden tumbled her to the bed. She gasped as he rolled her beneath him and positioned himself between her thighs. They wore too many clothes, damn it. His jeans, her wispy little nightgown. But he could fix that.</p><p>Lifting the hem of her gown, he stared into Sydney\u0092s dark, stormy eyes, down at the parted berry lips luring him like a siren call. They looked sweet and plump and perfect, and could be his so easily.</p><p>He lowered his head, then hesitated. He knew, knew, that she was his mate. If he kissed her, the words would tumble out. As much as his instincts were screaming yes!, if he followed through, he\u0092d tie himself irrevocably to her, to magic, and this place forever, stuck with a destiny he didn\u0092t want. And he\u0092d put Sydney in more danger.</p><p>With a growled curse, he levered himself up on shaky arms and sat on the edge of the bed, away from her. Bloody hell, if he wasn\u0092t breathing hard. His every muscle and nerve urged him to kiss her, spill the words, complete the deed. His head knew better.</p><p>\u0093What was that about?\u0094 Sydney sat up and was suddenly at his back, melting him with her nearness and the mixed scent of her arousal and anger.</p><p>\u0093I should be training with the others.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You order me about.\u0094 Her voice hitched. \u0093Tumble me into bed to change the subject, then avoid kissing me, as if I\u0092m diseased.\u0094</p><p>He whirled and found her earnest face\u0097and temptation\u0097so close. He put distance between them. \u0093Sydney, the more tangled up in you I get, the more dangerous it is for both of us.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That didn\u0092t stop you from spending two days in my bed.\u0094</p><p>Caden hesitated, hurt tingeing both her words and her expression. Sydney didn\u0092t often show her vulnerabilities. Now that she was, he had no good answer to right her smile.</p><p>\u0093Witches and wizards require sex during transition. Without it, they will die.\u0094</p><p>The hurt deepened. \u0093So I could have been anyone? Or was I merely convenient because I happened to have that book you wanted so bloody bad?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I wanted you.\u0094 He grabbed her by the shoulders. \u0093Only you. Duke insisted he bring in someone else to transition with me, and I refused. It is helpful that you had the book, but even if you hadn\u0092t, I would have insisted on being with you. I\u0092m not a heartless cad. I care about you. But having a relationship now isn\u0092t smart if we want to stay alive.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Rubbish! Excuses. Every time we\u0092ve had sex, you\u0092ve more than hinted it was against your better judgment. I propositioned; you refused. The night you beat down my door, you couldn\u0092t run away quickly enough the next morning. The evening you bent me over my kitchen table, I asked you to make love. Then your transition hit, and I happened to be the only woman handy. All along, you wanted to stop my story more than you wanted me.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s jaw dropped. \u0093You\u0092re mad. I want you until I can\u0092t breathe, until my thoughts are tangled inside out, until I could nearly die for not touching you. But I don\u0092t want your death on my conscience. I don\u0092t want to hurt you when I leave.\u0094</p><p>I don\u0092t want to meet the same end as my brother.</p><p>\u0093Leave?\u0094 She blinked, her thoughts clearly working as she fought tears.</p><p>He wanted to reassure her. But that was pointless.</p><p>\u0093Once your brother is well, you\u0092ll go back to Dallas?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Alone?\u0094</p><p>Saying the word would hurt them both, so he merely nodded.</p><p>\u0093Which leaves us nowhere.\u0094 She tensed, absently plucking at a stray thread on the coverlet.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s for the best.\u0094 He willed her to understand. The sooner she could safely leave, the sooner he could resume his normal life and put magic behind him. They could both live, if not happily-ever-after, at least without constantly looking over their shoulder.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re being a coward.\u0094</p><p>The slur felt like a flaming torch to Caden\u0092s chest. She didn\u0092t understand how much he feared mating and hated magic. She hadn\u0092t been running happily with her laughing younger brother through the grass one moment, then seen him hit by errant magic and fall the next, never to rise again. She couldn\u0092t fathom the devastation this war would bring, the growing certainty that, if he mated her, she would be targeted for death. All too clearly, he saw that if he didn\u0092t find a way out of this war soon, magic would not only change his life, but ruin it\u0097and hers.</p><p>But more explanations would only prolong the inevitable and change nothing.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry you feel that way.\u0094 Caden straightened his clothes and donned his discarded trainers.</p><p>\u0093For the first time in my life, I began to think that I might be falling in love with a man who liked and understood me, didn\u0092t think my theories were crazy. Supported me. Even my own parents haven\u0092t done that.\u0094 Her voice was a low thing that throbbed with pain, striking him deep in the chest. \u0093If you\u0092re going to kill my hope, help me understand.\u0094</p><p>Love? She might love him? Bloody hell. . . . Surprise washed over him, along with a cold chill in his veins. Yet wasn\u0092t the reverse true? If he really considered the situation, wasn\u0092t he falling for the stubborn, brave, intelligent, loyal reporter as well?</p><p>\u0093They\u0092re waiting for me on the training field.\u0094 He backed away, toward the door. \u0093You likely won\u0092t believe me, but I never meant to hurt you.\u0094</p><p>With that, he cast one last look at Sydney, looking so soft and kissable among the rumpled bedding. Then, before he did something reckless he\u0092d regret, he left, closing the door with a soft click behind him.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>NIGHT DESCENDED AND MEALTIME arrived. Bram, Ice, and Duke looked sweaty and haggard after a long day of training and a fruitless evening of searching for Anka. The one responsible for their sore muscles, Marrok, ate energetically, seemingly untaxed by the day\u0092s hard work as he consumed nearly his body weight in food. How any one man could eat that much, Sydney had no idea. That he sneaked heated glances at his mate, Olivia, didn\u0092t escape her notice either.</p><p>Everyone else ignored them. Especially Caden.</p><p>Seated beside her, he carefully avoided brushing elbows or looking at her. He said absolutely nothing. After Sydney\u0092s day of nursing Aquarius in a desperate attempt to cool her down, fending off a hundred questions during a brief phone call to Holly, scribbling her thoughts about her next magickind story, and trying not to feel her heart shattering into a million pieces\u0097the distance he put between them hurt.</p><p>It was possible during all the time they\u0092d worked, touched, and fought off the Anarki together that he\u0092d come to care for her. But not enough to cross the chasm between them. He wanted to abandon the very world she\u0092d been seeking her whole life. He had some disliking for magic, and if he ever discovered that she\u0092d written in that book to bring him to her bed, he\u0092d hate her for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Any change in Aquarius?\u0094 Bram asked, breaking the heavy silence.</p><p>Sydney shook her head and picked at the tender meat on her plate. Guilt and heartache were appetite killers. \u0093No.\u0094</p><p>She supposed she should be thankful that Zain had left her friend alive. She didn\u0092t know if his spell prevented her from dying from her injuries or if Sydney\u0092s efforts to keep Aquarius cool with compresses and ice packs had helped. Whatever the cause, thankfully, her resilient friend had hung on.</p><p>Bram turned to his sister. \u0093Did you call for Conrad, the healer? He\u0092s had more experience than Millie, and he tended Marrok well enough a few weeks past.\u0094</p> <p>The blonde glanced at Ice before she focused on her brother. \u0093He popped by earlier. Said he\u0092s never seen anything like it either. He can\u0092t help, but suggested the helbresele spell.\u0094</p><p>\u0093A healing spell would be lovely, but until Zain awakens and gives his blessing, that\u0092s impossible.\u0094</p><p>That didn\u0092t improve Sydney\u0092s mood. She didn\u0092t fully understand the spell, but even if Zain was conscious, he certainly wouldn\u0092t consent to help Aquarius.</p><p>Sabelle turned toward Caden. \u0093He also looked in on Lucan.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I spoke with Conrad before he left.\u0094 From Caden\u0092s tone she wondered if his brother\u0092s condition had worsened.</p> <p>\u0093He told you that we should try moving him to his own home? That he might improve with exposure to more familiar surroundings?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. I\u0092ll be preparing his house over the next day or two. Anka put up a quite a fight, and it\u0092s in shambles. As soon as it\u0092s ready, I\u0092ll move him.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll help,\u0094 she said. \u0093If moving him will help his condition improve.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can lend a hand,\u0094 Sydney offered.</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 Caden bit out. \u0093But thank you.\u0094</p><p>His immediate, adamant refusal stung.</p> <p>Caden leaned closer and murmured, \u0093I don\u0092t want to involve you any more than I must. Let me protect you.\u0094</p><p>Was he simply trying to keep her safe or had that been a lie to soften the blow? What danger could there be in cleaning up a house?</p><p>Sydney suspected that he simply didn\u0092t want her there. Had the tenderness he\u0092d once shown her been manufactured by the Doomsday Diary? After all, it granted wishes, and she\u0092d fantasized about him on the page. What they shared had been more than sex. For her, anyway. Now that the spell was gone, so, it appeared, was his caring.</p><p>In some ways, she wished she\u0092d never laid eyes on that book. But had she not, Caden would never have let down that mammoth self-control and become her lover.</p><p>He had a lot on his plate, true. But deep down she feared he simply didn\u0092t want her for more than a shag, and she had no one to blame but herself. Rather than dwelling on her screwup, she\u0092d be better served by focusing on her story. Once this ordeal was over, releasing it would be safe. With great copy and proof of magickind\u0092s existence, she\u0092d be a journalistic sensation.</p><p>But right now, her old life seemed a million miles away. Sydney pushed her plate aside.</p><p>\u0093Anyone seen Shock?\u0094 Duke ventured, more to change the subject than anything she suspected. The man had disappeared again late last night.</p><p>\u0093No. I tried to reach him earlier today to coordinate some last minute plans for our\u0097\u0094 Bram glanced her way, then pursed his lips together. \u0093He didn\u0092t answer.\u0094</p> <p>And whatever he\u0092d been about to say would remain a secret. She understood why Bram didn\u0092t trust her, but she wouldn\u0092t write a word for Out of This Realm when doing so would endanger them. She\u0092d made that clear to Holly. But they had no reason to trust her.</p><p>A series of trills and gongs sounded. Bram sat up straight, listening intently. As soon as the last note faded away, he rose and stalked from the room.</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s that?\u0094 Sydney asked.</p><p>Sabelle looked puzzled, but explained, \u0093It\u0092s a magical calling card. To be polite, we send a distinct sound to another residence when we wish to visit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Each person has an individual bell ring?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Something like that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Do you know who that one belongs to?\u0094 she asked.</p><p>\u0093Everyone,\u0094 Bram called from the narrow dining room\u0092s portal. \u0093This is Tynan O\u0092Shea.\u0094</p><p>Mr. O\u0092Shea was, in a word, yummy. Hair as dark and shiny as ink and slightly spiked, as if he were ready for a photo shoot. A rugged face, a strong chin, and bronzed skin all gave the appearance of a hearty outdoorsman. But his flat gray eyes looked as if all life and happiness had been sucked dry.</p><p>He held up a large palm by way of greeting, not meeting anyone\u0092s eye, then turned an intense gaze back to Bram. Clearly, he wasn\u0092t here to be sociable.</p><p>\u0093Sit.\u0094 Bram gestured toward an empty seat at the table.</p><p>\u0093Hungry?\u0094</p><p>O\u0092Shea shook his head. \u0093I came to talk. I want answers.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Has something happened to your family?\u0094</p><p>Slowly, he shook his head, then he swallowed. \u0093I\u0092ve heard whispers that Mathias has returned.\u0094</p><p>Sydney frowned. Whispers? Of course Mathias had returned. How could Tynan not know?</p><p>Bram shifted in his chair. \u0093Have you asked your grandfather?\u0094</p><p>Tynan drilled him with a derisive stare. \u0093Would I be here if I\u0092d gotten answers?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Officially, as a Council member, I\u0092m not at liberty to \u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093The devil with the Council!\u0094 Tynan erupted suddenly.</p><p>\u0093Who killed Auropha MacKinnett?\u0094</p><p>Clearing his throat, Bram sighed. Sydney got the distinct impression that Bram was stalling for time.</p><p>\u0093We haven\u0092t yet determined precisely\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093The truth, damn you!\u0094 O\u0092Shea looked ready to burst a blood vessel. His olive complexion flushed red. His eyes flared to furious life, like smoke and danger and determination. \u0093Was it Mathias?\u0094</p><p>\u0093There are rumors that some rogue vestige of the Anarki are trying to wreak havoc.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I hear others have been attacked!\u0094 O\u0092Shea pointed out. \u0093People claim they\u0092ve seen Mathias. I saw Auropha\u0092s body.\u0094 He choked on the last word.</p><p>Sydney\u0092s heart went out to him. The man looked genuinely anguished. And furious, as if he had a death wish. As long as he could avenge Auropha first, Tynan O\u0092Shea would die a satisfied man.</p><p>\u0093Tell me the bloody truth!\u0094 Tynan demanded.</p><p>Mathias on the loose should be all over magickind\u0092s version of the news. Maybe he\u0092d been living in a fishbowl? Sydney saw confusion and desperate need in his expression. The man fisted his hands, clearly trying to hold back. Tension vibrated in the air, and she had little doubt O\u0092Shea was close to snapping.</p><p>\u0093You know I\u0092m not allowed to speak of Council matters,\u0094 Bram said finally.</p><p>\u0093Do not fuck with me,\u0094 he growled. \u0093I loved Auropha. She was to be my mate after her transition next year. If that Satan\u0092s spawn raped her until she found her nextlife, then I want to show him his. The more painful his death, the better.\u0094</p><p>Sydney held her breath. Ice cursed softly. Duke looked at Bram, seemingly waiting for a cue. Would no one tell this grieving man about the Doomsday Brethren?</p><p>\u0093Damn it, have you formed a clandestine army? There are whispers. I visited the Pullman family after they were attacked. One of the neighbors thought you might be gathering warriors to combat Mathias, and doing it under the Council\u0092s nose.\u0094 He rose and growled. \u0093If you\u0092re fighting, I want in.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mere rumors,\u0094 Bram said weakly.</p><p>Sydney\u0092s jaw dropped, then she snapped her mouth shut.</p><p>Why would Bram lie?</p><p>Tynan sneered. \u0093Only in dire circumstances would I find a Deprived like Rykard supping at the same table as the ultimate Privileged. You need only your friend Lucan MacTavish to complete the picture. Where is he?\u0094</p><p>Dead silence fell across the table. Sydney bit her lip. Couldn\u0092t these people see Tynan O\u0092Shea\u0092s anguish? Why wouldn\u0092t they help him? Sydney hurt for the man and his soul searing loss. How could they refuse this poor man something as simple as the truth? Besides, if the odds were so seriously against Bram, Caden, and the others, wouldn\u0092t they want another warrior?</p><p>\u0093Lucan is injured,\u0094 Sydney finally said, testing the waters.</p><p>Every head at the table whipped in her direction, especially O\u0092Shea\u0092s. His gaze fixed on her until she felt pinned as surely as if he held her to the ground. Oops, maybe I shouldn\u0092t have said anything.</p><p>\u0093And they\u0092re fighting Mathias as a group, human?\u0094</p><p>Sydney frowned. How did he know I was human? Not important now. Instead, she caught Bram\u0092s gaze, silently asking why he wouldn\u0092t want to tell O\u0092Shea the truth. Finally, the blond wizard sighed.</p><p>\u0093Fine. Unofficially, yes. We have formed a group, the Doomsday Brethren, designed to both keep the Doomsday Diary safe and fight Mathias, who has returned from exile, and the Anarki. If you take the information about the Doomsday Brethren to your grandfather, I will deny it to him and the rest of the Council with my dying breath.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why would I end a group that can help me avenge Auropha and prevent this tragedy from befalling another family? I\u0092m relieved you\u0092re taking action. I know the Council will do nothing to quell Mathias. They\u0092ll merely deny his existence, despite news like this.\u0094</p><p>O\u0092Shea pulled a scrap of paper from his pocket. Sydney would have recognized it anywhere. It was her article from Out of This Realm about the battle in the tunnel. She gasped.</p><p>\u0093You read my article?\u0094 The words slipped out before she could stop them.</p><p>\u0093This and the others in the series.\u0094 O\u0092Shea crossed the room, grabbed Sydney\u0092s shoulders and hauled her out of her chair. \u0093You\u0092re the reporter? What else do you know?\u0094</p><p>Suddenly, Caden stepped between them. \u0093Take your hands off my\u0097the woman.\u0094</p><p>Tynan pinned him with a contemptuous gaze. \u0093You are a MacTavish, clearly.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Caden, Lucan\u0092s younger brother.\u0094</p><p>The distraught man held Sydney tighter. \u0093Until someone gives me information, I\u0092m going to keep asking her questions. She\u0092s talking, at least.\u0094</p><p>The murderous look O\u0092Shea tossed at Bram chilled Sydney. He was deadly serious.</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s already told you all she knows,\u0094 Bram drawled, looking totally unconcerned. But she sensed the tenseness in his shoulders, the slight pull of his mouth.</p><p>\u0093Let me fight with you.\u0094</p><p>Caden spoke up then. \u0093Let her go and get lost. There\u0092s more here than wand waving.\u0094</p><p>Tynan raised a dark brow. \u0093Meaning?\u0094</p><p>\u0093In for a penny, in for a pound,\u0094 Bram grumbled. \u0093Mathias is \u0091recruiting\u0092 Anarki involuntarily, using human soldiers for his army once he rips their souls from their body. They don\u0092t wield magic and seem impervious to it, so the only way to defeat them is through human methods. Ever punched a man? Fired a gun? Sliced someone in two with a sword?\u0094</p><p>The angry intruder looked around the room, seeming to gauge whether everyone else knew these things as well. He released Sydney. \u0093I\u0092ll learn.\u0094</p><p>After pausing, Bram shook his head. \u0093No. I can\u0092t risk it.\u0094</p><p>Duke interjected, \u0093A handful of weeks ago, few of us knew any of those things, either.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can teach the lout quickly, should he learn to curb his temper,\u0094 Marrok added. \u0093An emotional warrior is a sloppy one.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll curb it. Just . . . damn it, let me fight.\u0094 Tynan curled his hands around the sides of an ornate dining room chair, his knuckles turning white.</p><p>\u0093If I let you fight beside us and you\u0092re killed, your grandfather would do everything in his power to see me separated from the Council and my head severed from my body. No.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You need more warriors,\u0094 Caden argued. \u0093I\u0092m not staying. Lucan . . .\u0094 He shrugged painfully. \u0093He may never fight again. Shock comes, Shock goes.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Shock Denzell?\u0094 O\u0092Shea asked, incredulous. \u0093His family has always supported Mathias. Isn\u0092t he on the other side?\u0094</p><p>Bram didn\u0092t answer. He turned to Caden instead. \u0093Your point?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mathias is quickly swelling his ranks with all these soldiers he\u0092s conscripting. You have a wizard willing to fight. You allowed everyone else here to fight with the understanding that their safety was on their own head. Why change the rules for him?\u0094 Duke pointed to Tynan. \u0093We need him as much as he wants to join. It isn\u0092t as if we have more appealing options.\u0094</p><p>Sydney winced. It was the blunt truth.</p><p>\u0093I absolve you of any and all blame if something happens to me,\u0094 Tynan assured.</p><p>\u0093Your family won\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Burn the body, then. They\u0092ll simply think I disappeared. The great Bram Rion has ways to protect his precious reputation, I have no doubt. But don\u0092t exclude me because you\u0092re afraid of an old man like my grandfather.\u0094</p><p>Oh, that was ugly. Animosity was thick in the air.</p><p>Marrok stood suddenly, clutching the hilt of his sword, always strapped about his hips. \u0093Have you brought your wand?\u0094</p><p>Tynan looked at Marrok as if he\u0092d gone mad. \u0093I never go anywhere without it.\u0094</p><p>With a quick nod, his long, dark hair brushing his shoulders, Marrok said, \u0093Come with us. I will test your fighting prowess, and Bram, your magical skills. If you have aptitude, mayhap you can join. Bram?\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s face told Sydney that he didn\u0092t like being boxed into a corner, but saw the logic. \u0093If you possess skill with a wand and can demonstrate the ability to learn human combat, I\u0092ll consider it.\u0094</p><p>Tynan nodded eagerly. Bram shot Marrok a rancorous glare and followed him. A moment later, the back door slammed. Duke rose next and crossed the room, exiting after them. Then Ice. Olivia and Sabelle followed.</p><p>Suddenly, Caden and Sydney found themselves alone. She rose and took a few steps toward the hall\u0097until Caden wrapped his hand around her arm and pulled her back.</p><p>She whirled to him, certain that what was about to happen would make a great story. \u0093I want to see what happens next.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And I don\u0092t want you involved any deeper.\u0094</p><p>She had always been independent, and that would never change. Besides, while this was a story that could make her, it was one people should read as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Unlike you, I\u0092m not one to bury my head in the sand.\u0094 Sydney jerked her arm free and turned to stomp away.</p><p>He grabbed her arm again. \u0093What does that bloody mean?\u0094</p><p>\u0093These people need you. And you plan to turn your back on them because you think it\u0092s not your fight? I never knew Marines were afraid.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s blue eyes narrowed. \u0093Is that what you think? I\u0092m not afraid of fighting. If I survived two tours in Iraq, I can survive this, I assure you.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Then explain why you won\u0092t fight with your people.\u0094</p><p>His grip loosened, and he pulled away. \u0093I left England and everyone magical I knew at eighteen. All this wand waving and the like, it isn\u0092t normal.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Normal? You\u0092ve already transitioned. You can\u0092t change that. What magickind can do is so extraordinary . . . amazing. Humans would kill to have your abilities. A gift like yours can help take down a madman. And you want to walk away from it?\u0094</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest, mouth thin with anger. \u0093Why don\u0092t you want to follow your parents and join the academic crowd?\u0094</p><p>Sydney hesitated. \u0093I just didn\u0092t. It didn\u0092t fit me.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Precisely!\u0094 Caden threw his hands wide.</p><p>If anyone tried to force her into that tediously dull and pretentious academic scene, they\u0092d have to drag her kicking and screaming. She didn\u0092t fit there. Square peg, round hole. But this wasn\u0092t about a career. This was his heritage! She sensed Caden\u0092s reticence was deep.</p><p>He wasn\u0092t being completely honest with her. Given that, how could he possibly claim she was important? He\u0092d demonstrated that he felt responsible for her, but his unwillingness to truly share himself said he didn\u0092t love her. And it hurt.</p><p>\u0093They need you,\u0094 she said quietly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u0093They need someone passionate about their cause. That isn\u0092t me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s the real reason?\u0094 She should bloody stop trying to make him share himself, but she kept hoping.</p> <p>Caden recoiled. \u0093I don\u0092t want to discuss it.\u0094</p><p>He didn\u0092t trust her, not with his story, not with his secrets. Not with his heart. And he didn\u0092t care for her enough to try. She had no one to blame but herself. Bloody stupid impulse to write in the book.</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t make you. It\u0092s simply . . . Bram and the others won\u0092t survive without able wizards on their side.\u0094</p><p>Caden closed his eyes, and Sydney almost regretted her words . . . almost. But she couldn\u0092t skirt the truth. Even if he didn\u0092t want to hear it, he belonged here. He was a wizard. By virtue of his brother\u0092s illness and his sister-in-law\u0092s rape, he had a stake in this fight. Heck, she barely knew Anka and had never seen Lucan, but already her heart went out to them. And for the people who had tried to help Aquarius, she resolved to help however she could.</p><p>Caden shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. \u0093More Tynans will appear at Bram\u0092s door as word inevitably spreads.\u0094</p><p>She hoped so. \u0093Why doesn\u0092t everyone know about Mathias and the Doomsday Brethren?\u0094 Sydney anchored a hand on her hip. \u0093I gather Bram wants to keep the Doomsday Brethren hush-hush from the Council so he can operate without their interference, but Tynan has only heard whispers of Mathias\u0092s return. And people are being attacked. What\u0092s going on?\u0094</p><p>Caden pinched the bridge of his nose. \u0093Bram sits on the magical Council that governs magickind. There are seven councilmen in total. Tynan O\u0092Shea\u0092s grandfather is among them. Bram has pushed to advise magickind about Mathias, but the rest of the Council are controlling bastards who prefer to pretend problems don\u0092t exist. Bram wants a transcast. It\u0092s a television-like broadcast using magical mirrors, for lack of a better description. They were established for just such emergencies.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And the Council said no?\u0094 Sydney\u0092s jaw dropped.</p> <p>\u0093They don\u0092t see this as an emergency. Some even write off the \u0091problem\u0092 as pranksters stirring up trouble for the sport of scaring people.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s insane! If they had seen Anka\u0092s condition . . . the poor woman could barely speak coherently when I first met her. And this Auropha woman; Mathias killed her. Hardly a prank!\u0094</p><p>\u0093Despite the fact Auropha MacKinnett\u0092s father sat on the Council and the girl was murdered by Mathias, the Council won\u0092t budge. Bram says they are a traditional lot. I think they\u0092re afraid.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Magickind should know. This is censorship! And very dangerous to people caught unaware. I want to talk to Bram.\u0094 The first item on her agenda was the thing she excelled at most. \u0093Everyone must know about Mathias so they can protect themselves.\u0094</p><p>He frowned. \u0093Why do you want to talk to Bram?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve never done a . . . what did you call it? Transcast. But I am a reporter. In an emergency, I don\u0092t have to be magical or entertaining, just informational.\u0094</p><p>He leaned in with a scowl. \u0093You want to transcast to magickind?\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s the only way I can help. I\u0092ll never learn to fight or be able to wave a wand. But by God, I can keep people informed.\u0094</p><p>Caden knew his mouth gaped open. Did Sydney have any notion of the target she\u0092d be painting on herself if she transcasted? All of magickind would see her face. Especially Mathias. No one he attacked put up a fight, because they were unprepared. And for breaking that secrecy, he\u0092d want her dead. Caden couldn\u0092t help but admire her courage and willingness but . . .</p><p>\u0093No. Absolutely not.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s not your choice, Caden. You\u0092ll be returning to Dallas alone, remember?\u0094</p><p>She brushed past him out the dining room and into the hall. She was headed to the back door, where she\u0092d join all the others and embroil herself deeper into this morass. He\u0092d failed Lucan with his inability to return Anka. He\u0092d failed Anka by letting her slip through his fingers. He would not fail Sydney by letting her place herself in mortal danger. Even if he couldn\u0092t mate with her, the thought of her dying . . . it flattened his soul.</p><p>Caden stalked into the hall, then grabbed her arm. \u0093You cannot do this. The fact I\u0092m not staying doesn\u0092t bloody mean I don\u0092t care.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, the fact you won\u0092t be honest about your reasons for avoiding magic tells me you don\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>Damn, the woman was too bloody smart by half. He grabbed her shoulders and brought her against him. \u0093I won\u0092t see you hurt or worse.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You may be comfortable retreating, but I\u0092m not. I can help. There\u0092s nothing I can do for Aquarius, but I can try to make certain no one else suffers her fate. Or Anka\u0092s. Since you and I are through, and you\u0092re unwilling to stay and fight Mathias or fight for us, we have nothing to say.\u0094</p><p>A tennis-ball\u0096sized lump of apprehension stuck in his throat. After a few days here, she didn\u0092t have a proper grasp on magickind\u0092s real peril. He had to stop her. If he failed . . . the thought of Mathias hurting her was so painful, he nearly staggered to his knees.</p><p>\u0093The hell we don\u0092t!\u0094</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder, those arrow-sharp eyes of hers piercing him with fire. Her red hair floated around her shoulders, curled halfway down her back. Even in anger, she was a beauty. He couldn\u0092t let her talk Bram into a transcast. It would mean her death.</p><p>Pumped full of protective fury, Caden charged after Sydney and scooped her up against him, lifting her off her feet to carry her into the nearest room with a closed door, the library.</p><p>Sydney wriggled and grunted in frustration. \u0093Put me down, damn you!\u0094</p><p>Lightning tore through him as she moved against him. But despite his hunger for her, they had to talk. She had to see reason, damn it.</p><p>He plopped her on Bram\u0092s plush sofa, and she sprawled out beneath him, eyes spitting fury. Desire sparked in his veins. Everything inside him tensed as he tried to ignore it.</p><p>\u0093Let me be very clear, Sydney: You are not transcasting.\u0094</p><p>She scoffed. \u0093I\u0092m a grown woman who makes her own decisions. Besides, how will you stop me once you\u0092re gone?\u0094</p><p>Her challenge hit him like a hammer. She was right. If he found Anka and righted Lucan\u0092s life and departed, Sydney would be left to her own devices.</p><p>Not bloody likely.</p><p>\u0093Until you realize the folly of your idea, I\u0092m not going anywhere. In fact, I\u0092ll be staying very close to you.\u0094</p><p>Sydney raised a ginger brow. \u0093Go away.\u0094</p><p>Her dismissal riled his mating instinct and urge to protect. The human signs of her arousal exploded across his brain\u0097her peachy-floral scent, peaked nipples, the heat in her eyes.</p><p>Caden shook his head. \u0093I\u0092ll remain so close you\u0092ll feel my breath on the back of your neck. Constantly.\u0094</p><p>She stilled, her breath turning rougher. \u0093I don\u0092t need a babysitter.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No, you need a keeper, and I\u0092m him.\u0094</p><p>With an outraged gasp, she began squirming, trying to worm free. Her arching and bucking inflamed already sizzling nerves.</p><p>\u0093Stop it!\u0094 He clamped his hands on her hips to still her.</p><p>\u0093Make me.\u0094</p><p>Her dare went straight to his core. Heat bolted through him, and instinct overruled logic. Mine. Take. Now!</p><p>Breathing hard, he fitted his body completely over hers until their lips were inches apart. The temptation of her little red mouth was right under his, and the urge to taste it for the first time nearly consumed him. Just once . . .</p><p>One kiss would be the nail in his coffin. Would it be so bad? A needling voice in his head asked the insidious question. What if they mated and she transcasted and he lost her? He would become a carbon copy of his brother. She was so intent on slaying the evil she didn\u0092t understand, it would kill her.</p><p>The thought made him grab her tighter, as if he could take every part of her into him and keep her safe. His body pulsed, electric. She was so warm and vital and female, and he needed her with a desperation that bordered insanity.</p><p>Trailing kisses across her cheek, he dared to brush the corner of her mouth. The sweet scent of her nearly overcame him. He grabbed the edge of the sofa in one hand, her hip in the other, barely restraining the urge to devour every part of her with his mouth. Determined to distract them both, he kissed his way down her throat, down to the soft skin above her breasts, rising and falling rapidly.</p><p>\u0093Caden, this is insane. We should talk.\u0094 Smart words, but her voice was breathy.</p><p>\u0093We did.\u0094</p><p>Shoving her T-shirt aside, he inhaled deeply. Since transition, his sense of smell was keener. Though he knew she\u0092d showered since they\u0092d last made love, he smelled himself on her, and it aroused him out of his mind. Skin. He needed her bare skin\u0097against his hands and his tongue.</p><p>\u0093But\u0097\u0094</p><p>Caden wrapped his fingers around the clasp of her bra and yanked. It snapped into pieces. When he laved her nipple with his tongue, Sydney moaned, and he smiled in satisfaction. She couldn\u0092t deny that she wanted him. Her breathing, accelerated heartbeat, alluring smell, fingernails in his shoulders\u0097all told him the truth.</p><p>\u0093Damn it, how do you reduce me to a puddle in moments?\u0094 she panted.</p><p>\u0093You do the same to me.\u0094</p><p>With a quick yank, he doffed his shirt, then tugged hers over her head. Thank God she was wearing a flowing skirt, which was blessedly easy to flip up. The knickers beneath provided no barrier for his insistent hands. Next thing he knew, he had his fingers buried between her slick folds, counting the seconds until his cock could replace them.</p><p>The feel of her enticed him\u0097her little pebbled coral-pink nipples, the way she wrapped her fists in his hair and looked at him as if his touch was her whole world. Wriggling his fingers inside her, he felt her sweet spot, massaged it. She gasped, climbing closer, closer to the edge of pleasure.</p><p>Extracting his fingers, he brushed the wet tip of her clit gently, a slow, maddening caress that had her whimpering and calling his name. And he loved it, needing her to need him. As he needed her.</p><p>After making quick work of his button and zip, he shoved his jeans past his hips and spread her thighs wider.</p><p>\u0093Caden, wait,\u0094 she panted. \u0093We haven\u0092t settled the matter.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Do you truly want to stop?\u0094 If she said yes, it would kill him, but he would get up. Zip up. Walk away.</p><p>Time ceased. Sydney hesitated. A dozen seconds or more passed in silence. That answered his question . . . not that he blamed her. Caden caressed her cheek, smoothed his thumb over her brow, then made to rise.</p><p>She tightened her arms around him. \u0093I\u0092ll likely regret this later, but stay.\u0094</p><p>Caden smiled. Even while his logical mind was screaming that he was playing with fire, the reckless side of him was looking forward to the burn.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around Sydney, he gathered her up, lifting her hips to him. He paused to worship one breast with his mouth, then the other. She wrapped her legs around him and tried to urge him higher up her body, inside her. She didn\u0092t have to invite him twice.</p><p>\u0093Are you still sore?\u0094 When he\u0092d touched her, she\u0092d felt swollen.</p><p>\u0093A bit . . . but not enough to stop you.\u0094</p><p>Resolving to be gentle, he positioned himself at her entrance and pressed slowly. Beneath him, she tensed by degrees, and he withdrew slightly. When she relaxed, he edged forward, deeper, then back out when her body objected. Back and forth, back and forth. Seconds turned to minutes, and still he wasn\u0092t completely inside her. His eyes were about to cross from the tight, wet friction of her around him\u0097along with the mingling of their scents.</p><p>There. Finally, he was as deep as possible. Sydney was heaven, and he intended to enjoy every inch of her now, while she was all his.</p><p>She laid a series of kisses on his cheek, his throat, his shoulder, as he buried his face in her fragrant neck and gently thrust. Immediately, he groaned. Something was happening here; something new, more intense. Amazing.</p><p>A deep breath in, out, as he pushed deeper, easing inside her again. Another need, a dangerous one, rose up. He bit his tongue, squinting hard against the urge, but once the words scorched his brain, he couldn\u0092t stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Become a part of me, as I become a part of you . . .\u0094</p><p>Sydney, flushed and damp, looked up at him with those big chocolate eyes. A coy smile curved her lips. \u0093I think you have.\u0094</p><p>He tried to clamp his jaw shut, keep the other words in.</p><p>\u0093In fact, I know you are,\u0094 she murmured, moving with him. \u0093And I love it.\u0094</p> <p>Damn, that wasn\u0092t helping his restraint. Caden picked up the pace, sliding inside her with more urgency. The desire and the need to speak the Call were gaining steam, colliding in his head, coiling together in his belly. The need swelled, more than pleasure, more than emotion. Belonging. A desire to claim.</p><p>The next words slipped out. \u0093Ever after, I promise\u0097\u0094</p><p>Before he could finish the sentence, Sydney moaned, tightening around him, her sex beginning to pulse in a way no man, wizard or otherwise, could resist.</p><p>I promise myself to thee.</p><p>With a guttural shout, ecstasy congealed deep inside him. He roared as pleasure shot through his body like a supernova.</p> <p>Each day we share, I will be honest, good, and true. If this you seek, heed my call . . .</p><p>As he held her against him, the sense that she was meant for him clogged his throat, filled his chest. Frightening. Intense. Impossible.</p><p>Inevitable? Magic wasn\u0092t choosing a mate for him. It wasn\u0092t going to rule him or ruin her. Still, this felt like more than magic. Instinct aside, he liked her grit and determination, respected her intelligence. Her sassy mouth made him hard. If he\u0092d remained human and been choosing a wife, he suspected he\u0092d pursue Sydney to the ends of the earth.</p><p>Now, he couldn\u0092t think about that. He had another objective: to prevent her from transcasting. Once accomplished and Lucan\u0092s life was fixed, he\u0092d be back in Texas with the Doomsday Brethren in his proverbial rearview mirror.</p><p>But what do I have to return to? Disturbed by the question, Caden withdrew, stood, righted his jeans, then looked at Sydney, all flushed and disheveled and gorgeous.</p><p>He found himself saying, \u0093I promise . . .\u0094</p> <p>The Mating Call clogged his throat. Instead, he shook his head, then took a step back. \u0093I promise to do everything in my power to keep you from transcasting. And to protect you. I can\u0092t let you get more involved with magickind. I\u0092ll be watching.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>A HALF HOUR LATER, Bram crashed through the back door. Tynan came next, with Marrok following behind, slapping him on the back and smiling. Just like that, the new bloke had been accepted. The lot of them looked smug.</p><p>Already on edge from his encounter with Sydney in the library, Caden stared, anger he didn\u0092t understand slicing through his gut. So Bram had found a new warrior with no battle experience or training. Caden crossed his arms over his chest. He wasn\u0092t one of the Doomsday Brethren, so he shouldn\u0092t care that Bram had chosen someone so untried. In fact, he should be thrilled that Bram had already added his replacement to the ranks. Or he would be, once his mood improved.</p><p>Olivia filed in next, then Sabelle, the wind tugging at her blond curls. Ice followed close behind, his green eyes glued to the gorgeous witch like he wanted to swallow her whole. She tossed a long glance over her shoulder, until Duke entered and shut the door behind him.</p><p>Behind Caden, Sydney marched down the stairs. When he\u0092d been changing into all black to resume his search for Anka, Sydney had gone upstairs, likely checked on Aquarius, and showered.</p><p>Now, she walked past him, a siren to his senses. He wanted her again\u0097and not just sexually. Being near her soothed and fired him at once.</p><p>Denying her and his feelings would be much easier if he didn\u0092t suspect that he loved every stubborn, passionate inch of her. So he could not continue this . . . thing with Sydney. He could only stop her plans to transcast before she entangled herself more deeply in magickind, keep his mouth shut and his trousers zipped.</p> <p>At the moment, she was clearly avoiding him, hovering in the doorway to the library, never looking in his direction. Not that he was surprised. He\u0092d seen the hurt on her face, and he hated himself for it. But he simply wasn\u0092t the crusader she was. He\u0092d been burned by magic as a kid, suffered loss after loss as a Marine. Staying here, taking the chance to get close to her\u0097everyone, really\u0097in the middle of this war was a recipe for insanity. He refused to drink the Kool-Aid.</p><p>Grasping her arm, he stopped her and murmured, \u0093Please drop this transcasting idea.\u0094</p><p>She yanked free of his grip and crossed her arms over her chest. \u0093Please stop hiding from me and yourself.\u0094</p><p>Direct never worked with Sydney. She gave as good as she got. Maybe another tactic. \u0093I know you\u0092re frustrated with me for many reasons. I\u0092m sorry. But you can\u0092t protect yourself during this war, and I don\u0092t want to see you hurt.\u0094</p><p>The uber-bitch fa\u00e7ade dropped, and she looked at him as if he was ripping her heart out. Seeing her hold back tears was a pick axe to his chest.</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t sit about and do nothing. If you cared for me at all, you\u0092d understand that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Firecracker, it\u0092s because I care that I can\u0092t let you,\u0094 he said, voice low.</p><p>She arched an auburn brow at him. \u0093You never asked me what I wanted. What I was willing to risk? You assumed that, like you, I shouldn\u0092t risk anything. You\u0092re not even being honest about why you won\u0092t permanently join Bram. So I\u0092m not surprised that you can\u0092t be honest with me about your feelings.\u0094</p><p>Before he could reply, Bram and the others spilled into the hallway. Caden bit his tongue, wanting to tell her there was so much she didn\u0092t understand. But even if she did, Sydney still wouldn\u0092t comprehend not diving in with total passion. Despite what had happened to Anka, she still insisted on doing what she believed was right. He\u0092d known soldiers who prayed for such courage. She both amazed and terrified him.</p><p>\u0093We\u0092re going to brief Tynan on Mathias\u0092s attacks and any other relevant information. Joining us?\u0094 Bram asked.</p><p>Caden shook his head. \u0093I\u0092m searching for Anka. My brother isn\u0092t improving, despite Sabelle\u0092s efforts.\u0094</p><p>Bram hesitated. \u0093Yet.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can you spare anyone to help me?\u0094 He glanced over to Tynan, who was still wearing an eternal glower. Something inside him twinged when he saw how naturally the O\u0092Shea bloke fit in with the others. Even after weeks, Caden almost always felt like an outsider. But Tynan had melded with the group after less than an hour. \u0093Or do you no longer need me now that you have someone new?\u0094</p><p>Bram frowned. \u0093We need every hand we can get. You and I have had our differences, but we share a common goal: doing what\u0092s best for Lucan.\u0094</p><p>\u0093As long as that doesn\u0092t interfere with your war.\u0094</p><p>Nodding, Bram didn\u0092t make any apologies. \u0093It can\u0092t. Will you stay and fight? I\u0092ll send the others out with you tonight, regardless. After that I have to devote all the resources I can to defeating Mathias if you won\u0092t remain.\u0094</p><p>They had planned the attack on Mathias\u0092s compound. As soon as Shock surfaced again, they\u0092d finish their plans and implement. He didn\u0092t want to tie himself any closer to magic than necessary, but what if Anka had been recaptured? Could he let this opportunity pass?</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 he muttered.</p><p>Bram smiled. \u0093Until then.\u0094</p><p>\u0093In the meantime, she has nothing to say that you should hear.\u0094 Caden pointed at Sydney. \u0093Are we clear?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn you!\u0094 Sydney spat.</p><p>Bram fought a smile. \u0093Indeed.\u0094</p><p>Then the wizard turned away, gesturing to Tynan to enter his office. Marrok followed, closing the door behind them. The feeling that they were shutting him out intensified. Foolish, since he hadn\u0092t wished to join in the first place.</p><p>\u0093Where to?\u0094 Ice asked, slipping on a pair of leather gloves to ward off the November chill.</p><p>Caden had no idea.</p><p>Standing alone in the hall, Sydney huffed at the closed doors. All the men were now gone. Not only had Caden cut off her access to Bram, he\u0092d abandoned her again\u0097after trying to tell her what to do. Bloody prat!</p><p>It was stupid that magickind knew nothing of their worst enemy returning from exile to wreak havoc on them all. They should be informed not only of the truth, but of safety precautions, ways to reach out in case they were attacked, who to contact in the event of a Mathias sighting. Something.</p><p>Thinking about that almost kept her mind off Caden and the fact he wanted her body and sought to protect her, but held back from truly being with her. What was in his head? She\u0092d chalk it up to a typical fear of commitment, but he wasn\u0092t entirely immune to her emotionally. There was some . . . tug between them. Or had her entries in the diary created some artificial emotions in him?</p><p>With a sigh, she left Aquarius lying amid fresh ice packs and meandered into the library. It looked different with the lights blazing. Sabelle and Olivia now occupied the sofa. Did they have any notion what she and Caden had been doing there an hour ago?</p><p>\u0093I didn\u0092t until you thought about it,\u0094 Sabelle said with a teasing smile. \u0093Join us?\u0094</p><p>Aquarius was resting, and Sydney had set aside the loads of notes about her story. She could do something now if she could talk to Bram or his sister. \u0093Thank you.\u0094</p><p>With a nod and a smile, Sabelle gestured to Sydney to sit in a nearby chair. As she did, the witch said, \u0093Talk to me about what?\u0094</p><p>\u0093A way I can help magickind. Caden is furious, and may . . . I don\u0092t know, paralyze my mouth if I say this, but\u0097\u0094</p><p>She burst out laughing. \u0093Caden is out, so he can\u0092t overhear.\u0094</p><p>True, but that worried Sydney as well. For all anyone knew, Mathias could be searching for Anka. If he was, if Caden found both of them and there was trouble. . . . She worried about him, too. But she hadn\u0092t tried to prohibit him from doing what he must.</p><p>\u0093Caden, Ice, and Duke are large wizards. Experienced fighters. Mathias is currently weak,\u0094 Sabelle said.</p><p>\u0093But they\u0092re all helping.\u0094 Even if Caden didn\u0092t want to. \u0093Caden expects me to do nothing but cower in the name of safety.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Wizards can be overprotective,\u0094 Sabelle added. \u0093My brother epitomizes that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Amen,\u0094 Olivia added. \u0093I love Marrok\u0097most days. Then he brings on the \u0091me big warrior, you little woman\u0092 attitude. I have to remind him that I\u0092m not playing that game.\u0094</p><p>Sydney smiled. She could actually see the little brunette standing up to her massive husband, and him backing down . . . eventually. He loved her to distraction; even Sydney had noticed. And she was green with envy.</p><p>Caden had his moments. While making love to her earlier today, he said something more romantic and poetic than any man had ever said to her. Become a part of me, as I become a part of you . . .</p><p>\u0093He said what?\u0094 Sabelle demanded.</p><p>Wincing, Sydney flushed red. \u0093Sorry. I need to keep my thoughts to myself.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle waved away her apology. \u0093He said, \u0091Become a part of me, as I become a part of you\u0092?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes.\u0094</p><p>The blond witch and Olivia exchanged a glance. Uh oh, something was afoot.</p><p>\u0093Is that a problem?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle hesitated. \u0093Did he say anything after that?\u0094</p><p>Sydney scanned her memory. \u0093 \u0091Ever after, I promise\u0097\u0092 then he stopped and turned into an overbearing lout.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle\u0092s raised brow and another look at Olivia said she understood. Good. Perhaps the witch could enlighten her.</p><p>\u0093Indeed,\u0094 Sabelle said. \u0093When a wizard takes a mate\u0097a wife, in human terms\u0097he speaks words. A Mating Call. What Caden said begins the wizard\u0092s vow to his mate. Not the overbearing lout bit, though that comes with the territory.\u0094</p><p>Heart beating in triple time, Sydney gasped. \u0093So he speaks those words and poof, we\u0092re mated? For life?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not quite that simple, no. You have to answer his Call.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And then?\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re mates for up to a thousand years. No worrying about picking the right china pattern.\u0094</p><p>A proposal and a wedding all at once. Efficient. Had Caden really meant to \u0093propose\u0094 to her, or had that been the diary\u0092s influence?</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m confused. Human males can take an annoyingly long time to decide if they\u0092re in love and want to marry. Caden and I have known each other just over a week. I love him, but . . . is a wizard any different than a regular man?\u0094</p><p>Olivia snorted. \u0093Want a list?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle giggled. \u0093Indeed. Magic cuts through a great many human mating rituals. A wizard knows his mate by taste. Instantly. One kiss, one taste of her\u0097any fluid\u0097and he knows. Often, her taste compels the words immediately.\u0094 She looked behind her, ensured the door was shut, then whispered, \u0093It happened to my brother just before Caden came to work with you. He met a woman in a pub and brought her here\u0097most unlike him. By morning, they were mated, and she had run off. Bram told me, one kiss and he could hardly keep the words to himself.\u0094</p><p>One kiss? That explained so much. And it nearly crushed her. \u0093Caden has never kissed me. I thought maybe he wasn\u0092t the kissing sort or something. So often, we were rushed or he was frenzied.\u0094 Sydney flushed, realizing how much of her personal life she was spilling. \u0093But he never tasted me in any way. Why would he think I\u0092m his mate?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Instinct. It would tell him eventually. A kiss would tell him more quickly.\u0094</p><p>From the first, he\u0092d been avoiding locking lips with her. Pain stabbed her chest, shattered her heart. She couldn\u0092t breathe, couldn\u0092t swallow. Tears were an ice pick in the back of her eyes. She tried to keep them in, but they fell anyway. Caden had squashed his instinct once he\u0092d suspected she was his mate.</p><p>Or was she? Maybe writing her sexual fantasies of him in that bloody book had wrought some lust cloud that prompted those mating words. Maybe he hadn\u0092t finished them because he hadn\u0092t meant them.</p><p>\u0093If he spoke even a few of the words, he knows,\u0094 Sabelle assured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093That I\u0092m his mate?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yep,\u0094 Olivia added. \u0093No doubt that scares the crap out of him.

Twice?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle and Olivia both stilled.</p><p>\u0093What did you write?\u0094 Olivia asked.</p><p>How to put this delicately without sounding sex starved?</p><p>With a smile, Sabelle said, \u0093Did you ask to be his mate forever or for the night?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Just the night,\u0094 she assured.</p><p>\u0093We really don\u0092t know,\u0094 Olivia finally said. \u0093But probably not. Our theory is that the diary grants one\u0092s true desire if you write it, and that you must have enough passion and power to make it come true. But it\u0092s only a theory.\u0094</p><p>She sniffed at her tears, wishing she had more answers. \u0093Do you have a book that describes this mating ritual?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Absolutely. Feel free to take anything in the library you want. Bram and I have been adding to the family collection like mad of late. Fiction is in that corner.\u0094 She pointed to the far left. \u0093The rest is nonfiction. Human history, science, technology, et cetera, on the near left. The right and back wall are all magical tomes. What you want will be there. Let me know if you need help.\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s ears perked up. She\u0092d wandered the library once, but the number of books had been overwhelming. She could arm herself with information and occupy her maudlin thoughts by tackling the article about magickind once it was safe\u0097but more information would help.</p><p>\u0093Bram will never let you print such an article,\u0094 Sabelle vowed. \u0093But as long as you\u0092re going to stay among us, you should have more information.\u0094 She rose to her feet and headed for the library door. \u0093Night.\u0094</p> <p>She\u0092d argue with Bram about the article later.</p><p>Olivia followed behind Sabelle, but paused in the doorway. \u0093Marrok will likely be hours with Bram and Tynan. If you want someone to talk to, I\u0092m here. I know what it\u0092s like to be among all these guys and have no idea what\u0092s going on. I\u0092ve recently been through the mating thing, so . . .\u0094</p><p>She appreciated the other women, really. But she wanted to read up so she could verbally skewer Caden when he returned. She would also wait for Bram\u0092s meeting to end so she could talk to him about transcasting. The issue of her article for Out of This Realm aside, magickind needed information. And dangerous or not, she was the woman to give it to them.</p><p>Sydney awoke suddenly, head tilted awkwardly onto the arm of the sofa, a book still open in her lap, a terrible cramp in her neck\u0097and the magical Mating Call running through her head.</p><p>Noises sounded just outside the door. Loud ones. Shouting. Marching. Good God, what time was it? Judging from the weakness of the sunlight outside the northern window, it was early.</p><p>With a frown and a pull at her sore neck, Sydney rose and approached the library door. Someone had closed it during the night. The voices streaming down the stairs and in the hall were slightly muffled, but emphatic.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re certain?\u0094 Bram asked in clipped, authoritative tones.</p><p>\u0093Indeed. Saw him myself.\u0094 Duke. No mistaking that quiet upper-crust speech. The man scarcely ever raised his voice; as if he expected his words to be obeyed, so didn\u0092t bother shouting.</p> <p>\u0093Splendid. Shock returned five minutes ago. Let me see . . .\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s voice trailed off. Pounding footsteps.</p><p>What the devil is going on?</p><p>Sydney opened the library door and peeked into the hall. There Duke stood, wearing chocolate trousers and a pristine white shirt, both meticulously pressed. He had wide shoulders and a perfect patrician profile. In a glance, she could see why he was one of England\u0092s most eligible bachelors. Funny that few humans knew just how special he was.</p><p>A moment later, Bram emerged from his office, Shock in tow.</p><p>\u0093Where is Zain?\u0094 the tough guy growled.</p><p>\u0093Below,\u0094 said the blond wizard. Despite his disheveled hair, rumpled striped shirt and designer jeans, he maintained that air of authority.</p><p>Now if she could just figure out what they were talking about, she\u0092d be loads happier.</p><p>\u0093Let me go down,\u0094 Shock said.</p><p>Bram shook his head. \u0093I want to hear where you\u0092ve bloody been. And he shouldn\u0092t see you here. Let Duke get him. We\u0092ll need him upstairs anyway.\u0094</p><p>Shock ground his jaw and crossed his arms, looking quite brassed off. Sydney wondered why. He\u0092d been absent of late. Was he angry that Bram had tracked him down? Or because the Doomsday Brethren\u0092s leader demanded a command performance at some ungodly hour of the morning?</p><p>After a quick gesture to Duke, who acknowledged with a nod, Bram turned back to Shock. \u0093While we\u0092re waiting, want to tell me where you\u0092ve been these past days? Bloody hard to plan an attack on the enemy when your only spy doesn\u0092t see fit to appear.\u0094</p><p>Sydney smothered a gasp with her hand. They were planning to attack Mathias? Sabelle said they had information that the evil wizard was weak now. It would make sense.</p><p>\u0093You summoned me before the sun rose to interrogate me? I\u0092m not at your beck and call.\u0094</p><p>Bram crossed his arms over his chest. Though Shock was both taller and bigger, Bram carried a knowledge and a lethal aura that even Shock, with those dark sunglasses, couldn\u0092t miss.</p><p>\u0093So you only answer to Mathias, then?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Do you doubt that I have to make my loyalty look real?\u0094 Shock tensed, then cursed. \u0093I explained all this. Are you a simpleton?\u0094</p><p>Tapping his toe, Bram paused for a long moment. \u0093Simpleton, no. Suspicious, always. Your family reputation isn\u0092t the best, Shock. Your parents were rabid Mathias supporters. Your brother still is. When you disappear for days at a time with no communication, I\u0092d be a fool not to wonder if you were really spying on our side for Mathias, rather than the other way around.\u0094</p><p>A double agent? Sydney\u0092s eyes widened. She could completely understand Bram\u0092s skepticism. He hardly struck her as Mr. Upstanding.</p><p>Suddenly, the object of her thoughts turned his head and looked in her direction. She suspected he was looking right at her, but with those sunglasses, she couldn\u0092t be certain. Still, a flush of embarrassment crept up her body, to her face, heating her cheeks. Bugger!</p><p>\u0093I would hardly call you upstanding, either, considering you\u0092re eavesdropping and have been since I joined this conversation.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Shock, go to my office. Zain shouldn\u0092t see you here now. We\u0092ll finish this chat in a bit.\u0094 As Shock groused, Bram turned to her with a scowl and a raised brow. \u0093You\u0092ve no need to know Doomsday Brethren business. It\u0092s not for you to print in your newspaper. These warriors could die if you leak information.\u0094</p><p>She would never intentionally hurt anyone, but inadvertently she already had. Shame smote Sydney. She understood now how people could die. Bram had no reason to believe that she wanted to help them. But she had to try.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not listening so that I can steal information for my next story. I\u0092m willing to put that aside and help. When Mr. O\u0092Shea arrived last night, I realized that magickind knows nothing about Mathias\u0092s return. I want to help resolve that. I\u0092m an experienced journalist. I\u0092ve done more than work for a tabloid. I interned at the BBC for a summer, so I can\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093This is the \u0091nothing\u0092 Caden didn\u0092t want me to discuss with you, I presume?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Precisely.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Even if I believed you, it\u0092s not that simple. The Council is against notifying the public.\u0094</p><p>Suddenly, the front door slammed. Tynan O\u0092Shea stood in front of the portal. \u0093And people are dying for that stubborn stupidity. The Pullmans would still be a whole family today if someone had advised them that Mathias had come back with both barrels loaded and in search of Privileged families to destroy. The men killed, the women murdered or taken, the children sliced in two\u0097all of it avoidable. Stop being a bloody coward. You joined that group of codgers on the Council to be its future. Start acting like it now.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I started the Doomsday Brethren under the Council\u0092s nose. If they so much as catch a breath of the fact I\u0092ve begun an army to counter Mathias, do you think for an instant I\u0092d retain my Council seat? Who would they replace me with? Someone whose mind is more like theirs. That would not benefit us or magickind. We must lay low and think smart until they\u0092ll admit what\u0092s in front of them.\u0094</p><p>Magical politics? Fascinating. Sydney couldn\u0092t take it in fast enough. How amazing to be one of the few humans to know about this world within a world. Even more amazing to be in a position to help, because despite what Bram said, she thought magickind deserved the truth.</p><p>\u0093What about the next family that\u0092s attacked?\u0094 she asked Bram. \u0093And the one after that? If a few words via transcast might save them, then why not\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Who told you about that?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Doesn\u0092t matter. I\u0092m volunteering. Just show me what to do. No one has to know you\u0092re involved. I want to do it.\u0094</p><p>Bram sent her an incredulous stare. \u0093Do you understand the incredible danger you\u0092ll be in? Mathias and every Anarki scum will hunt you until you\u0092re caught. They are banking on the Council being useless and paralyzed by their fear.\u0094</p><p>\u0093So if you want to win this war, why give them the very thing they need to flourish?\u0094</p><p>\u0093She has a point,\u0094 Duke said, dragging a bedraggled figure behind him.</p><p>The tall figure had long hair and a T-shirt that said Do Not Disturb. I\u0092m Disturbed Enough Already. His head popped back when Duke yanked on his hair. Zain!</p><p>Well, clearly the T-shirt was appropriate.</p><p>\u0093We\u0092ll talk about this later,\u0094 Bram barked.</p><p>At least it isn\u0092t a no. Close, but Sydney hoped he\u0092d come around.</p><p>\u0093Well, if it isn\u0092t Privileged\u0092s poster boy,\u0094 Zain sneered at Bram.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s better than raping women and killing children.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can I kill him?\u0094 Tynan asked.</p><p>\u0093No. We need him at the moment.\u0094 Then Bram turned to Zain, stepping closer. \u0093You\u0092re going to perform the helbresele spell.\u0094</p><p>That healing spell Sabelle had spoken of earlier?</p><p>If Zain hadn\u0092t had his hands tied behind his back, he would have assuredly crossed his arms over his chest in defiance. \u0093If I expended the energy necessary to injure someone, why would I bother to bestow a healing spell on them?\u0094</p><p>The sod\u0092s flippant tone made Sydney furious.</p><p>\u0093Because I said so,\u0094 Bram snarled. \u0093And if you don\u0092t . . .\u0094 The wizard glanced toward the door, then smiled. \u0093Do you remember Auropha MacKinnett?\u0094</p><p>Nodding, Zain added, \u0093I abducted her straight from her bed. The Privileged bitch gave Mathias enough power with her lovely screams to last days. But I can\u0092t heal her now. Very dead. So sorry.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Bastard!\u0094 Tynan charged toward Zain.</p><p>Bram held up a hand. It wasn\u0092t the gesture that stopped him as much as some invisible restraint. O\u0092Shea snarled and scowled, but Bram didn\u0092t budge. Zain, however, stared warily at the grieving man, who was more muscular and more enraged. Tynan\u0092s gray eyes said he\u0092d rip the man limb from limb, given half the chance.</p><p>\u0093If you don\u0092t cooperate,\u0094 Bram began. \u0093I\u0092ll be happy to tie you down and let Auropha\u0092s mate-to-be avenge her in any way he pleases. Don\u0092t think anyone will mourn you, you sodding little shit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093How does threatening murder make you any better than Mathias?\u0094</p><p>Bram cocked his head. \u0093I view your extermination as preventive maintenance. If you choose not to cooperate, then I\u0092ll make certain you can\u0092t harm anyone else. We all know you attack those who can\u0092t fight back, mostly women. If you want to fight a man your size or better, at least it\u0092s fair. But a woman? Is that what it takes for you to feel manly?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Piss off.\u0094 Zain flushed an angry red.</p><p>Tynan charged toward Zain again, barely held in check by a force Sydney couldn\u0092t see.</p><p>Over his shoulder, Zain stared at Tynan, who itched for the opportunity to inflict damage.</p><p>\u0093Pick,\u0094 Bram demanded. \u0093Tynan O\u0092Shea or the helbresele spell?\u0094</p><p>\u0093And that\u0092s a healing spell?\u0094 she asked. \u0093For Aquarius?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 Duke answered softly. \u0093Since he inflicted the damage, only he can repair it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And it will cost him a great deal of his energy,\u0094 Bram explained with a smile. \u0093Nearly everything he has.\u0094</p><p>Aquarius! The man could heal her friend? Sydney wanted badly to plead with Zain to help. But she felt certain that her pleas would give him pleasure, especially when he denied them. She bit her lip and stayed mute.</p><p>\u0093So,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093What\u0092s it going to be? Healing and a new beginning? Or certain death? Choose wisely and choose now.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>SENSING THAT HE WAS both outnumbered and in danger, Zain agreed to heal Aquarius. Caden still wasn\u0092t certain how such a thing worked. Everyday magic he\u0092d been unable to avoid as a child, but this more complicated life-and-death magic was all new to him.</p><p>As they made their way upstairs, Bram and Duke prodded Zain. The new bloke, Tynan, growled threats behind him. Caden looked over at Sydney. She was pale but her dark eyes reflected her determination and optimism. He knew exactly how she felt, hoping the magical cure would work. For her sake, he prayed she got the happy ending for her friend that he hadn\u0092t gotten for Westin and still needed for Lucan.</p><p>As they awaited Aquarius\u0092s fate, Caden reached across the space between them and took her hand. They\u0092d had their differences, but at this moment they didn\u0092t matter.</p><p>Instantly, she whipped her gaze to him. Naked pain and uncertainty showed behind her calm facade, nearly undoing him. He wanted to hold her, bring her close, and assure her all would be well. But he wasn\u0092t certain of that at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead, he murmured, \u0093Squeeze my hand if you need me.\u0094</p><p>With a shaky nod, she turned and followed the procession up the stairs to the bedroom in which Aquarius rested. Inside the cool, shadowed room, everyone fanned out around the bed where the little woman lay, still bloated and red, lips cracked. Sabelle had removed her clothes and dressed her in a feather-light cotton gown. Aquarius\u0092s eyes remained closed, her breathing slightly labored.</p><p>Bram drew his wand and held it at Zain. \u0093Go on.\u0094</p><p>Zain growled at them both, then caught Sydney\u0092s gaze. Tears streamed down her face, and she clutched Caden\u0092s hand. His heart lifted. She\u0092d come to him for support, trusted him to care for her. Caressing the soft crown of her fiery hair, he squeezed her hand in return.</p> <p>Behind her, Sabelle patted her shoulder. Standing beside Marrok on the opposite side of the bed, Olivia gave her a reassuring smile.</p><p>Tynan shoved Zain closer to Aquarius.</p><p>\u0093How does this work?\u0094 she whispered to Caden.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve never heard of it. But Bram made it sound common enough, so . . .\u0094</p><p>Sydney exhaled, clearly trying to calm herself. Caden wanted to reassure her that if Zain did anything more to hurt Aquarius, Bram would let Tynan at him. But he didn\u0092t want to say it out loud and give the Denzell bastard any ideas.</p> <p>Zain finally stepped forward, leaning over the bed, and reached for Aquarius.</p><p>With a ruthless grip on his arm, Bram stayed the other wizard.</p><p>\u0093I have to hold her against me,\u0094 Zain explained.</p><p>Bram released Zain slowly. \u0093One wrong move, and I swear, I\u0092ll have no compunction about making certain your family needs tweezers to pick up your remains.\u0094</p><p>Sneering, Zain turned back to Aquarius. He sat on the bed beside her and pulled her awkwardly into his lap, bringing her small breasts against his chest. Her hair drifted down to his thighs. Her arms hung limply from her shoulders. Zain took in a deep breath and closed his eyes.</p><p>His arms tightened around her, then began to shake. He drew in a sharp breath, his eyes popping wide open as if stunned. Caden could see whites all around the dark irises.</p> <p>Tighter and tighter, Sydney squeezed his hand. The air thickened with tension and fear. He could smell the worry pouring off Sydney and wished he could do more.</p><p>Seconds dragged by, one after the other, and still Aquarius sagged against Zain, unmoving, seemingly not breathing. His whole body began to shake. Sweat rolled in fat drops down his forehead and temples. His face turned ghostly white.</p><p>Suddenly, he released Aquarius, collapsing back to the bed. Bram rushed forward. She fell face first in a heap across him. Sabelle elbowed her way between Tynan and Sydney, who let go of Caden\u0092s hand and tried to dart to the bed. He held her back.</p><p>\u0093Let them,\u0094 Caden whispered.\u0093 Just in case it\u0092s a trick.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s my friend,\u0094 she cried. \u0093If anything happens . . .\u0094</p><p>Tears took over then, and Caden\u0092s heart broke for her. Since meeting her, he\u0092d been dazzled by her beauty and smarts. Her moxie and dedication had impressed the hell out of him as well, even if, at times, they scared him. For days, she\u0092d been tending Aquarius\u0092s injuries. Sydney\u0092s incredible loyalty and love made him want her all the more. Magic aside, it was no wonder he was falling in love with her.</p><p>Caden closed his eyes. This wasn\u0092t the time or place\u0097 Sydney was hurting. But what a fucking cosmic joke that he should finally meet a woman he adored, only for her to become entangled in the very world he despised.</p><p>Gently, Bram rolled Aquarius over, easing her away from Zain. Neither stirred. \u0093Aquarius?\u0094 Bram called. \u0093Can you hear me?\u0094</p> <p>Still nothing.</p><p>Sydney looked about her with a desperate glance. \u0093Can anyone else help her? A bit of magic and\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sorry.\u0094 Bram\u0092s face was soft with regret. \u0093Only the one who inflicted the hurt can heal her. Check him,\u0094 Bram barked at Duke.</p><p>Hurstgrove leaned around Sabelle, who was gently brushing Aquarius\u0092s hair from her face to reveal healed skin, but an unmoving form. He waved a hand across Zain\u0092s face.</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s out,\u0094 Duke declared, pulling him to the far edge of the bed.</p><p>\u0093Oh God.\u0094 Sydney\u0092s voice trembled.</p><p>All of Zain\u0092s energy hadn\u0092t been enough to bring Aquarius around. Caden squeezed Sydney tighter. He hated to see her pain, but a part of him hoped that she\u0092d finally accept the danger she was courting. And this was just a sliver of the possibilities. The things he\u0092d heard about Anarki attacks in Bram\u0092s meetings these past few weeks were bone chilling. He hated using Aquarius as an illustration for Sydney, but if it got her to forget the transcasting idea, then something good would come of this tragedy.</p><p>Suddenly, a woman groaned, then coughed. It wasn\u0092t Sydney or Sabelle. Caden glanced up and saw Olivia staring wide-eyed at Aquarius. Glancing past Sabelle\u0092s bent form, he studied the delicate woman.</p><p>Slowly, she opened her green eyes. Groggy, unfocused\u0097 but awake.</p><p>\u0093What is it?\u0094 Sydney demanded, trying to peek around the blond witch. \u0093Tell me!\u0094</p><p>Sabelle pulled back from Aquarius, and a last glance at the other woman\u0092s face showed her to be perfectly healthy, if still a bit red.</p><p>\u0093See for yourself.\u0094 Caden thrust Sydney toward her friend, as relief poured through him.</p><p>Sydney squealed and darted from his grasp, charging headlong toward her friend, arms open wide.</p><p>Bram thrust an arm between them, then admonished, \u0093Gently.\u0094</p><p>With a vigorous nod, Sydney leaned carefully toward her friend, brushing her cheek. \u0093How do you feel?\u0094</p><p>\u0093If I said terrible, you\u0092d only cry more. I don\u0092t need the bad karma.\u0094</p><p>Sydney gave a watery laugh. \u0093You scared ten years off me!\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t have that. Who else will put up with me at the office?\u0094 Aquarius groaned as she leaned toward Sydney. \u0093Where am I?\u0094</p><p>\u0093My home. Where do you hurt?\u0094 Sabelle asked.</p><p>Aquarius sent Sydney a quizzical glance.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s Sabelle. You remember Bram from my flat? This is his sister.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The cocky one with the angry aura?\u0094</p><p>Bram chuckled. \u0093I bet if you look at me now, you\u0092ll find my aura much changed.\u0094</p><p>With a slow turn of her head, Aquarius stared at Bram. \u0093You\u0092ve traded anger for stress. You should learn to meditate.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s better already,\u0094 Sydney joked, wiping tears from her cheeks.</p><p>\u0093Get some rest,\u0094 Sabelle suggested to Aquarius.</p><p>Sydney patted Aquarius\u0092s shoulder, then urged her to sit back in the bed, against the pillows.</p><p>She touched her cracked lips. \u0093I\u0092m dry everywhere. Water?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle waved a hand, and instantly a cool glass of water appeared in a delicate crystal cup. \u0093Drink.\u0094</p><p>Aquarius didn\u0092t look very surprised. \u0093Nice trick. Thank you.\u0094 She tossed back the entire glass at once. Once finished, she handed it back to Sabelle. \u0093So what happened to me? To say I feel run over by a train is an understatement.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What\u0092s the last thing you recall?\u0094</p><p>Aquarius paused. \u0093Coming by your flat to talk to you about\u0097\u0094 She gasped. \u0093Has anyone found Anka yet?\u0094</p><p>Sydney looked back. Over her shoulder, she sent Caden a silent apology, then turned back to her friend. \u0093No. We\u0092re still looking.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She was weak the morning she left. Talked about needing energy. I offered her green tea, but she wouldn\u0092t have it.\u0094</p><p>Caden froze. Of course, Anka had been weeks without contact from Lucan. As often as they\u0092d tried to force feed Lucan energy, had Anka been without any contact that would build up her power? So who had she found to recharge her? Or had Mathias seized her again before she could take a lover?</p><p>Either possibility would kill his brother\u0097if he ever emerged from this mourning.</p><p>After Sydney and Aquarius had hugged, cried, and reassured each other, Sydney listened to her friend\u0092s horrific description of Zain\u0092s torture. Seeing what Mathias and his henchmen had done to both Anka and Aquarius made Sydney more determined to help protect others. When she\u0092d spoken to Bram earlier about transcasting, he hadn\u0092t said no. Now she was going to get assertive, Caden be damned. Why should anyone suffer because they were uninformed about the danger about to descend on their doorsteps?</p><p>Fire brewing in her belly, Sydney jogged down the stairs to find Bram. The Council was against spreading word of Mathias\u0092s return, but she knew that Bram wanted others to know. Was itching to tell them, in fact. She was going to help him do what he wanted to.</p><p>As soon as she entered the hallway, she heard raised voices to the left, behind closed doors. Damn and blast! They were all in Bram\u0092s office, except Caden, who\u0092d departed with Sabelle to begin cleaning up Lucan\u0092s house.</p><p>Sydney approached the door and raised her hand to knock. Before she could, a voice boomed through the heavy wood separating her from the men, \u0093Are you out of your bloody mind?\u0094</p><p>Ice. The warrior everyone else believed mad. The irony of his question wasn\u0092t lost on her.</p><p>\u0093For the first time in nearly two hundred years, we agree on something,\u0094 Bram quipped.</p><p>\u0093Are any of you sods listening to me?\u0094 Shock growled. \u0093What are your better ideas? I can\u0092t lead you to Mathias in his lair with your hands tied and your wands confiscated. Mathias fell for that trap once, and it led to his exile.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Aye,\u0094 Marrok agreed. \u0093We may call the man many unpleasant things, but he has never shown himself to be stupid. We cannot underestimate him. We will get but one chance to undertake a surprise attack.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed,\u0094 Duke added. \u0093Besides, if you pretend to lead us to Mathias, then we unleash our fight, he\u0092ll be suspicious of you in the future, Shock. I\u0092m not certain that serves our long-term interests.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But a pair of us claiming to be traitors and offering to bring him the book?\u0094 Ice again, his tone saying all on its own that he thought the idea absurd. \u0093Why can\u0092t we simply lure him out and whip his arse?\u0094</p><p>\u0093That plan leaves him a base to run back to and regroup, should he escape the ambush,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093I want to destroy his home turf, disrupt his operations. And if Shock lured him out, again, Mathias would suspect him in the future.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Here\u0092s another snag: if we want to be certain we can use the diary as bait, a woman must carry the book. After Caden tried to steal it from Sydney, we can\u0092t discount its rules.\u0094</p><p>Sydney thought that line was as good a cue as any. With an assertive push on the double doors leading to Bram\u0092s office, she swept into the room, trying to quell her quaking.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll take it to him.\u0094</p><p>Six pairs of male eyes all swiveled her way, expressions ranging from stunned to considering. Bram was the first to speak.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re not a witch.\u0094</p><p>A hot protest leapt to the tip of her tongue, but she had to play this smart. \u0093I am female, but if you insist on someone magical, I suppose you\u0092ll use Sabelle.\u0094</p><p>Bram reared back. \u0093Absolutely not!\u0094</p><p>Ice glared at her from beneath heavy black brows.</p><p>Sydney laughed, as if she\u0092d been incredibly daft. \u0093Of course, you\u0092re taking Olivia. Married to the ultimate warrior, descendant of Morganna, she\u0092s likely a gifted witch.\u0094</p><p>Marrok stepped forward, hand on the hilt of the ever-present sword at his side. \u0093I know not what game you play, but my tender, untrained wife will be nowhere near this battle.\u0094</p><p>Sydney feigned confusion. \u0093But if you need a woman to pretend to deliver the book to Mathias in order to breach his defenses and you\u0092re against using Sabelle and Olivia, who did you have in mind?\u0094</p><p>Bram looked straight ahead, meeting no one\u0092s gaze. The others looked at him, then at one another. Clearly, they hadn\u0092t gotten this far in their planning.</p><p>Sydney cleared her throat. \u0093Might I suggest that I\u0092m the perfect candidate. I loathe Mathias for what he\u0092s done to Anka and Aquarius, and I relish the opportunity to be a part of an attack that could destroy him.\u0094</p><p>With a furious scowl, Bram turned to her. \u0093How do you know what we\u0092re about?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your voices are louder than your doors are thick. I\u0092m merely volunteering because I know you need the assistance and I\u0092m not personally valuable to anyone here. Unless you prefer to try the trick that felled Mathias once before . . .\u0094 She tried to suppress a smile of triumph, but she had them by the balls and they knew it.</p><p>\u0093Caden would not think you expendable,\u0094 Duke said from the far side of the room. \u0093Quite the opposite.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Since he hasn\u0092t seen fit to kiss me\u0097ever\u0097to ascertain pertinent facts or speak certain words . . .\u0094 Their jaws gaped. \u0093Yes, I\u0092m informed about your mating rituals. Given all that, if I have your blessing to assist, this decision is mine alone.\u0094</p><p>A long beat of silence passed, and she waited it out.</p><p>\u0093She makes excellent points,\u0094 Ice conceded.</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s got more gumption than half the men I know,\u0094 Tynan admitted.</p><p>\u0093Aye, a warrior spirit in a small body. You know if you attempt this, you risk grave danger?\u0094 Marrok asked.</p><p>Did he think she was a fool? \u0093Of course. But just as you\u0092re willing to risk your very lives to stop terrible evil, so am I. I may not have the brawn or magical ability you possess, but my wit has saved me from a scrape more than once. I may be more helpful than you imagine.\u0094</p><p>\u0093This isn\u0092t fodder for one of your stories,\u0094 Bram growled.</p><p>\u0093At the moment, my only thought is to help. We can negotiate the rest later.\u0094</p><p>\u0093This isn\u0092t your fight,\u0094 Bram pointed out.</p><p>\u0093When that bastard hurts my friends, it is.\u0094</p><p>Bram tapped his toe against the expensive Persian rug and glanced at Duke. Hurstgrove shrugged.</p><p>\u0093We need a woman to carry the book. Unless you know of a female warrior . . .\u0094</p><p>The jerky shake of Bram\u0092s head told Sydney she\u0092d won. She pasted on a smile and couldn\u0092t resist fluttering her lashes. \u0093Well?\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093You are a minx.\u0094 Bram sighed.</p><p>His toe kept tapping, which told Sydney that his mind had already reached the right conclusion, but his pride simply wasn\u0092t allowing him to utter the words. Wisely, she stayed silent.</p><p>Finally, he conceded. \u0093Very well. But there are rules.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093If you want to stay alive, you must behave as if you\u0092re delivering the book to him because as you researched your articles, you agreed with his message of equality.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Easy enough.\u0094 And most likely the only tactic that would allow her to escape in one piece.</p><p>\u0093You don\u0092t go alone.\u0094</p><p>Sydney thrust a hand on her hip. \u0093I\u0092d prefer not to. But who can I take without arousing his suspicion?\u0094</p><p>A moment of silent thought passed before all eyes in the room drifted to the warrior in leather with the very bad attitude.</p> <p>Shock bristled. \u0093I\u0092m not here to babysit.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Too bad.\u0094 Bram\u0092s tone was unequivocal. \u0093You tell Mathias that you met her through Zain and that you persuaded her to come with you to give him the book. Tell him that you promised her protection in exchange for the diary and some positive press. This buys you credibility and Sydney\u0092s freedom. And a way to \u0091accidentally\u0092 leave the protections around his base open.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You want me to escort her in, keep the trail to his compound cracked for you to enter, then leave?\u0094 Shock exploded.</p><p>\u0093You want me to deliver the book into a madman\u0092s hands and walk away?\u0094 she asked.</p><p>\u0093Yes and yes.\u0094 Bram crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll take Shock\u0092s protection. But your plan has two flaws: first, it keeps the book in Mathias\u0092s hands.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Not at all. If you make him take it from you instead of handing it over, it will return to you. If you give the book to him, then it may remain. We don\u0092t know for certain. Simply use that wit of yours and make him filch it. As soon as you leave, so will the book.\u0094</p><p>Clever. Quite clever. Bram was more intelligent than she\u0092d thought. \u0093Fine. But there\u0092s still flaw number two: I refuse to help you unless you allow me to capture video so I can later transcast proof of Mathias\u0092s return to magickind. Do you have a small camera?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Do you know what you\u0092re asking of me?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed. You also know it\u0092s the right thing to do. Man up.\u0094</p><p>Bram hesitated, then sighed. \u0093Well, fuck. There goes my Council seat.\u0094</p><p>The following morning as the sun rose, Caden burst into the bedroom Sabelle had assigned Sydney and crossed his arms over his chest. \u0093It\u0092s one thing to talk about transcasting, but to meet with Mathias? No. You are not going.\u0094</p><p>The words rang with authority, but his gaze wandered. Good God, what was she wearing? Or rather, what wasn\u0092t she wearing? Having barged in before she was dressed, he stared at her body clad only in her bra and very tiny knickers. With effort, he dragged his stare to her face, squaring his shoulders with determination. He\u0092d come to save her from a fatal mistake, not gawk.</p><p>But Sydney taunted him, making a great show of adjusting her bra, flashing a bit of creamy breast. One strap fell off her shoulder, and she lifted it in place with a coy smile.</p> <p>Caden swallowed. He would not let her lead him around by his cock. He simply was not going to\u0097bloody hell, her lacy knickers were actually a thong! When she bent over to don a pair of socks, the sight of her bare backside and graceful legs stopped all thought. Sydney followed up with a sly look over her shoulder.</p><p>\u0093Actually, it\u0092s none of your business.\u0094 She shoved her shirt over her head and reached for her jeans.</p><p>That snapped him out of his trance. \u0093By God, woman, it is. Bram tasked me with returning the book to him and shutting you up. I\u0092ve managed the first. And I will make good on the second today. No joining this attack and no transcasting.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Bram and I have changed your plans.\u0094 She shrugged. \u0093Sorry.\u0094</p><p>She fastened her jeans, grabbed her trainers, and tried to slide by him. Caden grabbed her and pulled her near. God, it felt good to hold her. She was addicting, especially when she glanced up at him, lips pursed and glossy and right there beneath him.</p><p>\u0093Did you want something?\u0094</p><p>To take that mouth and make it his in every way known to human and magickind. To make certain that she understood precisely who she belonged to.</p><p>\u0093Spit it out or let me go.\u0094</p><p>If only it were that simple. \u0093It is my business.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Based on?\u0094</p><p>He tightened his jaw. Since he hadn\u0092t finished speaking the Mating Call, he had no basis; they both knew it. His head knew that he had no claim on her\u0097unless he wanted to be roped into magic and put her in deeper danger. His body, pride, and heart, however, weren\u0092t prepared to give up. How had one fiery woman stolen into his life and turned his world completely topsy-turvy in scarcely more than a week?</p><p>Finally, he murmured, \u0093I care about you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Really?\u0094 Something really angry came across her face.\u0093Prove it, then. Kiss me.\u0094</p><p>Her words were like petrol on a roaring fire. She had no idea how badly he craved to know the taste of her.</p><p>Last night, after hours spent searching for Anka and righting his brother\u0092s house so he could move Lucan there, Caden had stopped by a pub in which he\u0092d been fortunate to find temporary female companionship in the past. As before, he\u0092d received inviting glances and even two promising offers. The only thing he\u0092d been able to muster enthusiasm for was another ale. Sydney had so invaded his mind and heart, there wasn\u0092t room for anyone else.</p><p>But that didn\u0092t change their situation.</p><p>\u0093Sydney. I can\u0092t,\u0094 he said with regret.</p><p>\u0093You won\u0092t. Just like you won\u0092t finish speaking those words to me that you began in the library.\u0094</p><p>He froze. Someone had explained magical mating to her. And she was clearly furious.</p><p>Frustration boiled over, blending with pain, uncertainty, fear for her, and the goddamned longing he couldn\u0092t seem to shake.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re right,\u0094 he growled. \u0093I won\u0092t put you in danger, which is exactly where you\u0092ll be if I let you join this attack. Same if I mate with you. I can\u0092t drag either of us deeper into this magical muck.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why not?\u0094</p><p>\u0093What if Mathias takes you? What if something happens and I lose you? I just . . . can\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>He expected her anger, but was surprised when her face softened. \u0093What happened?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Happened?\u0094</p><p>\u0093To make you distrust magic? You didn\u0092t choose a human path without reason. You haven\u0092t avoided helping magickind and their cause because you fear battle. You\u0092ve hardly avoided women and relationships in your past, but you\u0092ve avoided me because you suspect I\u0092m your magical mate. So what tragedy made you afraid?\u0094</p><p>Caden froze, paralyzed. He shouldn\u0092t be stunned that Sydney had figured that out, but shock thrummed through his system. Mind racing, he wondered what the devil to say. She deserved answers, but opening up the wound Westin\u0092s death had left inside him would solve nothing.</p><p>\u0093Leave the past in the past. Please.\u0094</p><p>Something sad settled into her expression as she dragged a brush through her hair and braided it. \u0093Bury your head in the sand, then. I can\u0092t. We\u0092d best go downstairs now. They\u0092re waiting.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Move, whelp,\u0094 Shock said suddenly from behind him, then motioned toward Sydney. \u0093Ready?\u0094</p><p>She moved toward Shock and sent Caden one last resolute expression that chilled him to the core. \u0093Ready.\u0094</p><p>Fog hung in eerie patches as Caden assembled with Sydney and the Doomsday Brethren outside. Dressed head to toe in battle gear and dripping enough weapons to make a third-world dictator salivate, he approached Sydney, who held the Doomsday Diary and stood close to Shock. She looked to Caden for comfort, but to the leather-clad warrior for protection. The thought stung his pride.</p><p>\u0093Everyone knows their assignment, right?\u0094 Bram said more than asked.</p><p>\u0093Aye.\u0094 Marrok loaded a wicked Glock with a smile, his sword hanging at his side.</p><p>\u0093Got it.\u0094 Ice looked as if he was looking forward to this. Then again, given the fact Mathias had brutally murdered his sister nearly two hundred years ago, he probably was.</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t wait.\u0094 Tynan was all business, but his eyes glowed with pleasure.</p><p>\u0093Ready.\u0094 Duke managed to look like a cover model even in clothes meant for stealth and a pair of guns slung low on his hips.</p><p>\u0093And I\u0092m with the skirt,\u0094 Shock groused.</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s not a \u0091skirt,\u0092 \u0094 Caden snapped. \u0093She\u0092s a very worthy female, and you\u0092re crawling on my last nerve.\u0094</p><p>Shock responded with an obnoxious finger gesture.</p><p>\u0093Why are you here?\u0094 Bram asked.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m coming along,\u0094 Caden said, strapping a blade to this thigh and securing the clip in his S &amp; W.</p><p>\u0093Why?\u0094</p><p>What the hell? \u0093Does it matter?\u0094</p><p>\u0093It does. Every one of the warriors here has a vested interest in our success, except you. You\u0092re thinking with your cock and only joining us to protect the woman you don\u0092t have the balls to claim. Admit it.\u0094</p><p>Bram simply didn\u0092t understand. Then again, if Sydney hadn\u0092t convinced Bram and the others to let her go, Caden wouldn\u0092t have been as committed to today\u0092s attack. Not because he was against it or afraid. Any hint of joining the group, and he could find himself permanently entangled in magic and losing people like Duke, who he\u0092d come to admire. But this once, Sydney had boxed him into a corner.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve got your six,\u0094 Caden insisted.</p><p>\u0093Even though you don\u0092t give a shit about this mission and won\u0092t join us, we\u0092re expected to accept that you\u0092ll protect us with your life?\u0094</p><p>Bram\u0092s question was fair. In his position, Caden would ask the same things. His respect for the group\u0092s leader notched up.</p><p>\u0093You, Shock, and the rest are protecting Sydney. So yes, I care.\u0094 He looked right at her, dwarfed by Shock standing beside her. \u0093I\u0092ll give my life for hers\u0097and anyone protecting her.\u0094</p><p>Tears collected in the corners of Sydney\u0092s eyes before she looked away. Bloody hell, he hated the distance between them.</p><p>Finally, Bram nodded. \u0093We need all the warriors we can get. I\u0092ll provide you a wand. Practice would have been advisable, but under the circumstances, your instinct will have to do.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t want a wand,\u0094 Caden insisted, chafing at the thought of magic. \u0093The Marines taught me everything I need to know.\u0094</p><p>Bram rubbed his forehead. \u0093Fine. Your knowledge of explosives will be helpful. Let\u0092s review the plan. Not a word of objection, understood?\u0094 At Caden\u0092s reluctant nod, he went on. \u0093Shock says the gift of hypnosis runs in his family. He will put Sydney into a trance . . .\u0094</p><p>Sydney came to at the sound of a snap. She blinked once, twice, her fuzzy vision coming into focus. Then she looked up into the dark lenses of Shock\u0092s sunglasses. As always, his face told her nothing, and she still wasn\u0092t sure she trusted him. She clutched the book tighter.</p><p>Around her, she was aware of tall ceilings, hard floors, relatively bare walls. She glanced around. Through a partition door, she could see this warehouse had been transformed into a trendy industrial loft. Inside the makeshift office sat a black leather sofa and glass tables. The partition walls hid the rest of the space, but she could hear shuffles and grunts beyond. This was Mathias\u0092s lair?</p><p>\u0093Welcome.\u0094 A smooth, cultured voice snagged her attention.</p><p>Glancing to her right, Sydney took in its source. Stared, really. The bloke was gorgeous. Dark hair threaded with streaks of golden brown lay in loose waves around his neck, nearly to his bulging shoulders. He wore a tight black T-shirt that hugged every ripped bulge of his biceps, chest, and abdominals. A sexual animal in his prime with enough magnetism for ten men. Sydney sucked in a breath.</p><p>Exotic cheekbones framed a lush mouth, smiling widely. His pale blue eyes, rimmed with heavy black lashes, grabbed attention, at first for their utter beauty. But when she looked again, she saw the eyes revealed the cruelty of Jack the Ripper and Hitler combined. They chilled her.</p><p>Sharp expression, glittering eyes, carefully controlled upturning of lips, he compelled and repelled at once. Maybe she\u0092d been listening to Aquarius too long. She couldn\u0092t see this man\u0092s aura, but she felt it. Calculating, soulless. Evil.</p><p>Self-preservation kicked in. She played her rehearsed part. \u0093Thank you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m Mathias.\u0094 He held out his hand.</p><p>Knowing the crimes he had committed, certain he was capable of far worse, Sydney was loathe to take it, but maintaining the charade was critical. She shook his hand, scorched by the fire that burned across her palm, up her arm. She pulled back quickly, resisting the urge to rub her offended skin.</p><p>\u0093Would you care to sit?\u0094 He gestured to the sofa behind Shock.</p><p>She glanced at Shock out of the corner of her eye. He gave her an imperceptible nod.</p><p>\u0093Certainly.\u0094 Sydney clutched the book tighter as they sat on the black leather grouping. As she settled onto the cushion, she pressed the play button on Bram\u0092s tiny video recorder, which was hidden in a pocket on the outside of her handbag with a little hole cut to accommodate the lens, which she pointed right at Mathias.</p><p>Gotcha! She thought. Let\u0092s see what we can get this bastard to admit to on film.</p><p>\u0093Shock has told me about you. Anyone who brings the Doomsday Diary to me is to be rewarded.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I-I stumbled across it in my research. Actually, a stranger gave it to me after my first article printed. But after hearing of your quest for equality among magickind, I thought it might be best in your hands.\u0094 And she nearly choked on those words.</p><p>\u0093In that case, why don\u0092t you give it to me now?\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>GIVE IT TO HIM NOW? Caden watched Mathias commanding Sydney through a crack in the warehouse\u0092s window.</p><p>Earlier, Shock had snuck them all past Mathias\u0092s security spells, which didn\u0092t surprise him. Getting out in one piece was another matter altogether. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looking around, it was clear that Mathias didn\u0092t believe in anything so human as guards, so there had been none to overtake. Though he and the Doomsday Brethren now waited near Mathias\u0092s stronghold for the \u0093go\u0094 signal from Shock, he was more interested in Mathias and Sydney\u0092s conversation.</p><p>The evil wizard was testing her, toying with her. It took every ounce of restraint not to burst into the building and slay him on the spot. Clutching the butt of his semiautomatic, he had second thoughts about refusing a wand. Embracing magic wasn\u0092t on his agenda, but could he fight an evil wizard with a 9 mm? He knew from their battle in the tunnel that bullets had little effect on Mathias. To add a human element Mathias would never think to combat, Caden had placed C4 at every corner and window of the building. Once inside, his mission was to place more around the support beams so the building would come down at the touch of a button, preferably with Mathias in it.</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s why I came here,\u0094 Sydney said. \u0093To give you the Doomsday Diary. But I wonder, you\u0092re such a powerful figure in magickind, could I persuade you to answer a few questions first?\u0094</p><p>She managed to look both starstruck and sheepish. The fact she had the temerity to ask such a man questions without looking nervous staggered Caden. She was baiting a very dangerous bear. Even the look on Shock\u0092s face was, well, shocked.</p> <p>Mathias crossed his legs and leaned back in his black leather chair. \u0093A woman with backbone . . . I haven\u0092t known many human females. Perhaps I should remedy that.\u0094</p><p>Sydney looked down with just the right amount of coyness. \u0093Is that a yes?\u0094</p><p>Mathias laughed. \u0093Amusing and lovely. I smell a man on you. A wizard.\u0094</p><p>Her eyes widened, and Caden\u0092s heart stuttered. Could Mathias identify her lover? Would he know that she\u0092d been intimate with someone aligned against him?</p><p>She glanced at Shock, who said, \u0093She fancies my brother. They\u0092ve been nearly inseparable for days.\u0094</p> <p>Mathias regarded her carefully. \u0093That\u0092s where he\u0092s been. And he convinced you to bring the book to me?\u0094</p><p>She shook her head. \u0093It was my book and my choice. Actually, Shock suggested I give it to you. I just have a few questions first.\u0094</p><p>Leaning forward, Mathias leveled a bland stare at Sydney, but Caden saw the lethal way his gaze dissected her. If she couldn\u0092t read men, she was screwed.</p><p>Nodding, she adjusted her handbag in her lap, perching it on the edge of her knees. What the . . .</p><p>Suddenly, Caden understood. The camera was in her handbag, now close to Mathias. Brave little fool. She was going to get herself killed. Everything inside him clenched. Somehow, he had to get her out of there without compromising the mission.</p><p>Sydney bit her lip in a nervous gesture. \u0093I understand the book has awesome power.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093An object with this much magical ability has not been seen in centuries. It will give me the power to provide the Deprived a chance at equality.\u0094</p><p>\u0093A commendable goal, but how exactly can the book help you achieve it? What will you do with the Doomsday Diary? Could you control, say, an entire class of magickind if you chose?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Before acting, I must study the book carefully. An object like this deserves respect. To answer you now would be premature and rash.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Naturally,\u0094 Sydney countered. \u0093But give me an idea of the things you anticipate being able to do with this diary.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Forgive me if I decline to answer your question. Shock looks quite protective, and you\u0092re Zain\u0092s current amour. To keep my plans secret, I would hate to be . . . impolite.\u0094 The wizard sent her a tight smile. \u0093The book, please.\u0094</p><p>Mathias\u0092s tone hadn\u0092t changed. Nor had his expression. But Caden could tell the wizard was done indulging Sydney. He hoped she realized it. She needed to get the hell out. Heart racing, fear burned his veins as Caden mouthed to Bram, Now?</p><p>Bram shook his head. Caden clutched his gun so tight, his fingers turned white. When it came to her job, Sydney didn\u0092t understand the word \u0093stop.\u0094 If she pushed Mathias further, what happened to Anka and Aquarius would look like fun.</p><p>\u0093In a moment,\u0094 Sydney assured. \u0093What about your background makes you willing to lead the Deprived out of their poverty? It sounds like an admirable cause, and a favorable story about the inspiration behind your dedication might help your cause.\u0094</p> <p>With a brow raised, Mathias leaned forward and spoke softly. \u0093The time for reporting magickind\u0092s news in your human rag has ended. My presence is still something of a surprise, and I prefer to keep it that way. No more questions.</p><p>The book. Now.\u0094</p><p>Though the plan entailed making Mathias steal it, screw Bram\u0092s plan. Give it to him before he kills you and get out!</p><p>Instead, she frowned. \u0093You understand why I\u0092m reluctant to turn over what is, by your own admission, an awesome weapon without more information.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m a busy man. By your own admission, my cause is an admirable one, and my attention is better spent on the war and the matter of equality.\u0094</p><p>Sydney pursed her lips. \u0093Indeed. But I have heard troubling rumors about your treatment of witches. Can you comment?\u0094</p><p>Horror washed over Caden, and he bit the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood. Mathias would have no compunction about killing her for merely asking the question.</p><p>\u0093Give him the book, damn it,\u0094 Shock snarled and ripped it out of her hands, then shoved it into Mathias\u0092s outstretched arms. \u0093You came to do that, and now you have. Let\u0092s go.\u0094</p><p>Sydney managed to look flustered and irritated. \u0093I wasn\u0092t done asking questions. What about\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes, you were.\u0094 Shock warned.</p><p>Caden hoped to God Sydney heeded him. What in hell had possessed her to interrogate a man who could squash her like a bug? If she walked out of this warehouse alive, she had no idea the tirade he planned to unleash on her.</p><p>\u0093What about Auropha MacKinnett, Anka MacTavish, Elmira Craddock?\u0094 She kept aiming her handbag and the video camera in the dark wizard\u0092s direction.</p><p>Mathias\u0092s expression looked empty, yet Caden saw fury creeping through the wizard\u0092s black magical signature. He held his breath, terrified the evil bastard would draw his wand and end Sydney in one flick of his wrist.</p><p>\u0093Come on!\u0094 Shock grabbed Sydney\u0092s elbow and hauled her to her feet.</p><p>Normally, Caden would be furious that Shock had touched her and dragged her to the door, even as she held her bag in Mathias\u0092s direction. But now, he was grateful to Shock for every centimeter of distance he put between Sydney and Mathias.</p><p>As they neared the door, Mathias stood, his weighty gaze on Sydney. \u0093Stop.\u0094</p><p>Instead of walking\u0097or better yet, running\u0097out of the warehouse, Sydney turned to him.</p><p>\u0093The wizard I scent on you doesn\u0092t smell like Zain.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s heart nearly beat out of his chest. A flush stained her cheeks, but she shrugged. \u0093If you\u0092re not inclined to tell me all about your intentions concerning the book or your past actions, I hardly feel obligated to explain my sex life.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s in your best interest to reconsider. Are you fraternizing with my enemies? Maybe one of the Doomsday Brethren?\u0094</p><p>Terror struck Caden cold.</p><p>She tilted her head and glared at Mathias. \u0093Would I be bringing you the book if I was?\u0094</p><p>Because she was a minx, Sydney didn\u0092t wait for the answer, but turned and headed for the door, exiting the little room.</p><p>Then all hell broke loose.</p><p>As she crossed the threshold, the Doomsday Diary vanished from Mathias\u0092s hands. The wizard looked down as it dissipated. Letting out a horrific roar, he tried in vain to grab the little red volume, then whirled toward the warehouse\u0092s interior door\u0097and Sydney.</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t bother waiting for any \u0093go\u0094 signal. He kicked in the window and leapt through, dropping to the concrete and rolling to a crouch, gun drawn. He\u0092d have one chance to surprise the fucker and he meant to make the most of it.</p><p>The evil wizard whirled toward the noise, then grabbed his wand and raised it, his enraged blue eyes ringed in red. The plastic grip of the gun heated Caden\u0092s hand. Its weight was nothing compared to the gravity of Mathias\u0092s magic. Again, he wondered if he\u0092d have been better off with a wand and magic he could use.</p><p>Before Mathias could level Caden with a lethal spell, Bram jumped through the window, wand drawn, and faced their nemesis.</p><p>With Mathias\u0092s attention momentarily divided, Caden fired. One of the bullets tore through Mathias\u0092s stomach, and he grunted, surprise transforming his expression. Quickly, blood spread, darkening an ever-widening circle on Mathias\u0092s black T-shirt. He clutched his gut, glaring at Caden with even redder eyes.</p><p>\u0093You are going to die,\u0094 he growled. \u0093Along with Rion.\u0094</p><p>Mathias jerked his wand in their direction. Bram waved his own and deflected whatever the bastard had hurled their way. But the effort cost Bram as he stumbled back with a gasp. Caden popped off another shot, but the element of surprise was gone, and Mathias dodged the bullet.</p><p>Bram flicked a wrist at the wall behind Mathias, and it came crashing down in a tumble of plaster. Sydney stood behind the door with the book in one hand and her handbag in the other. Why the hell hadn\u0092t she departed with Shock as planned? Caden wanted to blame the other warrior, but knowing Sydney, she\u0092d stubbornly stayed.</p><p>Mathias raised his wand to Sydney. Caden roared forward, gun at the ready. On the far side of the warehouse, Marrok and Tynan broke through another window, distracting Mathias again. Ice charged through the warehouse\u0092s front door. Apparently getting the signal, Duke teleported into the room behind Mathias.</p><p>Now the wanker was completely surrounded. Time to play. . . . As soon as Sydney left.</p><p>\u0093Go!\u0094 he shouted at her.</p><p>She ignored him. Damn it, would the woman never listen! Fury and fear juiced his bloodstream that had his adrenaline on overdrive. He itched to snap Mathias\u0092s wand\u0097and neck\u0097in two.</p><p>\u0093Lower your wand,\u0094 Bram shouted at Mathias. \u0093You\u0092re done tormenting and raping magickind, tearing apart families. You\u0092ll never get your hands on the Doomsday Diary.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You overestimate your ragtag band, Rion.\u0094 With a wave, Mathias pointed his wand at the wall behind Duke. In a hiss, it disappeared\u0097no rubble, no mess, just\u0097dissipated.</p><p>Behind the missing wall stood a sea of Anarki, all zombies, dead on the outside, malevolent on the inside. Their sheer numbers shocked Caden. Not a dozen or a hundred . . . at least a thousand with grave-white faces and vacant expressions.</p><p>Beside him, Bram sucked in a breath. \u0093So many. How?\u0094</p><p>Clutching his bleeding gut, Mathias smiled. \u0093You have your secret weapon; I have mine.\u0094</p><p>The Anarki army surged forward, revealing the far corners of the room. Over the top of the Anarki\u0092s heads, Caden saw a soldier in fatigues\u0097a U.S. Marine\u0097fighting two wizards.</p><p>\u0093No! No!\u0094 the soldier screamed, struggling against them, kicking out. The wizards overpowered him and managed to shove him against a raised, slanted dais, and with a flick of their wands, strapped him down. If Caden had a wand, he might be able to free him.</p><p>An instant later, they passed a round object over his skull. The man belted out a spine-chilling yell of pain.</p><p>Once the object was pulled away and moved to the next victim, Caden looked at the limp man. In his early twenties, he\u0092d been strong, healthy, vital only moments ago. That man was gone now. In his place was an Anarki zombie, like all the others coming toward Caden, a puppet whose flesh was already whitening. The eyes staring back were devoid of life as he melted in with the attacking crowd.</p><p>There were at least fifty soldiers strapped to tables, lined up one after the other against the warehouse\u0092s back wall. The two wizards were passing the round object over one head at a time, all to horrific screams. A few moments later, they left behind corpses, alive only by Mathias\u0092s magic and will.</p><p>Shit! Time to save who they could, lay the C4, and blow this joint\u0097literally. With Mathias\u0092s attentions engaged by the others, Caden raced to complete his mission, darting to the first visible support beam and applying the explosive putty.</p><p>Marrok stepped toward the crowd of Anarki zombies, sword drawn. Bending low, he swung, cutting several in the front row in half. Black blood spurted in every direction. With a fist pump, Caden dodged his way to the next support beam, in and out of the battle\u0097stopping to slice and dice any Anarki intent on stopping him. Duke joined him, shooting down several zombies in his way.</p><p>While Caden bent to secure the next explosive, Mathias snarled, eyes narrowed at Bram as he closed in on one side. Ice approached from the front, Tynan from his opposite side.</p><p>\u0093Your Anarki can\u0092t stop us. We\u0092re not going to rest until you\u0092re back in exile,\u0094 Bram said. \u0093You\u0092re surrounded. Give up.\u0094</p><p>Mathias snorted, the sound abrasive and amused. \u0093You may have Merlin\u0092s blood in your veins, but I will still decimate you and your worthless bunch.\u0094</p><p>He whooshed his wand toward the crowd. Shrieks sounded all around. The frigid zombies crushed in, forming a protective circle around Mathias. Those close to a Doomsday Brethren wizard attacked.</p><p>Marrok and Duke cut through them as fast as they could. Bram dodged his would-be killers with a blade here and an elbow there, charging after Mathias. Tynan followed, determined to get his pound of flesh.</p><p>Mathias leapt toward the exit. As the wall of Anarki encircled him, now closer to the warehouse door, Sydney set her handbag on a nearby ledge, shoved the book inside, and peeked into the bag. A moment later, she grabbed an aerosol can and a lighter.</p><p>\u0093Duck!\u0094 she screamed, then she flicked the lighter and sprayed the contents of the can into the open flame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The resulting fireball hit the Anarki dead on. The roar and heat of the blaze singed the heads off the first row of zombies looming near. The second row paused their catatonic march, either tripping over their dead cohorts or falling victim to the fire.</p><p>Then the aerosol from the can sputtered, died. The Anarki surged forward again.</p><p>One stepped over his fallen comrades and reached Sydney. She grabbed her handbag and tried to twist away, but the door and the wall of zombies trapped her. She slid along the wall, then gasped suddenly and clutched her arm, face contorting with pain.</p><p>\u0093Bugger!\u0094 she muttered as blood started spreading across the pristine white sleeve.</p> <p>At the sight, Caden\u0092s protective instincts rocketed to life. He climbed a stair rail, jumping over zombies to reach Sydney, shooting down and knifing any who stood in his path.</p><p>A corpse grabbed Sydney, pinning her to the wall and squeezing her neck. As the magical battle raged around them, Sydney\u0092s wheezing and choking rose above the din. Her eyes bulged in panic. Red suffused her face as she flailed and fought.</p><p>Caden leapt over two more Anarki. A third, wearing fatigues stood in his way, evil pouring from his eyes. His bullets running low, Caden clutched his knife, then looked back up at the zombie in shock.</p><p>Brian, his Marine buddy. The pasty white face and vacant eyes had thrown him, but that sandy hair, the scar on his chin, the patch that read Halstead across his chest proclaimed him Caden\u0092s missing platoon mate. He swallowed, unable to move, breathe.</p><p>\u0093Brian?\u0094</p> <p>No reaction except a malevolent smile as he reached for Caden\u0092s throat.</p><p>Kill him!</p><p>Shock\u0092s voice roared in his head. How was that possible?</p><p>Kill him before he tears you to pieces, Shock demanded.</p><p>Last chance. \u0093Brian?\u0094</p><p>Nothing but a creepy smile and a shivery death grip reaching ever closer. When Caden heard Sydney scream again, he plunged the knife into Brian\u0092s neck and ripped down viciously, nearly tearing his head from his neck.</p> <p>Brian crumbled to the ground. Guilt, grief, and relief crushing him inside, Caden stepped over the body and scrambled to Sydney\u0092s side. He had to compartmentalize Brian\u0092s death now and deal with the present.</p><p>He grabbed the zombie holding her throat and pushed him face first into the concrete wall. It was still fighting after the first blow, so Caden delivered two more. The undead soldier went limp.</p><p>Whirling back to Sydney, he saw that another zombie had her in its grip, dragging her along the wall. More blood spread across the shirt at her waist. The white cotton was torn and a few inches of ragged flesh peeked through. She cried out and fell to her knees, pain slashing across her expression. The zombie was following her to the floor with murder in his eyes.</p><p>And Caden wasn\u0092t going to reach her in time.</p><p>Panic burned through him, even making his fingertips tingle. A swell of energy bounded inside him. Suddenly, he pictured the broken glass on the floor flying toward the Anarki. Seemingly of their own volition, his arms raised and hurtled forward. He snarled his rage and glass shards flew past him and embedded sharp points into the zombie\u0092s back. Black blood flowed, gurgled, and the creature fell to the ground.</p><p>He\u0092d done magic. Dear God. No time to dwell on it, whether to rail or cheer. Instead, Caden charged toward Sydney. A fresh swarm of Anarki were headed her way. With one hand, she clutched her handbag. With the other, she scooted away from the zombies, wearing an expression of utter terror.</p><p>Caden couldn\u0092t see Bram and the rest of the Doomsday Brethren, but it didn\u0092t matter. He was done risking Sydney.</p><p>With superhuman speed, he reached his little firecracker before the Anarki and grabbed her against his body, avoiding her injured shoulder. She wrapped one arm and her legs around him. Her handbag bobbed against his side as he raced out the front door of the warehouse and reached into his pocket to set off the warning charge. An explosion just outside the building rattled the walls and sent up flames.</p> <p>The Doomsday Brethren had sixty seconds to get out before he blew the whole building to kingdom come.</p><p>Outside, the weak morning sun filtered through gray clouds, lending barely enough light to see Sydney\u0092s wounds. The shape of the slashes told him she\u0092d gouged her flesh on a nail\u0097or those Anarki bastards had pushed her on it\u0097as she tried to get away. She needed direct pressure and stitches immediately.</p><p>Caden stripped off his shirt and rolled her to her back, easing the cloth against the deepest of her wounds. \u0093Lie still. We\u0092ll be out of here soon.\u0094</p><p>She nodded. \u0093I got the film. As soon as I put it together, I\u0092m transcasting it to all of magickind. This will save lives.\u0094</p><p>And who was going to save hers? But now wasn\u0092t the time to debate. It simply wasn\u0092t going to happen.</p><p>Bram emerged from the warehouse, two of the captured soldiers who hadn\u0092t yet been converted into Anarki behind him. Duke emerged next with another three. Ice and Tynan each brought a handful more. Caden wished one of those saved could have been Brian. He didn\u0092t even have to close his eyes to relive the horrifying moment he\u0092d plunged the knife into his friend\u0092s neck. God, Brian.</p><p>Still, Mathias had killed him, and Brian hadn\u0092t been Caden\u0092s friend anymore. War meant kill or be killed. The guilt would hurt like hell, but he had saved Sydney.</p><p>And he\u0092d used magic to do it. Even though his palms burned, his head hurt, and he felt so weak his thighs trembled, Caden couldn\u0092t deny that without magic, she\u0092d likely be dead.</p><p>Shoving the thought aside, Caden looked at his watch. Five, four, three . . . where was Marrok?</p><p>Just then, the medieval warrior emerged with nearly twenty of Mathias\u0092s prisoners. They all looked shell-shocked and confused by what they\u0092d seen. And why not? It wasn\u0092t every day a man saw another\u0092s soul ripped out via magic.</p><p>\u0093Blow it!\u0094 Bram shouted.</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t hesitate. He pressed the button in his pocket. The entire warehouse detonated in a flash of fire, glass, and dust. The Doomsday Brethren stepped back as bodies flew. Sydney shrieked. Flames licked out, heat ripped through the morning air, and the structure collapsed. What was left of its walls were singed black as the pop and hiss of fire ate anything in its path.</p><p>Mission accomplished. He only hoped that Mathias was still inside.</p><p>Bram tossed one soldier a cell phone. \u0093Dial nine-nine-nine. Tell them you\u0092re captured soldiers standing in front of the American Embassy.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But we aren\u0092t there,\u0094 the confused soldier challenged.</p><p>Just then, Shock appeared and waved his wand. They all tumbled to the ground in a deep slumber.</p><p>\u0093Damn you!\u0094 Sydney barked at Shock, clutching Caden\u0092s shirt to her wound. \u0093I wanted to interview them.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hell no!\u0094 Caden barked.</p><p>Shock and Bram exchanged a glance.</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s right. No time. Too dangerous,\u0094 Bram decreed. \u0093I know it\u0092s not easy, Shock, but see if you can do anything with their memories.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn near impossible,\u0094 he grumbled. \u0093I\u0092ll try.\u0094</p><p>Shock gathered grabbed three and teleported out, only to appear moments later and repeat the process.</p><p>Clutching Sydney against him, Caden smelled her feminine scent tangled up in his own and thanked God she was alive. They had to get her medical attention now. For that, they had to get to safety.</p><p>Duke sidled up to him a few moments later.</p><p>\u0093Ready?\u0094 Even after a battle, the titled wizard looked collected and almost royal.</p><p>\u0093Hurry,\u0094 Caden insisted, watching as Bram took Marrok\u0092s arm and they disappeared. Tynan and Ice both teleported out.</p><p>\u0093You could learn to do that yourself now, you know?\u0094 Duke said.</p><p>Yes, he could. Since transition, he\u0092d been \u0093blessed\u0094 with common magic like teleporting. But magic was a slippery slope, in his mind. Accept one \u0093gift,\u0094 and how long before he\u0092d take everything else? Already he\u0092d used it today and prayed that no one had witnessed it.</p><p>\u0093Get us back,\u0094 Caden groused. \u0093She\u0092s hurt.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m fine,\u0094 Sydney insisted.</p><p>\u0093You need stitches. No arguing.\u0094</p><p>She opened her mouth, but Duke grabbed Caden\u0092s arm and placed a hand at Sydney\u0092s back. Moments later, they tumbled through emptiness, then landed in Bram\u0092s office. Sabelle was already waiting, and though Caden wanted to be the one to tend to Sydney, her injuries weren\u0092t life threatening. And he was too weak. As much as he hated to admit it, Bram\u0092s sister was both talented and capable of handling Sydney.</p><p>\u0093Go with her,\u0094 Caden murmured. \u0093Let her patch you up. I\u0092ll be along shortly.\u0094</p><p>She held up the handbag. \u0093As long as she\u0092s quick. I\u0092ve got good film and the book inside.\u0094 Leveling a sharp glance at Bram, she challenged, \u0093You\u0092re not backing out, right?\u0094</p><p>\u0093The matter is too serious for the Council to remain silent. You can transcast.\u0094</p><p>Fury shot through Caden. Before he could object, Sydney rushed Sabelle out the door, excitement humming off of her. Caden wanted to go along, hold her hand, shout some sense into her, but the fair-haired general stood behind his desk and barked questions.</p><p>\u0093Did anyone see Mathias teleport out?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes,\u0094 Tynan snarled. \u0093I was just about to blast the bloody sadist when I saw the warning explosion. Unfortunately, so did he. He grabbed that glass globe his followers used to create Anarki and flashed out. After that, I grabbed a couple of the captured soldiers and left.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Fuck!\u0094 Ice spat the word everyone was thinking.</p><p>\u0093At least we blew up his facility and damn near a thousand zombies,\u0094 Duke added.</p><p>Including his friend. Pain stabbed Caden in the gut, but even as it did, he knew he had to let go. What was done, was done. War was hell. He just didn\u0092t want to suffer any more losses.</p><p>\u0093How was he making them in the first place?\u0094 Caden demanded. \u0093What is that glass sphere? One of those soldiers was my friend.\u0094</p><p>Mercy tempered Bram\u0092s battle-fierce expression for a moment. \u0093I don\u0092t know. A wizard can torture a human\u0092s soul from him and replace their will with his bidding. Normally, he can convert but a few at a time at the cost of a great deal of energy. That glass ball his followers were wielding is a mystery to me. I\u0092ll start investigating.\u0094</p><p>Then Bram\u0092s mercy hardened, and he glared at Caden. \u0093The bad news is, Mathias got away. We were supposed to have more time to trap him so he\u0092d go up in flames with the building. We agreed to that plan. Why the bloody hell did you detonate off the charge early?\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s temper spiked. He wasn\u0092t one of the Doomsday Brethren. Bram wasn\u0092t his commanding officer.</p><p>But you agreed to help, whispered the pesky voice in his head. He\u0092d had a mission and he\u0092d panicked and jettisoned the mission. Period.</p><p>\u0093The Anarki had Sydney cornered and were about to kill her. I got her out.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn you!\u0094 Bram charged from behind his desk and got in Caden\u0092s face. \u0093If you\u0092d learn some bloody magic, you might have saved her without aborting the mission.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I used it!\u0094</p><p>Bram raised a brow. \u0093On purpose?\u0094 Into Caden\u0092s silence, he added, \u0093Because of your stubborn refusal to learn magic, we blew our surprise and perhaps Shock\u0092s cover so you could save Sydney. The fact she\u0092s your mate and you won\u0092t claim her is clouding your judgment.\u0094</p><p>Caden absorbed Bram\u0092s words with anger and guilt. He hated it, but the wizard was right.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re no longer fighting with us. If your brother needs help, ring me. Otherwise, until you embrace your magic,\u0094 Bram shook his head. \u0093Get out.\u0094</p><p>Caden stomped up the stairs. Get out? He\u0092d be more than bloody happy to. Bram ordering him gone hadn\u0092t hurt in the least. That was fury brewing in his gut. Definitely. He didn\u0092t need this group of wizards. In fact, he didn\u0092t belong tangled up in magic. He\u0092d take Lucan back to his own house, as the healer recommended. Bram\u0092s assistance hadn\u0092t helped locate Anka, so Caden would continue that quest alone. He\u0092d grab his belongings, his brother, and go.</p><p>But what about Sydney?</p><p>She couldn\u0092t return to her human life, and unless he mated with her, he had no business taking her with him. She would be safer with Bram and the others, especially now that Mathias had seen her face. It all made sense except . . . the thought of leaving her made him want to tear something apart with his bare hands. How the hell could he protect Sydney from a distance?</p><p>He couldn\u0092t.</p><p>\u0093Ouch! Damn it, I thought magical healing would be less painful. Did you fry my skin together?\u0094</p><p>Sydney. At the top of the stairs, he shook his head wryly. Even when his life was shit, she amused him. He had to figure out some way to watch over her and his brother. He wasn\u0092t going to leave her when her life was in danger. After all, the diary had been stolen out from under Bram, so clearly the wizard made mistakes.</p><p>Lately, Caden had been riding the thin line between the magical heritage he rejected and the human world he embraced. He\u0092d continue doing it to keep Sydney alive. He refused to step over the line while she sought the very world he wanted to escape. As much as he loved her, they wanted different futures. Given that, linking his survival to her as his mate made little sense. She\u0092d never be happy if she followed him to his human existence in Dallas. He had no doubt that if he mated with Sydney, with her so determined to help magickind, she\u0092d end up dead and he\u0092d become exactly like his brother.</p><p>Being back in the UK had been a homecoming, but if he remained with Sydney, she\u0092d want him to join the Doomsday Brethren. Today\u0092s battle had made him feel vital and part of a unit again, but he\u0092d screwed up. Lost his edge. Maybe losing his platoon had done that. Whatever it was, he didn\u0092t want to endure the pain again or put Bram and the others at risk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Bram had ceased Caden\u0092s involvement with the Doomsday Brethren, he needed to do the same with Sydney. After settling Lucan in at home, he\u0092d protect her, but no more.</p><p>As he entered the bedroom, Sabelle left, answering his unspoken question as she did. \u0093Conrad just left. Sydney\u0092s fine.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Indeed,\u0094 Sydney insisted as she dug into her handbag and extracted the camera. \u0093Help me edit this film? I know you\u0092re against me transcasting, but you saw how evil Mathias was. We can\u0092t let him continue to run amok. I want to transcast within the hour.\u0094</p><p>His advice was going to fall on deaf ears, but Caden felt compelled to say it. \u0093You understand that there\u0092s no going back? You\u0092ll both incur Mathias\u0092s supreme wrath and be trapped in magickind forever.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Trapped?\u0094 She frowned. \u0093I have a chance now to save lives and achieve everything I ever dreamed. Nothing worth doing is without risk.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Pretty speech. I don\u0092t think it will comfort you when Mathias tries to kill you. I\u0092m not helping you transcast.\u0094</p><p>She cocked her head and peered at him, clearly puzzling something out. \u0093You\u0092re walking away and leaving this mess to Bram and the others and wasting your abilities when you could be helping, too.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Bram tossed me out, and I\u0092m leaving something I never wanted to be involved in.\u0094</p><p>Sydney paused, drew back. \u0093You\u0092re leaving me as well.\u0094</p> <p>Caden saw no reason to beat about the bush. \u0093I\u0092ll protect you. I can\u0092t be this close, care this much, and lose you. I . . . can\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>Clenching her fists, Sydney tried to hold back sudden tears. And failed. \u0093I don\u0092t understand you. First, you ran from your parents and your heritage, spent ten years trying to be American and human, when you\u0092re neither. You came back to help your brother, why? Obligation? Because you couldn\u0092t avoid it without feeling like a heel? You\u0092re not running from the Doomsday Brethren and me. You\u0092re running from yourself\u0097like you have been your whole life.\u0094</p><p>Caden accepted the rebuke in silence. Sydney simply didn\u0092t understand. Nor could she relate to the tangle of affection and duty he felt for Lucan after losing Westin. And she had no way of comprehending the disastrous results of a failed magical mating. Would it make a difference if she did? No, it was too late now. Some things simply weren\u0092t meant to be.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ve oversimplified everything,\u0094 he said.</p><p>\u0093Have I? Explain to me exactly how this isn\u0092t running from your destiny.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p> <p>\u0093SYDNEY, I DON\u0092T EXPECT you to understand.\u0094</p><p>Which meant he wasn\u0092t even going to try to explain. Grief felt like a blow to the chest.</p><p>\u0093Make me understand. Why?\u0094</p><p>He raked a frustrated hand through mussed brown hair.</p><p>\u0093Magic isn\u0092t always . . . good.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mathias proves that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I mean that using magic, even the sort you think is good, can change your life in terrible ways.\u0094</p><p>His words renewed her dread. She\u0092d fantasized about him in the Doomsday Diary to lure him to her side. Had that changed their lives in terrible ways? The possibility sounded ugly. How much, if any, of their affection and passion was due strictly to the book\u0092s magic?</p> <p>\u0093You\u0092re always so bloody vague, raising more questions than you answer.\u0094</p><p>Sighing, pacing, he grasped for words. \u0093Magic is all new and interesting to you now, but it\u0092s ripped apart my life more than once.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Change happens in everyone\u0092s lives, whether you\u0092re magical or not. Tell me what\u0092s so terrible\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093No point except to dredge up bad memories and burden you with tragedies you can\u0092t change. I just need to go.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You belong here, fighting beside these warriors. I think you belong beside me, as well.\u0094 She pressed her lips together to hold in tears. \u0093I\u0092ve fallen in love with you. You used magic today to save me, though you hate it. You must care about me a bit. Perhaps, in time, it could be real\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093It is real.\u0094 His blue eyes burned with truth.</p><p>But a niggle of doubt remained.</p><p>Caden\u0092s slumped shoulders and the exhausted lines bracketing his eyes and mouth made him look like defeat on two legs. \u0093I wish the answer was as simple as love, firecracker. But taking the next step with you means accepting magic I don\u0092t trust. It\u0092s too uncontrollable.\u0094</p><p>Though she knew better, Sydney couldn\u0092t stop fighting for them. \u0093So is life!\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve died a hundred times with the desire to kiss you, but if I do, we would be mated for life. You would adopt my lifespan, so that means hundreds of years, literally.\u0094 He wrapped warm hands around her shoulders, and Sydney wished he\u0092d welcome her farther into his embrace. \u0093But if you keep to this path, you\u0092re going to die\u0097and take me down with you. I can\u0092t stand by and watch. It will drive me mad.\u0094</p><p>His every word was a pick ax to the heart, and she struggled to comprehend his reasons for walking away from greatness and love for the mundane and lonely. \u0093So you\u0092d prefer to end it, just to be safe?\u0094</p><p>Caden hesitated. \u0093You\u0092ve chosen to remain, and I\u0092m going to protect you. But mating in the middle of a war with both of us on the front lines, there would be consequences you can\u0092t begin to comprehend.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Explain them.\u0094</p><p>He sighed. \u0093Even if I did, it would change nothing. We want different lives. I won\u0092t lie and say I don\u0092t love you or that I don\u0092t wish things could be different. But I\u0092d be doing us both a disservice if I spoke the Call.\u0094 Caden looked at her then with bleak, hollow eyes. The expression magnified as he touched her cheek and leaned in to hold her close and kiss her forehead. \u0093I\u0092ll remain your bodyguard, nothing more.\u0094</p><p>Sydney pulled away from his embrace. A deep, heavy ache spread across her chest, shattering her heart into a million pieces. \u0093I\u0092ll do my damnedest to make you regret your choice.\u0094</p><p>She grabbed the video camera, hurt pounding inside her. But she hesitated. That tousled hair that curled at the ends, those electric eyes, the ripped body . . . yes, at first he\u0092d been a walking fantasy, and she\u0092d lusted after him. But soon, she\u0092d discovered the man beneath, the one who put his brother first, who believed in her, who made love passionately, who fought to protect her even when he wanted to run away.</p><p>But it appeared that magic was a hurdle they couldn\u0092t overcome. Sydney wasn\u0092t going to walk away from magickind. This had become more than a story to her. Bram and the others were a handful against a powerful evil. If she could help them, she would. She\u0092d proudly do this job until she could return to the human world to tell the best story ever about magickind.</p><p>Pity she\u0092d take the spotlight alone.</p><p>\u0093No doubt you\u0092ll achieve all your ambitions. I\u0092ll miss you.\u0094</p><p>Tears burning her eyes, she watched Caden leave.</p><p>\u0093 . . . sobering video from a fight that took place earlier today. Mathias D\u0092Arc is definitely back and, as you saw, is abducting soldiers from around the world and converting them to zombies to make his army. He and his followers have attacked at least four Privileged families, killing many and abducting the women. Take precautions. Keep close watch on all family members. Never stray far from your wand. Have some means of communication nearby. If you\u0092re being attacked, contact Bram Rion. Updates will follow as necessary. I\u0092m Sydney Blair. Stay safe. Good afternoon.\u0094</p><p>With that, Bram waved a hand in front of the ancient, heavy mirror hanging in the library. Beside him, Sabelle stood with a smile, despite the strain on her face.</p><p>\u0093Good job,\u0094 Bram praised, exiting into the hall. \u0093Angry Council members will scream their displeasure in mere moments, I suspect, but at least innocent people have been warned.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ve done the right thing,\u0094 Sabelle added, following Bram.</p><p>Nodding, he sighed and approached Sydney. \u0093Are you all right?\u0094</p><p>Define all right, she thought. Transcasting the news of Mathias\u0092s return had been both exhilarating and bittersweet. Without Caden here to cheer her on, hold her hand, love her afterward . . . a part of her was missing.</p><p>\u0093Fine.\u0094 Melancholy and exhaustion made holding her plastic smile a Herculean task.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll pretend I believe you and wait for the deluge of messages in my office. The rest of the warriors and I should talk, plan our next moves.\u0094 He paused and placed a hand on her shoulder. \u0093You\u0092ve done us a great service at much risk to yourself. I appreciate you. I know the others do as well.\u0094</p><p>Looking tired but determined, Bram left.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t know what he\u0092s going to do,\u0094 Sabelle murmured after he\u0092d cleared the room.</p><p>\u0093Do?\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092s nearly out of energy and cannot find his mate,\u0094 the witch explained. \u0093Thus far, he\u0092s only skimmed the barest amount from a surrogate. I hope he finds this mystery woman soon. Or takes more energy. He\u0092s too important to the cause to go on like this.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What will happen if he doesn\u0092t?\u0094</p><p>\u0093He\u0092ll die. It\u0092s why I\u0092ve been tending Caden\u0092s brother. Technically, he\u0092s no longer mated since Anka broke with him, but he rejected all females until I duped him into believing I was her. His condition is awful. He\u0092s keeping his strength now, but his mind . . . I don\u0092t know if he\u0092ll recover.\u0094</p><p>Caden had returned to the UK for his brother and had reluctantly admitted that Lucan had a mental imbalance, but nothing more. Now she saw the truth he\u0092d avoided telling her. Sabelle\u0092s explanation made all the pieces click into place. Lucan\u0092s magical \u0093divorce\u0094 from Anka had caused Lucan\u0092s condition. Could Caden be rejecting a future with me, not because I\u0092d written in the diary, but because he feared becoming like his brother?</p><p>Oh. Dear God.</p><p>Suddenly, Sabelle speared Sydney with a direct stare. \u0093You\u0092re right. Sorry to read your mind. Terrible habit. Caden is terrified of becoming like Lucan.\u0094 She shook her head. \u0093I hope Caden finds Anka before it\u0092s too late.\u0094</p><p>She had to see the man, had to know what had spooked Caden. Trying to fight something she couldn\u0092t see and scarcely understood was both stupid and impossible.</p><p>\u0093When Caden left, I told him I would be by shortly to see Lucan. I\u0092m certain they\u0092re settled in at Lucan\u0092s townhouse. I think it\u0092s time you see the dangerous side of magic.\u0094</p><p>She hardly needed more proof to understand magic\u0092s potential peril. But perhaps this would unravel the rest of the complicated puzzle of Caden.</p><p>\u0093Of course.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No pictures. I simply want you to understand, not report.\u0094</p><p>Naturally. If I reported on Lucan\u0092s condition, it might spur Mathias to take the mates of other Doomsday Brethren.</p><p>\u0093Just Bram,\u0094 Sabelle provided. \u0093Marrok isn\u0092t a wizard, and none of the others are fully mated.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Fully mated?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle began trudging her way up the stairs. \u0093Remember when I told you about the Call? They ask, you answer, then you\u0092re mated?\u0094</p><p>She nodded. \u0093It sounded simple enough, so how can someone be partially mated?\u0094</p><p>\u0093They ask and they\u0092re refused.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But if they\u0092re refused, how can the bond be established?\u0094</p><p>\u0093The wizard takes a mate in his heart when he speaks the words. Whether or not he genuinely means them or the feelings are reciprocated, he is bound by that Call. Until the woman dies, he is hers exclusively.\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s jaw dropped as she followed the woman. \u0093And one of these big warriors\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Shock. He Called to Anka shortly before Lucan did and was eventually Renounced.\u0094</p><p>Another jaw dropper. Lucan and Shock quarreling over the same woman?</p><p>\u0093For over a century. When Lucan slipped into mate mourning, we called Caden here to care for his brother. He\u0092s afraid because he knows you\u0092re his, but has seen firsthand the tragic possibilities of mating.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle reached the top of the stairs and headed for a corner room in the family wing. Sydney had never been to this side of the estate, and when the witch pushed her way into a glamorous room, Sydney\u0092s jaw threatened to drop once more. Sumptuous cream silk bedding with golden touches was relieved by hints of melted chocolate. The walls were warm, the drapes swagged, the furniture of dark, glossy wood. Crystal candlesticks gleamed, plush furniture lounged. The room fit Sabelle completely.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s lovely.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle smiled. \u0093My haven. I just need to grab a few things. Should only be a moment.\u0094</p><p>Why not just summon objects? Sydney wondered.</p><p>The beautiful witch sent her a chiding stare. \u0093I\u0092m saving my energy for what\u0092s to come.\u0094</p><p>She grabbed a cape, a length of silk, rope, and a pair of handcuffs. Sydney\u0092s brows raised.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t know what I\u0092m facing over there,\u0094 Sabelle explained. \u0093Here, we had Lucan well restrained so he wouldn\u0092t be a danger to anyone.\u0094</p><p>Suddenly, Sydney wasn\u0092t sure she wanted to see Lucan after all. But Sabelle grabbed her arm. Blackness and that topsy-turvy feeling invaded her stomach. A weightless feel left her at odds and ends.</p><p>Then the floor appeared beneath them, and they zoomed into a room straight out of Tuscany, with walls like an autumn afternoon and drapes the color of wine, accented by a gleaming hardwood floor.</p><p>The only thing out of place was the snarling man secured by rope to all four corners of the bed. His dark hair had been pulled back, revealing a face that would normally be considered handsome. It was so like Caden\u0092s with high cheekbones, a wide mouth, a sculpted jaw. But instead of the familiar vibrant blue, Lucan\u0092s eyes were just angry black pinpricks. No warmth or passion, as feral as a wild wolf\u0092s.</p><p>Lucan snapped his unfocused gaze in their direction and roared, struggling against his bonds as the bed creaked. Surprise pinged through Sydney. She stepped back. Way back.</p><p>\u0093Losing Anka did this to him?\u0094</p><p>Sabelle nodded solemnly.</p><p>He missed his mate so much that he\u0092d lost his mind? Sydney had never met Lucan, but she ached for him and the pain he was obviously enduring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093Because she\u0092s no longer mated to him? Doesn\u0092t that release him? Or does he suffer because the break was against his will?\u0094</p><p>\u0093It doesn\u0092t matter why the mating ends. Magic makes the ties between mates stronger than humans. Unlike divorce, there\u0092s a magical connection that doesn\u0092t simply disappear because the union is over.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Even under all his madness, he misses her?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Lucan doesn\u0092t remember who he is but, he knows Anka at a core level. I can only give him energy by tricking him into believing I\u0092m her. I use her soap and shampoo, wear her clothes, whatever is necessary.\u0094</p> <p>Under all that torment, Lucan waited for his one true love. And she might be gone from him forever. Tears welled.</p><p>\u0093But if Anka is free of Mathias and has left Aquarius, why doesn\u0092t she return to Lucan?\u0094</p><p>\u0093She doesn\u0092t remember him. Magic\u0092s way of ensuring survival of the species, I suppose. She\u0092s currently mateless and in need of a male with whom she can charge her energy. If she remembered Lucan and suffered as he does, she\u0092d never allow another to mount her and potentially impregnate her. Conceiving is possible, but difficult if unmated, and with Lucan in her memory and heart, she\u0092d likely never mate again.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Nor will Lucan.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Men who have been well mated usually emerge from their mate mourning with a strong yearning to mate again.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Usually? I hear uncertainty in your voice.\u0094</p><p>Sabelle winced. \u0093Lucan may be different. . . .\u0094</p><p>Sydney dared to glance at Lucan again. His gleaming chest and shoulders rippled with each strain against the ropes. His growl was a threat that sent shivers down her spine. His love must be powerful, indeed. And Sabelle had tricked him into bedding her?</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s the only way to keep him alive.\u0094</p><p>Caden\u0092s reluctance to mate made sense now. He liked being in control. Lucan\u0092s descent into madness because of magic would be the worst horror to a soldier with such self command.</p><p>They were in the midst of a war, and Sydney had put herself straight in the path of danger. Coupled with the fact she\u0092d brought Caden to her side by foul means\u0097even if the book no longer played a role between them\u0097his retreat made a sad sort of sense.</p> <p>She bit her lip. She needed to talk to him, if only to say that she understood. \u0093Is Caden here?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sure he is. He doesn\u0092t know we\u0092re here. Lucan long ago allowed Bram and me to visit without chiming in.\u0094 Sabelle handed her a little white rock. \u0093I\u0092m leaving, since Lucan\u0092s energy is holding and I\u0092m not needed. When you\u0092re ready to return, just toss this stone in the air and say my name. I\u0092ll return for you.\u0094 Sabelle hugged her, then warned, \u0093Given his worries about Lucan and Mathias\u0092s backlash, Caden may be a bit on edge.\u0094</p><p>A shuffle and a quiet knock on the family room door, Caden twisted around in the plush recliner, expecting to see Sabelle. The sight of Sydney punched him with a breathless rush of thrill and need.</p><p>He\u0092d been away from her for four hours and missed her with a frightening intensity, like a junkie craving a fix. After settling Lucan back into his home, Caden had done little except pace and sweat and wish to God he could hear or smell or touch Sydney. Or taste her. He had to get his desire under control before he could protect her. Worse, his energy was waning, and he realized that as an unmated male, he could bed anyone. And must do so soon.</p><p>But he only wanted her.</p><p>Then his brain kicked in. Why was she here? Sabelle, he realized. And the only reason for the witch to visit was Lucan.</p><p>Anxiety buzzed his blood, and he fought to rein in the curse on the tip of his tongue. Sydney now knew far more about his objections. That fact softened her normally sharp gaze.</p><p>Damn it, she felt sorry for him.</p> <p>\u0093I know you\u0092re not expecting me.\u0094 She took a hesitant step into the room, eyes flicking to the book on the nearby table. \u0093I don\u0092t mean to barge in, but I had to see you. Why didn\u0092t you tell me about Lucan and his mate mourning?\u0094</p><p>Caden took a hesitant step closer\u0097but not too close. That would be dangerous. \u0093It doesn\u0092t change anything.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But your refusal to share with me does. I only wanted the truth.\u0094</p><p>She rushed across the room to stand by his side. Her smell blindsided him with hunger and longing. He dug his fingers into his thigh to keep from reaching out and hauling her into his arms.</p><p>\u0093I understand now what you fear,\u0094 she murmured. \u0093Why you\u0092ve avoided mating with me. Your brother has lost all control, and that\u0092s something you strive to retain. I\u0092m sorry for him, but you don\u0092t know that Lucan\u0092s condition would become yours\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Given the way you\u0092ve thrown yourself into a war, I do. Your bravery is commendable, but it\u0092s placed you in grave danger. You don\u0092t take precautions, and I know you\u0092ll try to refuse my protection, even if I insist you follow my rules\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your rules? I\u0092m hardly a child in need of guidance.\u0094</p><p>He stepped closer, toe to toe, towering over her. That spicy-sweet scent of hers infiltrated and intoxicated his senses, tightening his gut. The inevitable erection sprang to life moments later. He had to get rid of her quickly. His resistance to her kiss was weakening.</p><p>\u0093You met Mathias face-to-face and duped him. Angered him. He won\u0092t forget that. Or the fact you revealed him to magickind. He will hunt you down and torture you. Why didn\u0092t you use caution? Bow out?\u0094 he growled, ready to tear his hair out. \u0093Now it\u0092s too late. In less than two weeks my desire for you has grown far beyond rational. If we mated, there\u0092s no question I would become like my brother.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m clever, and you\u0092ll protect me. Bram and the others will, too.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No. I\u0092m no longer involved.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You should be. Don\u0092t you see? Strength in numbers. If you stayed with the others, we\u0092d be safer and making a difference. If we mated, we\u0092d have each other. I don\u0092t need more.\u0094 She paused, bit her lip. \u0093I should tell you something\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I feel the same and more, but if I mated with you, I could probably count our time together in days on the fist of one hand. This is war. Mathias is like . . . magickind\u0092s ultimate sociopath. Determined, smart, charismatic, powerful and willing to kill. And he won\u0092t die by a simple bullet, as you saw in his warehouse.\u0094</p><p>\u0093We\u0092ve weakened his army,\u0094 she argued. \u0093Taking the fight to him was the right thing to do, and using the book as bait was perfect. Maybe peace will come shortly, and we will have wasted precious time together.\u0094</p><p>Caden raked a frustrated hand through his hair. They were talking in circles, and still she wouldn\u0092t understand. \u0093Peace? Last time Mathias was vanquished, it took decades and an army of experienced wizards. Many died. Too many were sacrificed.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The same is true in human wars. And like those, we don\u0092t have any control over who lives or who dies. We only have control over what we do with our time together.\u0094 She squeezed his hand. \u0093If Lucan and Anka\u0092s separation has shown anything, it should be that, while lovers can suffer, love itself endures. Even without remembering Lucan, Anka knew she was missing someone dear.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And Lucan has been reduced to an animal.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Who still pines for his mate. You fear becoming like Lucan so much you would rather skip whatever time we might have together? If that\u0092s so, you don\u0092t love me as I love you.\u0094 She sniffed. \u0093And maybe I\u0092ve no one to blame but myself.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I love you.\u0094 Caden couldn\u0092t stand it anymore, and he grabbed her shoulders. \u0093But I won\u0092t be able to endure the pain of losing you!\u0094</p><p>\u0093People live, they love . . . and they die. That\u0092s unavoidable.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But I lose over and over again.\u0094 A well of memories and fears rose inside him, drowning out logic and caution. Opening his past to her would change everything. But continuing to hide the truth was hurting her, and he couldn\u0092t bear that anymore.</p><p>\u0093I can\u0092t find Anka, and Lucan is likely going to die. Just today, I had to kill one of my old Marine buddies in Mathias\u0092s warehouse. It was one of the hardest things I\u0092ve ever done. And still not as terrible as the day I lost my younger brother, Westin.\u0094</p><p>Sydney paused, then wrapped warm hands around his biceps, offering silent support.</p><p>Caden swallowed. \u0093I was twelve. After Lucan, my parents had tried for over two hundred years to have another child. They were elderly when I was born, but Westin surprised them ten years later.</p><p>\u0093He wasn\u0092t quite two when we went out one summer morning to play. Westin was my shadow. He looked up to me. And I loved him . . . God.\u0094</p><p>Tears hacked at the back of his eyes, stinging. He hadn\u0092t let himself think about that day or cry since Westin\u0092s burial. Remembering his chapped little cheeks and happy giggles now was like opening a chasm in his soul.</p><p>\u0093It\u0092s okay if you can\u0092t say more now.\u0094</p><p>But he couldn\u0092t stop. \u0093I was chasing him, pretending I was going to scoop him up and tickle him until he cried uncle. He ran, as always. But that day, he tripped.\u0094</p><p>He could see it in his mind, those little feet stumbling, chubby hands flying. Why didn\u0092t closing his eyes make the vision go away?</p><p>\u0093And he fell?\u0094 Sydney promoted softly.</p><p>The only heat in his body came from her soft stroke of his arm. Everything else inside him was dead cold. He swallowed.</p><p>\u0093Yes. And hit his head on a stone wall.\u0094</p><p>As he said the words, he could see Westin collide with the wall, then crumble to the ground, blood spewing from a cut on a ragged rock, bruise bursting across his forehead.</p><p>Sydney gasped.</p><p>He stabbed his eyes with a thumb and forefinger. Choke out the rest. Get it over with. He owed her a reason for breaking her heart. \u0093I screamed, and my mother came running. She was rattled but promised that simple magic would make him \u0091right as rain\u0092 again. She squeezed my hand, and I remember feeling utter relief as she hovered her wand over Westin\u0092s wound. Instead of healing, he choked, sputtered, suffocated.\u0094</p><p>Beside him, Sydney frowned. \u0093I don\u0092t understand.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Her magic, meant to heal him, went awry and killed him. She was rattled, perhaps applied the wrong spell. After my mother stopped screaming, I remember the song of the same fucking birds that had been singing ten minutes ago, before my life changed.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Oh, I\u0092m so sorry, Caden.\u0094 Sydney wrapped her arms around him tightly.</p><p>How easy it would be to lean against her, let the balm of her love fill the festering wound inside him.</p><p>Easy but dangerous.</p><p>\u0093After that, my mother and I barely spoke. She retired to her bed and never left. I wouldn\u0092t blame her for hating me. I ran him into a wall and\u0097\u0094</p><p>Tears. Scalding drops made a path down his face and he wiped them away angrily, then drew in a rattling breath. \u0093I can\u0092t be with you. I shouldn\u0092t even love you. Because I\u0092ll lose you like I\u0092ve lost Westin and my mother, all my friends. And now Lucan. They all hurt like hell. But losing you too.\u0094 He shook his head. \u0093I\u0092d lose me. I\u0092d collapse inside myself and never come out. No reason left to live without you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You have every reason to live. Lucan isn\u0092t gone, and you\u0092re not going to lose me. We\u0092re going to fight this bastard and win.\u0094</p><p>He shook his head. There was too much at risk. \u0093My freedom, life, and heart are gone. I\u0092d like to keep my sanity.\u0094</p><p>Resignation stiffened her expression, and she stepped out of his embrace. \u0093I\u0092ve lost those things as well\u0097and I embraced those losses. I think they could lead to something wonderful.\u0094</p><p>Caden opened his mouth\u0097to say what, he had no idea. But just then a shrill female scream ripped through the house. Adrenaline surged through his bloodstream, and he pushed past Sydney and charged out of the room and down the hall. \u0093Sabelle!\u0094</p><p>Sydney was on his heels. \u0093Perhaps she didn\u0092t leave. Is Lucan hurting her?\u0094</p><p>Likely so, but if he confessed that, then Sydney would insist on helping. The woman truly didn\u0092t understand the peril she put herself in. Since he refused to assume the risk of mating with her, he had no right to dictate to her, but be damned, he couldn\u0092t hold his tongue.</p><p>As he reached Lucan and Anka\u0092s bedroom, he grabbed the knob and barked, \u0093Stay here!\u0094</p><p>He threw the door open and tried to slam it in her face, but Sydney resisted. As Caden saw the unfolding drama within, he stopped fighting her and stared in mute horror.</p><p>Lucan had been released from his bonds and scrambled to the end of the bed where he\u0092d captured a female underneath him, her blond hair twisting in ringlets across the bed and down to the floor. His face contorted with menace as his hands encircled her neck and squeezed.</p><p>Instead of struggling beneath him, the woman embraced him, holding as tight as possible, her whole body shaking. Something gentle and magical poured off her, flowing into Lucan. But Lucan and the witch weren\u0092t intimately entwined.</p><p>They were locked in a death struggle.</p><p>This witch didn\u0092t have Sabelle\u0092s magical signature, but a different one entirely.</p><p>She struggled to free her neck and turned her head, revealing a red, distressed face.</p><p>\u0093Anka!\u0094 Sydney gasped.</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t have time for surprise, not when Lucan was about to kill his own mate. Why didn\u0092t he recognize her? Somehow, someway, Caden had to stop Lucan from choking the life out of his beloved.</p><p>Shoving aside his dismay, Caden jumped into action, body slamming Lucan to drive him away from Anka.</p><p>\u0093No!\u0094 the witch choked out, the sound barely discernible above the din.</p><p>But primal instinct gave Lucan ferocity. He lifted one hand away from Anka\u0092s slender neck and backhanded Caden away with a roar. Caden hurtled across the room until his head hit one of the bedposts with a thump.</p><p>Pain exploded through the back of his skull. Cursing, he reached up to the sore spot. His hand came away sticky and wet with blood. Bloody hell! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another choked scream made Caden struggle to his feet. Lucan again had his fingers wrapped tightly around Anka\u0092s throat. As before, she clutched Lucan to her, rather than shoving him away. Did she want to die?</p><p>Caden pulled his mobile phone from his belt, Bram on ready speed dial.</p><p>\u0093Help is on the way,\u0094 Sydney said through a cloud of white smoke. \u0093Sabelle gave me one of those enchanted rock things. I\u0092ve just used it.\u0094</p><p>That impulsiveness and acceptance of magic might get her into trouble on occasion, but right now it just might save the day. He tucked the phone away, then crept toward his brother.</p> <p>It was up to him to stop another tragedy, another loss.</p><p>\u0093Lucan,\u0094 he murmured, panic invading his bones. God, he had to stop this. Lucan would never forgive himself if he killed Anka. \u0093You\u0092re hurting Anka. Remember Anka? Your mate.\u0094</p><p>Lucan\u0092s face turned more feral. \u0093Shock Denzell!\u0094</p><p>What did Shock have to do with Anka nearly gasping her last breath?</p><p>With that growl, Lucan\u0092s fingers again tightened on Anka\u0092s neck. Sydney stepped in, and Caden thrust out an arm to hold her back. He was about to have a tragedy on his hands. He didn\u0092t need two.</p> <p>\u0093No. Anka. Your Anka,\u0094 he insisted. \u0093Let her go.\u0094</p><p>Still, the little witch beneath him gripped Lucan tightly and trembled, even as her face turned red and her eyes began to roll back in her head.</p><p>Caden grabbed Lucan\u0092s wrists, but couldn\u0092t pry them apart. Anka drew in a wheezing gasp of a breath\u0097and brought Lucan closer to her. Caden tried to wedge himself between them, but both were frozen into place by determination, emotion, and that blasted magic.</p><p>Suddenly, Lucan stiffened. His eyes flew open wide as Anka melted beneath him, either unconscious or . . .</p><p>Dear God, no.</p><p>The expression on Lucan\u0092s face mirrored that thought. Caden could see the whites of his brother\u0092s eyes for the first time in a month. He focused as if he could actually see.</p> <p>As if scalded, Lucan ripped his hands from Anka\u0092s neck and sucked in a panicked gasp.</p><p>Caden rushed closer. Check Anka or restrain Lucan first? Ask questions or just start performing CPR and hope Lucan didn\u0092t kill him?</p><p>His brother saved him from answering that question by rasping out, \u0093What have I done?\u0094</p><p>Then he promptly melted into unconsciousness.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>CADEN STARED AT HIS brother, who sat on the couch in his family room, cradling his head in his hands. Lucan was alive and lucid . . . and broken.</p><p>If Caden had needed more proof of magic\u0092s capricious nature, he\u0092d gotten it today.</p><p>He didn\u0092t ask Lucan if he was all right. Such a stupid question. Caden knew the answer. How did a man face the sort of stunning twist of fate magic had forced Lucan to suffer today, nearly strangling his beloved wife?</p> <p>Sabelle had arrived in Lucan\u0092s bedroom, Bram, Duke, and Ice hot on her heels. Quickly, they\u0092d surmised that Lucan had entered a healthy, restorative sleep. Anka, though pale as death, had depleted her energy.</p><p>While Lucan had been trying to kill her, she\u0092d been holding onto him with every ounce of her energy, bravely fighting certain death to perform the helbresele spell. To heal his mate mourning. She had drained herself and nearly died in the process.</p><p>The good news was, Lucan came around quickly and assessed the damage, thrilled to have his mate back. An elated Lucan had curled his body protectively over Anka\u0092s, chanting his apology against her lips over and over. He clung to her, trying to share a bit of his energy with her with simple touches. It worked. The bad news? The first person Anka asked for was Shock.</p><p>Caden couldn\u0092t forget the way Lucan had staggered back, his guilt morphing, blending with betrayal.</p><p>Lucan had sat back on the bed, his face sharp with pain. \u0093That\u0092s why you smell like Shock. You\u0092ve been with him.\u0094</p><p>Anka\u0092s amber eyes welled up with tears, and the terrible truth became clear before she said a word.</p><p>\u0093I didn\u0092t remember you,\u0094 she whispered. \u0093I stayed with my human cousin, Aquarius. I hoped Mathias would never think to look for me there, in case he wished to torment me further. I remembered almost nothing about myself or my life.\u0094</p><p>Caden had gone to his brother\u0092s side and braced his hand on Lucan\u0092s shoulder in silent support. He wanted to be angry with Anka for hurting his brother, putting him through so much, and now betraying Lucan with his greatest enemy. But her sweet face and bowed mouth crumbled into pain and fear and anguish. She\u0092d been through a great deal, too.</p><p>Looking back on the incident three hours later, Caden worried. Despite the fact they seemed meant for each other, could all ever be well between them again? Or had blasted magic ruined something wonderful forever?</p><p>He already knew the answer to that question for him and Sydney.</p><p>\u0093But you remembered Shock.\u0094 Lucan had tensed beneath Caden\u0092s palm. \u0093Before you recalled me.\u0094</p><p>Anka then nodded, and fresh tears fell unimpeded down her pale cheeks. \u0093Once Mathias broke our bond, I remembered nothing. I suspected I\u0092d been mated, but I was weak and needed energy. I remembered Shock\u0092s Call.\u0094</p><p>Lucan looked away, clenching his jaw. Caden was certain that his brother was picturing his wife and his enemy embracing. Sharing pleasure. He hurt for Lucan. Imagining Sydney with another man was like an open wound in Caden\u0092s gut.</p><p>No one else in the room said a word.</p><p>Drawing a few deep breaths, Lucan finally turned back to his former mate. \u0093You remember me now. Come home.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not the same woman,\u0094 the exhausted witch said sadly.</p><p>\u0093You no longer need Shock anymore. You have me.\u0094</p><p>Anka gathered her strength and grasped Lucan\u0092s hand. \u0093I do need him. Everything between you and me is a treasured memory. But I need time . . . I can\u0092t simply step back into my old life and be the same woman I was.\u0094</p><p>Lucan grabbed her shoulders. \u0093Because I failed to protect you?\u0094</p><p>She barely managed to shake her head as tears threatened to overtake her. \u0093What Mathias did to me changed me. I can\u0092t just . . . be happy again. I don\u0092t know what I want, what to believe.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You don\u0092t have to.\u0094 He squeezed her hands tight. \u0093I\u0092ll heal you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t deserve you. You don\u0092t know what I did with him.\u0094 Her eyes squeezed shut as shame washed over her.</p><p>\u0093Against your will!\u0094</p><p>\u0093It started that way. But then . . .\u0094 She squeezed her eyes shut as tears streamed down. \u0093I begged him.\u0094</p><p>Lucan swallowed. \u0093He compelled you. Don\u0092t think for a second that I fault you. I left you unprotected, and Mathias abducted you. I love you\u0097\u0094</p><p>She withdrew from his grasp. \u0093Don\u0092t. I came to see you as soon as I remembered. I\u0092m sorry for the way our mating ended. I wanted to make certain you weren\u0092t suffering.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Without you? Every day. I have no one to blame but myself for\u0097\u0094 Lucan choked on his next words. \u0093For Mathias violating you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093He hurt you, too,\u0094 she breathed, her eyes nearly closing as her energy waned. \u0093Until today, I never imagined how deeply. Had to perform the helbresele spell.\u0094</p><p>Her eyes slid shut.</p><p>\u0093It nearly killed you.</p><p>I nearly killed you.\u0094 Lucan eased her onto her back and leaned over her, stroking her pale curls. \u0093Yet, rather than teleporting away, you\u0092ve stayed.\u0094</p><p>Silently, Caden had to agree with the unspoken part of Lucan\u0092s sentence; Anka\u0092s actions revealed strong feelings for her former mate. But her eyes fluttered open and she crossed her arms over her chest and eased from beneath him.</p><p>Confusion overtook Lucan\u0092s expression, and Caden\u0092s heart broke for him. Though this tense moment wasn\u0092t his, he found himself holding his breath, wishing for a happy outcome for his brother. After what he and Anka had endured, surely they deserved as much. But magickind wasn\u0092t a Hallmark world.</p><p>\u0093I had to make things as right for you as I could,\u0094 she slurred. \u0093Now I must go.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No!\u0094 Lucan clenched his fists at his sides looking somewhere between blindsided and helpless. \u0093Don\u0092t. I\u0092ll care for you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093And you\u0092ll expect everything to be as it was.\u0094 Her mouth trembled as she began to cry. \u0093I\u0092ve experienced too much. I\u0092ve been with Shock. We can\u0092t sweep that under the rug. He will always be between us. Maybe he always was.\u0094</p><p>Lucan looked like he wanted to refute Anka\u0097and couldn\u0092t.</p><p>\u0093In time, we could recover.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll always treasure our time together. But Mathias . . .\u0094 She choked on tears. \u0093You\u0092re a wonderful man, but you must see that I\u0092m ruined. I won\u0092t make you endure that,\u0094 Anka murmured, then turned to Bram. \u0093Will you take me to Shock?\u0094</p><p>Though Lucan fought and argued, Anka sent him a contrite stare, then allowed Bram to teleport her out.</p><p>Sydney lingered, looking as if she wanted to talk, but there was no need. The regret on her face told him that she understood his reluctance to mate now. He couldn\u0092t have illustrated it more clearly if he\u0092d drawn her a picture.</p><p>Finally, she left with Ice, Sabelle, and Duke.</p><p>Then Caden was alone with Lucan, who quickly decided his best friend was a bottle. Lucan hadn\u0092t had a sober moment since.</p><p>Shadow crept into the room as Caden looked over at his big brother, cradling his head in his hands, a mostly empty whiskey bottle on the table in front of him. Caden had no idea what to say. Platitudes that all would be well and time healed wounds seemed inane and insulting. He wasn\u0092t sure time would heal this wound, ever.</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t stare at me. Say something,\u0094 Lucan growled.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t know what to say.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I haven\u0092t seen you in years. Your presence is a surprise.\u0094 Lucan laughed bitterly. \u0093One of many. When did you arrive?\u0094</p><p>\u0093When your mate mourning began.\u0094</p><p>A reluctant smile tugged at Lucan\u0092s mouth before he took another swig. \u0093Bram come after you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sabelle, on Bram\u0092s orders.\u0094 \u0093Bet you hated returning.\u0094</p><p>Words couldn\u0092t express how much, but saying that to Lucan would only increase his guilt. \u0093I\u0092m fine.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m glad you\u0092re back. You can\u0092t be truly happy in the States. You loved home so much when you were little.\u0094</p><p>Loved home? Caden remembered the wonderful summer days before Westin\u0092s death. A lifetime ago, really. He hadn\u0092t thought of those times in decades, romping with his father and younger brother in the fields, playing magical hero, his mother vowing that would be his future.</p><p>How much everything had changed.</p><p>\u0093The States are home now.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ll be going back, then?\u0094 Lucan scowled.</p><p>Not until he was certain Lucan was okay and settled. Not until he found some way to protect Sydney from danger. \u0093Eventually.\u0094</p><p>Lucan sighed. \u0093I see you transitioned. Recently?\u0094</p><p>Caden nodded. \u0093Last week. Terrible stuff.\u0094</p><p>Lucan took another long swallow. \u0093You have a strong signature. Powerful magic. Have you used it yet?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not much.\u0094 Caden couldn\u0092t meet Lucan\u0092s eyes. His brother had chosen a magic life for himself, and Caden wondered if Lucan would understand his decision otherwise. \u0093I\u0092d rather not. Magic brings nothing but destruction and heartache\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093And days filled with endless possibilities. Westin\u0092s death wasn\u0092t your fault. Or Mum\u0092s.\u0094</p><p>Caden looked at him with burning eyes. \u0093Westin should never have died. I should have taken him elsewhere to play. Mum\u0092s spell\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093In both the human and magical world, accidents happen.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Magic killed him\u0097and took Anka from you, through no fault of your own.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094 Looking down into the bottle, Lucan hesitated. \u0093I hold the blame.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What? Don\u0092t assume Mathias\u0092s guilt. You couldn\u0092t be with Anka all day, every day. You did your best to protect\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not enough. Mathias took her and . . . I didn\u0092t save her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Damn magic threw you into mate mourning. If not for that\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Even if I hadn\u0092t been in mate mourning, I still would have been out of my mind with worry. The truth is, I failed to consider that Mathias might make her a target when I joined the Doomsday Brethren. Now, I\u0092m reaping what I\u0092ve sown.\u0094</p><p>Caden wanted to reassure Lucan that he couldn\u0092t have known, but the first rule of combat was to expect the unexpected.</p><p>\u0093I haven\u0092t a clue what will happen,\u0094 Lucan went on. \u0093I don\u0092t want to give up on Anka, and the fact she hasn\u0092t accepted Shock\u0092s outstanding Mating Call gives me hope, but I nearly killed her. I didn\u0092t protect her when I should have. How can she forgive me?\u0094</p><p>No doubt, Lucan still loved her. Profound sadness crept through Caden, and the tragedy wasn\u0092t even his. \u0093I\u0092m sorry.\u0094</p><p>Lucan shrugged. \u0093Who gave me energy while I was out of my mind?\u0094</p><p>\u0093We hired surrogates. Do you remember?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I remember women who smelled terrible. I remember being angry. I could see nothing, hear very little, but smell guided me. Then I remember a woman who smelled much like Anka . . . at first. The last time she came to me, I scented Sabelle.\u0094 Lucan winced. \u0093Tell me I didn\u0092t use my best friend\u0092s sister.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m sorry.\u0094 Caden could only apologize. Lying would do no good.</p><p>Lucan cursed. \u0093I owe her an apology for my rough behavior, I\u0092m certain. And a great deal of gratitude. She\u0092s an amazing woman.\u0094</p><p>Caden couldn\u0092t argue that. \u0093Indeed.\u0094</p><p>A long silence followed, and Caden reached for his own bottle, swallowing the sting of the alcohol, letting it burn a path from his throat to his stomach.</p><p>\u0093Let\u0092s talk of something more pleasant,\u0094 Lucan suggested. \u0093Tell me about the saucy redhead who left with Bram and the others.\u0094</p><p>Caden tensed. \u0093Sydney Blair. She\u0092s a reporter for a human tabloid.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She has feelings for you.\u0094</p><p>Damn, Lucan had always been perceptive. Caden nodded.</p><p>\u0093You have feelings for her, as well. You\u0092ve adopted a bit of her color in your signature. Despite the fact you haven\u0092t spoken the Call, she\u0092s your mate.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too perceptive. \u0093It doesn\u0092t matter.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Would she refuse you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can we change the subject?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Talking about your problems gets my mind off my own.\u0094 Lucan grabbed the whiskey off the nearby table and took another swig with a lopsided grin. He\u0092d had just enough alcohol to numb his pain and enough mischief to exploit Caden\u0092s pity. Sod. \u0093Would she say no?\u0094</p> <p>\u0093She\u0092d accept.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You haven\u0092t mated with her because . . . you want a witch?\u0094</p><p>Caden snorted. Lucan must know better than that. \u0093Of course not.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You don\u0092t love her?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I do.\u0094</p> <p>Lucan stroked his chin as if perplexed. \u0093She\u0092s against magic?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Quite the opposite. She persuaded Bram to allow her to transcast news of Mathias\u0092s return.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The Council agreed?\u0094 Lucan looked genuinely shocked.</p><p>\u0093No. Bram finally agreed that distributing the information without their blessing was best.\u0094</p><p>\u0093There will be hell to pay. Good for him, doing the right thing. Sydney wants to help, then? That\u0092s why she\u0092s transcasting, despite the danger?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes.\u0094 Caden sighed, knowing where Lucan\u0092s line of questioning was headed. Might as well beat him to the destination. \u0093And that is precisely why I haven\u0092t spoken the Call. The more she involves herself in magickind, the higher up Mathias moves her name on his hit list.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093You don\u0092t want to lose her the way you lost Westin. Or the way I lost Anka.\u0094</p><p>Either would devastate Caden. \u0093Something like that.\u0094</p><p>Lucan slammed his bottle down on the table and lunged in Caden\u0092s face, bracing his fists against the back of the sofa, effectively pinning Caden there. \u0093You stupid fuck! You have a woman who loves you and would accept your mating call. Yet you\u0092re willing to flush it down the toilet to avoid possible pain.\u0094 He scoffed and backed away. \u0093You have no idea\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I do!\u0094 Caden shoved Lucan aside and jumped to his feet, anger roiling through his body. \u0093You weren\u0092t there when Westin died. I was!\u0094</p><p>Lucan sighed. \u0093An accident.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That doesn\u0092t make him any less dead. And then you\u0097I saw you chained to a bed for weeks. I watched you with Sabelle.\u0094 Lucan winced, but Caden pressed on. \u0093You nearly killed her for trying to save you. For as long as Anka stays in Shock\u0092s bed, there will be an infinitely deep hole in your heart. Why the hell would I sign up for that?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Because I wouldn\u0092t trade a moment of what Anka and I had together. For any reason. It\u0092s my own bloody fault for not protecting her, but I adore her. Love her. I\u0092d never known true happiness until I mated with her. Would I give up all that bliss because I\u0092m hurting now? Never. You have the advantage, idiot. I didn\u0092t find Anka until I was nearly three hundred. You\u0092re only thirty. You and Sydney could have hundreds of years to enjoy each other.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Or she could goddamn die tomorrow.\u0094 Caden shouted. \u0093She constantly puts herself in danger. I do everything in my power to keep her safe, but she doesn\u0092t want my protection. She\u0092d rather make a difference for magickind. How can I protect her against a monster like Mathias? Magically, I\u0092m no match for him. Knowing my mate was in his clutches would kill me.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093I\u0092m living proof that it won\u0092t. You don\u0092t want the pain or the mourning that goes with losing a mate, so you\u0092re going to toss her away now? Bloody stupid.\u0094 Suddenly, Lucan growled and lifted him by his shirt. \u0093Love rarely comes more than once in a lifetime. If you piss her away, be prepared for centuries of emptiness. And without your longer lifespan, you\u0092ll see her grow old and turn to dust so quickly your head will spin. Then you\u0092ll stand alone, a young wizard on the outside, an old, withering man on the inside, wishing for just ten minutes with your one true love. And she will be gone. I\u0092ll be standing there to say I told you so. Because ten minutes with your beloved is better than a lifetime without her.\u0094</p><p>Like needles piercing her skin, her soul, Sydney felt the pain of Caden\u0092s departure. Inside, she ached\u0097even while she wanted to throw half of Bram\u0092s priceless knickknacks against his pristine wall. And yet . . . after the up-close view of what Lucan had become and hearing of Westin\u0092s heartbreaking death, Sydney couldn\u0092t really blame Caden.</p><p>She wanted to be furious. Mostly, she was sad.</p><p>Maybe if she found some way to end this war sooner, take Mathias down now. . . . If the evil wizard\u0092s threat against her ended, she and Caden could deal with the rest of their issues one by one. Likely, it would take time, but as long as they ended up together, she could learn patience.</p><p>Evening lengthened into night, then into early morning, and still Sydney paced her room, turning over ideas, rejecting them, starting over. After hours of filtering through ideas, two remained. First, she had to find that magical book and discern once and for all if the feelings they shared had originated from the book. If so, she had to undo the magic. And let the chips fall.</p><p>Second, she had to help magickind in a larger way. Transcasting Mathias\u0092s return was a start. Bram hadn\u0092t let her give details about the attacks\u0097yet. But if magickind knew what Mathias had done, what he planned to do, and got angry at the horrific violence Mathias was inflicting, magickind might band together. If so, Mathias didn\u0092t stand a chance. But they needed an advantage.</p><p>One sat languishing behind bars downstairs.</p><p>Sydney glanced at the clock. Nearly three in the morning. No time like the present.</p><p>Down the dark stairs she traveled, creeping into Bram\u0092s office. In a secret compartment behind the sofa, she located the book. After they\u0092d returned from attacking Mathias\u0092s warehouse, Bram had disclosed his hiding place to all the females in the house . . . just in case.</p><p>Extracting the little book, she lit a small desktop lamp and spread the pages open with a pen. Quickly, she leafed through the book, looking for her previous two entries. She couldn\u0092t find the first. Or the second. What the hell? Blasted book made no sense. Then again, it was magic.</p><p>With a sigh, Sydney stared at the blank pages. What to write?</p><p>Within a few minutes she crafted another message to her \u0093Magical Diary,\u0094 wishing that she hated Caden and he loathed her as well. They would give each other coal for Christmas, dead roses for Valentine\u0092s Day, and snarl like pit bulls every day in between. Then she stared at the page, waiting for the diary\u0092s inevitable message.</p><p>To wish for enmity, you are too late.</p><p>This fantasy cannot be your fate.</p><p>Because true love has claimed your</p><p>hearts, you two are sworn never to part.</p><p>True love? A smile burst across her face. Hearing that her fantasies hadn\u0092t incited false feelings was a huge relief\u0097and made her all the more impatient to get on with task number two. The sooner she found a way to rally magickind around Bram, the sooner she and Caden could work through their differences. That meant trying to talk information out of Zain.</p><p>Though he was likely to be a hostile interview subject and it was the middle of the night, she wasn\u0092t waiting. Who knew whether Mathias could do extra damage to magickind while she waited for a more polite hour? Zain was behind bars, had no wand, and Bram had explained that only his houseguests could teleport in and out. The dungeon dampened magical ability, too. She\u0092d be safe long enough to ask a few questions.</p><p>But how? Snark wouldn\u0092t serve her. Zain\u0092s T-shirts suggested he would snark back, which would be counterproductive. She\u0092d be better served using their previous work connection and playing the stupid human card.</p><p>Sydney grabbed Bram\u0092s little video camera and made her way through the dark house, down to where Bram kept Zain locked away.</p><p>She eased the door open. It was pitch black inside. No windows, no lights. The room smelled like damp stones and despair. She shivered.</p><p>\u0093Why are you here, Sydney?\u0094 Zain rasped out. He sounded weak.</p><p>\u0093How did you\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your scent.\u0094</p><p>She didn\u0092t think taking a shower would fix that. \u0093Where\u0092s a light?\u0094</p><p>\u0093There isn\u0092t one.\u0094 He barely got the words out.</p><p>Sydney recoiled. \u0093I\u0092ll return.\u0094</p><p>Trudging upstairs, she wondered why there was no light in the dungeon. Even during the day, with the room underground and no windows, the room would remain black as midnight. A magical form of torture? Either way, she couldn\u0092t find the buttons to start the video camera without a bit of light.</p><p>In the library, she found a candle. She had to search harder for a match. Probably not a necessary item in a magical household, but her handbag still had a book of matches from the pub near her house.</p><p>Lighting and clutching the candle, she descended the stairs again and pushed open the door. Setting the candle on a nearby table, she turned on the video camera. Its light burst into every corner as she stepped into the middle of the room.</p><p>\u0093What the devil?\u0094 Zain shielded his face with his hand, his longish hair wild.</p><p>\u0093Sorry. I\u0092d hoped to interview you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t want to talk.\u0094 He sighed. \u0093I\u0092m exhausted. I need more time with the surrogate. I\u0092m still weak after healing your friend. Bram allowed me very little energy.\u0094</p><p>Perhaps he was faking it, but he looked like death warmed over. Pale and gaunt, several days\u0092 growth shadowed his jawline, nearly overwhelming his face. His clothing was dirty. Of course, he deserved every bit of it for what he\u0092d done to Aquarius.</p><p>\u0093If you talk to me, I\u0092ll talk to him.\u0094</p><p>Zain frowned. \u0093Why should I trust you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093What have I done to earn your distrust? I\u0092m just trying to understand what\u0092s happening. Caden wants nothing to do with magic and won\u0092t talk about it. Bram is too busy. The others . . . well, you know far more than I.\u0094</p><p>Zain leaned against the bars. \u0093Of course I do.\u0094</p><p>The stroke to his ego. She bit her lip, putting on her best earnest face. \u0093Help me. I am a reporter at heart. Even if this story will never see daylight, I want to understand . . . when you first came to work for Out of This Realm, you said you had a mysterious someone who left you information. That wasn\u0092t true, was it? Did Mathias tell you? Or did you just know?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I knew. I know most everything Mathias does or plans.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I thought as much. I\u0092ve heard Bram\u0092s side of this war, but I want to understand Mathias\u0092s. I\u0092m intrigued by his struggle for equality. It sounds so . . . utopian. But I allowed myself to be swayed by Anka\u0092s story of rape and Bram\u0092s tales of Privileged attacks without checking the other side of the story. It wasn\u0092t professional of me. What is Mathias\u0092s side to those stories?\u0094</p><p>Zain drew in a ragged breath. \u0093Everyone has enemies, some willing to exaggerate the truth.\u0094</p><p>\u0093That\u0092s true, but I saw Anka after Mathias released her. Did he break her bond with Lucan, then force her to his bed?\u0094</p><p>\u0093That was her view of events. Mathias\u0092s version of the story is much less melodramatic.\u0094</p><p>Doubtful, but she had to keep him talking, find proof for magickind that Mathias was up to something terrible so they would rally behind Bram and the Doomsday Brethren.</p><p>\u0093Right, then. What are Mathias\u0092s plans to help the Deprived overcome their oppression?\u0094</p><p>Zain moaned. \u0093Come closer. I can\u0092t hear you.\u0094</p><p>Sydney bit her lip. Was he lying? Perhaps, but so far he was doing nothing more menacing than begging. He had no wand, no energy, could barely keep his eyes open. How could he be a threat?</p><p>\u0093What are Mathias\u0092s plans?\u0094 she repeated.</p><p>\u0093Closer,\u0094 he pleaded. \u0093Please. Give me your hand. I need a bit of your energy.\u0094</p><p>She stilled. \u0093You can get it from a simple touch?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Some.\u0094</p><p>His request disturbed her. She didn\u0092t trust him to touch her. \u0093Answer me first. What does Mathias plan?\u0094</p><p>\u0093To eradicate inequality, of course.\u0094</p><p>\u0093How? How will obtaining the Doomsday Diary help him do that? Will he simply write that as a wish?\u0094</p><p>\u0093What else would he do?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t know. You\u0092re familiar with him. All I\u0092ve heard are the . . . rumors.\u0094</p><p>\u0093They\u0092re crap!\u0094</p><p>Sydney was tired of Zain\u0092s coy answers. She had to break him out of this mode. \u0093Are they? I understand the opposition telling lies and whatnot, but if you\u0092re anything to go by . . . What you did to my friend Aquarius was unforgivable. You threatened to kill me!\u0094</p><p>The more she thought about it, the more angry she became.</p><p>\u0093Worthless pawns, both of you,\u0094 he spat. \u0093Just like your wizard lover.\u0094</p><p>Zain\u0092s remark was meant to get under her skin, and it did. But she refused to show it. \u0093Why should anyone get behind your \u0091cause\u0092 if half the goal is simply to kill people?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Stupid prats blame someone brave enough to challenge the establishment. Mathias should be hailed as a hero.\u0094 Zain lunged at the bars and shook them.</p><p>They rattled, clinked. Dust and grit fell from the ceiling. Was the plaster disintegrating?</p><p>Sydney glanced up to where the bars joined the ceiling. They were working free.</p><p>She gasped and peered at Zain. Had he seen it, too?</p><p>Too late. He had. He might not be able to do magic, but he could use his strength to get out. Fear laced her veins as she turned to run. She had to get help.</p><p>Two steps later, she heard the bars rattle\u0097then thud to the ground. She kept moving, but Zain grabbed a fistful of her hair and whirled her around.</p><p>\u0093The delicious energy from your anger and fear was just what I needed.\u0094</p><p>He wore a sick, almost sexual smile that turned her stomach. She looked away, mind racing. How could she get away to alert Bram and the others? What had she done?</p><p>\u0093Look at me,\u0094 he barked, using his grip in her hair to force her to comply. \u0093Now, be a good girl and retrieve the Doomsday Diary.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why?\u0094 she asked wanly.</p><p>\u0093For Mathias, of course.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093But he\u0092ll take it and kill me.\u0094</p><p>Zain pulled her close and stroked her cheek. \u0093Think of yourself as an important sacrifice for a very worthy cause. You\u0092ll make the news.\u0094</p><p>Fear lanced Sydney. Oh God! She had to fight.</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t try anything, or I\u0092ll roast you and make what I did to Aquarius seem like a sunburn.\u0094</p> <p>She drew in a deep breath, battling her fear. She refused to be bullied. \u0093Do it. I won\u0092t give up the book.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Then I\u0092ll kill everyone you work with at that silly human tabloid. Do you want that many deaths on your conscience?\u0094</p><p>Bastard! Zain had her and he knew it. As he pushed her up the stairs to Bram\u0092s office, Sydney tried to think of a way out of this mess. But he\u0092d boxed her in completely. Holly and the others were all human and no match for what Zain could unleash on them.</p><p>Quickly, she deposited the video camera on Bram\u0092s desk, then dragged out the hidden book once more. Trembling and dismayed, she handed it to him.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p> <p>WITH A GASP, CADEN sat straight up in bed. He looked around the darkened room at Lucan\u0092s house, panting, sweating.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Bounding out of bed, he grabbed his jeans and shirt, thrusting them on as he ran down the hall to Lucan\u0092s room and shoved the door. Empty. Shit!</p><p>Backtracking, he raced toward the front of the house, wondering if his brother had slipped out, gone to challenge Shock for Anka, decided to end it all. . . . Instead, he found Lucan sleeping fitfully on the sofa.</p><p>As Caden\u0092s gaze latched onto his brother\u0092s face, Lucan opened his eyes. \u0093What is it?\u0094</p><p>Hesitating, Caden wasn\u0092t certain what to say. Lucan was well enough\u0097in one piece, anyway. But Caden knew something was terribly wrong.</p> <p>\u0093I have this sense of foreboding . . . this dread.\u0094 It throbbed inside him, an echo of someone else\u0092s real fear.</p><p>Lucan rubbed his hand over his shadowed jaw. \u0093Have you opened your magical senses?\u0094</p><p>\u0093My what? No.\u0094</p><p>Lucan sighed. \u0093Close your eyes. Look inside yourself for your magic. That thing that sparks and burns at your core.\u0094</p><p>His eyes slid shut, and he shook his head. \u0093It\u0092s not in one place; it\u0092s everywhere.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Find the heart of it. Look inside,\u0094 Lucan snapped impatiently.</p><p>As Lucan said the words, Caden focused deeper inward. There it was. As soon as he found the heart of his magic, it expanded, growing exponentially, as if it had been waiting for him to acknowledge its existence. Now, it woke a sleeping giant. Desperately, Caden tried to shrink it, shove it aside\u0097 something.</p><p>\u0093No!\u0094 Lucan commanded. \u0093Grab onto it. Let it take you.\u0094</p> <p>\u0093Hell no! It\u0092s going to drown me. It\u0092s massive.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Excellent.\u0094 Lucan jumped to his feet. \u0093Size . . . um, matters. Magically speaking.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t want it! Damn it, I just want to be normal.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re not,\u0094 Lucan snapped. \u0093And the sense that something is wrong often involves a wizard\u0092s mate. If you want to know if something happened to Sydney, I suggest you give your senses free rein. Now.\u0094</p><p>Caden caught his breath. Sydney in trouble? Yes, he sensed it. Her fear and panic. Her regret. Her cry for help. And for her, he\u0092d move mountains, scale skyscrapers.</p><p>Embrace magic.</p><p>Most of the night he\u0092d spent pondering Lucan\u0092s admonishments about embracing love and accepting his mate. His heart wanted it so damn bad. All evening, logic had urged him to resist.</p><p>But everything changed the moment he knew Sydney was in danger.</p><p>Without hesitation, he looked inward again, mentally touching his magic. It burst inside him, burning down his arms, reaching its tentacles through his brain\u0097and grabbing on. As it did, he looked outward for Sydney, trying to feel her, find her.</p><p>He did, and horror washed over him.</p><p>\u0093Oh, God,\u0094 Caden gasped, heart drumming furiously.</p><p>\u0093For a moment, I saw everything through her eyes. And he\u0092s got her. Mathias!\u0094</p><p>Lucan cursed. \u0093Don\u0092t panic. Close your eyes. See if your magic can locate her.\u0094</p><p>He concentrated, frowned. Vague images pinged back at him. Her arms curled around the book, Mathias barking questions. But no location.</p><p>\u0093I-I can\u0092t. I don\u0092t know how. You couldn\u0092t do it when Anka was taken from you.\u0094</p><p>Would Sydney be ravaged by that monster, as Anka had been? If an experienced wizard with a long-term mate bond had been unable to find her, what hope did Caden have?</p><p>\u0093He took Anka suddenly,\u0094 Lucan explained. \u0093I felt only a vague sense of uneasiness before the bond was broken.\u0094</p><p>\u0093We aren\u0092t mated. How can I find what isn\u0092t technically mine?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mother said for years that your magic would cross rare lines. Try.\u0094</p><p>A deluge of thoughts and emotions pounded him. Fear. Anger at himself for not mating with Sydney. Dread. The sensations that kept pouring across the tenuous thread of consciousness he shared with her. Determination.</p><p>There! \u0093A house. Remote.\u0094 Frustration crashed over him. \u0093That\u0092s all I can see. It could be anywhere.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Have you teleported on your own yet?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No.\u0094</p><p>Lucan sighed roughly. \u0093Remind me when this is over to beat you within an inch of your stubborn life. Close your eyes. Envision yourself getting as close to Sydney as possible. Focus on your sense of her, not the appearance of the location. Your instincts should guide you to her.\u0094</p><p>His first time to teleport, and he wasn\u0092t even sure where he was headed? No time to worry about that. \u0093If I fail?\u0094</p><p>Wincing, Lucan slapped his shoulder. \u0093Best not to dwell on that.\u0094</p><p>Perfect. But as a fresh surge of terror clawed at his magical senses, and he actually felt Sydney\u0092s fear like the taste of blood in his mouth, he had to try now.</p><p>\u0093Here I go.\u0094</p><p>Lucan grabbed his arm. \u0093I\u0092ll pop in on Bram. He\u0092ll help.\u0094</p><p>Caden shook his head. \u0093He coerced me to temporarily join the Doomsday Brethren in exchange for helping me find Anka. After flubbing a mission a few days ago, he ousted me.\u0094</p><p>With a raised brow, Lucan predicted, \u0093I think you\u0092ll be surprised. But if I\u0092m wrong, then I\u0092ll go to Shock. He\u0092ll know best where Mathias is keeping Sydney.\u0094</p><p>The gesture stunned Caden. \u0093You\u0092d do that? Even though the bastard has your mate?\u0094</p><p>\u0093To keep you with yours so that you could have your happy ending? Yes. Shock may well work for Mathias, and if so\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093He claims to be a double agent.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not relevant now, except that if he\u0092s truly on our side, then getting him to help me find Sydney should be much simpler. Go. I\u0092ll sort the rest out.\u0094</p><p>Suddenly a scream rent his mind. Pain and fear scraped every nerve ending raw. The time for deliberation was gone. He had to act now.</p><p>He closed his eyes, focused on Sydney and how to be as near her as possible. Then he was tumbling through the dark.</p><p>\u0093How lovely of you to bring the Doomsday Diary to me.\u0094 Mathias sent her a tight smile. \u0093I\u0092ll reward Zain later. But now, my dear, you must tell me how the book works.\u0094</p><p>Sydney staggered as Zain completed teleporting and the room tilted. She blinked, trying to get her bearings. But all she saw was an unfamiliar house. And Mathias waiting for her.</p><p>Fear zipped down her spine. It was one thing to sit across from Mathias with Shock present and the Doomsday Brethren just outside. This face-to-face now? Disturbing, to say the least.</p><p>She clutched the book to her chest. \u0093What will you do with it?\u0094</p><p>He sifted his fingers through her hair, and Sydney tried not to show just how distasteful she found his touch. \u0093Put an end to all this silly fighting. Magickind needs to unite.\u0094</p><p>Under the banner of false equality and his cruel thumb? No.</p><p>\u0093How does the book work?\u0094</p><p>Sydney figured in this instance, her best defense was to play dumb. \u0093I don\u0092t know. I\u0092m not a witch.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Precisely my point.\u0094 Mathias leaned closer, and she shivered. \u0093How can a human control that book?\u0094</p><p>His eyes, so icy blue, were nearly silver\u0097and alive with intelligence and evil. Sexuality oozed from every pore. To the woman who didn\u0092t know what he was, a man this good looking would be a powerful lure. Yet Sydney was not only repelled, but disgusted. His closeness spiked nausea through her.</p><p>She had no idea why he wasn\u0092t reading her mind as Sabelle did. Different powers? Whatever. She wasn\u0092t looking a gift horse in the mouth.</p><p>\u0093I d-don\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>Without using his hands or feet, he scooted both himself and the sofa he sat upon closer. It just moved. Then he leaned in, grabbing her arms. \u0093It\u0092s attached to you. The minute you left my office in the warehouse, it dissolved out of my hands, back into yours. Tell me why.\u0094</p><p>If Mathias didn\u0092t know the secrets of the Doomsday Diary, she wasn\u0092t going to explain them. She was pretty certain he regarded humans as little better then pond scum, so convincing him of her stupidity shouldn\u0092t be difficult.</p><p>She shrugged. \u0093Something Bram did?\u0094</p><p>Mathias stared, deep, hard. Sydney tried not to give the prick the benefit of her fear, but he seemed to reach inside her and bring it all out. \u0093Do you know what I did to one of the Doomsday Brethren\u0092s mates?\u0094</p><p>Despite her vow to stay strong, she shrank back in her chair. \u0093You raped her.\u0094</p><p>He smiled as if reliving a fond memory. \u0093Indeed, I rent her bond with her mate and stole most of her life essence. She was a strong witch, and that took time. You I can decimate in three minutes. Then I\u0092ll hunt down the cowardly wizard who hasn\u0092t completed his Mating Call and make him watch while I waste you completely under the pounding of my cock.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You vile son of a bitch. You stay the hell away from us!\u0094 Mathias laughed. \u0093Or what?\u0094</p><p>Sydney clutched her hands in her lap, her brain furiously whirling for a way out. Why had she ever imagined that Zain locked up without a wand was harmless? That she understood magic enough to know what was safe? Caden had been telling her for days now that it was unpredictable and dangerous. She hadn\u0092t listened.</p><p>\u0093Let\u0092s try again,\u0094 Mathias suggested. \u0093You tell me what I want to know, and I\u0092ll spare you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re going to kill me anyway. Let\u0092s be honest.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hmm.\u0094 Mathias frowned. \u0093It occurs to me that the Doomsday Brethren will converge on me en masse to save you, the book, or both. You\u0092re excellent bait. As soon as all the Doomsday Brethren are dead, then I can kill you. Unless you\u0092d like me to show some mercy. Tell me what you know about the diary, and I might.\u0094</p><p>Sydney highly doubted that, but if they were still talking, she was still alive and still able to try to find a way out of this. \u0093I don\u0092t know anything that will help you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I grow tired of this game.\u0094</p><p>Mathias flicked a hand in her direction. A fireball burst inside her. She screamed as if her insides had suddenly been boiled in acid. She clutched her middle, fearing imminent death.</p><p>Caden! her mind screamed. She loved him and wished everything could have ended differently between them. She would have liked to kiss him and know one perfect night as his mate. But even dying like this, she wasn\u0092t sorry she\u0092d become involved with him. She was only sorry that she didn\u0092t know how to fight this evil and couldn\u0092t keep the others safe.</p><p>\u0093Didn\u0092t like that, did you?\u0094 he asked smugly. \u0093Maybe you\u0092ll be more cooperative now. Right, Shock?\u0094</p><p>Sydney\u0092s eyes flew open, and Shock stood beside Mathias, wearing those sunglasses that hid his every thought. He smirked at her, his look suggesting that she was getting what she deserved. But he\u0092d helped Bram and the others attack Mathias\u0092s warehouse. The attack had been a success . . . or had it? Mathias had escaped, and with that terrible glass sphere he used to make Anarki soldiers at will. Whose side was he really on?</p><p>\u0093Hello, Sydney.\u0094 Shock\u0092s voice held all the warmth of a glacier.</p><p>\u0093You treacherous, two-faced bastard!\u0094</p><p>\u0093You do have the Doomsday Brethren convinced that you have their best interests at heart.\u0094 Mathias laughed.</p><p>Shock sent Mathias a brash smile. \u0093Of course. How can I help you?\u0094</p><p>Sydney reared back. Every time Shock opened his mouth to Bram he was challenging, disrespectful. When he spoke to Mathias, she\u0092d been surprised not to hear a \u0093master\u0094 at the end of his greeting.</p><p>\u0093Read this stupid chit\u0092s mind, please. What does she know about the Doomsday Diary? Where did she get it?\u0094</p><p>Shock turned toward her. She used the techniques Sabelle had given her to ward him out of her mind, but even her dull thoughts of computer maintenance and a dreary lullaby didn\u0092t stop him.</p><p>\u0093It was a gift to her, from a friend. She isn\u0092t certain where the friend got it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What else does she know?\u0094 Mathias scowled.</p><p>\u0093She was told it granted sexual fantasies. It came with no further instructions.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Did she use it in that capacity?\u0094 he asked Shock.</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 Sydney said.</p><p>\u0093Of course,\u0094 Shock corrected immediately. \u0093Twice.</p><p>It worked both times.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Is she a witch?\u0094</p><p>She could actually feel Shock tromping through her mind, his steps as subtle as an elephant\u0092s. Gripping her head to stop the pain, she willed him to get out. A moment later, his heavy presence left her.</p><p>\u0093If she is, she is unaware of it.\u0094</p><p>\u0093How old are you?\u0094 Mathias snapped.</p><p>She sighed. If she didn\u0092t answer, Mathias would just send Shock back in to pillage her mind.</p><p>\u0093Twenty-seven.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not a witch,\u0094 they said in unison.</p><p>\u0093Females transition into their powers around twenty-five,\u0094 Shock supplied.</p><p>Mathias focused on her utterly, the same way a snake probably watched its prey before swallowing it whole. \u0093The book has conferred some sense of ownership to you. Because you used it?\u0094</p><p>Suddenly, Shock was in her head again, crashing through her skull as if he was looking for answers with a machete. She screamed at the skull-cracking pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093She does not know.\u0094</p><p>Mathias waved him away. \u0093That\u0092s all. Go round up the Anarki. I\u0092m expecting company soon. You\u0092ll greet them, I hope.\u0094</p><p>Shock shot her an evil grin. \u0093With great pleasure.\u0094</p><p>Sydney watched him with horror as he strode out, long leather duster trailing behind him.</p> <p>As soon as he was gone, Mathias snatched the Doomsday Diary off of her lap and rose, his long stride eating up the space to the door out of the makeshift office. The moment Mathias stepped over the threshold, he cursed.</p><p>The book reappeared on her lap.</p><p>When he turned back to her, he fixed his stare on the diary, then lifted his terrible gaze to her. The force of his anger was like a missile. Even across the room, she knew the fury rimming his eyes with red could be fatal.</p><p>He took a deep breath. Another. Then strode across the room again in measured steps and sat on the sofa once more. \u0093It\u0092s because you\u0092re female. Damn Morganna. Did a woman give this book to you?\u0094</p><p>She wanted to tell him to go to hell, but he\u0092d kill her for it. At the very least she had to stay alive long enough to help any of the Doomsday Brethren who came.</p> <p>\u0093Yes.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Human?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I believe so.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Even more puzzling . . .\u0094 Mathias sat back against the red velvet sofa, looking perplexed. Suddenly, he snapped.</p><p>Moments later, a bony woman with glossy black hair and black-rimmed brown eyes glided to his side. She wore a blue bra that supported pert breasts, but was cut low, nearly exposing her hard nipples. Her matching knickers were nearly transparent.</p><p>\u0093Sir?\u0094 she breathed.</p> <p>He stood and dropped an open-mouthed kiss on her neck, his thumb idly strumming her taut nipple. She keened and writhed under his touch. Surely he was forcing her response by magical means, because the wizard made Sydney\u0092s skin crawl. When he caressed her hip and buttocks, pulling her close, the woman lifted her leg over his hip and writhed sinuously.</p><p>They needed privacy. If she had to watch another moment, she would be ill.</p><p>\u0093Rhea, be a good girl and grab that book from the human\u0092s lap.\u0094</p><p>With an absent nod, the thin woman slinked across the distance between. Sydney clutched the book. The woman tugged, but Sydney refused to let go. Once she did, she was pretty sure she\u0092d lose control of the Doomsday Diary. Mathias had it right; the little journal didn\u0092t seem fussy about which woman handled it.</p><p>\u0093Let go,\u0094 Mathias instructed.</p><p>\u0093Sod off.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ll pay for that backtalk.\u0094</p><p>Mathias flicked his hand in her direction and the scorching bomb burst under her skin again. Reflexively, she released the book and doubled over, clutching her stomach. Oh God, she was going to die at the hands of this madman.</p> <p>\u0093Take the book to my bedroom, sweet. I\u0092ll join you there.\u0094</p><p>The tall woman smiled, and Sydney wondered if she\u0092d lost her bleeding mind. Likely so. Rhea strutted toward the door on four-inch stilettos, as if she\u0092d been born on them. When she reached the door, she strode through with her head held high, then kept walking\u0097taking the book with her. This time, it didn\u0092t reappear on Sydney\u0092s lap.</p><p>Sydney\u0092s stomach sank. She\u0092d lost magickind\u0092s greatest weapon and put it in the hands of a madman who\u0092d likely use it to kill her and all the Doomsday Brethren, including Caden. Her reckless need to tell the story, her voracious curiosity to explore the amazing world of magic had been her downfall. Why hadn\u0092t she listened?</p><p>It was her last thought before darkness overtook her.</p><p>After free-falling through black weightless space, Caden slammed to the ground in a cold field. Fresh snow had fallen and seeped under his clothes. Every exhalation misted the chilly air. The crisp smells reminded him of the north country. He had no idea how far he\u0092d traveled, but he closed his eyes, feeling for Sydney, and knew he was closer.</p><p>Her earlier panic had been replaced with a muffled unease, as if she had a disturbed sleep. Now he prayed it was slumber, not something tragic.</p><p>He followed the feel of Sydney, closer, closer with each step through the dark. He almost thanked the snow for lighting his way with the reflective moonlight.</p><p>Through spindly trees, he saw a huge estate rise in the distance. More Italian Renaissance than Middle Ages, the beautiful limestone glowed in the golden light as pristine snow surrounded it. She was in there, his Sydney. He knew it, just like he knew if he took too many more steps around the perimeter, he could set off magical traps.</p><p>He took a deep breath, closed his eyes. He was a trained</p><p>soldier, often able to find and disable security. Mathias\u0092s would be magical, but should be disarmable. Thinking with his magical senses would be critical.</p><p>Magic buzzed through his system, raced through his veins. His legs were a bit wobbly after the teleport, and this level of energy wasn\u0092t going to last. But he had to endure until he saved Sydney.</p><p>Caden skirted the perimeter of the building, looking for traps and holes in the security. A few feet ahead, he encountered a wall, presumably for humans since it did nothing more than put off a \u0093keep out\u0094 vibe. It included a very mild electrical surge\u0097more than enough to deter a normal human.</p><p>Too bad for Mathias he wasn\u0092t \u0093normal\u0094 anymore.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Caden let his senses crawl around the wall. About ten feet high. Simple.</p><p>While he didn\u0092t know the limits of his magic, there was nothing he couldn\u0092t do if it helped him reach Sydney. For all he knew, he was bloody Superman. When he was a tot, his mother had certainly made it sound as if he would be. Besides, he\u0092d already performed some magic. Lifting Sydney\u0092s password off her computer at Out of This Realm, sending a wall of glass flying into Anarki when the Doomsday Brethren had attacked Mathias. How hard could leaping a wall be?</p><p>Squeezing his eyes shut tight, he jumped\u0097and quickly discovered that when he tapped into his magic, jumping tenfoot walls was no problem. One step closer to Sydney.</p><p>Moments later, Caden noticed a shifting of the air. Then he saw something unexpected. Someone.</p><p>Shock strode toward him as if rising up out of the mist. Even at night, he wore those blasted sunglasses, so Caden had no idea what he was thinking. He\u0092d never really trusted the sod, and now that the man had all but stolen his brother\u0092s mate away, he didn\u0092t trust Shock at all.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re here for Sydney. I\u0092ll sneak you past the alarms and take you to her.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Why should I trust you? You had Anka under your roof and in your bed for days and told no one. Nor did you return her to my brother.\u0094</p><p>\u0093She was mine before your brother stole her from me,\u0094 he growled. \u0093I owe Lucan nothing. She was abducted and hurt on his watch. It won\u0092t happen on mine.\u0094</p><p>Caden hesitated, mulling over Shock\u0092s words. In all likelihood, that\u0092s exactly how Shock saw the matter. But that didn\u0092t piss Caden off any less or make him trust Shock any more.</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t really care about your tender sensibilities,\u0094 Shock mocked. \u0093If you\u0092re here for Sydney, I\u0092ll take you now.\u0094</p><p>Caden glared at the leather-clad wizard. \u0093Just like that?\u0094</p><p>Shock looked past Caden. \u0093You come alone?\u0094</p><p>The truth gave Shock the green light to overpower him. But Shock would only read his mind if he lied.</p><p>Caden nodded. \u0093This is my fight.\u0094</p><p>He raised a skeptical brow above those dark sunglasses. \u0093So Bram and Lucan and the others are leaving you to rescue Sydney and the book by yourself?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Sydney is my responsibility. The book isn\u0092t my first priority.\u0094</p><p>\u0093But you\u0092re going to try to rescue it.\u0094 It wasn\u0092t a question.</p><p>And Shock was right. Since opening his magical senses, he\u0092d come to understand that if he didn\u0092t, he could save Sydney, but Mathias could use the book to consign them all to hell on earth ten minutes later. If he genuinely wanted her safety and the chance to live happily ever after with her, then he had to snatch the book.</p><p>Shock sighed. \u0093Well, of course, you\u0092ll want to save the book. It shouldn\u0092t have been a hard decision.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Get the hell out of my thoughts.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Look, you did a good job getting this close, but once Mathias took your woman, he knew you\u0092d come. I suspected you\u0092d come after the book, as well. Despite what you think, the others will come. Now I\u0092m going to restrain you and drag you to Sydney\u0092s cell, to make it all look believable.\u0094</p><p>He shook his head. \u0093Mathias seems like a natural ally for you, since your brother is all cozied up with him. How do I know that I can trust you, mate thief?\u0094</p><p>An acrimonious smile split his mouth. \u0093You don\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>Caden roused with a groan and opened his eyes to find a dank limestone floor\u0097and realized he was hanging upside down, a shoulder in his midsection. A throb ripped through the peace in his head, and he groaned.</p><p>\u0093Awake, are you?\u0094 A male voice groused. Shock. \u0093That was a quick recovery. Your magic is strong. I\u0092ll have to keep my eye on you. On your feet.\u0094</p><p>With a grunt, Shock set him down. Shadowed, underground. Prison-like. Shit.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re not locking me up!\u0094</p><p>Shock shoved him around a corner. \u0093Don\u0092t be difficult, whelp. You wanted to see your woman, and I\u0092m taking you to her. I have to wait for the rest of the company.\u0094</p><p>With a downward slash of his wrist, Shock opened the cell. Its rusty door squeaked open. Sydney appeared out of a dark corner, looking no worse for the wear. She ran to the open door, but Shock held up a palm, creating an invisible wall to stop her. Caden tried to focus on tearing down that wall, to no avail. Shock\u0092s magic didn\u0092t bend.</p><p>Damn, there was always Marine-style brute force.</p><p>Caden whirled and punched Shock in the stomach, and he grunted, doubling over. Running toward Sydney, Caden was determined to get her though Shock\u0092s force field. He grabbed her hand, and when his fingers closed around hers, a sense of home and thankfulness curled around him. Warmth, relief, need.</p><p>Until he felt a boot right in his arse.</p><p>Caden tumbled into the cell, falling into Sydney. They toppled over, to the cold floor, in a heap of arms and legs.</p><p>With a rusty screech, the cell door closed, and Shock used his magic to seal it.</p><p>He sent them a sly smile. \u0093Wait here. If your friends don\u0092t appear, Mathias will send you back to Bram and the others with a message. Your woman . . .\u0094 Shock shook his head. \u0093You should know, it doesn\u0092t look good.\u0094</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, Caden raced to the bars and screamed at Shock\u0092s retreating back, \u0093You traitor! How the hell could you do something so miserable and underhanded when people are dying? Do you care more about your own power than the fact Mathias is going to wipe out entire families?\u0094</p><p>Shock paused, then slowly turned to glare at Caden over his leather-clad shoulder. \u0093You don\u0092t know a damn thing about me.\u0094</p><p>Then Shock was gone, and Caden sighed as failure settled over him, heavy and oppressive. How bloody stupid had he been, believing that he could rescue Sydney from the most powerful wizard in a millennium by himself?</p><p>\u0093Caden, how did you get here?\u0094 she asked.</p><p>He turned to her, drinking in the sight of her, loose sweat pants, baggy T-shirt, hair blazing like a wildfire around her shoulders. The impact of her slammed into him.</p><p>She was his, the past he should have grabbed with both hands, the future he could have if they found a way out of this bloody mess. He wasn\u0092t going to give it or her up for another second.</p><p>\u0093Sydney, I\u0092m sorry. I love you.\u0094 Refusing to waste a second, Caden cradled her face in his hands and did something he should have done the moment he met her: He kissed her.</p><p>His mouth crashed over hers, open, seeking, dying for a taste of her. Their lips joined. Their tongues met. Her taste boomed across his senses, spicy, sweet, slightly tart\u0097all woman. His senses revved up, both magical and male. In concert, they demanded more, everything, from her. A chorus of now, now, now! chanted in his head. His body tensed, his cock hardened, and he grasped her tighter.</p><p>Under him, Sydney surged, throwing her fervor into the kiss. She grabbed his hair, clutched his sweater, moaning, writhing, accepting in every way.</p><p>Lucan had been right. Ten minutes with Sydney was better than an eternity without her.</p><p>Familiar words burst across his brain, and he embraced them, then tore his mouth from hers and panted, \u0093Become a part of me as I become a part of you. And ever after, I promise myself to thee. Each day we share, I shall be honest, good, and true. If this you seek, heed my call. From this moment on, there is no other for me but you.\u0094</p><p>She gasped, her eyes welling. \u0093You\u0092re certain?\u0094</p><p>Caden took her mouth again, her flavor bursting across his senses, and he knew without a doubt she was his one true mate. Always had been. Always would be. \u0093Completely.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Mathias is going to kill me. Soon. You\u0092ll be like Lucan\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll do everything I can to prevent that, but if not, I would rather have had you for a few moments than not at all, firecracker.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Promise me, if you make it out alive, that you\u0092ll continue fighting. Not for revenge, but for what\u0092s right. For magickind.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I won\u0092t let you go easily. You won\u0092t be unavenged. I won\u0092t let this scum take over my people.\u0094</p><p>Warm tears rolled down her cheeks. Then she smiled, lighting up the cell, his world. \u0093I\u0092m so proud of you, and I love you so much.\u0094 She sniffed. \u0093But there\u0092s something you should know. I wrote about you in the Doomsday Diary. I wanted you so badly . . .\u0094</p><p>Caden searched his memories. \u0093The night I crashed through the door of your flat and we made love against the wall?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Yes. And again before you took me on my kitchen table.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You minx.\u0094 He caressed her cheek lovingly. \u0093You had no idea what you were in for.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u0093I wouldn\u0092t change it for the world. I tried to . . . I wrote a reverse \u0091fantasy\u0092 in the Doomsday Diary to see if your feelings for me were all magically manufactured.\u0094</p><p>\u0093They\u0092re not. I swear.\u0094</p><p>She sent him an impish smile. \u0093I know. The diary told me.\u0094</p><p>With a growl, he pulled her against him. \u0093Don\u0092t you have an answer for me? Do you know the words?\u0094</p> <p>She nodded. \u0093Bram and Sabelle have a great library.\u0094 Happiness broke over her face, like the sun from behind storm clouds, illuminating everything in joy. \u0093As I become a part of you, you become a part of me. I will be honest, good, and true. I heed your call. \u0092Tis you I seek. From this moment on, there is no other for me but you.\u0094</p><p>A powerful jolt slammed into Caden\u0092s body, and his sense of Sydney as his mate jumped into the foreground of his consciousness, fusing into his heart. She had been important; now she was his everything. She gasped, clearly feeling it as well.</p><p>But with the sealing of their bond came another crashing need\u0097to test her, taste her, claim her\u0097all of her.</p><p>Without a thought, he dragged the baggy shirt off one shoulder to reveal a bare breast, then he cupped it.</p><p>\u0093Caden! They\u0092re going to come back. We should focus on\u0097\u0094</p> <p>He cut her speech off with a kiss, deep, blistering, the kind that sent sizzle all the way through his body. Slowly, she melted against him.</p><p>Caden eased back until he sat on the room\u0092s lone bed, bringing her down to straddle his lap. Narrow and squat, the little bed wasn\u0092t the haven he wanted the first time he loved his mate, but he wasn\u0092t going to quibble. She was in his arms. The future was coming, he knew. But he\u0092d face it stronger if he joined with her first.</p><p>\u0093This might be our last chance,\u0094 he whispered against her mouth. \u0093Our only chance. Let me love you.\u0094</p><p>Sydney didn\u0092t hesitate. She grabbed Caden\u0092s sweater, tugging and pulling until she managed to yank it over his head. Rapaciously, she ran her hands over his hands and shoulders, and he thanked his years of daily running and training in the Marines and beyond that kept him in shape.</p><p>But he wasn\u0092t content to just have her hands on him; he wanted her open to him. Lifting her off his lap, he dragged the large sweatpants down one thigh. Another adjustment, and his own pants rested south of his hips.</p><p>As he brought her back to his lap, he captured her mouth again, brushed his knuckles over her collarbone, across her nipple, skipped the shirt covering her abdomen, then delved into the red curls between her pale thighs. Slick, steamy\u0097 ready. He\u0092d missed her so, so much, trying to separate her from him, and thus from danger. Keep himself safe from the whims of magic. But he\u0092d been foolish, wasting time. If they managed to escape this place in one piece, he\u0092d never waste another second together. If they didn\u0092t . . . he didn\u0092t regret their mating in the least.</p> <p>Raking his fingertips over her clit, he basked in her sighs and moans. She melted, all delicious and sweet, around his hand as he plunged his fingers inside her and rubbed her sweet spot.</p><p>Her fingernails found their way into his shoulders, and he smiled when she dusted his neck with urgent kisses. The smile turned to desperate hunger when she caught his mouth in a searing kiss, grabbed his aching erection, and pushed her hips down to it.</p><p>Slowly, she sank over him, and the tight clasp of her body was both a homecoming and a pleasure unlike any he\u0092d ever known. His mate. His. No matter what.</p><p>Their time was short, but their love unlimited. Grabbing her hips, he tutored her in a long, slow stroke as he brushed his lips over hers again, then settled deep, mating with her body, her mouth\u0097her heart.</p><p>Gripping his biceps, she stroked her way up and down his cock, and the inferno-hot pleasure singed him. She tightened around him. Her cheeks grew pink, then flushed a darker rose. Her nipples swelled, her head tipped back, and she looked like the ultimate goddess of pleasure. Smart, brave, loving. His.</p><p>Caden\u0092s heart swelled with need, with love. His body did the same. Grimacing, he tried to stave off the orgasm about to overwhelm. But Sydney\u0092s pace quickened. She dug her fingers deeper into him as she bounced on him, chanting his name. Caden curled his arms around her and fused his mouth to hers as her sex clamped down on him. He swallowed her scream of pleasure and joined her over the abyss, in an ecstasy that not only suffused him with a warm satiation\u0097but a jolt of power so intense, it nearly overpowered his system. And love. God, so much of it. That love gave him a new dimension of strength. He was determined that, while that may have been their first time making love as mates, it damn well wouldn\u0092t be their last.</p><p>Quietly, they dressed, pausing to kiss. He touched her, wrapped her in his embrace to reassure her, then sat on the bed to cuddle her in his lap.</p><p>\u0093Caden?\u0094 she turned worried brown eyes on him.</p> <p>He knew everything on her mind. It was on his too. But damn it, he hadn\u0092t come this far, been born with the sort of magic that his mother, as a good seer, had praised, and found this amazing woman, only to have her ripped from him.</p><p>Time to fight.</p><p>\u0093Shh. It\u0092s not over.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Your time alone is.\u0094 A man\u0092s voice intruded on their intimate cocoon. Shock. Then he opened the cell and motioned to Sydney. \u0093Come with me.\u0094</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>SYDNEY TREMBLED AS SHOCK HELD her by the elbow and dragged her toward the middle of the house. \u0093Where are you taking me?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Where Mathias asked me to.\u0094</p><p>His complete lack of inflection, of guilt, incensed her. Rage bottled up inside her, then she wondered why she was keeping a cork on it. She was going to die, regardless. Why not tell Shock what toilet scum she thought he was?</p><p>\u0093So you enjoy watching innocent people be tortured to death? Or you just don\u0092t care?\u0094</p><p>He glared down his shoulder at her, his expression unreadable. \u0093You\u0092re playing games you don\u0092t understand.\u0094</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re betraying people who count on you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093More than you know,\u0094 he muttered, then tugged on her elbow and dragged her behind him.</p><p>As she feared, Shock lugged her back to the cold sitting room of black, glass, and chrome in which she\u0092d been earlier. There, Mathias sat, waiting, his expression cool but impatient. She had the distinct impression he was concealing the depth of his rage. And it scared the hell out of her. The Doomsday Diary sat on the table in front of him. The half-dressed witch who\u0092d taken the book from Sydney slept in a corner. At least she hoped the woman was asleep.</p><p>Shock shoved her into a chair across from Mathias.</p><p>\u0093These meetings are too frequent, my dear,\u0094 he said.</p><p>\u0093Rhea is unable to use the book. Everything she writes disappears. I cannot see the words at all. Care to explain?\u0094</p><p>Sydney glanced at Shock. As long as the traitor was here, she stood no chance of keeping her thoughts to herself. \u0093I just wrote what I wanted in the book and . . . poof.\u0094</p><p>\u0093It came true immediately?\u0094</p><p>\u0093No. It took a few days.\u0094</p><p>Mathias glanced at Shock.</p><p>\u0093She\u0092s telling the truth as she knows it.\u0094 Shock supplied.</p><p>Mathias relaxed against the back of the sofa. \u0093It\u0092s possible that larger magic takes time to collect and organize.\u0094</p><p>Shock nodded. \u0093She was looking only for a shag. Hardly difficult magic, but she\u0092s not a witch . . .\u0094</p><p>A feral grin stretched across the evil wizard\u0092s mouth as he turned to her. \u0093If you need a man in your bed, I\u0092m more than happy to oblige.\u0094</p><p>Ewww. \u0093I don\u0092t.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I can change your mind . . . whether you want it changed or not. Regardless of whether your new mate is languishing in the cell downstairs or not.\u0094</p><p>How did he know?</p><p>\u0093Your magical signature,\u0094 Shock said. \u0093You now have one that brands you as Caden\u0092s. Most anyone magical can see it.\u0094</p><p>Sydney liked that idea, and hoped that she\u0092d have years and years with this signature\u0097and a happy life to go with it. But she had to get out of here first.</p><p>Shock merely raised a brow at her, but thankfully kept commentary to himself.</p><p>\u0093You used the book twice with success. Rhea could not use it at all,\u0094 Mathias mused as if solving a puzzle aloud. \u0093Of course, you\u0092re a smart girl, and she\u0092s a stupid slut. But she\u0092s magical and you\u0092re not. I know it works for witches, or Morganna le Fay would have never created it. There is something I\u0092m missing. What?\u0094</p><p>Sydney wasn\u0092t even certain herself, but Sabelle and Olivia\u0092s theory that the woman using the book had to be wishing for her heart\u0092s desire made sense. She had when she\u0092d wished for Caden. Who knows what Mathias\u0092s witch whore had wished for?</p><p>\u0093She doesn\u0092t know.\u0094 Shock\u0092s tone was both annoyed and dismissive. \u0093She\u0092s human. She stumbled into magic and got lucky. That\u0092s all.\u0094</p><p>Sydney frowned. If Shock could read her mind, why hadn\u0092t he regurgitated her every thought to Mathias?</p><p>\u0093Any chance she\u0092s able to mask her thoughts from you?\u0094</p><p>Shock snorted in answer.</p><p>\u0093Take her to my bed. I think I\u0092ll enjoy finding out how much energy this feisty human can give me before she dies.\u0094</p><p>Zipping her gaze up to Shock\u0092s face, Sydney\u0092s heart beat triple time. Oh, dear God. The last thing in the world she wanted was to endure a moment of Mathias\u0092s touch. But to die in his bed . . . she shivered.</p><p>Now Shock was the only thing standing between her and death. His bland expression didn\u0092t give her much hope.</p><p>\u0093In order to bed her, you\u0092ll have to break her mate bond. That will likely kill her. Let me spend a little time with her. I have ways of getting deeper into a woman\u0092s mind.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Unpleasant ones, I hope?\u0094 Mathias perked up.</p><p>\u0093Absolutely.\u0094</p><p>Mathias paused, then smiled. \u0093Take her, then. Don\u0092t bring her back unless you\u0092ve extracted everything from her mind\u0097or she\u0092s dead.\u0094</p><p>As soon as Shock magically shoved him back in the cell and locked him in again, taking Sydney away with him, Caden broke out in a cold sweat. Damn it, now what? He doubted he could break Shock\u0092s magical seal on this cell. But he couldn\u0092t sit here while the traitor and mate thief took Sydney to his boss like a lamb to slaughter. Even the thought made him want to roar the entire house down.</p><p>He knew more than a little martial arts, but every attempt to kick at the walls or bars proved fruitless. He\u0092d looked around the cell for a trapdoor, back exit, ceiling vent . . . nothing.</p><p>He was going to have to get creative with magic. Damn it, he scarcely knew enough to be dangerous. He had the instincts to complete simple tasks, and had been so foolishly adamant about not learning more.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Caden forced his recriminations away and willed himself to think. He had to know something that would help her. Sitting trapped while his mate died at Mathias\u0092s hands was not an option. But he\u0092d never done big magic.</p><p>Except at transition. His one special power.</p><p>Hope soared, but he tempered it. He had to be logical. The fact was, he\u0092d been almost high on magic when he\u0092d cloned himself, he really had no idea how he\u0092d done it. Common wisdom said that a witch or wizard should not reveal their special power unless it meant the difference between life and death.</p><p>Saving Sydney was his life or death.</p><p>Vaguely, Caden recalled fusing his clone back to his body by visualizing the event. He hoped, prayed, the reverse worked.</p><p>Sitting on the cot on which he\u0092d so recently loved Sydney, he squeezed his eyes shut. In his mind, he pictured his clone morphing separately from him\u0097on the other side of these bars. His entire body tensed as he clutched the bed frame.</p><p>His arms shook, and he could feel the veins swelling as he concentrated. Seconds became a minute. A minute became three. But nothing happened. He cursed under his breath.</p><p>Then he felt his insides ripping in half.</p><p>Caden clenched his teeth against the horrific sensation of someone opening his chest and sucking out his insides. His whole body trembled. His head exploded with pain.</p><p>Suddenly, it ended, and he slumped back against the wall, utterly drained, wishing he had something to show for his effort.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ll come back with help.\u0094 The voice sounded eerily like his own.</p><p>His eyes flew open wide, and he saw himself\u0097his other self\u0097standing outside the cell.</p><p>Thank God. He\u0092d done it.</p><p>\u0093Save her,\u0094 he rasped in exhaustion.</p><p>His clone nodded and disappeared. And he bloody hated it, but now all he could do was wait.</p><p>At Shock\u0092s urging, Sydney rose on wobbly legs. She\u0092d never imagined he was a good guy, but now she\u0092d find out exactly how bad he was. Even if Shock didn\u0092t lay a hand on her, she had no doubt he could think of a hundred magical ways to torture her.</p><p>\u0093Faster,\u0094 he snapped. \u0093You\u0092re keeping me from my fun, and Mathias from valuable information.\u0094</p><p>The cold calculation of his command pissed her off. If she was going to die, she might as well let the bastard know how much she loathed him.</p><p>\u0093How inconsiderate of me not to run to my death. Must be a real bitch for you.\u0094</p><p>Mathias laughed, the sound scratching an icy path up her spine before his expression fell into pure menace. \u0093You\u0092ll give her extra pain for that, I hope?\u0094</p><p>\u0093With pleasure.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Wait!\u0094 Mathias barked. \u0093A disturbance in the security. I think the Doomsday Brethren have arrived. With them out of the way, we won\u0092t need this chit anymore. If we kill all the warriors, Olivia Gray and Sabelle Rion will be alone, unprotected. Certainly one of them can be persuaded to help our cause.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Don\u0092t touch my friends!\u0094 she screamed.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re in no position to issue orders.\u0094 Mathias smiled tightly, then looked at Shock. \u0093Why don\u0092t you go greet our company? Take the Anarki with you. I\u0092ll stay with our lovely guest.\u0094 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sydney could just imagine Shock\u0092s greeting. The Doomsday Brethren trusted him\u0097at least a bit. Because of it, they could be easily duped\u0097and quickly dead. Any chances of escape or a future for magickind would walk out the door with the big, bad wizard.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u0093Please, no. Don\u0092t do this!\u0094</p><p>Shock sent her a glare, shook off her hold, and walked out the door.</p><p>Caden shivered in the cold cell. But he shoved the discomfort aside and focused on the \u0093movie\u0094 in his mind that was spooling from his clone. Soon, his replica made his way out of the basement to the first floor\u0097and Mathias\u0092s sitting room.</p> <p>As he crept in shadow up the stairs and around a corner, a small lamp on the table illuminated Sydney, a small form in an oversized black leather chair, pale and hugging her knees to her chest. She stared at Mathias with undisguised hate.</p><p>Though she couldn\u0092t see him, he was damn glad to see her alive.</p><p>Sunlight was beginning to creep through the east-facing windows above him. Soon, his hiding place would be compromised. He was going to have to think and act fast to get Sydney out of here and snatch the Doomsday Diary. No way was he leaving such a weapon in the hands of someone like Mathias.</p><p>He was only going to have one chance to surprise the evil wizard, and Caden didn\u0092t know if his clone could perform magic. Even if he could channel energy to the duplicate, did he have enough energy left in him to kill Mathias?</p><p>As the sun crept farther into the room, and he heard the sounds of battle erupting outside, Caden figured it was now or never. Either the Doomsday Brethren would fight their way inside and chaos would erupt, or the Anarki would come in and kill them all. If he was going to get Sydney out before things got dangerous, it had to be now.</p> <p>Caden positioned himself into a crouch, ready to run. Sydney spotted him out of the corner of her eyes. She stifled her surprise quickly, but Mathias saw or sensed something. Whirling, he pulled out his wand. Using his instincts, Caden flipped a hand toward Mathias, picturing a fireball hurtling toward the wizard. Invisible energy ripped out of his body, burning down his fingers toward Mathias.</p><p>The other wizard couldn\u0092t scramble a defense fast enough. He jumped aside, but the ball struck him in the gut. Mathias doubled over, clutching his abdomen. Sweat dotted his temples and his face strained with pain as he looked up at Caden with hate.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092ll pay for that.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Not today,\u0094 he quipped, then pulled Sydney to her feet. \u0093Grab the book and run. It\u0092s still dark; you can get out. Stay in shadow. Bram and the others sound like they\u0092re fighting on the northeast side of the house. Run out the back and stay close to the walls. I\u0092ll be there as soon as possible.\u0094</p><p>Sydney shook her head. \u0093I\u0092m not leaving without you.\u0094</p><p>He loved her more than ever, marveled that he had a mate who was his, but locked away in a cell below, the real him couldn\u0092t defend her and both he and the clone were running out of energy. Why the hell wouldn\u0092t she listen? \u0093You and the book are all that matter. Go!\u0094</p> <p>\u0093We go together! Zap him again.\u0094</p><p>Her gaze flicked over to Mathias, beginning to straighten up, still clutching his wand with a groan. Below, Caden focused, trying to summon his energy to send to the clone to protect Sydney. His gut cramped, and he trembled, sweating and straining for something.</p><p>He had no magical energy left.</p><p>\u0093Stupid neophyte,\u0094 Mathias scoffed. \u0093I\u0092m looking forward to watching you die.\u0094</p><p>Caden had no idea why Mathias hadn\u0092t yet blasted him. Either he hadn\u0092t fully healed from the injury Olivia had delivered to him last month, or the blast he\u0092d just given the wizard had done more damage than imagined. Whatever. Time for some old-school ass kicking.</p><p>Dropping into a fighting stance, his replica delivered a blistering roundhouse kick to Mathias\u0092s jaw. He reeled back, staggering.</p><p>Below them, doors banged against the limestone walls, grunts, shouts, and the sounds of fistfighting erupted below.</p><p>Mathias smiled. \u0093Your friends are coming. Too bad they\u0092ll be too late.\u0094</p> <p>Fast as lightning, Mathias whipped his wand toward Caden\u0092s clone. A split second later, something hit him that weighed twenty tons, was as hot as lava, as destructive as acid. The spell spread throughout the clone\u0092s body. In his cell below, Caden absorbed the immense pain, felt the duplicate\u0092s organs shut down as he crumpled to the ground.</p><p>Sydney fell to her knees over him, grabbing his hand. \u0093No. No! You can\u0092t . . . Caden, listen. Please!\u0094</p><p>\u0093Take the book,\u0094 the clone panted. \u0093Get out.\u0094</p><p>Every muscle in Caden\u0092s body jolted in pain, and when the clone shut his eyes, Caden could no longer see Sydney. He panicked as pain ripped through him, shredding his insides.</p><p>The fighting reached the top of the stairs. The clone\u0092s hearing discerned shouts.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092ve already killed your friend. So glad you\u0092ll be next, Rion,\u0094 Mathias taunted.</p><p>The fighting around him resumed in a fierce clash. He sensed his replica\u0092s consciousness fading when a strong hand landed on his chest. Lucan. Funny how he sensed his brother from just a touch. Oddly, tragedy had made them closer, and he regretted that he wouldn\u0092t know what tomorrow might have brought for them.</p><p>\u0093Thank God you mated. The others are keeping Mathias busy. Quick! Kiss him, Sydney.\u0094</p><p>Moments later, Caden felt Sydney brush her lips gently over his. Nice. He floated, his consciousness like a cloud drifting in a clear, blue sky. The pain was receding, and he welcomed peace.</p><p>\u0093Fight, damn it!\u0094 Lucan growled. \u0093Take energy from your mate.\u0094</p><p>Sydney redoubled her efforts, her mouth growing insistent and frantic as the battle around them raged, others holding off Mathias and the Anarki. \u0093Don\u0092t. Leave. Me.\u0094 She peppered him with kisses between each word. \u0093Stay with me!\u0094</p><p>\u0093Can\u0092t. I\u0092m in a cell,\u0094 he managed to get out.</p><p>\u0093What the hell is he talking about?\u0094 his brother asked.</p><p>Caden didn\u0092t have the energy to answer.</p><p>\u0093I\u0097I . . .\u0094 Sydney seemed to flounder for an answer, then she gasped. \u0093You cloned yourself?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Hmm . . .\u0094 He didn\u0092t have the energy to say more. He felt his life force draining, dwindling more with each minute.</p><p>\u0093Take me to him,\u0094 Sydney commanded Lucan. \u0093This is a clone. The real him is downstairs. Bring that body.\u0094</p><p>\u0093No,\u0094 he protested, but it was a weak whisper. The remnant of his energy. \u0093Go.\u0094</p><p>Lucan ignored his pleas and lifted him, jolting every muscle in Caden\u0092s body. The agony twisted through him, and he had no idea if he could withstand more of the excruciating pain. Sweat rolled down his body, despite the chilly temperatures in the cell. He gripped the bed, wondering if it would break in his hands. He focused all his energy on staying conscious, not throwing up, waiting for Sydney.</p><p>As Lucan carried him down the stairs, the sounds of the raging battle faded in the distance. Caden nearly passed out, but he felt every step his brother carried his cloned body with a teeth-jarring agony.</p><p>A crash told him that Lucan had exploded the door wide open. Suddenly, Sydney was beside him, pressing her lips to his. Energy trickled into his system, a bit more as the seconds ticked by. Between them, Caden could feel the book. But it was her urgent touch that brought him around.</p><p>He opened his mouth beneath her and dipped inside, mingling with her, inhaling her essence. Energy now flooded his senses. He deepened the kiss, and she responded with all the fire and love inside her. His vitality spiked. The energy derived from the kiss was temporary until he could claim her body fully again, but it would hold for now.</p><p>Reluctantly, he ripped his mouth away. \u0093Better, firecracker. Thank you.\u0094</p><p>Squeezing his eyes shut, he pictured the barely alive replica merging with him, becoming one being. A sucking sound and a jolting collision later, the duplicate settled under his skin again.</p><p>\u0093You can clone yourself?\u0094 Lucan smiled. \u0093Impressive, little brother. Mum was right.\u0094</p><p>She\u0092d predicted he\u0092d be a once-in-a-lifetime hero. He wasn\u0092t\u0097yet.</p><p>\u0093The others?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Upstairs fighting off Mathias and the Anarki.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Take Sydney and the book back to Bram\u0092s for me. I have unfinished business.\u0094</p><p>Lucan frowned. \u0093You have little experience in these battles, and I\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I have energy.\u0094 He gripped Sydney\u0092s hand. \u0093And the means to get more, if need be. Until you find someone to merge with, you\u0092re going to be weak. Take her. For me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Come with us,\u0094 Sydney pleaded. \u0093Don\u0092t risk yourself.\u0094</p><p>He swallowed. \u0093Bram came back to help me and fight for you, even after he dismissed me from the Doomsday Brethren. He\u0092s remained fighting, even though we brought the book to safety. I can\u0092t leave him and the others without helping.\u0094</p><p>Lucan\u0092s smile tilted with pride. \u0093Go. We\u0092ll be waiting.\u0094</p><p>They exited the cell and began to make their way up the stairs, Caden to join the battle, Lucan and Sydney to get out of the house and teleport. Shock stood at the top blocking their entrance.</p><p>\u0093Do you have the book?\u0094 he barked.</p><p>Sydney clutched it to her chest. \u0093You\u0092re not taking it from us.\u0094</p><p>With a growl, Lucan reached for his wand, then stopped. \u0093I want to do this by my own hand.\u0094</p><p>Without warning, he charged Shock and punched him in the jaw. Shock reeled back, stumbling until his backside hit the stairs. Then Lucan drew out his wand. The leather-clad wizard froze instantly, as if his arms and legs had been bound tightly. Caden worried that Lucan had drained too much of his energy doing it, but understood that his brother needed to hurt the man who had stolen his mate.</p><p>\u0093I hope you enjoyed your cheap shot,\u0094 Shock growled. \u0093It\u0092s the only one you\u0092ll get.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If I had more energy, I\u0092d kill you. This isn\u0092t over.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Anka is with me.\u0094 Shock managed to look menacing even immobilized.</p><p>\u0093For now,\u0094 Lucan conceded. \u0093Not forever.\u0094</p><p>Then he took Sydney by the hand, led her past Shock, up the stairs, and into the morning.</p><p>Caden turned the other way and headed toward the sounds of battle to his right.</p><p>He rounded the corner to find disaster. Marrok and Tynan had engaged a dozen Anarki zombies and were quickly hacking their way through the men. Caden thought of his friend Brian with a pang and vowed that he\u0092d take that damn glass sphere from Mathias somehow, someway.</p><p>Duke and Ice had engaged a trio of wizards in robes who had appeared since the last time Caden had been in the melee. And near the fireplace, Bram and Mathias faced each other.</p><p>\u0093You\u0092re outnumbered,\u0094 Mathias pointed out.</p><p>Bram shrugged. \u0093We\u0092re better trained.\u0094</p><p>And sneaking up behind him, Caden had the element of surprise. Bram never looked his way, but sent him an imperceptible nod. Time to play . . .</p><p>\u0093Even as Merlin\u0092s famed grandson, you\u0092re no match for me,\u0094 Mathias snarled.</p><p>He whipped his wand out suddenly, then swung his arm toward Bram. A cloud of black smoke blazed between them, headed for Bram.</p><p>Before Mathias could do anything more, Caden snuck up behind Mathias and kicked him viciously in the knees. With a grunt, the evil wizard fell forward, catching himself on his hands, while his wand clattered to the tile. Brimming with fury and determination, Caden grabbed him by the hair and pounded his head directly onto the tiled floor. He heard an audible crack, and Mathias screamed. Caden raised a hand in the wizard\u0092s direction and pictured wrapping invisible ropes around Mathias to secure him. Once the wizard was still, Caden kicked him onto his back. His bloody forehead was already starting to bruise, looking darker than his blue eyes, now spitting hatred. He struggled, but seemed to be held by invisible bonds.</p><p>Marine training and magic working together. Perfect.</p><p>\u0093You should be dead,\u0094 Mathias choked.</p><p>\u0093You missed.\u0094</p><p>Now he just had to find the bloody Anarki-creating glass sphere. Dropping to his knees beside Mathias, he patted the wizard down. It might not be hidden in his clothes, but Mathias struck him as a control freak who would want it near him as often as possible.</p><p>One of his pockets bulged, and Caden reached in. Sure enough, he pulled out the familiar glass sphere. \u0093This won\u0092t be ripping out another soul.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I traveled to Africa to find that,\u0094 Mathias spat. \u0093It\u0092s rare. If you destroy it, there won\u0092t be a hell deep enough for you to hide in.\u0094</p><p>\u0093If you keep turning my friends into Anarki, I\u0092ll rip your stones out through your nostrils, then spit in the hole.\u0094</p><p>With that, Caden slammed the sphere against the tile. It shattered into a thousand tiny pieces.</p><p>\u0093Bloody stupid neophyte! I\u0092m going to kill your pretty little mate slowly and make you watch.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Right now, you\u0092re going to die,\u0094 Caden snarled. It might take every last bit of his energy, even kill him. But he was looking forward to seeing Mathias as a corpse.</p><p>Suddenly, Bram screamed behind him, and Caden whirled. The black smoke from Mathias\u0092s spell was smothering him, and Mathias\u0092s bed-warming witch screeched as she charged toward them, fury in her gaze, her wand raised in threat.</p><p>Tynan took her to the ground, but several of the Anarki rushed toward Caden and Bram. He crouched into fighting stance to face the new threat, glancing over his shoulder to glare at Mathias.</p><p>The evil wizard was gone.</p><p>\u0093Fuck!\u0094 Ice yelled.</p><p>\u0093Where did he go?\u0094 Caden shouted.</p><p>\u0093Coward teleported out.\u0094</p><p>Fury and disappointment pounded. Caden wanted to be the one to waste Mathias. For Bram, for Brian. To ensure Sydney\u0092s safety. He hated that the bastard would live another day.</p><p>Caden fought off the attack of the Anarki zombies, kicking one in the gut. It broke in half, bleeding black. The other he elbowed in the jaw. His head rolled off his rotting body. Another crept up behind him and jumped on his back. Caden cursed then backed up at a jog until he hit a wall. The Anarki squashed like a bug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Looking around, Caden saw that the other Doomsday Brethren were currently mopping up the last of the opposition. Thank God.</p><p>Another Anarki scrambled away from Tynan to Bram\u0092s side, holding a knife high above Rion\u0092s heart. Racing across the room, Caden leapt onto the ghoul, grabbed his blade, and shoved it deep into his chest. The zombie gasped as black ooze gurgled from his chest, then he slumped into death.</p><p>Breathing hard, Caden dropped to his knees next to Bram, who writhed and shouted, fighting an invisible battle with the black cloud. Caden lifted him into his arms just as Duke reached his side, looking sweaty and disheveled. An eerie calm fell over the room, now littered with black blood and dead Anarki wizards.</p><p>\u0093We have to get him help,\u0094 Duke said.</p> <p>Caden nodded. \u0093What is this black cloud?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t know. Something very bad, I\u0092m sure. Sydney, Lucan, and the book safe?\u0094</p><p>He nodded. \u0093And that damn glass sphere destroyed. Mission accomplished.\u0094</p><p>With a glance back at Bram, Caden wondered at what price?</p><p>Back at Bram\u0092s house, with afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows, Caden watched Duke and Sabelle prepare the transcast mirror so Sydney could keep magickind informed. Lucan burst in\u0097with most everyone else behind him.</p> <p>\u0093What is this, a bloody circus?\u0094 Caden demanded.</p><p>Lucan thrust his hands on his hips confrontationally. \u0093You\u0092re not going back to Texas.\u0094</p><p>If his brother was expecting an argument, Caden hoped Lucan wouldn\u0092t be too disappointed.</p><p>\u0093I\u0092m not,\u0094 he agreed. \u0093I\u0092m staying to fight. A weapon like the Doomsday Diary needs all the protection it can get. I can help.\u0094</p><p>A smile burst across Lucan\u0092s face. \u0093In that case, you\u0092ll need this.\u0094 He pulled an ornate golden box with some sort of family seal across the top. \u0093Will you take your wand?\u0094</p><p>\u0093With pride.\u0094 His chest swelled just thinking about holding the magical instrument made especially for him.</p> <p>\u0093Kneel.\u0094</p><p>Caden did, head bowed.</p><p>\u0093In the name of MacTavish, brandish this well and do good. Protect yourself, those you love, and guard this with your life. If you swear to do thus, I give this wand to you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I swear it,\u0094 he vowed as Lucan put the instrument in his hands.</p><p>Goosebumps broke out across his skin, and power vibrated through him. He was truly a wizard now. Caden looked up at his mate, who smiled proudly.</p><p>Lucan slapped him on the back. \u0093Congratulations on transitioning, mating\u0097everything. I think Mum was right; you\u0092ll be a gifted wizard.\u0094</p><p>\u0093I hope you\u0092ll consider me one of the Doomsday Brethren, too.\u0094 Caden addressed the others assembled: Lucan, Ice, Duke, Marrok, and Tynan. \u0093I\u0092m here to fight with you.\u0094</p><p>Lucan and Duke both stepped closer, and his brother spoke. \u0093Absolutely. If Bram was well, he\u0092d approve.\u0094</p> <p>Sabelle sniffed, holding back tears, and Lucan rushed to put an arm around her. \u0093I\u0092m sure your aunt and the healer will find a cure for Mathias\u0092s spell. Remember, I\u0092m here for you.\u0094 He caressed her cheek. \u0093You cared for me when I needed help. Let me help you.\u0094</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded. \u0093Thank you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093We\u0092ll get through this,\u0094 Lucan assured softly.</p><p>\u0093Where\u0092s Shock?\u0094 Ice challenged, glaring as Lucan touched Sabelle.</p><p>Lucan glared back. Reminders that the elder Denzell still kept Anka was a sore spot, and Caden cursed under his breath.</p><p>\u0093I hope the mate thief and traitor rots.\u0094</p><p>Caden agreed.</p><p>\u0093Actually,\u0094 Sydney spoke up. \u0093Shock did seem to be on Mathias\u0092s side . . . except that he could have told Mathias that the Doomsday Diary only granted the heart\u0092s true desire. The thought was right in my mind to pluck, as he had all the others. But he lied to Mathias about that.\u0094</p><p>A puzzled silence fell over the group.</p><p>Finally, Duke offered. \u0093I don\u0092t know if we\u0092ll ever know exactly whose side Shock is on. I suspect it\u0092s his own. He\u0092ll help us . . . if it suits his purpose.\u0094</p><p>That way Shock wouldn\u0092t suffer, regardless of which side ultimately proved victorious in the war. Caden didn\u0092t respect that position, but Shock wouldn\u0092t be the first to take it.</p><p>\u0093What do you think he\u0092ll do next? Or Mathias, for that matter?\u0094 Caden asked the others.</p><p>Duke shrugged. \u0093I have no idea. All we can do is stay prepared for any eventuality and stand strong.</p><p>Amen.</p><p>\u0093The mirror is ready,\u0094 Sabelle said, stepping away from Lucan.</p><p>In moments, Sydney snapped into action, got into place, and began her transcast. Yes, the Council had sent missives, likely objecting, but with Bram so ill, no one was reading his correspondence.</p><p>\u0093During a battle earlier today, a group of wizards destroyed a weapon Mathias claims he retrieved from Africa that ripped the souls from unsuspecting humans and made them Anarki instantly. Mathias escaped, but his forces have been badly damaged. As always, updates will follow as necessary,\u0094 she concluded. \u0093I\u0092m Sydney Blair.\u0094 She cut a glance over at Caden and winced at his scowl. \u0093Sydney Blair MacTavish. Stay safe. Good afternoon.\u0094</p><p>The transcast ended. Caden was still afraid for his mate\u0092s safety, but pride beamed all through him. She was vital to him and magickind. He had no idea what he\u0092d do without her\u0097and thankfully he hadn\u0092t learned the hard way this morning.</p><p>He held her close and pressed his lips to hers. \u0093Perfect.\u0094</p><p>\u0093The transcast?\u0094 she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u0093Yes, but I meant you. I\u0092m very proud of you.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Ugh. New mates.\u0094 Duke rolled his eyes. \u0093I\u0092m leaving.\u0094</p><p>The others followed suit and closed the door to the library behind them, sequestering Caden and Sydney alone.</p><p>\u0093I hope you mean that,\u0094 she whispered. \u0093Because I called Holly today and quit my job.\u0094</p><p>Fear for her speared through him, but he took a deep breath. This was war; they were mates and in this together. \u0093She hadn\u0092t already sacked you?\u0094</p><p>\u0093Aquarius told her I was working deep undercover on a new magickind story. It satisfied her until I called. She wasn\u0092t happy.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Are you?\u0094 he asked gently. \u0093Do you truly want to give up your human existence and work exclusively for magickind? What about proving to your parents that you\u0092re a journalistic star?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I don\u0092t need their validation anymore. I know I\u0092m doing something good. That\u0092s all that matters.\u0094 She bit her lip in uncertainty. \u0093What about you? Once, you wanted to return to Texas and resume\u0097\u0094</p><p>\u0093I thought I did. You said it best when you accused me of running from my destiny. It took nearly losing everything and everyone I love dearly to make me realize I had to stand and fight for what I want. I\u0092m a wizard now, and magickind needs those trained to fight during what\u0092s bound to be dark times ahead. And I wouldn\u0092t leave your side for anything in the world.\u0094</p><p>\u0093What about your job in Dallas?\u0094</p><p>\u0093I called and resigned an hour ago. You\u0092re stuck with me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Promise?\u0094 she laughed. \u0093Where is that little red book? I have a few untapped fantasies I want to jot down.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Oh, no, you don\u0092t. If you want something, from now on, you only need to tell me.\u0094</p><p>\u0093Looking forward to it,\u0094 she murmured, then pressed her lips to his. </p> </body></html>"]
