Their job on earth was done. They\u2019d earned their beautiful, sparkly angel wings and could stay in heaven forever...and ever...and ever. The end.\u201d</p><p>Parker Harrington Welles suppressed a dry heave, closed the book and tried not to envision smothering the fictional angels, no matter how much she would\u2019ve enjoyed it.</p><p>Don\u2019t kill us, Parker! squeaked the imaginary voices in her head, their voices helium-shrill.</p> <p>I can\u2019t kill you. You\u2019re immortal. Unfortunately. One of the huge downsides of writing the series\u2014the little pains in the butt talked to her. Another downside\u2014Parker talked back.</p><p>Seven or eight little hands shot up in the air.</p><p>\u201cPlease write more Holy Rollers books, Miss Welles.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d rather bathe in my own blood, kid, thought Parker. \u201cNo, sweetie, the Holy Rollers are in heaven now,\u201d she answered. \u201cThis is the last book in the series. But you can see them in a movie this summer, don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Today at her son\u2019s preschool, the Holy Rollers, a book series so sickeningly precious it made The Velveteen Rabbit look like a chapter out of Sin City, was officially done. Though they had made Parker moderately famous in the world of kiddie lit, had been translated into sixteen languages and had print runs in the gazillions, there was no getting around the fact that their author hated them.</p> <p>Hate is such an angry word! chorused the child angels. We love you, Parker! Honestly, they were a Cartoon Network version of a Greek chorus, always popping into her head with unwanted advice.</p><p>\u201cDid you write Harry Potter?\u201d was the next question, this one from Nicky\u2019s friend Caitlin.</p><p>\u201cNo, afraid not, honey. But I love those books, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I get the Warm Fuzzles, just like the Holy Rollers,\u201d Mariah said, and Parker nearly threw up in her mouth. Had she really invented that term? Had she been drinking at the time?</p><p>\u201cAre you rich?\u201d Henry Sloane asked.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Parker answered, \u201cif you\u2019re asking if I make a lot as an author, the answer is no. All the money I get for the Holy Rollers goes to a charity called Save the Children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for kids who don\u2019t have enough food,\u201d Nicky said proudly, and Parker smiled at her son. It was the one good thing about the book series. Parker didn\u2019t need the money, so right from the get-go, she\u2019d donated all proceeds to the charity, which took away some of the nausea.</p><p>\u201cBut you live in a mansion,\u201d Will Michalski stated with authority. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. You have twenty-nine bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d she said, a twinge of discomfort flashing through her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mansion. It\u2019s a castle! I want to live there when I grow up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to write another book?\u201d asked Amelia.</p><p>Excellent question. Parker might not love the Holy Rollers, but new ideas hadn\u2019t exactly been pouring out of her. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not quite sure yet. But I\u2019ll let you know, okay? Any other questions? Yes, Ben.\u201d</p> <p>After another half hour, as the questions dwindled into what color wings Golly should have, the teacher finally stepped in.</p><p>\u201cMiss Welles has to get going, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said. \u201cKids, can you say thank-you to Nicky\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Nicky\u2019s mom!\u201d the kids chorused, then rushed her, hugging her legs, the payoff for reading The Holy Rollers Earn Their Halos out loud.</p><p>\u201cAm I staying with Daddy this weekend?\u201d Nicky asked as they walked to the car.</p><p>\u201cYou sure are,\u201d Parker answered. She stroked her son\u2019s dark hair. Ethan\u2019s weekend had come awfully fast, it seemed. She gave her son a kiss, then bent to buckle him into his booster.</p><p>\u201cI can do it myself,\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry, honey.\u201d She got into the driver\u2019s seat and started the car.</p><p>A weekend alone. Parker tried not to sigh. She really needed to find another idea for a series. The Holy Rollers had been born as a spoof, sure, but they\u2019d been her job for the past six years. Aside from staring at a blank computer screen and possibly watching a Gerard Butler movie or three, she had no plans.</p><p>\u201cYou should sleep over, too,\u201d Nicky suggested, practically reading her mind. \u201cWe could have popcorn. Lucy said she\u2019s making me a cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman can bake, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite kind. With the frosting and the coconut. I can eat seven pieces, she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she, Nicky?\u201d Parker cocked an eyebrow. Truth wasn\u2019t a strong point for her little guy these days.</p><p>\u201cI think so. She maybe said five. But it was a lot.\u201d</p><p>Nicky continued to chatter about the joys that lay ahead of him for the weekend: eating cake; a sail on Ethan\u2019s boat; more cake; sleeping with Fat Mikey, Lucy and Ethan\u2019s cat; possibly taking a bath with Fat Mikey; having cake at midnight; and finding the pirate\u2019s cave that Mackerly, Rhode Island, supposedly possessed. Like his grandmothers, Nicky had been born with the gift of chat.</p><p>As she pulled onto Ocean View Drive, Parker frowned a little. The preschooler\u2019s comment about living in a mansion had struck a nerve. Lately, she\u2019d been thinking of moving, concerned over the idea that Nicky would be thought of as the rich kid. It hadn\u2019t helped her; trust funds were hard to get past for a lot of people. But Grayhurst had been in her family for four generations, built by her great-great-grandfather at the turn of the century, and though she\u2019d grown up in New York City, Parker had moved to Mackerly permanently after she\u2019d gotten pregnant. She had a lot of happy memories of childhood summers\u2014tea parties with her three cousins, learning to sail with her father. Ethan lived in town, and she\u2019d wanted Nicky to grow up knowing both his parents, even if they\u2019d never been married. But two people, living in a mansion in which they really only used a few rooms...it didn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>The place was gorgeous, though, she thought as they pulled into the driveway. Silhouetted against the aching blue of a June sky and bathed in the golden sun of late afternoon, the gray stone building looked like a stately grande dame gazing out contentedly over the acres of manicured lawns, flower beds and mature trees. Frickin\u2019 huge, but beautiful.</p><p>Ethan and Lucy, Parker\u2019s closest friends, were already here, holding hands as they sat on wide front steps that led from the driveway to the enormous entryway. Ethan jumped up to open her door as she pulled in.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Nicky yelled, scrambling out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my guy?\u201d Ethan asked, scooping him up.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lucy said, \u201care congratulations in order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am officially done with the Holy Rollers. Let the good times roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Parks,\u201d Ethan said, kissing Nicky\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou proud of Mommy, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. What\u2019s for snack? Is cake for snack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cake till after supper,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cUnless your dad decides otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecide otherwise, Dad!\u201d Nicky commanded, cantering ahead.</p><p>\u201cParker, do you have plans tonight?\u201d Lucy asked. \u201cI figured the boys could have some time alone, and we could hang out.\u201d</p><p>Saved! \u201cI would love that! We can break open some of my father\u2019s wine and gossip about Ethan\u2019s flaws all night.\u201d</p><p>Lucy reached for his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s driving me crazy. I\u2019m thinking marriage was a huge mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, it\u2019s like you\u2019re reading my mind,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cShall I call an attorney?\u201d They grinned at each other.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I just ate, okay?\u201d Parker said, cocking an eyebrow. The tiniest swirl of envy threaded through her. Lucy and Ethan were crazy in love, and yep, Ethan was the father of Parker\u2019s child. It wasn\u2019t as freaky as it sounded. Or maybe it was, and Parker was in denial.</p><p>\u201cWe brought the itinerary for our trip,\u201d Ethan said, standing back to let the ladies go in first. \u201cFigured you\u2019d want a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Parker said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m dying to see it.\u201d</p><p>Her friends had gotten married in February, but they hadn\u2019t had a honeymoon yet; instead, they were taking Nicky to California as soon as preschool finished. San Francisco, Muir Woods, Yosemite. After that, Ethan would be occupied with the reopening of his restaurant, so the timing seemed perfect.</p><p>It was just that it was for three weeks.</p><p>Three weeks without her boy.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Nicky galloped back and grabbed his father\u2019s hand. \u201cCome see my room! I cleaned it yesterday. Mommy made me. She said it was a sty. Where pigs live. I found Darth Vader\u2019s head!\u201d He tugged his father up the curving staircase.</p><p>Parker and Lucy went through the house to the kitchen, Parker\u2019s favorite place in the house. \u201cI brought us sustenance,\u201d Lucy said, holding out a bag. \u201cWhite-chocolate macadamia cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatan, get thee behind me.\u201d She took out a cookie\u2014heck yeah, still warm!\u2014and took a bite. Bliss. \u201cDo you know I\u2019ve gained eleven pounds since last year? You hit thirty-five, and bam, all those things you ate in your twenties launch themselves onto your ass.\u201d Parker raised an eyebrow as Lucy laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already see,\u201d her friend said. \u201cSo what? You\u2019re a size eight now? The horror, the horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hit double digits some time ago. Let\u2019s never speak of it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Lucy said.</p><p>Marriage agreed with her, Parker thought. Lucy\u2019d had it rough; widowed before her first anniversary years ago. Jimmy, her husband, had been Ethan\u2019s older brother; Ethan and Lucy had been college friends; the shared loss brought them closer together. About six years after Jimmy died, Ethan and Lucy had finally hooked up.</p><p>And somewhere in there, long before Ethan and Lucy had anything romantic together, he\u2019d dated Parker for about two months. The guy had been great on paper, save for one minor detail: he\u2019d been in love with Lucy. Parker always thought it funny that more people hadn\u2019t seen it. She broke up with him\u2014it wasn\u2019t terribly hard; they\u2019d already seemed more like old pals than anything\u2014then found out six weeks later that she was pregnant. They\u2019d shared Nicky from the beginning.</p><p>She took another cookie out of the bag and ate it. \u201cHoly halos, these are good. Shoot me if I eat another. Where\u2019s the itinerary? It\u2019s color coded, right? Tell me it\u2019s color-coded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Lucy said, unfolding a three-page spreadsheet.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be in San Fran for three days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d Lucy pointed. \u201cSee? San Francisco\u2019s in pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Parker bent over the paper, grateful for Lucy\u2019s organizational skills. She\u2019d know where her son was every minute.</p><p>Ethan came into the kitchen and helped himself to a cookie. \u201cParker, what are your plans while we\u2019re away?\u201d he asked. \u201cGot anything lined up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I might bop out to Nantucket and see some old pals out there. Go into the city. Maybe visit my mom. You know.\u201d She reached for another cookie.</p><p>The truth was, she hadn\u2019t made any solid plans. The idea of having her son four thousand miles away made her want to sleep at the airport, in case something went wrong. Which it won\u2019t, the Holy Rollers assured her. Lucy and Ethan are the best! Plus, it\u2019ll be good for Nicky to see what a healthy adult relationship looks like!</p><p>Take a bite, Parker thought. So she hadn\u2019t been in a relationship since Ethan. So she\u2019d yet to go on a second date with anyone in five years. So what? She tended to attract emotionally unavailable men, anyway. Married men, engaged men, sociopaths, that sort of thing. Better not to date at all. The fact that she\u2019d spent a lot of time watching gritty TNT dramas and eating Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s should not be construed as jealousy. It was more like a filling of the gap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A gap that would now be uninterrupted for three weeks.</p><p>When Ethan broached the vacation idea back in March, it had seemed like a fabulous idea...Parker, on her own, free to do whatever she wanted\u2014sleep past 5:00 a.m., for example, as Nicky was like a rooster about mornings. Find that elusive new idea for a book series. Just because Parker had been born with a trust fund didn\u2019t mean she wanted to build a life around shopping for handbags.</p><p>But as the spring progressed, she did nothing. What if something happened with Ethan\u2019s restaurant, and the trip had to be canceled? What if a new book series came to her, and she was on fire to write it, the way she\u2019d heard other authors describe? She should probably stay home, in case something came up.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. And now with ten days to go, the time alone seemed to loom like a mine shaft. She didn\u2019t even have the Holy Rollers to keep her busy, and the fact that this even caused a twinge was deeply disturbing.</p> <p>\u201cI was hiding! No one found me! I beat you all.\u201d Nicky charged into the kitchen with Elephant, his favorite stuffed animal.</p><p>\u201cNicky, you can\u2019t hide without telling us, remember?\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a game that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I always win,\u201d her son pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Lucy said.</p><p>Parker grinned and knelt down. \u201cKiss me, mister. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, too. Bye, Mom! Bye, Lucy!\u201d He bolted out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cue. See you, girls. Have fun tonight.\u201d Ethan kissed Parker on the cheek, then went out to the foyer with Lucy, where Parker presumed he would kiss her goodbye a little more intensely.</p><p>For a second, she wondered if Lucy was here out of...well...sympathy. Once, she, Ethan and Lucy had been three single friends. Now, instead of three, it was two and one.</p><p>So? Get a boyfriend, Golly advised. Since the release of the final book, it seemed to Parker that the Holy Rollers were aging in her imagination. They were depicted in the books as being about eight, but here Golly was already trying on mascara.</p><p>\u201cRight. A boyfriend,\u201d Parker answered. \u201cI need that like a stick in the eye.\u201d</p><p>She headed down to her father\u2019s beloved wine cellar, complete with a stone tasting room\u2014fireplace and all. Thousands and thousands of bottles, including the bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Lafite supposedly owned by Thomas Jefferson. Or not. Harry was quite a liar.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t seen her father for a while now; the last time was when he\u2019d held a wine-tasting dinner down here with a few sycophants from Wall Street, his omnipresent personal attorney and one of the Kennedy clan, who was up for reelection. Her orders were to bring Nicky down to be introduced, then bring him back upstairs. And stay upstairs with him. Not that she\u2019d have stayed even if asked. Which she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Well. Here was that nice 1994 Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti Harry had bragged about. Eight grand a bottle, far less than the 1996 vintage. Surely Harry wouldn\u2019t mind if his only child and her best friend drank that, right? He had a whole case, after all. She wouldn\u2019t tell Lucy how much it cost. Lucy was a little scared of Harry. Most people were.</p><p>Parker went back upstairs, uncorked the wine and let it breathe a little. Got out some goat cheese and grapes, some of those crumbly crackers. It was so great that Lucy had decided to hang out. Maybe too great. You\u2019ve got to fill these empty hours somehow, Spike said.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Parker said. \u201cYou\u2019re dead to me. Go. Fly off to heaven.\u201d She poured two glasses of the wine and set the cheese plate on a tray.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Lucy asked, coming back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSpike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. Well, listen. The books were very, um...entertaining. And they did a lot of good for a lot of kids. To the Holy Rollers.\u201d Lucy clinked her glass against Parker\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMay they rest in peace,\u201d Parker said, taking a healthy sip of wine.</p> <p>Six years ago, Parker had been sitting in the office of a Harvard classmate, hearing for the fifty-seventh time that Mickey the Fire Engine, the children\u2019s story she\u2019d written, wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Parker,\u201d George had said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little familiar.\u201d</p><p>Familiar? Mickey was wonderful! And really, what the heck? She had a double degree from Harvard in literature and ethics. Half of her graduating class seemed to be writing romance novels; Parker had fifty-six rejections to her name. Make that fifty-seven. Mickey was full of sincerity and good messages\u2014having a purpose, commitment, courage, second chances. With all the schlock that was out there, it was hard not to feel bitter.</p><p>\u201cGot anything else?\u201d George asked, already glancing at his watch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHow\u2019s this? A band of child angels are sent to earth to teach kids about God. Right? They haven\u2019t earned their wings, though, so they roller-skate everywhere\u2014they\u2019re the Holy Rollers. Do you love it? All they eat is angel food cake, and they live in a tree fort called Eden, and whenever a regular kid is up against a tough moral decision, in come the Holy Rollers and the preaching begins.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s The Crippled Lamb meets The Little Rascals meets The Exorcist.\u201d She sighed and stood up. \u201cWell, thanks for your time, George. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he said.</p><p>The next week, she\u2019d had an offer and a contract, and she and Suze, her old roomie from Miss Porter\u2019s School, had come to Grayhurst to celebrate, eat whatever Harry\u2019s chef felt like cooking them, swim in the indoor pool and laugh at life\u2019s ironies. The second night, they\u2019d gone to Lenny\u2019s, the local bar, and there was Ethan Mirabelli, who\u2019d flirted with them equally, despite Suze being g*y and built like a professional wrestler. When Ethan had asked for Parker\u2019s phone number, Suze had given her a heavy elbow to the ribs, her way of indicating approval. And the rest, as they say, was history.</p><p>Parker and Lucy took their goodies into the front room and were laughing over Lucy\u2019s in-laws\u2019 propensity for dropping by during certain intimate moments. \u201cIt\u2019s like they know,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cHonestly, some days I think they have the apartment bugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might,\u201d Parker agreed. Her phone rang, and Parker glanced at the screen \u201cOh, speaking of difficult parents, it\u2019s my mother. I bet she has a husband for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoody! Put her on speaker so I can hear, too!\u201d Lucy clapped like a little kid.</p><p>Parker clicked on. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I have someone for you!\u201d Althea Harrington Welles Etc. Etc. sang out.</p><p>Parker pulled a face for Lucy. \u201cHooray! Don\u2019t even worry about us meeting\u2014just start planning the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarcasm is the lowest form of humor, haven\u2019t you heard? Anyway, his name is...oh, well, I don\u2019t remember. But his last name is Gorman, as in Senator Gorman from Virginia? His father. Those charges were dropped, by the way. Isn\u2019t it exciting, sweetheart? I\u2019m thinking The Caucus Room for your engagement announcement party, the National Cathedral for your wedding, reception at the senator\u2019s home on the Chesapeake. It\u2019s stunning. I looked it up on Google Earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me when to show up in the big white dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be matron of honor?\u201d Lucy whispered.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Mom, Lucy\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware, dear. Hello, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs.\u2014um...Althea,\u201d Lucy said.</p><p>\u201cLucy, maybe you can make her take this seriously. She\u2019s so obsessed with that child, she hasn\u2019t noticed she\u2019s getting old! Honestly, my only daughter, never married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Lucy concurred, grinning. \u201cI tried to fix her up with my mute assistant at the bakery, but she said no to him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather date Jorge than a senator\u2019s kid,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHis tattoos are amazing. That one of the crucifixion? So lifelike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Make fun of me, girls. Oh, did you see my Facebook? I\u2019m auditioning for Real Housewives out here. Maury thinks it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>Parker mimicked a scream, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom. So you think you might come visit next month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. Maury has this thing. How\u2019s Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe misses you,\u201d Parker said, playing the guilt card.</p><p>\u201cWell, you kiss that beautiful boy for me, all right? And seriously, sweetheart, think about the Gorman heir. I hate to think of you in that hideous old house, all alone except for your toddler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s five and a half, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, when does one stop being a toddler? Anyway, it\u2019s not my point. My point is\u2014 Oops! Maury\u2019s ringing in. Kisses to my grandson! Nice to hear your voice, Lisa. Bye, Parker! Talk soon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mom.\u201d Parker sighed. \u201cMore wine, Lisa?\u201d</p><p>Lucy laughed. \u201cI like your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see her more, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Parker grumbled.</p><p>Just as they\u2019d finished their first glass of wine and were debating on whether to Google the Old Spice man or Ryan Gosling, they heard the crunch of tires on the long gravel driveway. \u201cThink Nicky forgot something?\u201d Lucy asked, going to the window and pushing back the silk drapes. \u201cEesh! It\u2019s your father. And his entourage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bugger and damn. Do we have time to hide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m allowed to hide,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cYou probably have to say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare go anywhere,\u201d Parker ordered.</p><p>A flare of nervousness\u2014her trademark reaction to Daddy Dearest\u2014flashed through her stomach. Almost automatically, she smoothed her hair and glanced down at her attire. Since she\u2019d been at Nicky\u2019s school as Parker Welles, Author, rather than Nicky\u2019s Mom, she\u2019d dressed up a little...beige silk shirt, ivory pencil skirt, the fantabulous leopard-print shoes. Good. A little armor.</p><p>She joined Lucy at the window and looked out. The driver of the limo opened the back door, and Harry Welles emerged into the sunlight, followed closely by Thing One and Thing Two, his minions.</p><p>Technically, Grayhurst was Harry Welles\u2019s home, though he lived in a sleek and sterile duplex on Manhattan\u2019s East Side. He only came to Rhode Island to impress clients or when he couldn\u2019t avoid a family event. He was the third generation to run Welles Financial, once a conservative financial-services firm, which Harry transformed into the kind of Wall Street playah that was often picketed by students and teachers\u2019 unions. He never traveled alone\u2014flunkies like Thing One and Thing Two were part of Harry\u2019s makeup.</p><p>The three men came up the walkway and into the house, Thing One and Thing Two trailing at a respectful distance behind him, like castrati guards in a harem.</p><p>Her father scanned her, unsmiling.</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she said, keeping her tone pleasant. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Her father glanced at her friend. \u201cLucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Welles. Nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Harry took a deep, disapproving breath\u2014well, it seemed disapproving. \u201cI have something to discuss with you, Parker. Is Nicky here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with his father this weekend. But I can run over and get him.\u201d There was that pesky, hopeful note in her voice. If you don\u2019t like me, at least like my kid, Dad.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s just as well. We need to discuss a few family matters.\u201d He looked pointedly at Lucy, who smiled sweetly and, bless her heart, didn\u2019t move a muscle. Harry\u2019s eyes shifted back to Parker. \u201cHow\u2019s Apollo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Pleasantries finished, he strode down the hallway. \u201cJoin me in the study, please,\u201d he added without looking back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Welles, your father would like you to join him in the study,\u201d said Thing Two somberly. The man held a long and meaningless title at Welles Financial, but so far as Parker could tell, his job was to echo her father and occasionally slap him on the back in admiration. He fell into step behind Harry, keeping six or seven paces behind.</p><p>\u201cParker. Always lovely to see you.\u201d</p><p>And then there was Thing One.</p><p>It was his customary line, usually delivered with a raised eyebrow and a smirk, and she hated it. Yes, Thing One was attractive\u2014Harry would never hire an ugly person. The whole cheekbones and perfect haircut and bored affect...okay, okay, he was hot. But he knew it, which detracted significantly, and that line\u2014Parker, always lovely to see you\u2014blick. Add to the fact that he was a Harry-in-the-making, and his appeal went down to nil.</p> <p>Thing One didn\u2019t work for Welles Financial; he was Harry\u2019s personal attorney, having replaced the original Thing One a few years ago\u2014why change a perfectly good nickname? He lived somewhere here in Rhode Island and did things like...well, Parker really didn\u2019t know. Occasionally she\u2019d have to sign a paper he brought by. Otherwise, he seemed fairly useless, glib, smug and so far up her father\u2019s butt she wondered how he could see daylight.</p><p>\u201cThing One,\u201d she murmured with a regal nod. Miss Porter\u2019s hadn\u2019t been for nothing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s James, since you can\u2019t seem to remember. I also answer to Mr. Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing One suits you so much more.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sardonic look, then turned to her friend. \u201cHello, Lucy,\u201d he said. He\u2019d met her at a number of Nicky-related events\u2014God forbid Harry come alone. \u201cCongratulations on your wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d Lucy said, looking a little surprised that he knew. Parker wasn\u2019t. Harry was hardly a doting grandfather, but he did keep tabs on Nicky\u2019s life. Or had his people keep tabs, as the case might be.</p><p>\u201cAfter you, ladies,\u201d he said. He looked somber. Parker was more accustomed to seeing him in full-blown slickster mode, kissing up to her dad, glad-handing whoever was around him. A small quiver of anxiety ran through her gut. Something was...off.</p><p>As they walked down the hall, Parker rubbed the tip of her ear. It was itchy. Stress eczema, probably, brought on by dear old dad.</p><p>Harry never did any real work in the study. So far as Parker could tell, he used it to impress and intimidate his colleagues. The room was beautiful, though, filled with first-edition books, Tiffany windows, a state-of-the-art humidor and a desk the size of a pool table. Harry sat in his leather chair now, his thick gray hair perfectly cut, his suit Armani, his eyes cool. Around his arm was twined Apollo, her father\u2019s pet ball python.</p><p>Yeah. You are your pet, right? Apollo was maybe four feet in length\u2014Parker didn\u2019t spend a lot of time looking at him, as he gave her a hearty case of the heebie-jeebies. Nicky, though...in case living in a mansion wasn\u2019t cool enough, he loved to impress his friends with Apollo, whose glass cage, it must be noted, was always locked. Didn\u2019t want to have a python slithering around the house, no indeed. The gardener was charged with feeding him and cleaning his cage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so Dr. Evil,\u201d Lucy whispered, giving Parker\u2019s hand a squeeze. She went to a window seat and curled up there, nearby, but at a distance.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Harry,\u201d Parker said, that nervousness flaring again. She sat in one of the three leather chairs in front of the desk. Things One and Two stood to one side, like soldiers at a funeral. \u201cHow are things? Are you here for the weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And things have been better. Is my grandson almost finished with school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Then he\u2019s going to California with his dad and Lucy.\u201d</p><p>Harry glanced at Lucy. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d echoed Thing Two, scratching his stomach. Parker waited for Thing One to chime in, too, but he remained silent, his arms folded.</p><p>Harry gazed at his pet, then kissed the snake\u2019s head. Parker tried not to flinch. That snake would make some very attractive shoes. Otherwise, he was her rival for Harry\u2019s attention. Well, hardly her rival. Apollo was ahead by miles. Her father looked at his minions. \u201cGentlemen, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Thing One and Thing Two obeyed, taking the seats on either side of her. She glanced at Lucy, who gave her a nervous smile of solidarity. There was definitely something in the air, and for the life of her, Parker felt a little bit as if she was about to be sentenced.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t far off.</p> <p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no easy way to say this,\u201d her father said, stroking his snake.</p><p>\u201cNo easy way,\u201d Thing Two murmured.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t look up from the snake. \u201cWe\u2019re broke. You have to move.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>JAMES CAHILL, also known as Thing One, closed his eyes. Granted, Parker Welles was not his favorite person, but even so. Hearing it put so baldly...uncool. Her friend gave a little squeak. Otherwise, there was silence.</p><p>He glanced at the princess. She didn\u2019t move for a second, then tucked her hair behind one ear, the tip of which was growing red. Otherwise, she just sat there, her profile to him. She crossed her legs. Said legs were flawless\u2014long, smooth, perfect. Not that he was allowed to look at them\u2014she\u2019d put him in his place quite a while ago, and yes, she was being informed of her financial ruin, but man, those legs were incredible.</p><p>\u201cBroke?\u201d she said, then cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Harry answered, petting the snake. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of broke, I assume?\u201d</p><p>Now, James knew that Apollo was some kind of security blanket for Harry; easier to break the news to his only child if he had something else to look at. Their whole vibe was always wicked uncomfortable; James hated having to go to Welles family events, but if Harry invited him, he\u2019d come along. It was the least he could do, given what Harry had done for him. Didn\u2019t make things fun, though.</p><p>Parker took a deep breath, her br**sts rising under her silky shirt. Nice. Focus, idiot. The perils of being a straight guy in the room with a beautiful woman. Even one who loved putting him down.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Dad?\u201d she asked, her voice more gentle than James had ever heard it. And \u201cDad.\u201d He couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d ever heard her call him anything but Harry in the six years he\u2019d been working for the guy.</p><p>Harry shifted Apollo to his other arm. \u201cJust a bump in the road. For now, there\u2019s no more money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, fill her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, why don\u2019t you fill her in?\u201d Vernon echoed, parrotlike.</p><p>Right. Time to earn that salary. \u201cOkay, well, it\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he began.</p><p>She gave him a razor blade of a look. \u201cTry me. I\u2019m a Harvard grad.\u201d</p><p>So much for her soft edges. And God forbid he forget that her blood ran crimson. James himself had gone to Boston University; once, he\u2019d flirted with a Harvard girl and told her he went to BU. \u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d she\u2019d asked, because if you went to Harvard, other schools didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>She had, however, gone home with him.</p><p>\u201cMagna cum laude,\u201d Parker added.</p><p>\u201cShould I kneel?\u201d he asked. Harry snorted, and Parker\u2019s mouth tightened. Not cool. James hadn\u2019t meant to make it seem as if it was boys vs. girl here. Even if it kind of was.</p><p>Parker\u2019s friend cleared her throat. \u201cUm, Parks, you want me to, uh, get started on dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you stayed,\u201d Parker said. Her tone was locked into rich-girl drawl. \u201cPlease continue, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Majesty. \u201cIt seems that Harry got mixed up in an insider-trading deal.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at her father, who was stroking his snake. \u201cOh, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him finish,\u201d Harry said, not looking away from Apollo.</p><p>James shifted in his seat. \u201cHarry made a sizable investment in a company on which he\u2019d had inside information\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what insider trading is,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and that was obviously unethical, but more to the point, the results weren\u2019t what the information promised.\u201d Okay, here came the hard part. \u201cTo cover the losses to investors, your father needed to, ah, liquidate certain assets.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, and James felt a pang of sympathy for her as realization dawned in her eyes. \u201cWhich assets, Harry?\u201d she asked, her voice calm.</p><p>Harry looked at the python. \u201cYour trust fund.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her hands, her mouth tight. \u201cGranddad set that up for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been managing it most of your life,\u201d Harry snapped. There was a pause, and the grandfather clock in the corner ticked ominously. \u201cNicky\u2019s, too,\u201d Harry added in a softer voice.</p><p>James couldn\u2019t help but wince. It had to hurt, hearing your father had sold you down the river. Your kid, too.</p><p>\u201cYou stole your grandson\u2019s trust fund, Harry?\u201d Her voice was harsher now.</p><p>Harry\u2019s lips pressed together. \u201cI\u2019m the administrator of the Welles family trust, Parker, as you\u2019re well aware. I liquidated it temporarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiquidated it temporarily,\u201d Vernon echoed, smiling like an idiot. James had almost forgotten he was here.</p><p>\u201cHow temporarily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo!\u201d came a voice. A shaggy-haired guy wearing overalls stood in the doorway. \u201cHey there, gang, sorry. Is this the Welles place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, man! Really nice! So, like, we\u2019re the movers? Gonna start in the game room, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBilliard room,\u201d Harry muttered.</p><p>The mover laughed. \u201cTotally! Colonel Mustard in the billiard room with the candlestick! Dude, is that a snake? Nice! Okay, better get going. This place is frickin\u2019 huge! See you later!\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s mouth was open. \u201cThey\u2019re taking stuff already? I\u2014 Wow, Harry. You don\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><p>Her face was pale now, and James wished he could, well, make this easier for her somehow. \u201cParker, anything that you bought for you or Nicky or the house is yours. Everything else, I\u2019m afraid, falls under Harry\u2019s assets, which the Feds have seized. The investigator is aware that you\u2019re living here, and you have a little time to, ah, pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d She squeezed her little finger and glanced at her pal, who was frozen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Lucy murmured automatically.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. \u201cObviously, Parker, having these vultures pick over our belongings is not my choice. I\u2019ll get everything back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>\u201cEventually. I\u2019m a little...constrained for the immediate future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little constrained indeed,\u201d Vernon said.</p><p>That was one word for it. James rubbed his forehead. Wicked headache coming on.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Parker shook her head. \u201cAbout my trust fund, and Nicky\u2019s. Don\u2019t you need my signature to just...empty it? There must be something left.\u201d</p><p>Nope. There was nothing, and Harry had only needed James himself to file the paperwork. Poor planning on her part, that was for sure. At any time since her eighteenth birthday, she could\u2019ve taken full control of that money. When her son was born, same deal.</p><p>She never had.</p><p>\u201cYour signature wasn\u2019t required,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNor was your consent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour consent was not required,\u201d Vern said, nodding cheerfully. There was a crash and a curse from somewhere in the house.</p><p>Parker took a deep breath \u201cWow, Harry. So it\u2019s gone? That was a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Parker!\u201d Harry barked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say you\u2019ll have to make do for a while. Until I can recover some losses.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long will that take, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Again, Harry\u2019s eyes sought out James.</p><p>Shit again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s undetermined right now,\u201d James said. \u201cYour father is being sentenced Monday morning.\u201d</p> <p>Parker\u2019s hand went to her mouth. \u201cOh, Dad.\u201d Twice in one day. \u201cCan I do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, Parker?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I have a great team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great team!\u201d Vernon agreed.</p> <p>Lucy got up from the window seat and went to Parker\u2019s side. Took her hand. Good girl, James thought. Parker would be needing her friends, and so far as he could tell, Lucy here and the Paragon of Perfection otherwise known as Ethan Mirabelli were her closest. Or so it seemed from those dreaded family events he\u2019d attended.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ll have to serve any real time.\u201d</p><p>James was sure. Oh, yeah. Harry was looking at somewhere around five years. His case wasn\u2019t the clusterfuck that some Wall Streeters had been involved in of late, but it was a clear-cut case. And after Bernie Madoff and the Occupy movement, there wasn\u2019t a judge in the country foolish enough to go easy on a case like this.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, you\u2019ll have to move,\u201d Harry added. \u201cI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll take Apollo.\u201d</p><p>You know, James had to wonder sometimes what the hell was wrong with Harry. He loved the guy, yeah. But he was a pretty big idiot around his daughter. And yep, here it came.</p><p>Parker\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cTake Apollo? You\u2019re worried about your snake, Harry? How about your grandson? The one you robbed? Where should I take your grandson, Harry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure his father would take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not living away from my son!\u201d she exclaimed. Her ears were burning red now.</p><p>\u201cYou can both live with us, Parker,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Lucy, thank you. But no. Harry, Ethan and Lucy just got married. I\u2019m not moving in with them! What about your apartment? You could sell that and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d James said as gently as he could. \u201cThe SEC has seized all your father\u2019s assets. The apartment, this house, the place in Vermont...everything.\u201d</p><p>She glanced out the window. \u201cThere goes the Steinway. Holy crap.\u201d She swallowed, then looked at James, her expression bleak. \u201cWhen do I have to be out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll leave your rooms for last,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have till the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis month?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis month,\u201d Vernon confirmed.</p><p>She squeezed her pinkie again. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cWell, that\u2019s... I was actually thinking it might not be a bad idea to move to a smaller place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmaller place. Not a bad idea,\u201d Vernon echoed, and James resisted the urge to duct-tape his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cLet me go call Ethan, okay, Parker?\u201d Lucy said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Parker said distantly.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Lucy said more firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone in this. Okay? I have some money put aside, and you\u2019d do the same for me. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Harry made a rude snorting noise.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Harry,\u201d Lucy snapped. \u201cYou should be grateful she has friends when her own father does this to her.\u201d</p><p>Score one for Team Lucy.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Luce.\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be fine. But sure, go call Ethan. Fill him in.\u201d</p><p>Whereupon the Paragon would no doubt charge up the driveway on his white horse and rescue the mother of his child. Which, no doubt, Parker would love. James sighed.</p><p>Harry was staring at the python, and James thought, not for the first time, that if he gave his daughter as much attention as he gave the snake, things would be a lot less chilly in the Welles family.</p><p>\u201cSo my trust fund\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stock market\u2019s not too bad these days. How\u2019s my portfolio doing?\u201d</p><p>Harry still didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cAnything you had through Welles Financial is now unavailable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnavailable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it back, Parker!\u201d Harry snapped. \u201cYou have what\u2019s in your checking account at the moment. Do you have anything in savings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You told me the stock market was better than...well, what am I saying? You\u2019re a felon. I took advice from a felon. Good God. I guess I should\u2019ve stuffed some cash into the mattress.\u201d Parker gave a shaky laugh.</p><p>Clearly the news was catching up with her. She ran a hand through her long hair, the strands falling back into place. Smooth, silky hair that\u2014 Been there, worshipped that, his conscience chided.</p><p>\u201cI can believe you took my money,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t believe you stole Nicky\u2019s. That\u2019s really low, Harry. Even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was necessary,\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cFor what? For covering your ass?\u201d</p><p>James held up his hands. \u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s just...let\u2019s try to calm down. This is a lot to take in. Your father made a mistake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did you lose, Thing One?\u201d she asked abruptly.</p><p>James hesitated.</p><p>\u201cOh. I get it,\u201d she said, and if looks could kill, James would be lying in a bottomless puddle of blood right about now. \u201cSo you knew. Well. Do go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have six thousand dollars in your checking account, and since that\u2019s in your name only, it\u2019s free and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to make a phone call,\u201d Harry said, unwinding his pet and putting him back in the case. \u201cVernon, come with me, please. I need the information on the drug-company stock. Parker, James can fill you in on the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more? Are you going to beat me with a rubber hose, Thing One? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>James waited till the study door closed, leaving him alone with Parker. And Apollo.</p><p>Nope, not alone. The mover was back. \u201cOkay if we start on the dining room? Packing up that china\u2019s gonna take a while. It\u2019s really nice! Expensive, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d Parker said. When he was gone again, she looked at James. \u201cIs Harry really going to jail?\u201d she asked, and James had to say, it wasn\u2019t the question he imagined she\u2019d ask.</p><p>\u201cYes. He went to the D.A. and confessed this morning, so that\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t been in the news yet. Monday morning, though...\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look. \u201cHe confessed? That doesn\u2019t seem like him.\u201d</p><p>James looked at his hands. \u201cYeah.\u201d There was that ticking noise again.</p><p>Parker sighed. \u201cSo, all this other stuff...Granddad\u2019s boat and the paintings and Grandma\u2019s china...it doesn\u2019t belong to us anymore?\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her. \u201cAnything in this house that you personally bought stays with you\u2014your clothes, artwork, your car, anything you bought for your son\u2014but the rest will go to refund what Harry\u2019s clients lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have no savings, no portfolio, no trust fund, and we have to move. Is that it in a nutshell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry was able to secure another five thousand in cash for you.\u201d James reached into his briefcase\u2014a gift from Harry\u2014and handed her an envelope, which she took automatically. \u201cYou have some jewelry that\u2019s yours, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she said. James knew exactly what she had, as it was listed on the insurance forms. Nothing spectacular\u2014some aging pearl necklaces, a few antique stickpins from her grandmother. All in all, maybe worth another couple grand. Parker wasn\u2019t the type to drape herself in diamonds or redecorate or buy a sports car\u2014she drove a Volvo Cross Country that was a good five or six years old. She didn\u2019t even travel that much. She was more like the Welles family of yore\u2014quieter, old-money New England wealth.</p><p>Harry was the new breed\u2014make sure the world knew how much you had by spending every cent.</p><p>And even though she\u2019d handed him his nuts on a platter a few years ago, he couldn\u2019t help feeling really shitty about the whole situation. \u201cI know this is a lot to take in,\u201d he said gently, and she cut her eyes over to him. Yikes.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there was no way you could\u2019ve given me a heads-up, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. Attorney-client privilege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope that lets you sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving on,\u201d James continued, \u201cyou do own the house in Maine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich house in Maine?\u201d</p><p>Rich people. Honestly. \u201cYour great-aunt Julia Harrington left you a house when she died six years ago. Ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOh, my gosh, right. I was just about to have Nicky when she died. Where is it? I never did make it up there.\u201d</p><p>James kept his expression neutral. How do you forget about inheriting a house? \u201cThe house is in Gideon\u2019s Cove,\u201d he said, handing Parker the folder. \u201cNorth of Bar Harbor.\u201d He knew the town...or he did once. His bachelor uncle owned a bar up there, and James had spent a couple of summers with him as a teenager.</p><p>\u201cSo I could sell that, right?\u201d Parker asked, her expression brightening a little. \u201cSell the house and have a nest egg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d James said. He didn\u2019t know which house was hers, though he had a copy of the deed. If he remembered, Shoreline Drive had some nice places on it.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She was quiet for a minute. \u201cI\u2019ll go up there when Ethan and Lucy take Nicky on vacation, slap on some paint and get it listed with a real-estate agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he said. His own experience was that life was rarely that easy, but for her sake, he hoped it was.</p><p>\u201cYou reminded her about the house?\u201d Harry asked, striding back into the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cGood. Parker, James knows the area. He\u2019ll go with you and check out the property.\u201d Right. She\u2019d love that. God save him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Vernon agreed.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut thanks all the same, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish,\u201d Harry said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019ll need help.\u201d</p><p>Parker turned to James, her eyes about as warm as Apollo\u2019s. \u201cThing One, my father is so very kind to offer your services, but no thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Harry said. \u201cDo whatever you want. You always do. We\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she began, standing up. There was the pinkie squeeze again. \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t do anything for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He flashed her a toothy smile that was so far from sincere it made James wince. Then Harry strode back out, looking every bit the master of Wall Street he used to be, Vernon murmuring on his heels.</p><p>And James, he well knew, was expected to follow. He stood up, then turned to Parker, who was staring at the snake. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about all this, Parker,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to help.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look they must\u2019ve taught her at her fancy prep school. I\u2019m sorry, and you are...? \u201cSave the ass kissing for my father, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>Sigh. Some people never changed. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>Okay, enough with the princess act. \u201cI am good for some things,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you might remember. Carpentry is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. How fascinating. Bye-bye, Thing One. And tell my father I\u2019m not taking that snake.\u201d</p><p>James stood there another minute, torn between guilt\u2014his favorite pastime\u2014the desire to help her in some way and the fact that he could see down her shirt a little bit from here. Fantastic view. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You don\u2019t take anything seriously, do you? his father\u2019s voice demanded in his head.</p><p>Hard to deny. \u201cI loved the last Holy Rollers book, by the way,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThen your IQ is even lower than I thought.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help a smile. Parker looked away. \u201cCall me and let me know what happens on Monday,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWill do.\u201d He picked up his briefcase and turned back to her. \u201cSee you in Maine.\u201d</p><p>She shot him an icy look. \u201cNot if I see you first. The gun laws are pretty clear about intruders on private property.\u201d He said nothing. \u201cGo, Thing One. Your master awaits.\u201d</p><p>James obeyed. There was nothing else he could do.</p><p>For now, anyway.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>IN THE TWO WEEKS since her father\u2019s bombshell, Parker thought she\u2019d done a pretty good job of holding it together. She was a mother...you don\u2019t get to walk around cursing like Job or crying. And Lucy had been amazing that first weekend, helping her through the initial shock, going through the house, determining what could reasonably be called Parker\u2019s as the movers tagged and wrapped her family\u2019s belongings.</p><p>Not a lot was Parker\u2019s outright. Her Mac, of course. A few pieces of furniture, a couple of paintings, a few little things for the house\u2014a vase, some throw pillows, nothing tremendously valuable.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll help with money,\u201d Lucy\u2019d said at least fifteen times. \u201cI have Jimmy\u2019s life insurance, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut you know what? It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s shocking, sure, but Ethan\u2019s got a nice bit tucked away for Nicky\u2019s college, and I can flip the house in Maine and have a little money and write some more books. Or get a job doing something else.\u201d</p><p>She smiled firmly, trying to forget that she\u2019d A) ignored her father\u2019s advice to major in economics and had instead double-majored in two such ridiculously unemployable fields that she actually woke up covered in a cold sweat one night\u2014English was bad enough, but Ethics? Ethics?\u2014and B) she hadn\u2019t had a new idea for a book series since the hideous Holy Rollers had been conceived. It was such bad timing that she\u2019d given the little suckers their wings and halos. She could\u2019ve milked them forever.</p><p>But honestly, after the initial shock, it was a little hard to feel as if a great injustice had befallen her. For thirty-five years, she\u2019d had more privilege and wealth than ninety-eight percent of the world. When she\u2019d watched the footage of the Occupy Wall Street gang, back before she was broke, she couldn\u2019t help thinking they had a point.</p> <p>And now the point had been made. Now, she was normal. Better than normal, according to Lucy\u2014she had a little over eleven grand in her bank account, no debt and a house on the coast of Maine. By Paris Hilton standards, she was destitute; by normal-people standards, sitting kind of pretty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss coming over here,\u201d Lucy said as she folded a sweater. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll need to find another friend with a mansion.\u201d</p><p>Parker smiled, appreciating Lucy\u2019s attempt to keep things light, not to mention her help at packing. Lucy was very organized. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does Nicky seem to be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know how he is. One minute, he thinks it\u2019s great that we\u2019re moving, the next he forgets why we\u2019re packing. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really wrapped his brain around the idea that we won\u2019t be coming back to live here. But I was thinking of moving anyway. It\u2019s easier than explaining why my father\u2019s in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Ethan that Grandpa Harry was in a time-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how I put it. He had to go away and think about playing by the rules and being greedy.\u201d She winced. \u201cNicky still took it pretty hard. But Harry\u2019ll probably be out on good behavior and all that in a couple years.\u201d Years. Crikey.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you doing with that, Parker? I know you and your father aren\u2019t really close, but still.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. But still.\u201d She gave Lucy a quick look. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel bad for him on the one hand. On the other, he deserved it. Then again, I\u2019ve lived off family money all my life, and I never really looked at where it came from. So anyway, it all belongs to the Feds now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard, though.\u201d</p><p>Parker swallowed. It was hard. The people from the SEC had been here last week, and they\u2019d let her keep a few sentimental things\u2014a model of a duck that her grandfather had carved, the little white vase her grandmother had let her fill with flowers from the garden. \u201cWell, I did snag a few bottles of wine from the cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPriorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. And it was nothing really expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your cottage in Maine. Am I wrong to think Bush compound? Sort of like this place, but with gray shingles?\u201d</p><p>Parker snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I only met my great-aunt a couple of times. You know my mother, always dragging me off to a new stepfather. When we did see family, someone was always having a nervous breakdown. There were no picnics, no bonfires, no uncles who dressed up as Santa. One of my few memories of Aunt Julia is that she told me to start smoking or I\u2019d get fat. I was probably about thirteen at the time.\u201d She gave Lucy a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cJeesh, Parks! How come you\u2019re so normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably not,\u201d she admitted, tossing some socks into her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cSo you barely see your relatives, but you inherit their summer homes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s our own form of guilt and family obligation and to make up for decades of bitterness, alcoholism and neglect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you curious about the house?\u201d</p><p>Parker shrugged. \u201cWell, I was nine months pregnant when Julia died. Then that colic\u2014remember? I could barely say my own name for six months. The truth is, I kind of forgot about it.\u201d Parker zipped up a suitcase. \u201cI did a Google search of the address, but all I got was a spot on a map; no satellite pictures available. Apparently I have a second or third cousin up there, according to my mom. I left a message on what I think is her machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s great that you\u2019ll have someone close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I did see pictures of the town, and it\u2019s really pretty, Luce. Like a postcard...lobster boats and pine trees. And I do know the house has a water view, so how bad can it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I bet it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll zip up there, spend a little money, flip it, zip back down here, find a place for us to live, and we should be all set before Nicky starts kindergarten.\u201d She folded a cashmere hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019ll be good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about a new book series? Think you\u2019ll get some writing done up there?\u201d</p><p>The million-dollar question. \u201cI hope so. I figured my father\u2019s crimes would hurt sales, right? But no. The opposite, and now my publisher is all over me for another idea before the notoriety fades. Can you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, I guess. That you\u2019re wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It was good; it was just a little disheartening to picture writing another sappy series, rather than that elusive, noble, touching Charlotte\u2019s Web kind of masterpiece she\u2019d been hoping to pull off. Attitude is everything, the Holy Rollers chided. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to get started.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s better! the HRs cheered. They\u2019d aged to about twelve and giggled a lot these days.</p><p>\u201cSo I was thinking,\u201d Lucy said, shooting her a little smile. \u201cNo kid for three weeks...you should have a fling.\u201d</p><p>Parker snorted.</p><p>\u201cNo, no! It\u2019d be great! A summertime romance with some hot sailing dude or a fisherman. I\u2019m thinking George Clooney in The Perfect Storm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis character dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do a little swimming, eat some lobster, do whatever else they do in Maine, but live a little, Parker. Find a summer hottie and get it on, girl! What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I\u2019m hearing this from you, of all people. Princess Purity turned pimp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019re the one who admitted to watching Neil Patrick Harris\u2019s Emmy speech eight times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up to eleven, actually. And I\u2019m convinced I could turn him straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, we all have that dream. But a fling would be great, Parks! Come on. Who was the last guy you slept with, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crikey! Was it Ethan?\u201d</p><p>Parker winced. \u201cNope. No, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Oh, my gosh. Ethan, who is now married to your best friend.\u201d Lucy grabbed another sweater and folded it. \u201cThat\u2019s both sick and sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop pimping me. It\u2019s so unlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Remember that singles thing you made me go to last year? Who was pimping whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s pimping?\u201d Nicky burst into the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, ladies, what is it?\u201d Ethan asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a grown-up thing,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt involves, um, baby making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Parker agreed, looking at Lucy with a smile.</p><p>Fling, Lucy mouthed.</p><p>\u201cDaddy couldn\u2019t find me,\u201d Nicky said, jumping on the bed and rolling amid Parker\u2019s clothes like a puppy. \u201cI was in the pantry, and he couldn\u2019t find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were playing, Nick,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to answer when I call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sorry.\u201d Her son began trampolining on the bed. \u201cGuess what, Mom?\u201d Bounce! \u201cDaddy says\u2014\u201d bounce \u201c\u2014our plane leaves\u2014\u201d bounce \u201c\u2014in four\u2014\u201d bounce \u201c\u2014more\u2014\u201d bounce \u201c\u2014hours!\u201d He jumped off the bed with a thud. \u201cAnd I might get some peanuts from the waitress.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s throat tightened. She ran a hand through Nicky\u2019s hair, which was still baby-soft. Don\u2019t change too much while you\u2019re gone. \u201cYou\u2019ll have so much fun, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it. You should come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be up in Maine, so I\u2019ll have a vacation, too. And Daddy will bring you up there when you get back. It\u2019s really pretty. We can eat lobster. Maybe go sailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Kiss Elephant.\u201d He held up his stuffed animal for a smooch. Parker obeyed, then gathered her son in her arms, breathing in his salty little-boy smell.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Nicky,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Mommy,\u201d he said. Then he wriggled out of her arms, seeming to see her suitcases for the first time. \u201cWe won\u2019t live here ever again?\u201d he said, his voice quavering.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I want a house just like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a smaller place. Like Daddy and Lucy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this house. I\u2019m gonna come back here and live!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, pal,\u201d Ethan said, \u201cthis house is really big. It\u2019s meant for lots and lots of people. But the new house will be yours and Mommy\u2019s. And you can help pick it out, right, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d She gave Ethan a grateful look.</p><p>\u201cI want it to be purple.\u201d Nick folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI love purple,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>Ethan glanced at his watch and gave her an apologetic look. \u201cWe really should get going.\u201d</p><p>This was it. Three weeks\u2014twenty-three days, if one was counting, and Parker definitely was\u2014without her son. She picked him up again and held him tight, relishing his strong little arms around her neck. \u201cI love you, Nick. I\u2019ll call you every night. And we can use Skype.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you every night,\u201d Nicky said. \u201cAnd every morning.

It\u2019s the trip of a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye, Mom! Elephant says bye, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Elephant! Bye, Nicky! I love you!\u201d</p><p>Then Lucy took Nicky by the hand and led him down the long hall. Don\u2019t worry, Parker, chimed the Holy Rollers. No one can replace you! You\u2019re the mom!</p><p>\u201cParker.\u201d Ethan took the shirt she was folding\u2014and folding and folding, apparently\u2014and put it on the bed. \u201cI know this hasn\u2019t been easy. And you\u2019ve been a rock. But I know it\u2019s been...a lot.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so kind and nice that Parker could feel her own filling. Dang it. \u201cIt\u2019s a little overwhelming,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019re not alone in this. I love you, Lucy loves you, you gave my parents their only grandchild, and they think you walk on water. You have all of us.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cEspecially me.\u201d</p><p>Not for the first time, Parker wished things had been different with her and Ethan. The guy was damn near perfect. \u201cI do know that, Ethan. And I appreciate it. Things aren\u2019t that bad, really. It\u2019s just been...fast. But I\u2019ll flip the house up there and we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her another minute. \u201cOkay.\u201d He squeezed her shoulders and let her go. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun in Maine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I really will. It\u2019ll build character.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have plenty of character.\u201d With that, he hugged her again and left. A minute later, she heard the echoing thud of the front door closing.</p><p>Alone in an eight-thousand-square-foot house.</p><p>Once, when she was seven, she\u2019d roller-skated down the big hallways and into the vast kitchen, where Bess, the cook, had given her a slice of rhubarb pie. Most of the year, the Welles family\u2014Althea, Harry and Parker\u2014had lived in New York, in an apartment on the Upper East Side, but Grayhurst had always felt more like home. When she was very small, her grandfather had still been alive, and she had some cherished memories of a man with a deep voice who smelled like Wintergreen Life Savers. For a few magical weeks each summer, they\u2019d come here and be together, Harry around for dinner, Althea making sand castles on the beach. Her three cousins, all girls, would come over to play, and they\u2019d spy on the grown-ups, and make forts in the endless rooms of Grayhurst. Her dad had taught her to sail, and she and Althea played tennis after dinner.</p><p>But when she was ten, her parents divorced, and summer was never the same. Harry became a stranger, and Althea married Clay, the first of Parker\u2019s stepfathers, less than a year afterward. Per court order, she\u2019d visit Rhode Island for a week or two in the summer, sometimes foisted off on her aunts, then spending a torturous few days alone with Harry, who\u2019d work most of the time. Then it would be off to whatever summer program was the in thing that year\u2014a summer at sea, another at the Sorbonne, one in Scotland with other daughters of rich people. And don\u2019t get her wrong. She\u2019d had some great times, seen some beautiful places.</p><p>But those summers here, at Grayhurst, before she realized what kind of man her father was, before her mother had become a serial trophy wife...those summers had been the best. Her fifth birthday party had been here, and there\u2019d been a white pony. When she was nine or so, she\u2019d had a sleepover, and the gardener had rigged up a screen in front of the indoor pool, and Parker and five friends had bobbed around on inner tubes and watched Jaws.</p><p>And this was where she\u2019d brought Nicky home after he was born. She\u2019d rocked him in her grandmother\u2019s Morelock chair and looked out at the sea. How could she not love the place where she learned how to be a mother?</p><p>Now Nicky\u2019s beautiful room would be someone else\u2019s. The dining room where they\u2019d once tied a rope and played Tarzan, the topiary in the back where they\u2019d had so many lunches, the back parlor where she and Lucy had spent many a girls\u2019 night, laughing until they cried...all someone else\u2019s.</p><p>Well. Self-pity wasn\u2019t going to get her car packed up. The moving truck was coming to take her clothes and most of the stuff to storage\u2014Nicky\u2019s bunk bed, the big white sofa she had in her office, the collection of Holy Rollers books in their many translations. The photo albums and framed pictures of Nicky\u2019s artwork.</p> <p>All her life, Parker knew, she\u2019d had the cushion of not just a trust fund, but the security of being a Welles of the Rhode Island Welleses. John Kennedy had once sailed his boat here and stayed for dinner, as he and her grandmother were childhood friends. E. B. White had played tennis on Grayhurst\u2019s courts with her grandfather.</p><p>Now, for the first time, Parker was truly on her own.</p><p>It was oddly thrilling.</p><p>She\u2019d use what she needed to spiff up the house in Maine and turn a cushy profit\u2014what, maybe a couple hundred grand? Not bad for a woman who was broke.</p><p>And you know what else? Maybe Lucy was right. Lady Land had been long ignored. Maybe a little summer romance would be a good thing. Heck yeah! She had twenty-three days on her own. Might as well live a little.</p><p>But now, she\u2019d go downstairs, uncork a bottle of her father\u2019s cheapest. She\u2019d take it out onto the back terrace and enjoy Grayhurst\u2019s view for the last time. And maybe, since no one else was around, she\u2019d have a good cry. And skate down the halls one more time.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>AFTER EIGHT HOURS in the car, Parker finally saw what she was looking for: a white sign surrounded by pansies and the words Welcome to Gideon\u2019s Cove, Population 1,411. \u201cFinally,\u201d she muttered, slowing the car. Maine was flipping enormous, and one didn\u2019t really understand how enormous until one had to drive the entire length of the thing. But she was here at last. Hopefully, in a few moments, she\u2019d be opening the door of her inheritance, pouring a glass of wine and running a hot bath. You deserve it! cheeped the female Holy Rollers, who were much more in tune with this kind of thing than the boys.</p><p>\u201cYou said it, sisters,\u201d Parker muttered. She\u2019d been talking to them the entire drive. Just one more reason to be grateful she was here.</p><p>The downtown of Gideon\u2019s Cove consisted of a tiny library, two churches, a town hall and about four storefronts. A bar with a neon Bud sign in the window. There was a cheerful little diner; it seemed to be the only restaurant in town. Parker grimaced. It was cute, but not exactly a tourist mecca\u2014no T-shirt stores, no ice-cream shop, no fried-clam shack. How robust could the real-estate market be in a town with 1,400 people?</p><p>The road ended at the harbor parking lot. Parker pulled into a space and looked out at the view. Okay, yes, it was beautiful here. The cove was edged with a ragged line of gray rock and pine trees, the water a deep cobalt accented by choppy waves. A small fleet of lobster boats\u2014six or eight of them\u2014bobbed in the darkening blue of the evening. Beyond the cove was the Atlantic, and clouds tinged with pink and lavender rested on the horizon.</p><p>Gorgeous. And somewhere close by was her house.</p><p>The Harringtons had been wealthy, too\u2014not like the Welles family, but sedately comfortable. Althea had gone to Bryn Mawr and grew up in Westchester; Aunt Julia had been from the Boston side of the family, and had lived in a musty but respectable town house. Parker had only visited a few times, so her memory was dim. A house on the coast of Maine...surely it had potential.</p><p>Unfortunately, her GPS didn\u2019t acknowledge the existence of Shoreline Drive. Wouldn\u2019t hurt to find someone to ask.</p><p>Parker got out of the car, her lower back creaking a little, stretched and inhaled deeply. Then gagged. Bugger! What was that smell? Sure, Gideon\u2019s Cove was a fishing village, but there was fish...and then there was this. Briny, fishy and rotten, thick enough to practically taste. It must have had something to do with the corrugated-metal building past the harbormaster\u2019s building.</p><p>A few more breaths, and the smell wasn\u2019t quite so repulsive. The wind was stiff and salty, so at least there was that. And though it was a beautiful evening, no one seemed to be around. Seagulls hovered on the breeze, and waves slapped against the white hulls of the boats. The wind shushed through the pines. Farther away, Parker heard some music, a baby crying. Mostly, though, it was quiet.</p><p>Aha. There was someone\u2014a man motoring in from one of the lobster boats. He pulled up to the dock, jumped neatly out and tied off the boat, then came up the ramp toward her. Perfect. A local who could give her directions. \u201cHi,\u201d Parker called, waving in case he missed her.</p><p>He stopped in front of her, then nodded.</p><p>Oh, Mommy! The word fling jumped rather forcefully to mind. She glanced at his left hand. No ring. Perfect. Lucy had urged her to have a fling, and the gods of Fling had sent this guy. How was that for convenience? Black hair. Light blue eyes. Laugh lines. Welcome to Gideon\u2019s Cove indeed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word. Just looked at her. Perhaps he was mute.</p><p>\u201cHi there,\u201d she said again, sticking out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Parker. I\u2019m visiting for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again and shook her hand briefly, his hand strong and calloused. \u201cMalone.\u201d</p><p>Dead sexy, just the one name. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Which was fine\u2014he didn\u2019t have to speak. He could simply stand there, looking hot. Okay, but yes, it was going on a little long. So. How to proceed? Truth was, Parker was a little\u2014very\u2014out of practice on the boy-girl front. Too bad Fling Material didn\u2019t say, Hey there, blondie, welcome to town. Let me buy you a drink and show you around! Maybe we could have a fling, because I find you very attractive.</p><p>Yeah, no. He didn\u2019t seem to be the talking type. But he hadn\u2019t left, either. \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cRight. Well, I\u2019m looking for my aunt\u2019s house. Julia Harrington. She lived on Shoreline Drive.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cDo you happen to know where that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d He said nothing more for a second, then, realizing perhaps more was required, cleared his throat. \u201cAbout a mile out of town, that side of the cove.\u201d Malone pointed. \u201cTake a left out of the lot, then a quick right, and there you are.\u201d</p><p>His voice was rough, and he dropped his Rs even more than they did in Rhode Island. It worked. \u201cThanks,\u201d Parker said, her voice perhaps a little breathy. Go ahead, ask him out, Spike advised. He\u2019s a guy. He\u2019ll say yes.</p><p>Her ears were itchy. \u201cWell, um, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around. Small town and all.\u201d That was not asking him out. \u201cAnd thank you, Malone was it? Malone.\u201d Still not asking him out. \u201cSo...I\u2019ll see you around?\u201d Jeesh. So out of practice.</p><p>But no, no, looky here. He was smiling a little. Heck yeah! Maybe she wasn\u2019t so bad at this after all.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nope. She did suck. She would\u2019ve said good-night, but he was already walking away.</p><p>That was terrible, the Holy Rollers said in disappointment. They were right. She was very bad at asking men out. This hadn\u2019t always been the case, but it was sure true now, wasn\u2019t it? Tall, Dark and Silent had simply appeared, all tousled and manly with those rough and calloused hands that, come on, probably knew their way around the female anatomy, because really. How many g*y lobstermen were there?</p><p>\u201cAll right, settle down,\u201d she told herself, getting back into her car. Talking aloud, the writer\u2019s affliction. \u201cLet\u2019s get home before we start jumping the locals.\u201d</p><p>Home. That had a nice sound to it, yes indeed.</p><p>Julia\u2019s house was at 97 Shoreline Drive, and Parker drove slowly, checking the numbers on mailboxes and doors. The road wasn\u2019t much wider than a driveway. There were a few very nice houses\u2014two Victorians, a Greek Revival\u2014but they grew smaller and more sparse as the road curved with the rocky shoreline, leaving behind the snug little town surprisingly fast. The last house was 66 Shoreline Drive; otherwise, there was nothing, other than a decrepit little shed that appeared to be about to fall into the ocean. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hang on a sec. The road led to a small peninsula that jutted out into the cove, and Parker glimpsed a clearing in the pine trees. Heart rate kicking up a few levels, she wound down the road, then slowed to a stop. This had to be it; it was the end of Shoreline Drive. An iron gate barred the driveway, flanked by stone posts and a small, tasteful sign\u2014Welcome to the Pines at Douglas Point. Number 66 was a ways back; this had to be 97.</p><p>Heck yeah!</p><p>She turned off the engine and got out of the car. Lucy had joked about the Bush compound, but Parker wasn\u2019t sure the Bushes could afford this place. The house was gorgeous. Smaller, much smaller, than Grayhurst, but absolutely stunning. The driveway led up through the pines to what had to be a fifteen- or twenty-room stone house. Slate-shingled roof. Iron lampposts. Though the light was fading from the sky, Parker could see mullioned windows galore, huge beds of white and red impatiens, hydrangeas, mountain laurel and ivy...the place was like a park! Good Lord, in ten minutes, she could be inside, wine and bath a reality!</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aunt Julia!\u201d Parker breathed. She couldn\u2019t wait to see what it looked like. Was it furnished? She had an air mattress, just in case, but given how well kept the outside was, she\u2019d bet it was full of solid old furniture. Maybe there was a caretaker; it sure looked that way. Weird that she owned the place and had never been sent a bill or anything. Then again, maybe her accountant had taken care of it. Still, she should\u2019ve known if someone was on the payroll.</p> <p>Whatever. She wasn\u2019t complaining. You know what? She\u2019d have a party before she sold it. Nicky could wear his little tux, and she\u2019d wear that ice-blue Vera Wang, and they\u2019d send out invitations\u2014Parker Harrington Welles and Nicholas Giacomo Mirabelli warmly request the honor of your company for the weekend at the Pines at Douglas Point, Gideon\u2019s Cove, Maine.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s get inside,\u201d Parker muttered. There was a code box; she flipped it open. State-of-the-art. Getting back into the car, she reached into the glove compartment and pulled out the envelope Thing One had given her the day he told her she was broke. There was the deed, there was his business card, there was a key...but no code. Dang it! She pulled out her phone and found Thing One on her contacts list. It went right to voice mail. The one time she actually needed something from him, and he was unavailable.</p><p>\u201cHi, Thing One, it\u2019s Parker. I\u2019m here in Gideon\u2019s Cove, and I have the key, but I don\u2019t have a code for the gate. Would you please call me as soon as you get this? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Her irritation with her father\u2019s minion faded as she looked back at the house. It was so pretty, and far less imposing than Grayhurst. Good Lord, she could get at least half a mil for this place, probably much more, and hey, maybe she could even hang on to it and rent it out\u2014</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d came a voice, and Parker jumped and whirled around. It was Fling Material\u2014um, Malone\u2014sitting in a somewhat battered pickup truck, and ten minutes apart hadn\u2019t diminished his appeal. Unless he was stalking her, which, though a flattering thought, was somewhat terrifying.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi again.\u201d She held her phone up to her ear. \u201cJust talking to my lawyer,\u201d she lied, in case he was a serial killer. \u201cBut I found it fine, thanks. See you around. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>Parker blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia Harrington\u2019s is back there.\u201d Malone nodded behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhere back there?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cThat little place you just passed.\u201d</p> <p>Parker looked back down the road. There was nothing except the shed. She glanced at Malone. He nodded.</p><p>No. That couldn\u2019t possibly... Oh, no. Uh-uh. Her stomach twisted abruptly.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a house. It was a shack. A falling-into-the-ocean hut.</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>No. No, no. That house had boards over the windows. It was...crooked somehow. It couldn\u2019t have been more than five feet from tumbling down to the rocky beach below. Square-footage wise, it wasn\u2019t really a house at all! It was the size of her bedroom back home.</p><p>Odd little noises were coming from her throat. She swallowed and turned to the lobster guy. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia Harrington\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, then.\u201d</p><p>Bugger! Bugger and damn. Parker took a deep breath, then another.</p><p>\u201cYou need anything?\u201d Malone asked.</p><p>\u201cUm...a different house?\u201d He didn\u2019t respond. \u201cNo, I\u2019m...fine. It\u2019s okay. Thanks for checking, though.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and put his truck in gear.</p><p>\u201cWait! Malone, is there a hotel in town?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cUsed to be a bed-and-breakfast, but it burned over the winter.\u201d</p><p>Well, tie her to an anchor and throw her in an ocean full of hungry sharks.</p><p>\u201cGood night, then,\u201d Malone said, then was gone, his taillights disappearing around the corner. Good news was, he hadn\u2019t murdered her. Bad news was...oh, crap! This beautiful house wasn\u2019t hers, and that...that...tenement appeared to be.</p><p>Parker got back in the car and sat for a minute. It\u2019s a fixer-upper! chirped the Holy Rollers. \u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re imaginary. You won\u2019t be picking up a hammer and helping, will you?\u201d She threw the car in Reverse and backed out the driveway. \u201cI really wanted you!\u201d she called back to the Pines. Yes. She wanted a house with a name. Call her shallow, but bugger, she did not want to live in a shack, even for a few weeks.</p><p>Ninety-seven Shoreline Drive was on the ocean side of the road; the hill was steep as it rose from the harbor, and it was clear why there weren\u2019t many other houses around\u2014most of them had probably fallen victim to storms over the years.</p><p>The shack sat on cement pilings, a two-foot gap between the earth and the house. No basement, clearly. She walked around the house slowly, the grass up to her knees. Were there mice in there? Probably. She shuddered. She hated mice. Her father liked to dangle them over Apollo\u2019s cage before dropping them to their doom.</p><p>Upon further inspection, she saw that the shack was, or had once been, an actual house, like something Nicky would draw\u2013a square box with a triangle on top. The gray shingles had warped, pulling away from the side of the house like eyelashes, and great shards of paint peeled from the once-white trim. The roof was patchy and battered, complete with crumbling chimney, but at least there was some form of heating, she guessed. All the windows were boarded, and the aluminum screen door was off its hinges, leaning against a rusting front door. Clearly people had tried to break in over the years\u2014there were dents all around the door handle, and the small windowpane was broken.</p><p>A cluster of lilac trees was in full bloom. \u201cGood sign, right?\u201d Parker asked, her voice a bit unfamiliar. The HRs agreed that yes, it was indeed a positive indicator.</p><p>There was a wooden stairway down to a small dock, but it was nearly full dark now, and Parker was not about to break her neck figuring out whether or not the stairs were sound.</p><p>\u201cBite the bullet,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cTime to go inside and view your inheritance.\u201d</p><p>The key Thing One had supplied fit fine. Had he known this was her house? Had Harry? Think they might\u2019ve given her a hint at what lay ahead?</p><p>Parker turned the lock, which slid open after some wiggling. The door was warped, however, and stuck fast, so she shoved harder, using her shoulder. Once, twice, three times, and bam, it opened.</p><p>Pitch-dark inside. She groped on the wall for a light switch and got lucky. Someone had turned on the electricity\u2014or it had never been turned off\u2014and a harsh yellow light momentarily blinded her.</p><p>Permanently blinded might\u2019ve been better.</p><p>Parker closed her mouth, then opened it to swear, then realized that she didn\u2019t know a word bad enough.</p><p>Aunt Julia had been a hoarder.</p><p>Faded boxes and stacks of crumbling newspapers lined the hallway so there was only a tiny path leading into the house. The smell was so thick and dry Parker choked. There was so much crap everywhere, it was hard to take in\u2014pots, pans, candlesticks, yellowing plastic containers, paper plates, old fabric, swollen paperbacks, a set of encyclopedia, plastic dolls. Cripes! And this was just the hallway! Parker lifted her gaze to the cracked plaster walls visible above the hoard to the cracked plaster ceiling. God. The place was a wreck. She tried to take a calming breath, choked and pulled up her shirt to cover her mouth\u2014or muffle her scream, she thought darkly. It\u2019s only stuff, Spike said. Check it out a little. See what you got.</p><p>Good advice, good advice. To her left was a bathroom, the door open. Pepto-Bismol-pink tub spilling over with...stuff. But there was a sink visible, and a toilet, thank the Lord. First things first.</p><p>You\u2019re not really going to pee in there, are you? asked the female Holy Rollers. When was that last cleaned?</p><p>\u201cWhere else should I go?\u201d Parker answered. \u201cOutside?\u201d</p><p>A girl had to do what a girl had to do, especially after two coffees on the way up. Still, the horror of the situation was not lost on her. An eyeless doll lay in the bathtub, just in case the place wasn\u2019t creepy enough. The toilet flushed, but when Parker turned on the faucet to wash her hands, nothing came out. Fine. She had Purell in the car.</p><p>Across from the loo was a bedroom, she guessed\u2014too much junk to open the door all the way. Praying no bats were currently living inside, Parker poked her head in. There may have been a bed, but it was hard to tell with all the boxes. Clothes, some still on their hangers, lay abandoned and forgotten. Shoes, hats, a box full of ceramic kittens, bags of yarn, books, macram\u00e9 plant holders.</p><p>A second bedroom held more of the same.</p><p>She sidled down the hall, trying not to touch anything, toward what proved to be one big room, the kitchen on one side, what had once been a living room on the other. Another single lightbulb hung from a wire in here\u2014still worked, showing piles of plastic bins filled with old clothing, more newspapers, sewing bric-a-brac. There was a fishing pole on the counter, couch cushions in front of the refrigerator, which looked to be from 1950, rounded and hulking. The oven was green, its door hanging open as if in a scream\u2014Parker could totally relate. More boarded windows that probably overlooked the sea.</p><p>Sometimes it\u2019s darkest before dawn! the Holy Rollers chirped, patting her shoulder, and Parker envisioned herself backing over them with the Volvo. Platitudes were not going to help. A fire\u2014a big one\u2014might.</p><p>How was she going to have Nicky come up here? How was she going to sell this place? Until this moment, Parker hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d been counting on a real house. This was all she had to her name, other than the $11,202.57?</p><p>Oh, crap, she was hyperventilating. And who knew what she was breathing in?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cWe can do this. It\u2019s bad, yes, sure, but that\u2019s okay. This will be really fun. We can do this.\u201d</p><p>She could. She was a strong person. Right? She could lift heavy things, and she\u2019d cleaned bathrooms and stuff before. Not that she really had to\u2014there was always the housekeeper or cleaning service\u2014but she\u2019d done it. Zillions of people cleaned out garages and stuff, and she would, too. It would be deeply satisfying. Yes. Maybe she\u2019d write a book about that, sure. Learning Life Skills Really, Really Fast.</p><p>Good. There. She was calmer now.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a fluttering of wings, and Parker screamed and ducked. A bird! In the house! A mourning dove, a glorified pigeon. \u201cGet out!\u201d she yelled, causing the bird to panic. It flew back and forth, hitting the walls, thudding sickeningly. \u201cStop!\u201d she yelled. Bugger, it was coming at her! Parker covered her head and twisted and turned down the little path, bumped into a dressmaker\u2019s dummy, the bird fluttering right over her head, that horrible, panicked trilling...gah! It hit her in the head, its feathers hideous, its little talons... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Parker was outside. Hunched over, she dashed to her car, got in and slammed the door, panting wildly. \u201cBugger!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Little Pigeon loved the lady\u2019s hair. It was so cozy there! With a smile, he dug his little claws into her scalp and hunkered down.</p><p>She was still shuddering. Good thing she\u2019d just gone to the bathroom, or she would\u2019ve wet herself.</p><p>As her breathing calmed and the shaking of her limbs quieted, Parker made a mental list. Her eyes burned with tears, but that was stupid. Crying wasn\u2019t going to help. Tomorrow, she\u2019d see about...well, hell. Getting a Dumpster, to start. And some giant rubber gloves, and maybe a hazmat suit.</p> <p>Tonight, however...tonight, she\u2019d be sleeping in the car. She had her comforter packed in the back, along with a few bags of groceries and her suitcase. She\u2019d eat some Wheat Thins and sleep here.</p><p>She cracked the windows. It had turned chilly\u2014of course, they were what, fifty miles from Canada? But the air felt clean and pure, and Parker sucked in great lungfuls, that faint tang of fish nothing compared to the closed-up stuffiness of the house.</p><p>And the stars were brilliant, blazing overhead in a clarity Parker had never seen before. The waves sloshed against the shore, and across the cove, the lights of the town glowed and winked as if welcoming her.</p><p>She\u2019d make this work. She had twenty-three days to make this work.</p><p>But, even though she tried hard to keep such thoughts at bay, she couldn\u2019t help remembering that a month ago, she\u2019d stayed in a suite at the Peninsula Hotel in New York City with her son. Her publisher had taken them to dinner to Nobu to celebrate the release of the last Holy Rollers book, and after that, she and Nicky had gone up to the Top of the Rock, just the two of them, so he could see the view.</p> <p>Tonight, she was sleeping in her car.</p><p>It was almost funny.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>THOUGH HE VISITED the great state of Maine at least six times a year, crossing the Kittery Bridge never failed to make James feel as if someone had hammered a nail in his eye. Ever since he was twelve years old, Maine had been a place to escape from, not Vacationland, as the license plates proclaimed.</p><p>Dresner, his hometown, was not on the agenda. Rarely was, even though\u2014or because\u2014his parents still lived there. The town had grown up around a paper mill that had long moved operations to some third-world country, but the bitter tang of chemicals still hung over Cahill family events.</p><p>Last night, James had stayed at his sister\u2019s, set his phone to go off at five-thirty, since Gideon\u2019s Cove was another two hours away. Whether or not Parker wanted his help\u2014and she didn\u2019t\u2014she was getting it.</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s Cove had been a cute town back then. There\u2019d been a diner, he remembered, and a pretty girl about his own age who waited tables...he\u2019d hung around, hoping she\u2019d notice him, but she\u2019d had a boyfriend, it turned out. Still, he\u2019d managed to lose his virginity with a very, ah, generous woman about a decade older than he was. Chantal. Very nice woman. Just the thought of her had James grinning. Yep. All guys should get started out that way.</p><p>Speaking of women he\u2019d slept with, it occurred to James that he hadn\u2019t called Leah. Not that they had an actual relationship...a hookup now and then, but still.</p><p>James pulled over on the side of the road and took out his phone. One missed call\u2014Parker Welles, the screen said. Cell-phone service was spotty up here, so no surprise there. The surprise was that she called him at all. He listened to the message, frowning. He didn\u2019t know anything about a security system or code. When he\u2019d called his uncle to tell him about his plans, James asked him if he knew the Harrington place. \u201cAyuh,\u201d Dewey had said. \u201cNeeds a little work. I\u2019ll make sure the electric\u2019s on.\u201d Nothing about a security system.</p><p>Well. He\u2019d be there in an hour. He could figure it out then. Besides, making Parker wait had its own appeal. And he did owe Leah a call.</p><p>\u201cHey, Leah, it\u2019s James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there, stranger! How are you doing?\u201d she said, her cheerleader-style exuberance making him hold the phone a little farther away from his ear. She was cute, but best in small doses, which explained why they only saw each other about once a month.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awesome! What\u2019s up? You wanna get together this weekend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, actually, I\u2019m in Maine right now, and I\u2019ll be here for a while. Six or eight weeks. Figured I\u2019d let you know.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cOh,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>It was impressive, how much could be packed into a two-letter word. They must teach it at woman school. \u201cYeah. So, just wanted to say bye and have a nice summer and all.\u201d James pressed his thumb against his eye socket, bracing for the relationship talk.</p><p>\u201cWhat about...you know? Us?\u201d</p><p>Ah, mooseshit. Was there an us? Because he\u2019d seen Leah, a very pretty redhead who liked to play pool and flirt, maybe six or seven times since they\u2019d met at a wedding on New Year\u2019s Eve, and if there was an us, it was pretty anemic. There was him, and there was her, and the two of them intersected at a bar once in a while, which generally led to more intersecting in bed, which had always seemed like enough.</p><p>Until this moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to be in Maine this summer,\u201d James repeated.</p><p>\u201cFor Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. So I figured I\u2019d call, tell you I wouldn\u2019t be around. And after the summer, I really don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be jobwise.\u201d There. Mission accomplished.</p><p>\u201cYou want some company up there? I love Maine!\u201d</p><p>Mission not accomplished. James sighed and closed his eyes. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be busy, Leah. And it\u2019s far. Way up the coast. But it\u2019s been fun hanging out. Good luck with everything.\u201d He winced. He didn\u2019t mean to sound like a dick. They just taught it in guy school.</p><p>There was a lengthy pause, then a sigh. \u201cFine.\u201d Another pause. \u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA town called Gideon\u2019s Cove. Harry\u2019s daughter has some property up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s in jail, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But his daughter needs a little help. Real-estate stuff.\u201d James never liked talking about what he did, just in case what he didn\u2019t do came out. Well, I sit in my office a lot. Shot thirty-nine Nerf baskets in a row one day. I was really stoked.</p><p>Another pause. \u201cWell, try to have fun,\u201d she said, her voice a little brighter. \u201cAnd thanks for calling, James! That was so thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>Atta girl. Leah was sweet. Not tremendously bright, but good-natured and fun. It\u2019d been really easy, hanging out with her. And easy was good so far as he was concerned. \u201cYou take care, Leah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, James. Give me a call when you\u2019re back, if you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Take care,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>There. His condo was sublet for the summer. Leah had been informed. Stella, his secretary, had told James not to worry; she\u2019d been about to quit anyway and become a jujitsu instructor. The guys he played basketball with on Saturday mornings had taken him out for a beer as a farewell. No point in telling Mary Elizabeth about work...she pretty much only cared if he brought her a present.</p><p>His parents could wait.</p><p>So. On to Gideon\u2019s Cove to see Parker. Maybe she\u2019d be glad to see him.</p><p>Right. And the ice-skating in hell was fabulous this time of year. But she was Harry\u2019s daughter, and James owed him more than he could say.</p><p>Six years ago, James had been stuck on the tarmac in L.A., where he\u2019d interviewed for a job\u2014one of 204 prospects, apparently. He\u2019d been out of law school for a year and had yet to get a job offer, and panic was setting in. His father was sixty-two and business was slow; his brothers were just getting by. The law was supposed to have been a sure bet for James, a guaranteed decent salary, and making money had always been the goal.</p><p>At any rate, James had been upgraded to first class\u2014the girl at the desk had liked his \u201csmies,\u201d whatever those were. James was enjoying the extra four inches of legroom when a man sat in the seat next to him, growling about the inconvenience of having to fly commercial. Harry Welles, legend of Wall Street, in the flesh.</p><p>A guy who probably had a whopping-size legal department.</p><p>James introduced himself, made wry comments about the joys of air travel, spent his last hundred bucks on a bottle of champagne\u2014which Harry had declared cheap swill\u2014got the guy to laugh and a few hours later found himself with a job offer. Not a corporate position, though. Harry\u2019s longtime personal attorney had announced his retirement; would James like the job? On retainer for personal and family business, no other clients in case Harry needed him. It would be mostly real-estate dealings, as Harry owned a couple dozen corporate buildings, maybe some trust and estate planning. When Harry had named a salary, it was all James could do not to hump his leg. For that salary, he would\u2019ve done anything. He needed money, a lot of it, and fast.</p><p>So James had become a glorified clerk, turning his attention to getting through loopholes so Harry could build a bigger boathouse, changing the terms of the lease on a commercial building. He set up a trust fund for Harry\u2019s unborn grandchild. Paid off Harry\u2019s occasional mistress. And became, it seemed, Harry\u2019s closest friend.</p><p>It was odd; Harry had colleagues and clients and employees, he had connections, but he didn\u2019t seem to have friends. And though James knew Harry had a daughter, he never talked about her. But from that first day on the airplane onward, Harry seemed to anoint James as the chosen one. He\u2019d summon James to the city, take him out for dinner, tell tales of his early career. Took him to ball games. Slapped him on the back and told him he was doing a great job, even though the work was mindless and dull. One night, when Harry\u2019d had too much to drink and James was seeing him back to his huge apartment in the city, Harry had said, \u201cIf I had a son, I hope he woulda been like you, kid.\u201d</p><p>Strange, given that Harry had only known him a few months. And stranger still that for all the time he\u2019d spent with Harry, he\u2019d never heard him talk about Parker. James knew she existed, of course. But she was never discussed.</p><p>And then, on the eighth day of the sixth month as Harry\u2019s attorney, when James had sunk eighteen Nerf baskets in a row and was in a heated mental debate between roast beef or turkey avocado, his cell phone rang. It was Harry. \u201cJames, my daughter had her baby. Can you swing by the hospital with the paperwork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, congratulations, Harry! Boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Mona! Did my daughter tell you the baby\u2019s name?\u201d There was a pause. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Can you get over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Tell my daughter I\u2019ll get up there when I\u2019ve got some free time. And I\u2019ll see you here in the city next week. Knicks game, don\u2019t forget.\u201d With that, Harry hung up.</p><p>James stared at the phone. Granted, his own parents weren\u2019t perfect, but they wouldn\u2019t miss out on seeing a new grandchild. Parker was Harry\u2019s only child, and this was her first baby, as James knew from the trust-fund paperwork.</p><p>Ten million dollars at birth, another ten at age thirty.</p><p>So much money, it felt fake to a kid from a blue-collar mill town in Maine.</p><p>And so James, then twenty-five years old, had taken the papers to the hospital for Parker\u2019s signature. Uncomfortable about Harry\u2019s apparent lack of interest, he stopped at a toy store and bought a stuffed animal, a large gray rabbit with floppy ears. That\u2019s what people did for babies, after all. He was an uncle, and even though he wasn\u2019t close to his brothers\u2019 kids, he knew enough to send a toy on birthdays and Christmas.</p><p>He got to the hospital, found the maternity floor, went down the hall to room 433, and there was Parker Harrington Welles. She was all alone, holding what looked like a large burrito with a blue cap, and her face was so soft with wonder that James literally stopped in his tracks. Kinda fell in love right then and there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she looked up, and there was no kinda about it.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said quietly, a question in her eyes. Right, because he was a stranger, and she\u2019d just given birth.</p><p>\u201cUh...hi.\u201d His mouth was suddenly dry. \u201cUm...I\u2019m James. James Cahill. I\u2019m your father\u2019s attorney?\u201d And you sound like the village idiot.</p><p>She blinked, and her face went completely blank. She looked back down at her baby, who made a little squeak. \u201cSo you\u2019re the new Thing One.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou replaced Sol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yes. I replaced Sol. Uh, I have some papers. For you to sign. For the baby\u2019s trust fund.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cCongratulations, by the way. Um...cute baby.\u201d Not that he could see anything from the doorway, but that was what you said to women who\u2019d just popped a kid.</p><p>She adjusted the baby\u2019s cap, then looked at James. \u201cI take it my father\u2019s not coming.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cWell, he\u2014he wanted to, but he\u2019s stuck in the city.\u201d</p> <p>Her face didn\u2019t change, but for one second, something flashed across her eyes. Her beautiful eyes. Crap, he was like a twelve-year-old with his first crush. But man, her eyes were beautiful. Blue or green, he couldn\u2019t tell from here. Didn\u2019t matter. She was gorgeous. Long, straight blond hair, perfect mouth. Even in a johnny coat, she was frickin\u2019 glorious.</p><p>Then a guy brushed past him, going instantly to Parker\u2019s side, and reached down to touch the bottom half of the burrito. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d he asked, and Parker smiled up at him. The father of the baby, clearly.</p><p>\u201cStill sleeping,\u201d Parker said. \u201cYour parents were great, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be saying that when they show up four times a day,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think they\u2019re sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they think you walk on water. Thanks for the middle name. That was really...\u201d The guy\u2019s voice choked up, and it was only then that he seemed to notice James, standing there like a lump.</p> <p>Parker nodded at him. \u201cMy father\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p><p>James stepped forward and offered his hand, which the guy shook. \u201cJames Cahill. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Ethan Mirabelli. New dad.\u201d He grinned broadly, clearly delighted with his title.</p><p>\u201cMr. Welles sends his best and says he\u2019ll be up as soon as he can. He\u2019s, um, very sorry he couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d James swallowed. Lying for the boss. Yikes.</p><p>\u201cReally. He said that?\u201d Parker asked coolly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooled. Gave him a knowing look, then touched her baby\u2019s cheek.</p><p>James suddenly remembered the bag in his hand. \u201cOh, here. For the...little one.\u201d He passed it over to the dad, who pulled the rabbit from it and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHey, Nicky, look. It\u2019s a bunny.\u201d The baby slept on, unimpressed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Thing One?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He approached the throne\u2014there was definitely a regal sense about her\u2014and held out the papers. She passed the baby to the guy, Ethan, who immediately kissed the tiny head.</p><p>James cleared his throat. \u201cSign here, and then initial here... .\u201d Her hair smelled so good, all clean and flowery. Don\u2019t go there, idiot, his conscience advised. Right, right, he agreed. Her skin was perfect. Beautiful hands.</p><p>She signed with brisk efficiency and didn\u2019t look at him when she gave the papers back.</p><p>\u201cLucy was wondering if she could come by,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Parker answered. \u201cI already told her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not too tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I feel like a superhero.\u201d She grinned up at the baby\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cYou are a superhero,\u201d he answered, smiling back.</p><p>A nurse came in. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Mom?\u201d she barked.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Parker answered.</p><p>\u201cGood! I need to check those stitches, then I\u2019ll leave you in peace.\u201d</p><p>The dad went over to the chair, murmuring to the burrito.</p><p>James, idiotically, didn\u2019t move. He was having trouble thinking. Those eyes were so...the whole face, so...</p><p>\u201cThing One? I\u2019d rather not have you see my episiotomy,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, of course.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cRight, no. Sorry. Congratulations, you two,\u201d he said and, with that, got out of there. Went home and did a Google search, saw her books. Ordered a bunch. Sent them to Mare. Got a pleasant thank-you note from her about a month later. Thank you for the rabbit you gave Nicky. It was very thoughtful. Best, Parker Welles.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t visit his grandson until the baby was three months old. He asked James to come with him, stayed at Grayhurst for forty-five minutes, then informed Parker that he and James had a business dinner. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to stay a little longer?\u201d James had murmured in the great front hall as they put on their coats. Harry had held the baby for approximately thirty seconds.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s a little intense,\u201d Harry had said tightly. \u201cBaby\u2019s a good-looking boy, though, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d James answered. Thus ended the conversation, and while James was curious, he knew better than to bite the hand that fed not just him, but Mary Elizabeth, as well.</p><p>From that point on, Harry began sending James to family events. Even when Harry did show up, he\u2019d call James and ask him to come, as well. No matter how much James tried to subtly protest, to hint that family was family, Harry was insistent, and so James ended up at quite a few Nicky-related events\u2014christening, birthdays\u2014always on the edges, always uncomfortable.</p><p>Parker would greet him and say goodbye. That was about it. She was civil, though she continued to call him Thing One, and after a while, James adopted a somewhat wry attitude at those dreaded family gatherings. He worked for Harry, the end. But he\u2019d watch Parker, see that she made her kid\u2019s birthday cake herself, clearly adored him, made sure he thanked James for whatever gift he\u2019d brought. She treated Ethan\u2019s family warmly, even though she never did marry the guy. And she worked for a living, writing those books, giving all that money away. Not your typical trust-fund baby.</p><p>And then there was that one time\u2014</p><p>\u201cWatch it, idiot,\u201d he said as a driver with Massachusetts plates blazed by at an easy ninety miles an hour. \u201cAnd you, idiot,\u201d he added to himself, \u201cshould really think about something else. You\u2019re here to help Harry\u2019s daughter flip a house. No more.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a family of chipmunks who found a lovely, clean place to live for the winter. They climbed inside and got all snugly and fell asleep. Then, alas, someone started their home, which was actually the engine of a car, and they were pulverized in their sleep. But they went to animal heaven, so it wasn\u2019t a total wash.</p><p>The Holy Rollers sighed with deep satisfaction. \u201cSave it,\u201d Parker muttered, putting aside the red notebook she always carried in case inspiration struck. Chipmunk puree would probably not sell, no matter how much her publisher wanted a new series. As for herself, she would not be recommending an overnight in a car anytime soon. Not comfy, no, sir. She\u2019d woken at the horrible crack of morning and had been, quite honestly, avoiding going inside the house again. But it was now 7:14 a.m. Couldn\u2019t pretend she was working on a story, couldn\u2019t avoid the day ahead of her.</p><p>She checked her phone; too early in California for Nicky to call her, of course\u2014it was still practically the middle of the night there. Thing One hadn\u2019t bothered calling her back, she noted with irritation. Of course, he\u2019d probably found another job by now, since Harry was in jail.</p><p>The thought that Harry was actually in prison gave her pause. She\u2019d called him twice so far; both times, the conversation had lasted less than three minutes. Harry was as busy in prison as he\u2019d been on Wall Street, it seemed. No time for that pesky daughter of his. He had, she admitted, asked after Nicky. At least there was that.</p><p>At that very minute, her phone chimed, startling her so badly that she dropped it. Harrington, L., the screen said. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hi,\u201d said a horrible voice. \u201cIs this Pahkah?\u201d For a second, Parker thought it was the guy from last night\u2014Malone\u2014but of course, he wouldn\u2019t have her number.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Parker said, running a hand over the back of her head. Her hair was matted.</p><p>\u201cAh you Pahkah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Um, yes. I\u2019m Parker.\u201d Man. That was some accent.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lavinnyer Harintin.\u201d</p><p>Lavinnyer...aha! The caller was her distant cousin! Lavinia Harrington.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Parker said. \u201cRight! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord has it you\u2019re here in town,\u201d Lavinia said.</p><p>\u201cI am. I got in last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...in the car.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia laughed, a dark, horrible sound that ended in a hacking cough. \u201cIs that right? Quite a shit-nest you gawt there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Parker tried to smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty accurate description.\u201d</p><p>There was a sucking sound...Lavinia had to be smoking, and with a voice like that, had been smoking three packs of Camel cigarettes a day since the age of four months. \u201cWelp,\u201d she said, exhaling, \u201cyou wanna meet sometime this week? Seems like we should lay eyes on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d Parker said. Honestly, she had no idea where to start with this house, and Lavinia could probably give her some names and places.</p><p>\u201cWanna come to the diner for breakfast tomorrow?\u201d Lavinia suggested.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Parker said. A real breakfast with eggs and bacon. Beat the two Nutri-Grain bars she\u2019d had an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cKnow where it is? Joe\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI passed it yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Parker got out of the car carefully; if she\u2019d been stiff yesterday, she was practically crippled today.</p><p>Eyeballing the house in front of her, Parker decided it looked even worse than last night, if possible. It had a water view, yes. The cove spread out before her, Douglas Point to the north, the harbor to the south. So that was a plus, the view. The house...eesh.</p><p>Well, nothing to do but face the music. She got her toiletries bag from her suitcase and, pushing through the long grass, went inside. Her bird friend from last night seemed to be gone, thank God. She left the door open just in case.</p><p>Clearly she\u2019d need to rent a Dumpster and buy some seriously sturdy trash bags. Almost everything in here would need to be thrown away. She winced, picturing trash stuffed in her beloved Volvo. But cleaning the house out would show her what she had to work with, at least. Maybe it could be a jewel. She really needed it to be a jewel.</p><p>She went into the bathroom and turned on the faucet. Right. No water. Sighing, she brushed her teeth dry and combed her hair, trying not to touch anything in the bathroom. This would be first on her list of things to scour.</p><p>She turned to leave, figuring she\u2019d put on a clean shirt in the car, rather than inside, when she felt something at her ankle...a tickle.</p><p>She looked down. Nothing there. Just an itch, she decided, from being in this house of crap.</p><p>Nope, there it was again, right under her ankle bone. A mosquito? She shook her foot. Nothing.</p><p>Then, horribly, the tickle moved. Moved up.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she hissed, shaking the leg of her jeans. If that was a cockroach, she\u2019d die.</p><p>The tickle moved up again. Faster this time, toward her knee.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Parker said, flapping her pants. \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>The tickle was now past her knee...and it had a lump. It was a lumpy, warm tickle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNooo!\u201d Parker shrieked, jumping up and down. The lumpy tickle zipped around to the back of her leg, then across her ass and around to the other side, and with that, Parker ripped open her pants and there it was, a mouse in her pants. Its eyes were huge and terrified and Parker heard a scream rip through the air\u2014her scream\u2014and the tiny rodent\u2014rodent!\u2014leaped, practically flying through the air, and landed in the pile in the tub.</p><p>Parker ripped off the jeans, dimly hearing herself shrieking, and ran out of the house, through the grass and right up onto the hood of her car. \u201cBugger! Bugger! Jeesh!\u201d she yelped. Her jeans were clutched in her hand. What if there were more in there? What if a whole family of rodents was in her jeans right now? Once there was a family of mice who loved to snuggle up against the warm flesh of an unwitting human. She whipped the pants against the car, cracking them against the hood again and again and again, shrieking at the remembered feeling of tiny claws. On her leg. Her skin. On her ass!</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker\u201d came a voice. She kept cracking. \u201cParker?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, her breath stuttering in and out of her chest.</p> <p>Thing One. Thing One was here.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, as if she wasn\u2019t murdering her jeans against the hood. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a mouse in my pants.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow and smiled. \u201cLucky mouse.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Wrong thing to say. Wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty traumatic to have a rodent in your pants, Thing One,\u201d she snapped. \u201cUnless you like that sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hey, sorry, princess,\u201d he said, approaching her car. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to make light of your tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a mouse in my pants,\u201d she blurted. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough, okay? I mean, do you see that house? That\u2019s mine! I own it! And I was doing fine, I wasn\u2019t panicking or anything, even when that fricking bird flew into my hair last night but a mouse\u2014 I...I can\u2019t have Nicky here! That place is infested!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he said. \u201cSettle down. You are aware that you\u2019re not wearing pants, right?\u201d Another quirked eyebrow. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him, her throat working. She could murder him and throw his body in the water. Or she could put on her pants. She took a shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019m not...eager to put them back on. In case the mouse had cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here. Let me check.\u201d Thing One took the jeans from her and turned them inside out, then shook them vigorously. Checked the pockets, too. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it. It was there. It ran all the way up this leg, then across my butt, then God knows where it was headed.\u201d His mouth twitched. Did he think this was funny? This was not funny! \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Thing One.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell. It\u2019s gone now.\u201d He looked down. She suspected he was smiling. Idiot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the tub,\u201d she said, giving the jeans a last shake before pulling them on. \u201cYou can go find it. Maybe it\u2019ll crawl up your pants and we can compare notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was your trip up?\u201d he asked, and really, what kind of a question was that when they were sitting in front of a hovel?</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely, Thing One. This house, however, is a sty.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the house for a long moment, then back at her. \u201cWell. Good thing I\u2019m here, then.\u201d</p><p>Right. It suddenly dawned on her that he was here. A familiar face, at least. Something moved in Parker\u2019s chest. She looked away, but no, there was the mouse-infested house. The harbor. Better. Nice view.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>Thing One went into the house, and Parker heard a few clunks and thunks. She sat on the hood of the Volvo, her panic fading gradually into the occasional shudder. A rodent running up her leg...there was a sensation a person wouldn\u2019t forget, right up there with an episiotomy.</p> <p>Her father\u2019s attorney emerged a minute later. Now that she wasn\u2019t screaming, she noticed he looked...different. It took a minute to figure out why.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wearing a suit. First time ever she\u2019d seen him out of\u2014 Well, this was the first time ever she\u2019d seen him in jeans and a T-shirt, that was for sure.</p><p>Parker looked away and cleared her throat. \u201cSo what are you doing here, Thing One?\u201d</p><p>He sat on the hood next to her. \u201cSince I\u2019m devoting the next few weeks to overhauling this dump, Parker, you think you could call me by my real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to have forgotten it.\u201d There. She was getting her old vibe back. Good.</p><p>He smiled slowly, his dark eyes crinkling. Dangerous, those eyes. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it John? Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s James. James Francis Xavier Cahill.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps broke out along her arms. It was chilly. Or something. \u201cSo what are you doing here, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father asked me to come up.\u201d</p><p>Right. James was an obedient pet; she\u2019d give him that. She didn\u2019t say anything for a minute, just pulled her knees to her chin and wrapped her arms around her legs. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d bet her left arm James got more than three minutes on the phone with her father. She sighed. \u201cSo. This place. Did you know how bad it was?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI called my uncle this morning to ask about a security code, and he told me it was kind of a dump. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be this bad, but I can help you out.\u201d</p><p>She really needed the Army Corps of Engineers, from the look of it. \u201cSo law school trained you to overhaul a house, Thing One? I know you\u2019re good at emptying trust funds, but carpentry?\u201d There. Hopefully that would erase the edge he\u2019d gained from having seen her hysterical and in her panties.</p><p>He gave her a look of his own. \u201cNothing I did was illegal, Parker. Your father had the right to do what he wanted with those trust funds, because you gave him that right. You signed papers letting him have full authority over every penny. And even if I\u2019d wanted to say something\u2014which I did\u2014attorney-client privilege prevented me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re a great guy. Maybe my dad will give you a sticker.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cAt any rate, my father was a builder. I worked on a construction crew summers when I was in college. Do you really want to kick me out because you don\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><p>She felt her jaw locking. She\u2019d be an idiot to send him away.</p><p>He took her silence as protest. \u201cLook. Aside from hauling all this crap to the dump, you\u2019ll need to reshingle the entire exterior. The roof needs to be replaced, the gutter\u2019s hanging off the front, the chimney is crumbling. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s dry rot under the linoleum in the kitchen, the cupboards are pulling away from the walls, and the stairs down to the dock are a death trap. The back door frame is warped. You probably need some significant rewiring, not to mention a new paint job inside.\u201d He paused. \u201cI happen to find myself free this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would you stay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? Where here? In the Harbor Suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we can get a lot of this stuff cleared out pretty fast. I already have a Dumpster being delivered today.\u201d</p><p>He did? \u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle lined one up.\u201d</p><p>This summer was supposed to be about doing things on her own, a fresh start. The plan had been to take sheets off aging but lovely furniture and paint the sunroom. The plan was to meet George Clooney before his boat went down in a hundred-foot wave, have a fling, then welcome Nicky for a few weeks of blueberry picking and sailing.</p><p>It was not to have her father\u2019s minion living with her.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t realized what she was up against. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t stay here. What about your uncle\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives in a one-bedroom apartment over the bar. I can get more work done if I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Parker,\u201d he said, his voice low and scraping. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re strangers.\u201d</p><p>She felt the tips of her ears practically burst into flame. Took a calming breath. \u201cFine. Stay. Thank you. You can report to Harry and ease your conscience over helping my father rob my son. I can\u2019t say no, because I\u2019m desperate and broke. But I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how\u2019s this?\u201d he said, his voice amiable. \u201cWe\u2019ll acknowledge that if the situation were different, you\u2019d kick me out. You\u2019ll barely tolerate me, and only because your back is against the wall and you had a mouse in your pants. Deal?\u201d He gave her a smug smile.</p><p>Parker unclenched her jaw and glanced at her watch as she got off the hood of the car. James followed suit. \u201cI\u2019m going to the hardware store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have the bigger bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that a lot.\u201d There was that smile again. Parker ignored it and started the engine. \u201cYou know where the hardware store is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find it,\u201d she ground out, throwing the car into Reverse.</p><p>Not going as planned. No, sir.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>WELL, SHE WASN\u2019T HAPPY. He hadn\u2019t expected her to be. But man oh man alive, this place was a mess. Three hours in, and James had thrown away a good ton of crap. He paused outside to wipe the sweat from his forehead and breathe in some fresh air. The Dumpster had been delivered right after she\u2019d left, thanks to Dewey, who knew everyone. James had put quite a dent in the piles of crap in the house, starting with the bigger bedroom. The princess had slept in her car last night, he guessed, based on the comforter in the front seat. Probably wouldn\u2019t want to do it again.</p><p>A car pulled into the driveway, and a very luscious redheaded woman unfolded herself from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cJamie Cahill! How you\u2019ve grown!\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. \u201cChantal?\u201d Couldn\u2019t be anyone else.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle told me you were back. Don\u2019t you dare say you\u2019ve forgotten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I think of you every night.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and James smiled. Time hadn\u2019t simply been kind to Chantal; it was in love with her. She\u2019d been beautiful at age twenty-five; at fortyish, she was unbelievable. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, God, you\u2019re single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby boy. I\u2019m married\u2014to a much younger man, I might add\u2014and I\u2019m a mommy, even. A little boy named Luke, six months old. I\u2019m nursing.\u201d She raised an eyebrow, inviting James to look. And what was a guy to do but obey? He dropped his eyes to Chantal\u2019s generous endowments, showcased in a very tight and low-cut blouse.</p><p>\u201cLucky kid,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bore you with pictures, but he\u2019s the love of my life. Okay, just one, since you begged.\u201d She held out her phone and showed James a shot of a drooling, fat-cheeked baby. \u201cAnd here\u2019s another one. Isn\u2019t he beautiful? Looks like his daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d James said. All babies tended to look the same to him, but then again, he didn\u2019t spend a lot of time staring into cribs or strollers or whatever.</p><p>\u201cOh, you look good enough to eat!\u201d Chantal exclaimed. \u201cGive us a hug.\u201d She wrapped him in a soft embrace. And hey, she patted his ass, too, making him laugh. Still had quite the effect, Chantal. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, releasing him, \u201cyou called Harbor Realty, and guess what I do on the side? Real estate. It\u2019s your lucky day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn so many ways,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cShow me what you got. In the house, not in your pants,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t remember you fondly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. Harry Welles\u2014you heard of him, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother Wall Street scumbag, from what I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, he bankrupted the family, and all his daughter has left is this house. From her mother\u2019s side of the family. Julia Harrington was her great-aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Millionaire to shack-owner,\u201d she murmured as they walked toward the front door.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. So she needs to flip it as soon as she can.\u201d He opened the door for Chantal, who recoiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass on the inside for now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing crappy insulation, maybe four entire electrical outlets and plenty of wildlife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re psychic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how much money can your client spend on it? If we put on an addition, a master suite with sliders and a deck, a big bathroom with a Jacuzzi, gourmet kitchen, build a big patio into the hillside here, outdoor fireplace...we can get a g*y couple in here faster than you can say, \u2018Bar Harbor is unaffordable.\u2019\u201d Chantal licked her red-painted lips in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cShe has about ten grand,\u201d James said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, shit, then.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThere are back taxes on this place, did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d James said. Crap. If he\u2019d known that, he could\u2019ve paid them off. Why Parker didn\u2019t, he had no idea. Then again, she didn\u2019t even remember that she owned the house.</p><p>Chantal nudged a piece of trash with her foot. \u201cJulia was broke, and no one in Town Hall ever had the heart to go after them while she was alive. Sorry to say, Harry\u2019s daughter will have to pay about fifteen years\u2019 worth of taxes. Guess it slipped through the cracks until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we did a teardown?\u201d James asked.</p><p>Chantal shrugged, pursing her full, red lips. \u201cNah. Waterfront property up here isn\u2019t worth a ton, because who the hell wants to live in Washington County, right? It\u2019s too far from everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d James acknowledged.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this is what we call a postage-stamp lot. You can get two acres of waterfront over on Mutton Chop Bay for next to nothing. Judy Phillips has been trying to sell a parcel for three years now. Not one offer.\u201d Chantal tipped her head and folded her arms under her chest, making her br**sts swell, then glanced at James to make sure he noticed. How could he not? She winked.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your advice, Chantal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, her best bet for a quick sale is to make it pretty. Strip it down, slap on some new flooring, new roof, new shingles, paint the inside. Market it as a tiny jewel of a hideaway. Maybe we can get enough to cover the back taxes and give her a little nest egg besides, little being the operative word here. The place isn\u2019t even winterized. But curb appeal, you hear? Make it adorable. You might get a family or a retired couple looking for a cheap summer home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll shoot for that. Thanks, Chantal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She gave him a sunny smile. \u201cHow\u2019s your family? Dewey says everyone\u2019s doing about as well as can be expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Everyone\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She shaded her eyes and looked him up and down. \u201cYou turned out awfully nice, James Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just as beautiful as I remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw. Give me a kiss. On the cheek, now. I\u2019m extremely faithful to my young stud of a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he get so lucky?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cHe knocked me up. Let me know if I can help, okay? I\u2019ll probably see you at Dewey\u2019s, and you have my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Thanks for coming out, Chantal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, honey,\u201d she said. She got back in her car and backed out of the overgrown driveway. No sign of Parker, who\u2019d been at the hardware store for a couple hours now. Or she\u2019d fled.</p><p>In the truck he\u2019d borrowed from Chuck, one of his basketball buddies\u2014who\u2019d been more than happy to take the Lexus off his hands for the summer\u2014was James\u2019s own stuff. Some tools, left over from his summertime work as a construction worker, not from his father, God knew\u2014Frank Cahill wouldn\u2019t give James a staple, and James wasn\u2019t dumb enough to ask. A few boxes that he\u2019d found in Grayhurst\u2019s attic. He wasn\u2019t sure if Parker had meant to leave them or not, but the Feds hadn\u2019t wanted them.</p><p>And his laptop. The old r\u00e9sum\u00e9 would need brushing up. Unfortunately, there seemed to be more unemployed lawyers in the world than Chinese, and getting a job that paid him what Harry had...not gonna happen.</p><p>Speaking of Harry...James reached into the cab of the truck and pulled out his cell phone. A few minutes later, he had Harry on the line.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, boss?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, James, me boy,\u201d Harry said. His jocular tone told James that someone else was nearby, so Harry would be keeping up appearances. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp in Maine. About four hours away from you, give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you going up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Harry.\u201d Playing along with Harry\u2019s mood\u2014because it was one of his few talents\u2014James added, \u201cYou\u2019ve paid me enough to go to the Black Hole of Calcutta for the summer, let alone the coast of Maine.\u201d</p><p>Harry burst out laughing. \u201cTrue enough, true enough.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get in touch with some of my former associates about a job for you, kid.\u201d</p><p>Whatever James had done to earn Harry\u2019s affection, he didn\u2019t know. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you know if something turns up. How\u2019s my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d James paused. \u201cThe house isn\u2019t worth much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And it\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>Another lengthy pause. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d Harry asked. There was some noise over the PA about visiting hours.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll fix it up as best we can, try to sell it.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou doing okay, boss?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence from the other end. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Harry said in a low voice. \u201cI have a lot of time on my hands. Not much to do. Plenty of time to consider my sins, right?\u201d He gave a halfhearted chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d James said. \u201cDid you get the books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Shogun and Moby-Dick, huh? Trying to educate me? Afraid I\u2019ll join a gang while I\u2019m in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I also figured you could use them as weapons if a riot broke out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking. All right, I should go. I have a meeting. Take care of yourself, son. Talk soon.\u201d With that, he hung up, sounding much like the corporate wheeler and dealer he\u2019d been.</p><p>A meeting. That was good. One good thing about prison\u2014Harry would have to sober up.</p><p>Well. Back to work. Parker\u2019s room was almost clear.</p><p>He had to admit, it was more satisfying than Nerf basketball.</p><p>\u201cOKAY, FOR MOLD KILLING, this here\u2019s what you want, little lady,\u201d said Ben, one of the three senior-citizen gentlemen who\u2019d pounced the second she\u2019d walked into the tiny hardware store.</p><p>\u201cMold killer. Got it. Thank you so much, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my Lord, it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d Rolly said. \u201cPretty ladies who don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about home repair...it\u2019s what we live for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are angels.\u201d</p><p>I resent that, said Spike. A totally overused word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet, dahlin\u2019,\u201d said Stuart. \u201cIt\u2019s our pleasure. You ever painted a room before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d she admitted, and the men charged the paint-chip wall.</p><p>Almost three hours after she entered the hardware store, Parker left, the three guys carrying her packages to the Volvo. \u201cOh, Rhode Island,\u201d said Ben, glancing at her plates. \u201cI went to Providence College.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wonderful school,\u201d Parker said, making him blush.</p><p>\u201cYou need any more advice, we\u2019ll be happy to help,\u201d Stuart said.</p><p>\u201cI absolutely will, and thanks a million, boys. Really.\u201d</p><p>She realized she was smiling as she started the car. The guys had advised on mousetraps\u2014the thought made her cringe, regardless of this morning\u2019s little incident, which she\u2019d relayed to her new pals to their howling delight. They\u2019d shown her what she\u2019d need: sponges, brooms, mops, bleach and lots of it, Murphy\u2019s wood oil, razor-blade scrapers, gallons of Windex, six pairs of thick rubber gloves, two pairs of work gloves, megasize trash bags. Not only that, but the boys had a box of doughnuts from Joe\u2019s Diner\u2014no Starbucks up here, that was for sure\u2014and they\u2019d made her eat two, bless their hearts.</p><p>Parker had never been in a hardware store before. Nope. It was her new favorite place, though\u2014all those mysterious thingies, the pleasant smell of metal and wood smoke from the stove in the middle of the store. All those solutions for her troubles.</p><p>Glancing at her watch, she saw that, at last, it was late enough to call Nicky. She pulled over to the side of the road. Cell service, thank heavens.</p><p>\u201cMommy! Guess what? I love sourdough bread! I hated it yesterday, and now I love it! You have to smear it with jelly. That\u2019s when it gets good. Guess what else? We\u2019re going to the Golden Bridge today! And some gardens...Lucy\u2019s making me go but I want to see the jail! It\u2019s on an island and me and Daddy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy and I are gonna go to jail like Grandpa, but I\u2019m gonna break out! And I\u2019m gonna bring Elephant, and he\u2019s gonna break out, too. And guess what? I\u2019m gonna jump in the water and swim all the way to Maine, Mommy! We\u2019ll take you out for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Man, her boy was the best kid ever. Parker felt a bit as if she\u2019d swallowed the sun, so warm and bright his chirpy little voice made her feel. \u201cWell, don\u2019t swim yet. The house isn\u2019t quite ready, and you have to go see the giant trees and rocks, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I miss you.\u201d</p><p>The vise that had gripped her heart since Nicky left tightened a notch. \u201cI miss you, too, sweetheart.\u201d I miss you so much I cried in the car last night. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to get here. It\u2019s so pretty. I can see lobster boats from the house.\u201d Well, she could if the windows weren\u2019t boarded up. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a really cute diner where we can go out to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have sourdough bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going there tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know there are earthquakes in Fran Francisco?\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>Parker smiled again. \u201cI did, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna lay on the floor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and see if I can hear one. Here\u2019s Lucy! Bye! I love you! I got you a present! It\u2019s a necklace and it\u2019s a rainbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, baby. I love you! I\u2019ll call you later,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>There was a smile in Lucy\u2019s voice. \u201cHe\u2019s on the floor. Every time a bus goes past the hotel, he tells us to get in a doorway. Go brush your teeth, okay, pal?\u201d she said to Nicky. \u201cSo how are you, Parker? What\u2019s it like up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s pretty. It\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the house like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, um, it\u2019s right on the water. It\u2019s pretty small, very cute. It needs some work. But it\u2019ll be great.\u201d No need to worry her two best pals on their vacation. She\u2019d save the stories for later, when the horror wasn\u2019t so fresh.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the real-estate market up there?\u201d Lucy asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t checked yet. It\u2019s on my list.\u201d Right after I kill Snuggles the Mouse, of course. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd how about that summer romance?\u201d Lucy asked. \u201cYou up for that?\u201d</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cWell, I happened to meet a very attractive lobsterman yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir! That\u2019s great! Do I smell a fling?\u201d</p><p>They chatted a few minutes more; Lucy said Ethan was in the shower, so he\u2019d call her later. And even though Parker knew she\u2019d be talking to her son again that day, she couldn\u2019t help feeling a little lonely as she hung up. The three of them in San Francisco, her alone in Maine. Such were the perils of joint custody.</p> <p>Well. She wasn\u2019t completely alone. She had Thing One, heaven help her. That was going to be...difficult. It wasn\u2019t so much that he worked for her father, or even that he hadn\u2019t warned her about the trust-fund issues, because yes, Parker could see that legally, he was stuck.</p><p>It was that\u2014Go ahead, this is good, advised Spike\u2014even after all these years of her father\u2019s neglect and vague disapproval, she would\u2019ve given a lot to have one-tenth of the affection Harry Welles offered so freely to James. Maybe James was the son he\u2019d always wanted. Maybe James reminded Harry of his younger self. But just once, it would\u2019ve been nice if her father had called her up and asked her to come for dinner or play a game of squash or go to one of his single-malt nights.</p><p>Stupid, that even after all these years, she still wanted her dad. Not the man Harry had become, but the man he\u2019d once been, who\u2019d pushed her on a swing and let her sit in his chair at Welles Financial and answer his phone.</p><p>Well. That guy had taken a bullet to the heart when she was ten years old.</p><p>\u201cOld news, my friends,\u201d Parker said. She started the car and glanced across the street. Gideon\u2019s Cove Animal Shelter, the sign said. And quite unexpectedly, she found herself turning into the driveway. There was a gray-shingled house and a small outbuilding from which the sound of barking could be heard.</p> <p>\u201cHello there!\u201d called a young woman as Parker got out of the car. She came over, wiping her hands on her jeans. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d She glanced at Parker\u2019s Rhode Island plates. \u201cYou must be Julia Harrington\u2019s niece. Hi, I\u2019m Beth Seymour. Sorry. Small towns. We know everyone\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker Welles. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looking for a pet?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just stopped. I\u2019ve never had a pet before.\u201d Except Apollo, if you could count that thing. She wondered briefly what had happened to it. Harry probably gave it to a minion. Or ate it.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, since you\u2019re here,\u201d Beth said. Crafty woman. Parker followed. She was not going to get a dog. Or a cat\u2014Lucy had a cat, and it was always leaping onto Parker\u2019s lap and sniffing her lips, which Parker found quite repulsive. Why she was even standing here was a mystery.</p><p>\u201cPets take a lot of work. I won\u2019t lie,\u201d Beth said, opening the door of the outbuilding. \u201cBut the love they give you...it\u2019s worth any price.\u201d</p> <p>Nice sale line. \u201cSo what have you got here? Not that I\u2019m really looking.\u201d You could be! sang the Holy Rollers. Pets can fill those giant voids in people\u2019s lives!</p><p>\u201cWell, we try to be a no-kill shelter,\u201d Beth said, \u201cbut times are kind of hard, and donations have been down. We have a lot of animals, sad to say, and we\u2019re running out of room. The vet\u2019s coming to put a couple to sleep today, actually.\u201d</p><p>Shee-it. Parker could picture a chunk of resolve crumbling like sand. \u201cThat\u2019s really sad.\u201d</p><p>At the sight of their caregiver, several dogs leaped to their feet, barking joyfully. Or savagely. Parker couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cThis girl\u2019s going on to her great reward today.\u201d Beth stopped in front of the first enclosure and pointed to an orange tabby cat. To Parker\u2019s eyes, it already looked dead, its filmy eyes half-open, fur dull and uneven. \u201cShe\u2019s twenty-one, can you believe it? Her owner died two weeks ago. At least they\u2019ll be in heaven together.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true, the Holy Rollers confirmed.</p><p>\u201cThis girl is the other one we have to let go.\u201d Beth knelt down in front of the next kennel. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, honey,\u201d she crooned. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><p>Parker looked in. A brown-and-white dog sat in the corner, as far away from the door of her cage as she could get, trembling. Parker couldn\u2019t see her face, but her fur was long and feathery.</p><p>\u201cYou think she knows?\u201d Parker asked, shoving her hands in her pockets. \u201cShe looks scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s always like this. Bob Castellano\u2014have you met him yet? No? Well, he was behind someone out on Route 119, and they pushed the dog right out the window. Didn\u2019t even stop! Can you believe that? She had a broken leg and two broken ribs, not to mention a bunch of cuts and bruises. She\u2019s all mended now, but no one wants her. She\u2019s too shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you can\u2019t blame her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s been with us four months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink she\u2019d bite? Since she\u2019s so scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even heard her growl. She\u2019s too afraid.\u201d Beth stood up and sighed. \u201cSo. She\u2019ll be put down later on, too, poor thing. But down here, we have kittens. Christy and Will Jones are taking two of them, but there are two left. And we have this very cute little pit-bull mutt\u2014he\u2019s an absolute sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Parker didn\u2019t move. Thrown out of a moving car, huh? Unbelievable. Well, it was one of a thousand horror stories, she was sure. She couldn\u2019t afford a pet, no matter how sad its life had been thus far. And she didn\u2019t know anything about dogs. She liked them, often stopped to admire one here and there, but she didn\u2019t know how to train one or take care of it.</p><p>Even if she wanted to have a dog, she had nowhere to put the thing. Parker wasn\u2019t sure where she herself would be sleeping tonight. Most likely, the car once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d she said.</p><p>Fifty bucks later\u2014really, not so much\u2014with another fifty in dog supplies\u2014collar, leash, shampoo, food, heartworm pills, brush\u2014Parker went slowly into the dog\u2019s cage. The poor thing bowed her head and looked away as if certain Parker was about to kick her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Parker said, squatting down. \u201cWant to come home with me?\u201d The dog didn\u2019t move, but she didn\u2019t flinch, either, when Parker reached out and petted her neck, working her way up to the dog\u2019s cheeks, which were as soft and plush as velvet. The dog didn\u2019t resist, but didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, sweetie,\u201d Parker murmured. Slowly, as if picking up Nicky while he was asleep, she lifted the dog into her arms. No resistance.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she found her forever family,\u201d Beth said.</p><p>The Holy Rollers sighed in deep satisfaction. Spike even wiped away a tear.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you name her?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>Parker looked down at her new best friend. Not the most attractive dog, with her drooping ears and sorrowful face. She had a bald spot behind one ear, and one of her eyes didn\u2019t open quite as much as the other. Her head seemed too big for her body. Parker looked at Beth and smiled. \u201cBeauty.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>JAMES WAS FILTHY and exhausted by the time Parker finally found her way back to the house. He watched as she got out of the car, then turned and lifted something out. It was a dog, some kind of spaniel mutt, maybe twenty pounds, curled into her arms. She set the animal on the ground and clipped on a leash.</p><p>\u201cAw. We have a dog now?\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cI have a dog now,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThing One, meet Beauty. Beauty, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Beauty,\u201d James said. The dog tucked her head behind Parker\u2019s knee and peed, not even bothering to crouch, trembling, unable to even look at him.</p><p>Parker tilted her head and gave James a smile. \u201cYou have that effect on women, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He returned her smile. \u201cNot all women.\u201d</p><p>Her ears started doing that sunrise thing, getting all pink, then red. Then she popped the trunk and lifted out a bag. \u201cI bought out the hardware store. Think you could grab a few things so we could get to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We, huh? She walked past him, her dog scuttling along, half-crouched, as if James was about to karate-chop her on the head. Parker, on the other hand, looked pretty damn good in those jeans, all long legs and perfect ass. And how was it that she smelled good...well, okay, sure, she smelled like dog, but also a little bit like...whatever it was she smelled like. Lemons or something. Flowers. Who knew? She smelled good, dog or no dog.</p><p>Just before she got in, her cell phone rang. \u201cHey, Ethan!\u201d she said, her face lighting up. \u201cNo, I talked to them a little while ago. How are you? You did? Cool! Hang on a sec, the cell-phone service out here is horrible. Let me go down to the dock. Yes, there\u2019s a dock, and no, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re picturing.\u201d</p><p>She set her bag down and went around to the front of the house, the dog slinking beside her through the long grass.</p><p>And here was the thing. It irritated him. First of all, he\u2019d spent the past few hours shoveling garbage on her behalf, and like some little kid who\u2019d gotten an A on his paper, he wanted to show her. Think you could grow a pair, guy? his conscience asked. Secondly, message received. The Paragon calls, the minion can wait. Not that Ethan Mirabelli was a bad guy, based on James\u2019s interactions with him over the years...friendly, successful, great father. That was the problem.</p><p>And third...she was down on the dock, and he hadn\u2019t checked that out yet, and who knew if it was sturdy? What if she fell in? She was standing on it, and it hadn\u2019t sunk, but he\u2019d been too busy getting the water turned back on and clearing out her room to get to it.</p><p>She was laughing now. She sat on the dock cross-legged, looking every bit the upper-crust, beautiful, graceful woman she was. Oh, a little hair toss. Too bad the Paragon wasn\u2019t able to see it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d James told himself. He went back inside\u2014plenty more crap to shovel\u2014and got to work.</p><p>But he checked on her every thirty seconds or so, just to make sure she hadn\u2019t fallen in.</p><p>WHEN SHE HUNG UP with Ethan, Parker felt considerably cheered. The fact that he\u2019d called made her feel less out of the loop. One thing to check in with your kid a couple times a day, another to have Ethan call her just to say hi. Maybe Lucy had told him she\u2019d sounded lonely\u2014and she\u2019d tried not to, honest\u2014or maybe, and more likely, Eth was a prince.</p><p>For about five minutes last summer, when Lucy had decided that she should marry some guy who wasn\u2019t related to her dead husband, Ethan and Parker had thought about trying to be more than friends and parents of the same kid. After all, they laughed at the same jokes. They were both attractive. Once upon a time, they\u2019d gotten it on with satisfactory physical results and a beautiful child. They were both single. Why not, right?</p><p>But whatever chemistry had once been between them had faded, and one kiss was enough to make them each rub their mouths with the backs of their hands. \u201cYou gave me cooties,\u201d Ethan had said, and they\u2019d ended up baking brownies and playing Scrabble.</p><p>It was too bad, in a way, because Ethan was pretty damn perfect. If he could clone himself and excise the part that had loved Lucy since he was nineteen years old, she was pretty sure he could be the One.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Beauty?\u201d Parker asked. The dog had followed her without protest, James being the more obvious threat, but she wouldn\u2019t make eye contact. Slowly, Parker put her hand out and stroked the dog\u2019s cheek with one finger. So soft. \u201cGood girl,\u201d Parker said. \u201cGood girl, Beauty.\u201d The dog sidled closer to her, and a strange, sweet feeling filled Parker\u2019s chest. She\u2019d like to find the person who\u2019d thrown her dog out of a moving vehicle and kick him in the nuts. Wearing her sharpest Jimmy Choo heels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parker looked up at the house and sighed. Time to get to work. There was Thing One, looking at her from the window\u2014 Hey! He\u2019d taken the boards off the windows! Fantastic.</p><p>\u201cCome on, girl,\u201d she said to Beauty, standing up and heading up the short flight of stairs. The back of the house was barricaded by more junk\u2014a table, boxes, a couple of plastic chairs, a tire\u2014so she went around the front, the dog walking so close to her legs that Parker almost tripped.</p><p>She went inside and lurched to a halt.</p><p>\u201cHoly halos, Thing One,\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>The hallway that yesterday she\u2019d had to sidle down was completely empty. Wood floor. Grimy walls, a hole near the ceiling, but the entire hallway was cleared. She went down to the kitchen. \u201cMy God! You did all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou... Wow. This is amazing.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen was much improved. There were still plastic boxes of who-knew-what, but the trash and cardboard and newspapers were gone. And it smelled much better, thanks to the salt air blowing through the windows.</p><p>She glanced out the window at the Dumpster that now graced the side of the house. It was already about a quarter full. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of crap,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI kept some things I thought you might want. Over there on the table.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over, then did a double take at the glass case on the floor by the wall. \u201cIs that Apollo?\u201d</p><p>James shrugged. \u201cThink of him as mouse control. I already gave him one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he eats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t keep him in the kitchen. He gives me the willies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Majesty. He can stay in my room.\u201d</p><p>Whoops. She did sound a little imperial there. \u201cThat would be great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d James said. \u201cThe fridge works, but it needs to be scoured. It\u2019s not the most efficient thing in the world, but it\u2019ll keep things cold. The oven is shot and I think your mouse and all his friends live in there, so we should ditch it. My uncle knows a used one you can buy pretty cheap. The cupboards are bolted on, so if we tear them off, it\u2019ll rip out chunks of the walls. The best bet is probably to clean and paint them. You\u2019ll need a new subfloor and linoleum or tile in here, but the floors in the rest of the house are wood. Clean them up, slap on some polyurethane and you have character. New roof, new shingles, cut down some of the scrub around the house, fix the stairs to the dock and the real-estate agent says you might be able to pay off the back taxes and get a little besides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack taxes? And how much is a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the offer you get.\u201d</p><p>Crikey. She didn\u2019t really want to hear the actual figure. \u201cThink I\u2019ll have enough left over to buy a house in Rhode Island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>A strand of panic laced through her. Parker took a deep breath. And another. Looked at Apollo, who stared back impassively.</p> <p>You can only do what you can do, the Holy Rollers chimed. True enough.</p><p>She looked around the kitchen, which still had yards and yards of crap in it, then back at Thing One, who was looking at her, arms folded, face unreadable.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James,\u201d she said.</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were dark, dark brown. Best not to look for too long. She cleared her throat. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get to work on my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>She went down the hall, opened the door and got another shock.</p><p>The room was completely empty. All that stuff...the clothes and boxes and lamps and macram\u00e9 and Christmas ornaments...was gone. The room was bigger than it had appeared when crammed with junk; the windows were open and somewhat battered screens were in the windows. It smelled clean. It was clean.</p><p>\u201cYour bed is being delivered later on.\u201d His voice made her jump. He\u2019d followed her down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat bed?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI figured you were too much of a princess to sleep on the floor, so I ordered you a bed. Nothing special. Just a frame and a box spring and mattress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames...\u201d Her cheeks burned, and she swallowed.</p><p>He smiled. Oh, that was dangerous.</p><p>Parker did not find Thing One particularly appealing, though she could recognize that he was attractive. He just didn\u2019t do anything for her. No, those sulky good looks and arrogant bone structure...yawn. He looked like a Gucci model or a bored playboy. Not her type. Not at all.</p><p>Until he smiled. He had a wide, generous smile, almost too wide if there was such a thing, and his eyes crinkled far more than a young man\u2019s should, and heck yeah, she felt it in Lady Land, uh-huh.</p><p>And given that they were apparently stuck together for the summer\u2014and as James Cahill was the last guy she\u2019d slept with\u2014this was a very dangerous thing indeed.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>TWO YEARS AGO, the thought of sleeping with Thing One had never crossed Parker\u2019s mind.</p><p>Really.</p><p>Since the day she\u2019d met him, Thing One had bugged her. Intellectually, she knew that it wasn\u2019t his fault that Harry had sent him to the hospital the day Nicky was born. Just doing what the boss said, following orders, covering for Harry\u2019s complete and utter lack of interest. Whatever the case, roughly five hours after she\u2019d given birth, a stranger had been standing in her hospital room. Not her father.</p><p>She knew that Harry had viewed her decision to A) have Nicky and B) not marry Ethan as a personal slap in the face, but Parker had honestly thought that once he saw his first\u2014possibly only\u2014grandchild, he\u2019d thaw. He\u2019d never viewed her books as much of an accomplishment\u2014well, she couldn\u2019t fault him on that. But a baby, come on. Surely he\u2019d be thrilled to meet his grandchild.</p><p>But no. He\u2019d sent a stranger. The fact that the lawyer had thought to buy a stuffed animal only reinforced the fact that Harry had sent nothing but legal documents. No flowers\u2014apparently one didn\u2019t reward one\u2019s wayward daughter for having a bastard child\u2014and nothing for her beautiful, perfect, miraculous baby other than Nicky\u2019s cut of the family trust. Thing One\u2019s presence announced\u2014shouted\u2014the fact that her child wasn\u2019t important enough for Harry to leave work...Harry, who once stopped a meeting with the head of Goldman Sachs because his nine-year-old daughter had come to his office to tell him she won the school spelling bee.</p><p>And then Thing One had kept on showing up, sent by Harry or accompanying Harry, and while Parker knew that it was at her father\u2019s behest, it still drove her crazy. Obviously, Harry couldn\u2019t bear to be around her, even with Nicky there. Thing One was at Nicky\u2019s baptism, his first birthday, his second birthday. If Harry summoned the rest of the family to a party, which he did once a year\u2014the better to rub their noses in his superior wealth\u2014Thing One would be there, too.</p><p>That first day in the hospital, she\u2019d almost felt sorry for him\u2014he was so awkward and uncomfortable. But then he tried to cover for Harry, lying about how her father was so sorry he couldn\u2019t come\u2014as if Harry had ever apologized for anything. It made it worse, knowing that a stranger knew how low she was on her father\u2019s list of priorities. And then, Thing One turned rather glib, a Harry Junior, almost, and that line, Parker, always lovely to see you, was so sarcastic. She knew she was nothing but another duty given to him by Harry.</p><p>Before long, Harry was calling Thing One \u201cson\u201d and inviting him to those pretentious wine-tasting dinners with his cronies or taking him out on Granddad\u2019s wooden sailboat. Mostly, though, Parker was more irritated with herself than with Harry. He hadn\u2019t sought out her company for years; why would he now? Her father had missed her graduation from Miss Porter\u2019s, though he did make it to her graduation from Harvard and spent the time schmoozing senators and Kennedys. He never came to her book signings. Even when she signed at Barnes &amp; Noble in New York City and there was a line out the door, he didn\u2019t show up.</p><p>On the occasions that Harry did interact with her son, Parker had to admit, he wasn\u2019t bad. He\u2019d ask Nicky questions about what he wanted to be when he grew up\u2014standard awkward adult fare\u2014as compared with Gianni Mirabelli, who\u2019d get down on his arthritic knees and pretend to be a horse or teach her son how to make the perfect meatball. But once, Parker came upon Harry and Nicky in the study, coloring, and a warm, hopeful feeling had rushed through her so fast, though what exactly she hoped for wasn\u2019t clear.</p><p>A month later, she invited her father to come to Nicky\u2019s graduation from swimming class; her boy had won the Eel Award for fastest swimmer. Wonder of wonders, Harry\u2019s assistant called back to say yes, Mr. Welles would come, and Parker really thought maybe a new era was about to start, now that Nicky was old enough to warrant her father\u2019s interest.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t show. But there was Thing One, expensive suit, calfskin briefcase, as if Nicky wouldn\u2019t notice the difference.</p><p>Sleeping with Thing One? Please. It never even crossed her mind.</p><p>Until her cousin Esme\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Harry had two older sisters, Louise and Vivian. They, in turn, had three daughters, Esme, Juliet and Regan. When Parker was young, the four cousins would play together during the summers at Grayhurst, unaware of the tension between the adults.</p><p>But then her parents divorced, and Althea took Parker to Colorado, only to send her back East for boarding school in Connecticut. During term breaks, Parker would sometimes stay with one of her aunts, who lived on the same street in giant homes that weren\u2019t big enough for them, and listen to them complain about her father.</p><p>Harry was a legend on Wall Street. The Welles fortune, founded first on shipping, then on mills, had dwindled significantly in the 1960s as manufacturing went overseas. By the time Harry was a teenager, there was a little money, but they were hardly the Kennedys or the Hiltons. Enough for membership in the country club and college for Harry and his sisters, a very modest trust fund to get each one started as adults.</p><p>Then Harry decided to swing for the bleachers. He took his trust fund, asked his sisters if they wanted in\u2014they declined; Harry was just out of Wharton and what did he know? Harry sold his car, schmoozed every client his father had, hit up every friend for a loan and stepped up to bat. He took every cent he\u2019d managed to get his hands on and bought up stock from a little company that dealt with a technology no one had ever heard of.</p><p>Turned out Apple Computer did okay. Harry was featured on the cover of Forbes magazine, a baseball bat over one shoulder, a cocky grin on his handsome face and the headline Play Big or Go Home. Welles Financial, founded by Parker\u2019s great-grandfather, went from a stodgy, trustworthy investment firm to an enormous force on Wall Street, and Harry became filthy rich.</p><p>His sisters had their modest inheritances; beyond that, if they wanted more\u2014and they did\u2014they had to come to Harry and present their request, be it jobs for their husbands or the money for an addition to keep up with the Joneses. Harry might or might not grant said request; his sisters hadn\u2019t trusted him back in the beginning, and he made them pay, and they hated him for it. Didn\u2019t stop them from asking, though.</p><p>And so Parker was an outsider, too, by association. Her cousins became an impenetrable clique, her aunts joined forces to disapprove of her, and Parker found herself thinking of them as the Coven. When she had to come to stay, Juliet, Regan and Esme made sure she was left out of the conversation, took potshots at Althea and her marriages, mocked Parker\u2019s hair, clothes, shoes. Her aunts weren\u2019t much better. Once, she overheard them discussing Althea\u2019s latest divorce from Parker\u2019s second stepfather, who was a lovely man; Parker had been devastated when he\u2019d left. \u201cWho\u2019d want Althea and a sulky teenager?\u201d Louise asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cSulky\u2019s the least of her problems,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cJuliet thinks she might be doing drugs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Louise answered. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably end up overdosing in a nightclub bathroom somewhere.\u201d There was a pause and the clink of ice as Louise took a sip of her Long Island iced tea.</p><p>Parker became even more of a freak by getting pregnant out of wedlock\u2014and staying pregnant\u2014and choosing to be a single mom. The books put her over the edge.</p><p>Family gatherings...eesh. Parker once described them to Ethan as Flowers in the Attic meets Jaws. Generally, she avoided them like a robust case of Ebola, but once a year or so, she had to make an appearance, and Esme\u2019s wedding was one such affair.</p><p>Parker was a bridesmaid, pretty much because Harry was paying for the wedding, an obscene affair at the Rosecliff mansion in Newport. Esme and Aunt Vivian had wheedled and whined to Harry for weeks before he finally played Santa and said of course he\u2019d pay for his niece\u2019s wedding. Apparently, Esme had been yearning to get married at Rosecliff since her conception, and she\u2019d gleefully spent Harry\u2019s money hand over fist: flowers and hairstylists, a twenty-thousand-dollar dress, yada yada yada.</p> <p>None of that made Parker welcome. She\u2019d spent the rehearsal dinner largely being ignored and pretending not to mind. She hadn\u2019t been invited to help Esme get ready the morning of the wedding, either. Nicky was with Ethan, so Parker had gone to Rosecliff alone. She figured she\u2019d do her bridesmaid duties, endure the reception, then leave as soon as she could.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chuck,\u201d she said to the driver of the car service her father kept on retainer. \u201cI\u2019ll be maybe three hours, okay? I\u2019ll text you when I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, Miss Welles,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to be my date?\u201d she said, tipping him a twenty.</p><p>\u201cVery. No offense.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cI hear you, pal. See you later.\u201d Heart sinking a little, she got out of the car. \u201cI am a wonderful mother,\u201d she said as she approached the mansion. \u201cI am a very successful author.\u201d Preach it, sister! the Holy Rollers chorused. \u201cAnd no one can make you feel inferior if you\u2019ve had enough to drink. Or something.\u201d</p><p>Without your consent! the angels corrected in their tiny, scolding voices.</p><p>Inside was the Coven\u2014Esme, the bride, and Juliet and Regan as co\u2013maids of honor\u2014huddled together in a preceremony clump. Her aunts made disapproving noises about Parker\u2019s timing, though she\u2019d arrived ten minutes before they\u2019d told her to.</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted,\u201d Aunt Vivian said, frowning. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d Parker said. \u201cEsme, you look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Um...so do you?\u201d the bride said, staring at Parker as if she had a third arm.</p> <p>Parker smiled determinedly, took her bouquet and walked down the aisle, her eyes searching for her father. One thing they had in common\u2014they hated family events. She didn\u2019t see him, but then again, there were four hundred wedding guests.</p><p>In the receiving line, Juliet took her shots. \u201cParker, did you bring your husband? Wait, are you married? I always forget.\u201d As if they hadn\u2019t seen each other the night before.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how old is your son again? It is a boy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky\u2019s three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone these days? It must be hard, because who wants a single mom?\u201d</p><p>Finally, the reception began in earnest. Parker glanced around for a safe haven, hoping to see a friendly face somewhere. One of her uncles\u2014Louise\u2019s husband\u2014had always been nice, but the last time she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d hugged her a little too long, his hand a little too low on her back.</p><p>Still no Harry. He wouldn\u2019t miss a family wedding\u2014or the chance to remind people who paid for it\u2014and last she knew, he was coming. For a second, she indulged in the fantasy that she and her father were close. That they\u2019d sit together today, that he\u2019d dance with her and tell her she was the prettiest girl in the room. He\u2019d come to Grayhurst after the wedding and play Candy Land with Nicky, read him books until her son fell asleep. Then she and her dad would watch something manly on TV, because Harry loved war movies. Saving Private Ryan. She\u2019d make popcorn.</p> <p>Right.</p><p>She should\u2019ve brought a date. Ethan would\u2019ve come, and Lucy would\u2019ve loved to have babysat. She could\u2019ve hired an escort, like in that movie she\u2019d fallen asleep on a few weeks ago. But needing armor and actually admitting you needed armor were different things.</p><p>A drink, however, was definitely in order.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said to the bartender, smiling. \u201cI would like a very strong martini with three olives and a smidge of brine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelvedere okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow about Stoli Elit? Got any of that?\u201d she said. It was her father\u2019s favorite.</p><p>\u201cYou have good taste,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGot that right, buddy,\u201d she answered, grinning. She gave him a fifty as a tip, knowing half her relatives would fail to tip him at all. Rich people. Sucky tippers.</p><p>The martini went down as it should, icy cold and so smooth she barely noticed.</p><p>\u201cParker! What are you doing, just standing there?\u201d It was dear Cousin Regan, dragging her fianc\u00e9 behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it all in,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met Rob, my fianc\u00e9, have you?\u201d Regan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe met last night,\u201d Parker said, nodding at him, the poor guy. \u201cHello again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, like, our wedding?\u201d Regan said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking Manhattan? Like...the Pierre? Right, Rob?\u201d</p><p>Parker nodded, feigning interest. This would be Regan\u2019s third engagement, and if it followed suit, it should be over in, oh, about an hour. Regan enjoyed upstaging other people\u2019s weddings.</p><p>\u201cAnd how are your little books doing?\u201d her cousin asked, nudging Rob with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing great. The last one came out at number five on the Times list,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cRob, Parker writes those strange little books about the angels,\u201d Regan said in mock explanation. \u201cThey\u2019re very...um...precious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo glad you like them,\u201d Parker said. \u201cExcuse me for one second.\u201d No point in hanging around Regan, who\u2019d recently posted a vicious review of The Holy Rollers and the Blind Little Bunny on Amazon. She\u2019d forgotten to use a screen name, however. Or maybe she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Regan\u2019s whisper, loud enough to ensure she was heard, followed Parker. \u201cThose books? They, like, make you want to hurl. And her mother? On her fourth rich old man. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>The thing was, Regan couldn\u2019t say anything about her books that Parker didn\u2019t already think herself. The books were a joke, it was true. That they were bringing Save the Children some serious money didn\u2019t matter to the Coven.</p><p>As for Althea, well, it was also true.</p><p>\u201cHow about another one of these?\u201d she said to the nice bartender.</p><p>She sidled through the crowd, saying hello here and there, making her way out of the throng. She had to stay; if she left, it would be an admission of defeat. But hey. She could have a quiet moment. The thing about having a three-year-old...the only time he didn\u2019t talk was when he was asleep, and the questions these days! Why, Mommy? Why? Why? Why not? Why? She smiled. Maybe she\u2019d give Ethan a call, see how their wunderkind was doing. So much for not wanting to talk to anyone. A friendly, nice person...she would love to talk to a friendly, nice person. But these mean people? They sucked.</p><p>Seemed as if the martinis were having the desired effect. That bartender knew what he was doing, yes, sir.</p><p>She wandered into the foyer\u2014well, a foyer, because this place was huge. It was less crowded here, and oh, perfect. A small, secret staircase leading up to the second floor.</p><p>Parker went up, not spilling a drop of martini because hey! She was a Miss Porter\u2019s grad, thank you very much! Stellar education and social graces. Also, the drink was nearly gone.</p><p>At the top of the staircase was a long hallway blocked by a velvet rope. Parker sat down a few steps from the top. From here, she could see not only the foyer, but the guests going in and out of the ballroom. Esme, despite being Bridezilla, was beautiful in her crystal-beaded dress, and certainly, as settings went, it didn\u2019t get better than Rosecliff, if you liked ostentatious excess, which the Welles family certainly did. Everyone was dressed to kill, and laughter and squeals floated up.</p><p>Oh, bugger. A dark-haired man had spied her staircase and was heading up. Parker looked into her purse, planning to make that phone call and avoid conversation. But the man stopped.</p><p>\u201cParker. Always lovely to see you.\u201d</p><p>She winced and looked up. \u201cThing One. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my father here?\u201d she asked, hating that he would know and she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he can\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. Her father was blowing off his own niece\u2019s wedding. The Coven would have a fit. Parker was used to it\u2014Thing One: Emissary\u2014but Harry usually put in an appearance with the extended family, the better to lord his power.</p><p>\u201cAnything you need, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even this?\u201d He handed her an icy glass and sat next to her. \u201cI asked the bartender what you were drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think I never liked you,\u201d she said with a small smile. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cThanks, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>He had a drink, as well, and sat down next to her. Like every man there, he was wearing a tux, which was...good. Not many men looked worse in a tuxedo, and Thing One was no exception. He was quite attractive. Not to her, of course. But he looked...good.</p><p>Wicked good.</p><p>She took a sip of her drink.</p><p>\u201cHaving a nice time?\u201d he asked, giving her a sidelong glance.</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d This was their first one-on-one conversation since...since Nicky was born, come to think of it. \u201cSo how have you been, Parker?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled as she sipped the martini. \u201cDo you care, Thing One?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m paid to care.\u201d He grinned at her, and Parker had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re honest. If there is such a thing as an honest lawyer, that is.\u201d He had a nice smile. Hell.</p><p>\u201cI get the idea that you\u2019re somehow persona non grata around here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re prettier than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Parker rolled her eyes. \u201cSave the ass kissing for my father, dear boy.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and looked into his drink, the smile playing around his mouth. \u201cBeautiful women. So cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmarmy men. So common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just reinforcing my point.\u201d He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a long, slender box tied with a silky black ribbon. \u201cHappy birthday from your dad.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. Bugger and damn. She swallowed carefully, not looking at Thing One.</p><p>Because yes, it was her birthday. No one had mentioned that fact when Esme\u2019s wedding date had been set, and Parker hadn\u2019t wanted to bring it up. She wasn\u2019t sure that her aunts knew when her birthday was.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure her father knew when her birthday was.</p><p>Parker took the package from Thing One\u2019s hand and untied the ribbon.</p><p>Inside the box was a fountain pen made of some glossy blue stone. It was heavy and beautiful, and there were two cartridges of peacock-green ink. She could use it for signings. The kids would love the ink color, and her signature would look like calligraphy, coming out of the brass nib.</p><p>It was perfect. \u201cMy father did not pick this out,\u201d she said, not looking at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least he didn\u2019t deny it. She turned her head to look at him. His eyes were brown. She\u2019d never noticed that before. There was a warm, tugging sensation down in Lady Land. Thing One had nice brown eyes. He\u2019d brought her a present and a martini. And had she mentioned the tux?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, Thing One?\u201d It was James. She knew that. She just didn\u2019t want him to know she knew it.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJames Francis Xavier Cahill.\u201d He smiled as he spoke, and she felt the tug harder this time, her stomach tightening, knees tingling.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the beautiful pen, James Francis Xavier Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said.</p><p>That was a good smile, vodka goggles or not. A great smile. That was a smile involving his whole face. Yep. With vodka goggles\u2014quite possibly without, she\u2019d never really let herself dwell\u2014Thing One was smokin\u2019 hot. Really thick, dark brown hair. It would be hard to check for deer ticks in hair like that. Okay, that was the mother part of her speaking...also maybe the vodka part. Let\u2019s shift gears, shall we? Parker asked herself. No need to waste a perfectly satisfactory ogle thinking about ticks. Hair that would look excellent if it were all tousled and rumpled. There. Much better. His eyes were, shoot, she couldn\u2019t think of the word for them, but they were smiley. Smiley eyes with very nice crinkles around them. One of his incisors was a little bit crooked, and for some reason, that made his smile even better.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, James Francis Xavier Cahill?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>Five years younger than she was. She could\u2019ve babysat for him. She wouldn\u2019t have minded babysitting him, now that she thought about it...when he was around eighteen, let\u2019s say, and she was twenty-three. Weren\u2019t there p**n o movies about that kind of thing?</p><p>He seemed to read her dirty mind, because he smiled again, just a little. Then his eyes dropped to her mouth. Heck yeah! So he was having kissing thoughts, too. And from the looks of it, his mouth would be excellent for kissing, full and generous.</p><p>Kind. That was the word she was looking for. He had kind eyes.</p><p>He reached out, slowly, and tucked a wisp of hair behind her ear, and without further thought, Parker leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>She was right. His lips were smooth and warm and it was so, so nice, simply having her lips against someone else\u2019s, someone not her child\u2014crikey, it had been a very long time. And James let her kiss him, the gentle pressure of his mouth just enough to let her know he didn\u2019t mind. A lovely kiss. Perfect. Made Lady Land feel kind of wriggly and warm, and oh, hey, look at this, she was frenching him, and that wriggly feeling leaped and twirled and surged.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t mind at all, apparently, because the next minute, he was kissing her back. She could taste whiskey on him, and oh, God, he was good at this, kissing was so underrated, there should be kissing apps for phones or something. Her fingers slid through his thick, wavy hair, and his arms slipped around her and pulled her closer. The heat and the gentle scrape of his five-o\u2019clock shadow, and oh, man, that mouth against hers...this guy would graduate top of his kissing class, no doubt.</p><p>Her heart was thudding, lust thick and hot in her veins, drowning out rational thought. Parker ran her hands down his neck, his shoulders thick with muscle\u2014nice, Thing One!\u2014then slid her hands under his tuxedo jacket and felt the heat of his skin under the thin cotton of his shirt.</p><p>From down below came the sound of someone laughing.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d she said, tearing her mouth off his and standing unsteadily. \u201cCome with me.\u201d She grabbed his hand and practically dragged him up the rest of the stairs, shoved aside the velvet rope and towed James down the hallway, opened the third door on the right, and bingo. A bedroom, thank you very much.</p><p>James pushed her against the wall and kissed her again, and it was so welcome, so wonderful, being kissed like that, as if the building could burn down around them and it would be more important to keep kissing, hard and hot and fierce. His hands slid down her sides, to her ass, pulling her against him, and damn if her legs weren\u2019t already shaking.</p><p>His mouth had moved to her neck, his dark hair brushing her cheek, and Parker felt such a wave of...longing and tenderness and gratitude and a melting sweetness. He wanted her. There was no doubt about that, and she turned her head and kissed his jaw, just under his ear, making him groan a little.</p><p>Then he straightened up and looked at her, leaning his forehead against hers. \u201cYou really want this to happen?\u201d he asked, and his voice wasn\u2019t quite steady, and that sealed the deal.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. Then she pulled him close and pulled his shirt from out of his pants and slid her hands up his hot skin.</p> <p>He unzipped her dress and didn\u2019t ask any more questions.</p><p>No, sir. No indeedy.</p><p>AS PARKER WOKE UP\u2014holy halos, she\u2019d fallen asleep with a near stranger\u2014her first thought, aside from \u201cParker, you slut,\u201d was \u201cDear Lord, don\u2019t let me be pregnant.\u201d Yes, they\u2019d used a condom. And she was on the Pill, not that she\u2019d needed it for contraception; her gynecologist recommended it as prevention for ovarian cancer. Whatever. Chances were, she wasn\u2019t preggers.</p><p>Next thought was \u201cPlease don\u2019t let him wake up.\u201d</p><p>James Francis Xavier Cahill was beautiful. His cheeks were flushed, giving him a boyish look, and one arm was up over his head. How had she not noticed how delicious he was before this day? He looked like a fallen angel. He looked beautiful. He looked...eesh...young.</p><p>If she could get out of here without talking to him, that would be fantastic, because what the heck do you say after you, the somewhat inebriated older woman, drag a man, the hot young stud, into a bedroom, basically tear off his clothes and shag him silly? She barely let him speak. May as well have commanded him to do her.</p><p>Not that he seemed to mind.</p><p>Her dress, his shirt, her shoes, his tie, were all strewn around the room. So classy. Parker grabbed her panties and dress and slunk into the bathroom attached to the bedroom\u2014excellent for trysts, these mansions\u2014and looked at her reflection. Her mascara was smudged, her lips pink and bee-stung, her cheeks pink. Eyes were dreamy.</p><p>We\u2019re so disappointed, said the Holy Rollers.</p><p>We\u2019re not, said Lady Land. Thank you! That was rather spectacular, yes?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Nevertheless, this was a huge mistake! Thing One? For God\u2019s sake! What was she thinking? She was thinking Stoli Elit, that\u2019s what she was thinking. Stoli Elit, a bad case of poor little rich girl and James Cahill\u2019s smile. Bad, bad combo. So bad. So naughty. Dirty, even.</p><p>The thought of what they\u2019d done...what he\u2019d done to her...and the noises it evoked...the feelings that had practically\u2014 Okay! Stop! Let\u2019s get moving here, shall we? Before the Coven finds us?</p><p>She dressed and ran a wet facecloth under her eyes, dampened her fingers and slicked her hair back into its twist once more. There. She looked normal\u2014for a woman who\u2019d spent the past hour against the wall, on the bed and yes, on the floor. With her father\u2019s attorney.</p><p>Oh, this was bad.</p><p>She\u2019d slip out of the room and call her driver and get out of Dodge. James could wake up and do whatever he wanted, but a face-to-face encounter? Bad idea.</p><p>She opened the door and jumped. There he was, right in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cSneaking out?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d she stammered. \u201cNope. No. Just...freshening. Freshening up, that is.\u201d</p><p>He had his pants on, and his shirt, though it was unbuttoned. Oh, Mommy.</p><p>\u201cAre you going back to the reception, or making a run for the border?\u201d he asked, giving her a quick once-over.</p><p>Border. \u201cThe reception. Esme\u2019s my cousin. I\u2019m a bridesmaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will you acknowledge me down there?\u201d</p><p>The question caught her off guard. Parker found she was pinching her pinkie. Hard. \u201cUm, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>There was something a little...dubious in his eyes. \u201cYes, James.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and once again, it hit her, the force of that incredible smile. \u201cIs there any chance you\u2019ll sit with me during dinner? Because as much as I love the Welles family...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re piranhas,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re piranhas,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Wow. When she\u2019d imagined the reception, she\u2019d pictured a few painful hours with the Coven; James of the beautiful smile was much, much more appealing. \u201cSure. I\u2019d love to.\u201d Her ears felt hot. This was almost like a date.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He was looking at her mouth again, and Parker felt her knees wobble. \u201cAny chance I can drive you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a chance,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said. God, he was darling! How had she missed this? \u201cWant me to go out first? So your evil cousins don\u2019t bust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, James was once again impeccably dressed. He stood in front of her, looked at her for a long minute. \u201cSee you down there,\u201d he said, and there it was again, that smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She bit her lip, then, on impulse, gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.</p><p>His smile grew. Then he winked at her and left the room, closing the door quietly behind him.</p><p>Parker sank down on the bed and let out a long breath.</p><p>So. Okay, it wasn\u2019t as if this was her first time, obviously, not with a three-year-old son. But the whole earth-moving experience...she hadn\u2019t had a whole lot of that. Sex had always been nice. Very nice. Fun. And sure, it had been a while. She hadn\u2019t had a\u2014oh, hell, a lover, though her mind cringed away from the word\u2014since Ethan.</p><p>That had been four years ago.</p><p>Holy halos.</p><p>So maybe it was just a long abstinence with only the pulsating showerhead for company on nights she couldn\u2019t sleep, but holy heck, sex with James Francis Xavier Cahill had been unbelievable. Heck yeah!</p><p>Parker realized she was smiling. Apparently, the best sex of a woman\u2019s life did that to her. James the Cutie-Pie, Purveyor of Said Experience, did that to her, and the thought of that smile, that slightly crooked tooth, the way his eyes looked so happy when he smiled...her knees were feeling wriggly again.</p><p>She sighed. Dreamily, for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>But for one second, she let herself feel dreamy. Moony. Dopey. Meltish. It was kind of wonderful.</p><p>Guess she\u2019d misjudged Thing One. Strike that. James. James was nice. Wasn\u2019t he? He was hot, sure, but he also seemed kind of... And he\u2019d made sure she\u2019d... Maybe they\u2019d...well. She didn\u2019t want to get ahead of herself.</p><p>\u201cOkay, team,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cTime to rejoin the masses.\u201d</p><p>She took another look at herself, hoped that while she definitely had a certain glow, no one would be able to tell she\u2019d been done\u2014the inhabitants of Lady Land gave a hot squeeze\u2014and left the bedroom. There were the stairs\u2014hello, stairs, thank you so much\u2014and she started down.</p><p>And there, in the foyer, was her father, laughing with James.</p><p>Parker stopped, squeezing her pinkie hard. Harder, even, till the tip was numb. For some reason, her heart was sinking, and fast.</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d she said, her voice pleasant. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you were going to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d he said. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>James glanced at her with a little smile, then murmured something to her father, and for one horrible second, she thought he was telling Harry that they\u2019d done the deed, and Harry would clap James on the back and congratulate him or something.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, by the way,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>Oh. Maybe that was worse, having James need to tell her father when she was born.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She lifted an eyebrow, something she\u2019d mastered at age seven after watching her father stare a minion into tears.</p><p>\u201cJames, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet,\u201d Harry said. \u201cParker, we\u2019ll see you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, watching as Harry put his arm around James. The two men walked away, but James looked back. Held up his hand and mouthed, Five minutes.</p><p>The thing was, she knew how long five minutes could last.</p> <p>\u201cParker, where have you been?\u201d It was Aunt Vivian, and she was pissed. \u201cDinner is being served! Would you please come in here? It\u2019s Esme\u2019s special day. Would it kill you to remember that? Honestly.\u201d</p><p>And so she ended up with the Coven, after all. The only person at the table with an empty chair next to her.</p><p>Five minutes became ten. Ten became twenty. Salad was served. \u201cIsn\u2019t Uncle Harry ever going to come over?\u201d Esme whined. He was halfway across the room, glad-handing someone and roaring with laughter.</p><p>\u201cLook at that lawyer of his,\u201d Juliet said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a social climber. I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t tried sleeping with you, Parker.\u201d The cousins burst into laughter, and Parker, who hadn\u2019t cried for a long, long time, felt suddenly terrified that she was about to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cWould you please pass the butter, Regan?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cDo you really think you need it?\u201d Aunt Louise said, and Parker was actually grateful for the change in subject.</p><p>The five minutes had stretched into thirty-three.</p><p>She was an idiot.</p><p>Don\u2019t say that, Parker, the Holy Rollers chimed. We think you\u2019re really smart!</p><p>Not smart enough, apparently, to realize that she\u2019d skipped happily into yet another clich\u00e9, even worse than Wedding Guest Picks Up Guy or Poor Little Rich Girl Feels So Alone. No, this one was worse. Juliet was absolutely right. This one was Guy Sleeps with Boss\u2019s Daughter as Part of Plan to Move Up Corporate Ladder.</p><p>Idiot.</p> <p>She spent forty-seven minutes at dinner, hoping her expression was pleasant, glancing over occasionally as her father worked the crowd.</p><p>Thing One stayed obediently at his side.</p><p>Then she texted her driver, went home, took a very hot shower and practically scrubbed off her skin with the loofah.</p><p>She got a text a little while later. You still around? Can\u2019t seem to find you.</p><p>It was now one hundred and twenty-six minutes after the five he\u2019d said. Well. Better to learn this now. She opted not to respond. Sat there and watched Dexter instead.</p><p>He called an hour later and left a message. \u201cHey, Parker, it\u2019s James. Would you mind calling me? I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, there\u2019d been a misunderstanding. One hundred and twenty-six of them.</p><p>The next day, when Ethan dropped Nicky home, she asked him to stay for dinner before he had to head for the airport. No skipping the armor this time, because if Parker was right, Thing One was going to put in an appearance.</p> <p>Ethan and Nicky were playing T-ball on the back lawn when James showed up. Parker watched through the window as he came up the long walk, flowers in hand. He ran a hand through his hair before ringing the doorbell.</p><p>She opened the door.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d James said. \u201cAlways lovely to see you.\u201d He paused. \u201cEverything okay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Thing One. What brings you by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you disappeared before I could find you yesterday.\u201d He held out the bouquet. Roses, irises, gerbera daisies and, smack in the middle, a package of Alka-Seltzer.</p><p>Damn. She\u2019d been feeling a little polluted all day long.</p><p>\u201cListen, James,\u201d she said, shooting for cool but not icy. Icy would imply that she was hurt. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that I overindulged yesterday and, ah, jumped you. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m actually embarrassed, and I apologize for my behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re about to eat dinner. So. I guess I\u2019ll see you the next time Harry tells you to come by.\u201d</p><p>Thing One\u2019s smile was gone. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I understand. You have certain duties. It was a business event for you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo I get to say anything here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you got in your car and left, to be completely honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if I did get to say something,\u201d he went on, \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019d like to see you again, take you to dinner, get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>She could picture it. He\u2019d woo her or whatever, smile his crinkly smile, make her fall for him, then, as soon as humanly possible, ask Harry if he\u2019d give his blessing, which Harry would certainly give. Finally, a son. He and James would play golf together on the weekends and be masters of the universe during the week, because sure, James would get promoted\u2014you don\u2019t bag the boss\u2019s daughter and not move up to Senior Vice President, after all. James would be an official prince in Harry\u2019s kingdom, wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard to impress her father, not as the son-in-law, no, sir. All James would have to do would be to shag her once in a while, father a kid or two, and he could kick back and relax, his future assured.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d he asked when she remained silent.</p><p>Much to her surprise, Parker felt the sting of tears in the back of her eyes. \u201cNo, thank you, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and looked past him. \u201cI\u2019m your boss\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>She snapped her gaze back to him. \u201cSo, if you think you\u2019re going to get closer to him by screwing me, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you recall, you kissed me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I recall, James. I also recall three very strong and delicious martinis, okay? I wish it hadn\u2019t happened, and I\u2019m promising you, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>James opened his mouth to say something, but at that moment, Nicky came careening into the foyer. \u201cMommy? Mommy? Mommy? Can I have some Goldfish? The eating kind?\u201d Then he noticed James in the doorway, the flowers still in his hand. \u201cHewwo,\u201d he said, not having mastered the L sound just yet.</p><p>Parker didn\u2019t answer, just put her hand on Nicky\u2019s head.</p><p>James dragged his gaze off her and looked at her son. \u201cHi, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember Grandpa Harry\u2019s lawyer, right?\u201d Parker said. Because that\u2019s all you\u2019re ever going to be in this house, pal.</p><p>Ethan joined the little crowd. \u201cHey, how you doing, James?\u201d he said. The men shook hands. Ethan looked at the flowers, still in Thing One\u2019s hand, then at Parker\u2019s face. \u201cNicky, let\u2019s go throw rocks in the water, okay, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Parker cleared her throat. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, Ethan. He was just leaving. Drive safely, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDwive safewy, James,\u201d Nicky echoed.</p><p>James looked at her another second or two. \u201cOkay. Enjoy your night.\u201d</p><p>There was a lump in Parker\u2019s throat as she closed the door. She was stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p><p>\u201cNicky, can you go get me a grape?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, Daddy!\u201d Nicky said, racing off to the kitchen.</p><p>Parker looked at Ethan, forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cFlowers, huh?\u201d he said, leaning in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYep. You know. Kissing up to the boss\u2019s daughter. So is salmon okay? I thought I\u2019d grill it, make a salad. Or we could have what the chef left on Friday. Just need to heat it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the fact that James brought you flowers and you pretty much set the dogs on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeck yeah.\u201d</p><p>Ethan gave her a long look but said nothing more.</p><p>She spent the next week on edge, waiting for something that never came. James never called her. Never emailed, texted or dropped by. He followed instructions, in other words; proof that she was right\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere by being with her. If he really wanted something different\u2014not that he actually did, but if\u2014he would\u2019ve surely tried again.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. She saw him a few months later, when, instructed by Harry, he dropped by with some mutual-fund papers she needed to sign.</p><p>He never mentioned anything about their hookup.</p><p>And even though it was what she\u2019d asked for, it was oddly disappointing.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>PARKER WAS SHOWERING. Not ten feet from his bedroom, Parker Welles was na**d and wet.</p><p>Okay. Probably not the most productive way to start the day. She\u2019d already blown him off in spectacular fashion once in his life. But she was na**d and wet and near, so these thoughts were apparently unavoidable.</p><p>Since yesterday, when she accepted that she really did need some help here, Parker had been very civilized, oh, yes. She always was. Nope, he was not allowed to see behind the curtain, as it were.</p><p>Except for that one time at her cousin\u2019s wedding. Damn. When she\u2019d leaned in and kissed him on those stairs, he actually froze for a second, convinced he was hallucinating the whole thing. But no. The memory of what had followed would live on the trophy shelf of James\u2019s mind till the day he died.</p><p>And afterward, when he was convinced she was having not only second thoughts, but third, fourth and fifth thoughts, too, she agreed to hang out with him. She kissed him on the cheek. Which, in its own way, meant more than even the unbelievable shag.</p><p>Then he\u2019d run smack into Harry at the base of the stairs. Hey, Harry, I just finished doing your daughter. How\u2019s it going?</p><p>So what was he supposed to do?</p><p>He figured he\u2019d take his lead from Parker, and she\u2019d been her usual frosty self with Harry. Then Harry had taken him off to meet some Rhode Island senator, and yeah, maybe it had been more than a few minutes. But he hadn\u2019t expected her to bolt, either. Texted her, got no answer. Maybe something had come up with her kid. But Harry was power-drinking and, as usual, wanted company. James called Parker; no answer. When Harry insisted on going back to the city because of a Sunday-morning brunch he couldn\u2019t miss, James went with him, knowing his boss was sloppy, feeling that mix of pity and love he always did when Harry overindulged. And now, maybe, he was taking care of not only his boss, but of Parker\u2019s father. Drove all the way back to Rhode Island so he could see her the next day.</p><p>Whereupon he\u2019d gone over with flowers and found that he\u2019d become dog shit. Then again, he may well have been dog shit all along. He might\u2019ve just been the guy picked up by the bridesmaid. No one could measure up to the Paragon, after all. A point driven home by the fact that Parker had the guy right there in the house with her.</p><p>Not that James really wanted to try to measure up. He\u2019d never pictured himself married, never wanted kids. But the first time he\u2019d ever seen Parker Harrington Welles, staring at her baby as if no one on earth had ever had a baby before, her face so rapt and gentle...something had sneaked up on him in that moment and sucker punched him and reminded him of what he didn\u2019t have, and hadn\u2019t had for a long time.</p><p>Somebody to love.</p><p>He loved Mary Elizabeth, of course. But that was different.</p><p>Then, at The Wedding, he\u2019d felt it again, that sucker punch when she kissed him on the cheek, a moment of believing that Parker...well. Whatever. She didn\u2019t. She\u2019d made that abundantly clear.</p><p>So why was he lying in bed, thinking about her? Because he was an idiot, that was why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The water shut off. James surmised that if he leaped out of bed at this very second, he could probably catch her in her towel. But no, she was quick. The bathroom door opened; her bedroom door closed. He rolled out of his own bed and pulled on some jeans and a T-shirt and went into the kitchen.</p><p>A few minutes later, Parker joined him, the little dog slinking at her calves. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to run, but I poured boiling water over these mugs last night and washed them three times.\u201d She glanced at him, not quite meeting his eyes. \u201cAnd luckily, I brought my Keurig, so there\u2019s coffee if you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her ears went red. \u201cHi. Sleep well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m meeting my cousin this morning at the diner. Should I bring something back for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, pulled her wet hair into a ponytail. \u201cSo you really think we can get this place up and running by the time Nicky gets back East?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d he said. So long as he worked twenty hours a day or so. \u201cIt won\u2019t be what he\u2019s used to, but it\u2019ll be livable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t care. He\u2019ll be so excited about the dog. And the ocean, too. He swims like a fish.\u201d She paused. \u201cAs you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis water\u2019s too cold for swimming,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Rhode Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s five. Hypothermia only deters adults.\u201d She smiled a little, then grew somber. \u201cI was thinking last night about how to pay you,\u201d she began.</p><p>How about in sex? You could pay me in sex, most definitely. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course I do.\u201d</p><p>Right. The help must be paid. \u201cYour father already took care of it,\u201d he lied. \u201cNow, get to the diner. Don\u2019t you have someone waiting for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Um, I guess I\u2019ll leave the dog here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Her smile hit him in the chest like a line drive.</p><p>Three weeks together before her kid came up. Three weeks alone with Parker Harrington Welles. He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or shoot himself.</p><p>TO PARKER\u2019S SURPRISE, Joe\u2019s Diner was mobbed; for such a tiny town, she wouldn\u2019t have guessed there\u2019d be a line. Then again, it was the only place in town, from what she\u2019d seen yesterday. The smell of dark-roasted coffee and bacon greeted her, practically making her knees buckle. That pizza last night hadn\u2019t been anything to write home about...and then again, there was James watching her, which was proving to be quite uncomfortable.</p><p>All that work he did\u2014for her\u2014well, Harry was paying him, but still, that smile of his brought up some very conflicted memories.</p><p>Because you were slutty, chided Golly.</p><p>\u201cYou have a point,\u201d Parker said.</p> <p>\u201cMorning,\u201d said a rough voice, making her jump.</p><p>Oh, yes. This was more like it. Fling Material. The guy with one name. Malone, that was it, in all his blue-collar glory. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cHi again. Great to see you. How are you? Malone, right? You were very, um, helpful the other night.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. Not smiling. A little scary, even. Parker swallowed and tried again. \u201cSo, Malone, I think I owe you a drink, since you straightened me out on my little property issue and all. Which I can\u2019t say I appreciate, really. I would\u2019ve much preferred the first house.\u201d</p><p>So out of practice on this boy-girl stuff.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s not so bad, Spike commented. He\u2019s smiling.</p><p>It was true. A little, anyway. \u201cYou going in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Parker pushed through the door of the little diner and turned back to Malone. \u201cUm, I\u2019m meeting my cousin Lavinia Harrington. I don\u2019t suppose you know her, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast booth on the left.\u201d He nodded, then turned as someone slapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>Last booth on the left. A woman\u2014or possibly a man\u2014sat there, studying the menu. She looked up as Parker approached. \u201cPahkah?\u201d Lavinia Harrington looked like she sounded\u2014somewhat ravaged. Deep, leathery face framed with frizzy white hair.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Parker said, squeezing past a buxom woman holding a baby. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry it up, girl. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>Parker obeyed, sliding into the red vinyl seat. \u201cSo, you\u2019re Lavinia,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019m not one-hundred-percent sure how we\u2019re related, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you hush up for a few? There\u2019s a surprise planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d Rather a strange welcome. She looked around at the diner, which was gleaming and adorable, like a piece of Norman Rockwell. Every seat was filled\u2014families in booths, people sitting at the counter, babies, toddlers, old folks\u2014 Oh, hey, there were the Three Musketeers from the hardware store yesterday. She waved, but they didn\u2019t see her.</p><p>At the counter directly across from Parker\u2019s booth was the stacked woman and her baby, who was dressed in blue. Six months, Parker guessed, all drool and smiles. God, Nicky had been so cute at that age! The mother wore a low-cut blouse, and a young guy next to her stared appreciatively at her wares. Aside from him, everyone seemed to be looking out the window and murmuring excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHere she comes, here she comes,\u201d announced a woman about Parker\u2019s age. \u201cAct normal, everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie, Maggie!\u201d said the toddler next to her. \u201cMaggie coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d the dad said. \u201cBe cool, Violet, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Like everyone else, Parker watched as a woman approached the diner, a yellow Lab on her heels, two grocery bags in her arms. \u201cOkay, Octavio,\u201d she said, pushing through the door. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we ran out of bacon and eggs when I could\u2019ve sworn\u2014\u201d She stopped in her tracks. Her gaze flicked around the diner, eyes wide. \u201cWhere did everyone come from?\u201d she asked. \u201cMom! What are you doing here? Did someone die?\u201d Her voice trailed off as her eyes stopped on Malone.</p><p>Parker sighed...not with happiness, like everyone else in the place. Indeed, the woman with the toddler had tears sliding down her cheeks\u2014hang on, she was twins with this Maggie person, apparently. The busty woman tilted her head on the young guy\u2019s shoulder and smiled. Indeed, everyone was smiling.</p><p>And here it comes, Parker thought. Sure enough, Malone, who was clearly not going to be her summer fling, got down on one knee and held up a small black velvet box. Yep. She just asked that guy out. The one on bended knee.</p><p>\u201cJeezum crow, Malone,\u201d Maggie squeaked. A grinning man wearing a white apron stepped forward and took the grocery bags out of her arms.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Malone said, a smile playing on his face. Everyone in the diner laughed\u2014clearly some insider joke.</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d Maggie said, a wobbly smile working its way through her tears.</p><p>Malone seemed to groan a little, and another laugh went through the crowd. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d He paused, took a deep breath and soldiered on. \u201cI love you, Maggie, have for a long time, and I\u2019d be real glad to wake up next to you every day for the rest of my life. You and the dog, that is.\u201d Another laugh, and now Malone\u2019s face was gentle. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was great. Yes, absolutely, yes, Malone, I thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d She half laughed, half wept, and Malone rose and kissed her, and everyone cheered.</p><p>Oh! We have the Warm Fuzzles! the Holy Rollers crowed.</p><p>You sicken me, Parker thought. Still, the HRs had a point. It was all lovely. Her eyes were even a little wet, too, and several people were openly weeping. The twin was hugging Maggie now, and the toddler was jumping up and down. An older woman holding an infant was crying, as well. The whole place was congratulating the happy couple, slapping Malone on the back, kissing Maggie. Young people, old people, in-betweens...seemed as if the whole town was there.</p><p>For one brief second, Parker tried to imagine this scene happening to her. Yeah. No. She wasn\u2019t really the Warm Fuzzles type, despite having invented the nauseating term.</p><p>Across the booth, Lavinia coughed, an alarming sound, then nodded as if satisfied. \u201cWe been watchin\u2019 these two for some time,\u201d she said in her rusty voice. \u201cMalone asked us all to come, wanted his daughter here. She\u2019s from away. But he figured Maggie\u2019d like that. Seems he was right.\u201d</p><p>A party seemed to be breaking out\u2014orange juice and champagne were offered, and a few people were coming in and out of the kitchen with goodies. A thickly built waitress plunked a plate of Danish pastries down in front of her, and Parker snagged one. \u201cThink I could get some coffee?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m dying for a little caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d she said, making her way through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it, this being your first time and all,\u201d Lavinia said, sliding out of the booth.</p><p>Parker looked around, the only stranger here, it seemed. Rolly gave her a wave, but he was on the other side of the diner, talking to a young man with Down syndrome. Parker looked at the little jukebox at her table. Oldies but goodies. Tried not to feel awkward.</p><p>Little Maggot looked around. He didn\u2019t know any other maggots on the entire roadkill. If only he was better at making friends!</p><p>\u201cHi there!\u201d</p><p>Parker looked up at the bride-to-be and Malone, who nodded. \u201cSorry, the service kind of sucks this morning,\u201d the woman said. \u201cBecause this guy here, he told everyone we know to show up. And I had no idea. How is that possible, I ask you? I mean, I know everybody, right? Except you. Hi, I\u2019m Maggie, and I know you\u2019re Julia Harrington\u2019s niece. Sorry to be babbling. I\u2019m a little overwhelmed. Because I\u2019m engaged.\u201d She bit her lip and looked at the ring herself, then kissed Malone\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful, Malone. I love it.\u201d</p><p>She showed off the ring. Three-quarters of a carat, maybe, fourteen-karat gold. Parker\u2019s mother\u2019s last engagement ring had been five carats, framed by a ring of twelve smaller diamonds, set in platinum and big enough to choke a seventh grader.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019m Parker. In town for the summer.\u201d Sorry I had dirty thoughts about your fianc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cAt my aunt\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Maggie gave a little grimace. \u201cUm, that\u2019s a beautiful spot. Welcome to Gideon\u2019s Cove. Anything you need, stop by. I know everyone. So does this guy here. Oh, my God, Malone! Are you sure you want marry me? Given how much I talk?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d Put his arm around her shoulders and kissed her temple.</p><p>Dang, they were cute.</p><p>\u201cHey, lovebirds,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cYou meet my cousin? Parker, the happy couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, we met,\u201d Parker said, gratefully taking the cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo when\u2019s the wedding?\u201d Lavinia asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks!\u201d Maggie said. \u201cMalone already got the license and everything, because he wanted Emory to be here, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to go, Dad!\u201d a young woman called amid the hum of conversation.</p><p>\u201cThink you could do the flowers?\u201d Maggie asked. \u201cEven with such short notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course I\u2019ll do the flowers,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cI\u2019ll do them for free if Malone sleeps with me, just one time.\u201d</p><p>Malone grinned but didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Maggie laughed. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll pay. I\u2019ll come by this week, okay? It was really nice meeting you, Parker.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>The couple moved on, as everyone in the place clearly wanted to hug and congratulate them.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Parker said. \u201cVery romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. So. Welcome to town. Nice to meetcha. You saw your inheritance. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d Lavinia asked. She took out a cigarette, lit it and took a drag.</p> <p>\u201cNo smoking, Lavinia!\u201d Maggie called.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Parker\u2019s cousin stubbed the ciggie out on her palm and tossed the butt out the window.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d Parker couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><p>\u201cNaw. My hands are tough.\u201d</p><p>Parker took another sip of the surprisingly good coffee. \u201cWell, my plan is to...I don\u2019t know. I thought I\u2019d slap on some paint and sell the place, but I didn\u2019t know how bad it was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shit-snarl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes indeedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot enough money to really spiff it up?\u201d Lavinia asked.</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cI have a little. I don\u2019t know how far it\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia pursed her lips together, causing a hundred wrinkles to radiate from her mouth like anemic rays from a sickly sun. \u201cI heard about your problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, ayuh. News travels fast. Especially when it\u2019s on CNN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many years did your father get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. Time off for good behavior.\u201d</p><p>Her cousin grunted. \u201cDeserved it, from what I hear. Sorry for you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Besides, even if it was bad, she\u2019d been raised not to discuss money, sex or religion. \u201cSo, Lavinia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Vin,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Vin, um, how exactly are we related?\u201d Parker asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve never met, have we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Your mother\u2019s my cousin on the Harrington side. Althea and I, we spent a little time together as kids some summers, back when my father still owned the Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat point is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouglas Point. The big place north of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was yours? You lived there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Till my mother and father divorced. Then my father sold it a few years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Althea had never said anything about summers in Maine.</p><p>Lavinia looked out the window. \u201cSo how is your mother these days? We didn\u2019t really stay in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ever remarry after your folks split up?\u201d</p><p>Parker couldn\u2019t suppress a smile. \u201cOh, yeah. A few times.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia smiled back. \u201cIs that right? Well. Tell her hello from me.\u201d</p><p>Parker knew that the Harringtons originally harkened from Maine, but her mom had grown up in Westchester County, New York. Back when her parents were still together, big family gatherings had only included the Coven. No second cousins from the Harrington side had ever been mentioned; only those few awkward visits to Great Aunt Julia up in Boston.</p><p>\u201cGot any help for overhauling the house?\u201d Lavinia asked, interrupting Parker\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cUm, yes. A family friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll need it. God knows how long it\u2019s been since the place was cleaned out. Julia stopped coming here probably fifteen, twenty years ago.\u201d She squinted at Parker. \u201cYou need a job this summer? Make a little extra cash? I could use the help with Maggie and Malone\u2019s wedding. Usually hire a high school kid part-time in the summer, but the job\u2019s yours if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Heck yeah, she wanted it. \u201cSure. That\u2019d be great. Thank you.\u201d Her first real job. Holy halos.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I gotta grab a smoke. Come by Wednesday. Three doors down. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia left, and Parker glanced at her watch. She should get back to the shack, bring James some sustenance. Help clear stuff out. But maybe she\u2019d call Nicky first. She glanced at her watch. He might be up. It was five-thirty in California.</p><p>Parker\u2019s chest constricted. Nicky felt so far away\u2014he was so far away. The fact that she hadn\u2019t heard his voice last night, didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d had for dinner, hadn\u2019t toweled off his hair after his bath...dang. Crying in a crowded diner full of strangers\u2014not fun.</p><p>Malone sat down across from her, and Parker jumped a little. \u201cHey there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked, his voice a quiet rumble.</p><p>She was about to deny it and found herself telling the truth instead. \u201cI miss my kid. He\u2019s with his dad in California for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Malone gave a brief nod. \u201cMy daughter lives most of the year in Oregon with her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your daughter over there?\u201d</p><p>Malone looked, his face softening a bit. \u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it.\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cHow old\u2019s your boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough to be apart when they\u2019re small.\u201d</p><p>She tried a smile. \u201cYeah. Well, he\u2019ll actually be coming up when they get back. So. Three weeks to go.\u201d</p><p>Malone nodded again. \u201cHang in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. \u201cBut thanks, Malone. And congratulations again.\u201d</p><p>She got up from the booth and waited at the counter as the gap-toothed cook made a ham-and-egg sandwich to go. He refused payment, telling her everything was on the house today.</p><p>Nice to be in a place where she was anonymous. Not one mention of the Holy Rollers, or Harry\u2014except from Lavinia.</p><p>The sun was shining, a brisk wind coming in off the water, the waves slapping sharply against the wooden pier. The lobster boats bobbed merrily at their moorings, and a seagull strutted down the sidewalk in front of her, the breeze ruffling its feathers but not its composure.</p><p>Upon further inspection, Gideon\u2019s Cove had a bit more to it than at first glance. There was a lovely brick town hall, the police station, a bar called Dewey\u2019s and Lavinia\u2019s flower shop\u2014called Lavinia\u2019s Flower Shoppe. Parker peered in the window and saw that it was crowded with little souvenirs and fake flower arrangements. A half inch of dust was on the sill. Well. She\u2019d make herself useful.</p><p>After that, the town became mostly residential. There were some beautiful old houses in the Federal style with handsome front doors and widow\u2019s walks, rhododendron and lilies blooming in the yards. But the town quickly gave way to blue-collar, with two-family homes and small bungalows as the hills rose around the cove. At the top of one street, Parker could see Douglas Point. Hard to believe that had been in her family and her mother never mentioned it. Then again, Althea was hazy with details.</p><p>Aunt Julia\u2019s place wasn\u2019t visible. Maybe, given Thing One\u2019s extra weight, it had fallen into the sea.</p><p>Either way, she should probably go back home. To the hovel.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>FOUR DAYS LATER, as James ripped shingles off the roof, he had to admit he\u2019d been wrong in thinking Parker would be a wuss when it came to hard physical labor. Grayhurst had had a cleaning crew, a gardening service, a handyman on call 24/7 and a personal chef who delivered meals daily. But there was Parker, hacking down the weeds along the stairway to the dock like a member of a chain gang. Cut-off jeans that showed her long, gorgeous legs. The jeans were the ones the mouse had run into, and she\u2019d said there was no way in hell she was giving the rodent another chance. A shirt from Joe\u2019s Diner; apparently, Miss Welles hadn\u2019t packed\u2014or didn\u2019t own\u2014a proper T-shirt. A Yankees hat, the only thing marring her golden beauty. Well, she couldn\u2019t help it. Had spent most of her childhood in New York.</p><p>Nope, Parker had dug right in, shoveling the remainder of her aunt\u2019s belongings into trash bags, sorting through what could go to the Salvation Army\u2014not a lot\u2014and what was recyclable. If she had to ask him how to change the head of the sponge mop, well, it was kind of appealing.</p><p>She talked to her kid probably four times a day, which James thought was a lot. Then again, he probably talked to his parents four times a year, so what did he know?</p><p>She whacked at the weeds again, swinging the scythe like a golf club, then stopped to throw Beauty a stick. She glanced up at James, saw him looking and gave a quick wave, then looked away.</p><p>Yeah. Even though they\u2019d been together for five solid days, there was little change in their relationship. She was polite. She was a good worker and listened when he told her how to do something. She had a decent sense of humor. Still called him Thing One occasionally. Didn\u2019t seem to be moping about her lost fortune, though she got quiet sometimes, maybe missing her kid.</p><p>In other words, she was as out of reach as ever. They talked about the house. The dog. The town. Maybe fifteen or twenty minutes of conversation a day. She spent more time than that by far on the phone with her kid. And the Paragon. And Mrs. Paragon.</p><p>Whatever. He had his own work to do, ripping the decaying shingles off the roof. Sweat dampened his hair, and he wiped his face on the sleeve of his T-shirt. Gideon\u2019s Cove was experiencing a rare heat wave the past day or so, with temperatures into the nineties. Humid, too. And the blackflies...he\u2019d forgotten about those bloodthirsty little suckers.</p><p>He turned as a truck slowed in front of the house. Probably one of Parker\u2019s fan club, the old guys from the hardware store, who\u2019d been dropping by daily to check on her progress. She had those three wrapped, that was for sure. Called them the Three Musketeers, which made the old guys shuffle and blush as if she\u2019d knighted them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t one of the Musketeers. It was his oldest brother, Tom, a good twenty pounds heavier than he\u2019d been two Christmases ago when James had last seen him. Red-faced, and not from the sun.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d James said, shading his eyes to be sure. Ayuh. That was Tom, all right.</p><p>\u201cHey, James. How you doing, bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain. Talked to Dewey last week. He said you were here for the summer.\u201d</p><p>James climbed down from the roof, wariness prickling at the back of his neck. He was the only one of the five Cahill kids who\u2019d graduated college, let alone gone on for a law degree. The only one who\u2019d made it out of Maine, too. His brothers didn\u2019t drop by or give him a call for the hell of it.</p><p>\u201cKids are good?\u201d James asked. He hesitated, then shook his brother\u2019s hand. From down by the water, he could hear Parker\u2019s scythe hacking into the long grass. He hoped she stayed there.</p><p>\u201cKids are great. Maybe you can swing by and visit this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. That\u2019d be nice.\u201d Except Tom had never once invited James to his house before. \u201cSo what brings you up here, Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I had to do something in Machias. Figured I\u2019d swing by.\u201d Machias was an hour south, but James didn\u2019t point that out. Tom leaned back against his truck door, all casual interest, and nodded at the house. \u201cGot your work cut out for you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just trying to get it up to code, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna reshingle the sides next?\u201d Like their father, Tom was a carpenter.</p><p>\u201cYep. Rebuild those steps, too.\u201d</p><p>Tom nodded sagely. \u201cSo listen. I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>Ah. That made more sense. Tom was here for money.</p><p>His brother folded his arms across his chest and stared out at the harbor. \u201cThere\u2019s this very cool opportunity to be a part owner in the old lumber mill. Remember that place? Down by the river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cSo me and my buddies, we were thinking we\u2019d buy it, renovate it, put in some really nice shops on the first floor, right? Cheese shop, wine, upscale shit. Then up above, we\u2019d have luxury condos.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d It sounded idiotic. Dresner was a dying city. There was more call for a soup kitchen than luxury condos overlooking a river polluted by forty years of industrial waste. Cheese shop? Come on.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m looking for a little capital to get started.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019d pay you back with interest and all.\u201d</p><p>James took a slow breath. \u201cI\u2019d love to help you out, Tom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s asking for help. This is an investment opportunity. Thought you liked that shit.\u201d There was already an edge in Tom\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could help you,\u201d James said. \u201cI really don\u2019t have the money.\u201d</p><p>Tom pushed off his truck, his face growing even redder. \u201cYes, you do, you little prick. You\u2019ve been working for that rich ass**le for years now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you didn\u2019t hear, my boss is in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t get a king\u2019s ransom for burrowing up that guy\u2019s butt.\u201d</p><p>Nice. \u201cI did. But it\u2019s all tied up, and you know it, Tom.\u201d</p> <p>His older brother glared. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, look, even if it was a great idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now it\u2019s a crap idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I honestly don\u2019t have the money. It all went to Beckham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we wouldn\u2019t have needed Beckham if it wasn\u2019t for you! You f**ked everyone over, didn\u2019t you? When your own family needs something, forget it. But here you are, playing house with your boss\u2019s daughter, aren\u2019t you? Having fun living off her money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, look at this place. Does it seem like she\u2019s got money?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for nothing. I should\u2019ve known. And don\u2019t show your face in Dresner. Mom\u2019s enough of a mess without you. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>Ten seconds later, Tom screeched out of the driveway. He gave James the bird as he gunned the motor. Then he was gone.</p><p>Forget the roof. There was a crowbar; there was the long side of the house. James grabbed the heavy metal tool, jammed its wedged end under some shingles and began ripping them off with a vengeance. Sweat poured off his body, soaked his hair, stung his eyes. The wood screamed in protest, but he didn\u2019t stop. Just ripped the shingles off the side, no matter that they\u2019d been petrifying there for two generations, just shoved the pry bar underneath and jerked up and ripped them off like scabs.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even notice Parker come up from the beach until she walked right past him, her dog as always tight against her calves.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweaty day laborer,\u201d she said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he grunted.</p><p>\u201cWas someone here? Thought I heard voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look, but he kept ripping shingles. \u201cOkay, Thing One. I\u2019m going for a swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She went blithely into the house. James continued jamming the crowbar under the shingles, relishing the screech as they tore off.</p><p>Then her words sank in.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t swim in Maine water. It was practically ice-cold. Fifty-two, fifty-five degrees? Maybe? It was high tide, too, so it\u2019d be even colder. He tossed down the pry bar and stomped inside, folded his arms across his sweaty T-shirt and stood outside her door, ready to lecture her.</p><p>Then the door opened, and he forgot what he was there for.</p><p>She was wearing a bikini.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His mouth opened, but no sound came out. Skin. There was a lot of skin. And...curves. Breasts. Shoulders. Legs. His mouth went dry. She gave him an odd look, then scooped up her hair and secured it with an elastic, and his eyes slid down to her rack, because my God, that was a fantastic\u2014</p><p>\u201cI know. Cellulite. I\u2019ve gained eleven pounds this past year.\u201d She stared down at her torso, then sighed. \u201cOh, well. Maybe I can swim some off. Come on, Beauty.\u201d She grabbed a towel and headed through the kitchen.</p><p>Her ass was...well, he was unable to summon actual words at the moment, as there was no blood flowing upward. And that scrap of fabric\u2014red fabric\u2014thank you, Jesus. Hard to believe she\u2019d kissed him once, and speaking of hard, she was so beautiful and perfect and luscious, bad enough that he\u2019d had to listen to her shower every morning, and\u2014</p><p>But wait, wait, wait.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t swim in that water.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d he croaked, but she was already halfway down the stairs, the long grass billowing in the breeze, the dog\u2019s feathery tail in the air.</p><p>\u201cParker!\u201d he called, banging out the back door. \u201cThat water\u2019s really cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am really hot,\u201d she said. Tell me about it. \u201cI\u2019ve been working like a dog. Right, Beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too cold for swimming,\u201d he said, running down the stairs. \u201cHypothermia cold, Parker. Don\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. People swim in it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot up here they don\u2019t.\u201d He reached the dock, which was bobbing vigorously, as the tide was coming in hard, slapping against the buoys that held the thing afloat. If he didn\u2019t watch it, he\u2019d fall right in.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going swimming.\u201d She draped her towel over one of the old wooden porch chairs she\u2019d dragged down here. \u201cBeauty, want to come? Come on, girl!\u201d With that, Parker executed a perfect swimmer\u2019s dive from the dock, the dog sailing in right behind her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t surface. He could see her white skin under the water...but no, that was just sunlight. Where was she? Where the hell was she? \u201cParker!\u201d James stripped off his shirt. \u201cParker!\u201d</p><p>Then her blond head popped up, way too far away from the dock. She pushed her hair out of her face. \u201cOh, bugger!\u201d she called. \u201cYou were right! It\u2019s freezing!\u201d She grinned at him, then saw her dog. \u201cBeauty! Good girl! Good puppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, get in here. You\u2019ll freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do feel like I\u2019m dying. But eleven pounds, Thing One!\u201d With that, she began swimming in long, hard strokes away from the dock.</p><p>James bit his thumbnail. Yes, granted, she\u2019d swum on the Harvard team. There\u2019d been two pools at Grayhurst, one inside and one out. But there were no tides in swimming pools, and they weren\u2019t fifty-two degrees, and they weren\u2019t strewn with buoy lines. What if she got tangled on one? \u201cParker, don\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d he called, jamming his hands into his pockets.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him. Kept swimming. Another yard. Another. She was an entire football field away now. No signs of slowing. Damn it all to hell. If he jumped in after her, could he catch her? Probably not. But once she went under, he\u2019d be a lot closer\u2014</p><p>Finally she stopped, and the dog swam right up to her. It had a stick, which Parker threw back toward the dock, and the dog zipped right around to find it.</p><p>\u201cTime to come in, Parker,\u201d James yelled, sounding like a parent. Then again, she was acting like an idiot child. Like\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not bad once you get used to it,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say, right before they freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. He was chewing his thumbnail again.</p><p>Finally, she turned in the right direction, diving under the surface of the water in a dolphinlike move, then popping up for breath a few yards closer. Swam efficiently, closer, closer. James didn\u2019t take his eyes off her the entire time.</p><p>Then, as she was climbing back onto the dock, she slipped and fell back with a splash, and before he was quite aware of having moved, he had her by the arm and was hauling her up, slopping frigid water against himself, her skin as cold as if she were dead.</p><p>\u201cEasy there, Mr. Lifeguard,\u201d she said, stepping back and smoothing the hair off her face. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this a habit. It\u2019s too cold. It\u2019s stupid, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I will make it a habit, Thing One,\u201d she said, squeezing the saltwater out of her hair. \u201cI love to swim, I own a house on the water, and you\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d Goose bumps covered her skin, and her ni**les\u2014 Shit. Women were not fair, because a perfectly good case of righteous anger was turning into lust.</p><p>Without another word, he turned and stalked off the dock.</p><p>Time to rip some more shingles.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a baby shark named Swimmy. He asked his mommy, \u201cDoes God still love me, even though I eat the other fishies?\u201d and his mommy said, \u201cWho cares?\u201d and ate him, and Swimmy was delicious.</p><p>Okay. So the writing wasn\u2019t going that well. Parker put aside the red notebook, which now contained eleven ridiculous and aborted story attempts, considered tossing it off the dock and sighed. Well, maybe her new series would get the green light. Two days ago, against her better judgment, she\u2019d sent her agent and editor a series proposal. The Ark Angels. How did all those animals get along on Noah\u2019s Ark? Why, it was all thanks to a clever lion cub, a singing fox and a crafty kangaroo. Glee meets the Bible meets Animal Farm. We thought it was super awesome, Parker! the HRs chorused. Parker figured it was close enough to the Holy Rollers in its preachy, simpering style, so she had high hopes that the powers-that-be would love it.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been feeling the mojo. Not that she\u2019d loved the Holy Rollers, but the books had come easily to her. You\u2019re welcome, said Spike, who now looked to be a thuggish sixteen. About time we got some recognition around here. He tucked a cigarette behind his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo smoking,\u201d she said. He stubbed the ciggie out against his palm, Lavinia-style, and lifted an eyebrow. Teenagers.</p><p>She got up and headed inside. Thing One was still ripping and tearing stuff, apparently having his period. She may as well start dinner.</p><p>Once all the crap had been cleared from the kitchen, Parker had scoured it. The linoleum was torn in a few places, but otherwise, the room had a sort of cheap charm. Shabby chic, maybe? There was a kitschy little table, one of those chrome-and-vinyl models from the sixties, white with bits of gold, and a couple of usable chairs. Parker had excavated a strange plastic tomato statue; it wore a top hat, had long eyelashes and sported a cane, which, upon further inspection, turned out to be a smiling green worm. She put it on the table and smiled. Looked kind of cute.</p><p>Grayhurst\u2019s kitchen had consisted of granite and marble and steel with rare-wood cabinets and knobs designed just for the house. The knives were German, the china French. The table had been an original Frank Lloyd Wright.</p><p>Well. Those days were over. Sparkly vinyl and plastic tomatoes were more her speed now. And the linoleum, while still cracked and yellowing, was clean, at least. Things were moving in the right direction.</p><p>The swim had been great, though James had a point. That water was freaking cold. But swimming had always made her feel calmer and happier. Nicky, too, she\u2019d noticed. He\u2019d love the water here, her little eel. She\u2019d been on Skype with him earlier during a quick run to the library; they were at a gorgeous lodge in Muir Woods. Nicky had looked bigger to her. Then again, that might be her imagination. They\u2019d only been apart for five days.</p><p>Hard to believe. It felt like five months.</p><p>The sound of screeching wood came from the opposite side of the house. James, still hard at work. The noise was like a knife in her eye. Maybe the lad was hungry. She\u2019d see if he had any preference for dinner. Seemed like the least she could do.</p><p>Going outside, she saw that James was still shirtless.</p><p>Oh, that was...that was good. That was nice. The guy browned up fast, that was for sure. His hair was wet with sweat, and half of the shingles on the side of the house were gone. His muscles bunched and corded as he worked. Beautiful arms, lean stomach, the muscles over his ribs shifting hypnotically with his movements. A bead of sweat ran down his neck into the little hollow at the base of his throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced at her without stopping. Right. She should speak. She swallowed. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d she asked. \u201cFor taking a swim?\u201d</p><p>He did stop then. \u201cNo. Just had a crappy day.\u201d</p> <p>Parker felt a pang of guilt. She didn\u2019t know much about Thing One, granted, and she\u2019d definitely been keeping conversation terribly neutral. But here he was, working like a dog for her. And when she\u2019d gone swimming, he\u2019d been rather adorably anxious.</p><p>\u201cWant some dinner?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m cooking.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were very dark. Ethan\u2019s were brown, too, but a lighter color. James, though. James had eyes that were so brown they were almost black. A person could look into those eyes and just about get lost.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, then went back to ripping off the shingles.</p><p>Crappy day, huh? Well, she\u2019d make him something nice. She\u2019d been to the market this morning\u2014not the tiny one in town, but the bigger one about half an hour away\u2014and had stocked up. In the sunny kitchen, she rinsed some spinach, sliced tomatoes, put the water on to boil the pasta. James came in to shower, and it was hard not to imagine him in there, all soapy and wet. And tanned. And naked. And wet. And naked.</p> <p>\u201cDown, girl,\u201d she said to herself, causing Beauty to flop to the floor. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you, sweetie,\u201d Parker added. The little dog had been trained by someone, it was clear. She didn\u2019t put a toenail out of line, as if afraid of being beaten, poor sweet thing. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl,\u201d Parker said, giving her a strip of salami. She was rewarded with a slight swishing of the dog\u2019s tail.</p><p>Dinner wouldn\u2019t be too fancy, but it smelled heavenly. She opened a nice bottle of Meursault, stolen from Grayhurst\u2019s wine cellar, then brought everything down to the dock and set it up, picnic-style. She poured a glass of wine for herself and sat down, looking out at the water.</p><p>The harbor was smooth now, the smallest ripples lapping gently against the rocky shore, and the sun was beginning its descent, filling the horizon with gold, turning the clouds to cream. A piping plover ran along the shore, stopped to peck at something, then ran some more. Always in such a hurry, those little birds.</p><p>The dock shifted, and Parker looked over. James had changed into jeans and a white polo shirt and looked like an ad for Ralph Lauren.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you could cook,\u201d he said, looking down at the spread.</p><p>\u201cSurprise. I like cooking. Have a seat, James.\u201d She patted the blanket, poured some wine and handed him a glass. \u201cThanks for all your hard work today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Thanks for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>They ate, plates in their laps, looking over the water, not talking. The tide was going out, exposing a few rocks, and a line of cormorants swam over and clambered up, spreading their wings to dry. A few lobster boats motored in. There was Billy Bottoms, the white-haired man who looked as if he belonged on a postcard; Parker had met him at the diner a couple days ago when she was picking up lunch. Then came the Twin Menace, which belonged to Maggie\u2019s brother, she\u2019d learned. The Ugly Anne came in last, and Malone lifted a hand in greeting. She waved back.</p><p>\u201cSo why the bad mood today?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cFamily stuff.\u201d James set his empty plate next to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a lot of family around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have three brothers and a sister, all in Maine. My parents still live in the same house where I grew up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere in Gideon\u2019s Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. About an hour and twenty minutes west of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you guys close?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cSome of us are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dewey, who owns the bar, he\u2019s your uncle, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. My mother\u2019s brother. She\u2019s one of seven. My dad has three sisters.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to interrogate him, but big families fascinated her. She\u2019d only had her parents and the Coven, after all. \u201cYou must have a lot of cousins, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen.\u201d</p><p>Parker smiled. \u201cSounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d James said.</p><p>Was. Not is. He didn\u2019t explain, though. \u201cI always wished I had more cousins,\u201d she said. \u201cFour girls about the same age. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ah. Right. At Esme\u2019s wedding, when they\u2019d done a lot more than talk. Parker felt her ears heat up. Could be the wine.</p><p>It was getting dark; clouds had gathered off Douglas Point, and the wind kicked up a little, lifting her hair. A rumble of thunder rolled in the distance.</p><p>Parker\u2019s phone cheeped. She looked. Oh, goody! A message from Ellen! Maybe her agent already had some interest in the Ark Angels.</p><p>Hey, Parker, sorry to say, they took a pass on the Ark Angels. It didn\u2019t seem to have the same sincerity as the Holy Rollers. Back to the drawing board! Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re all confident that you\u2019re almost there! Just go with the flow, and something will hit you. Sooner is better, okay? Hope you\u2019re having fun in Maine! Talk soon.</p><p>Well, bugger. Bugger and damn.</p><p>\u201cGo with the flow\u201d? She\u2019d been waiting for the flow for some time. There was no flow. And \u201cthe same sincerity\u201d? The Holy Rollers had no sincerity! Mickey the Fire Engine, which had been rejected by both her agent and publisher all those years ago...Mickey had sincerity. He was an extraordinarily sincere fire engine.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Yes.\u201d She looked out at the water. \u201cActually, no. My publisher didn\u2019t like my new series idea. So that\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re a big hit, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>The phone cheeped again. Aw. Ethan had sent a picture of Nicky, standing in front of a giant redwood tree. Parker\u2019s throat tightened at the sight of her son. There was another attachment, this one a drawing of two humans with giant heads and skinny legs. One had long hair, and one had spiky hair. They were holding the hand of a smaller giant-head person. Nicky had labeled them Daddy, Lucy, Me and written, \u201cWe Love You, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Her eyes were wet.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Parker?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cI miss my son,\u201d Parker said, swallowing. The words didn\u2019t do him justice. It felt as if a part of her was missing, that\u2019s what it felt like, as if she was killing time until her real life started when he came back, and crikey, time had slowed to an absolute crawl.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen days,\u201d James repeated, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never gone more than two without seeing him,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cMust be tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. For me, anyway. Nicky\u2019s having the time of his life. Swimming in the Pacific, seeing Muir Woods, horseback riding.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThen he gets to come here, to this...shack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s shaping up, Parker. It\u2019ll be fine by the time he gets here.\u201d</p><p>She set her plate down, glanced at James and his kind, dark eyes. For a second, she almost admitted what was on her mind, and a fear that had cropped up more and more in the past six months: that Nicky would ask to live with Lucy and Ethan full-time, and if he said that, it would kill her.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t sell this place?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, even if I can, there won\u2019t be too much left over, and I don\u2019t have that many marketable skills, Thing One. I was a double major in English and Ethics. Should\u2019ve listened to my father and gone into finance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook where that got him,\u201d James said.</p><p>Parker picked a splinter from the dock. \u201cYou know what the kicker is? Those miserable little Holy Rollers would\u2019ve made me a ton. The movie comes out this summer\u2014The Holy Rollers in 3-D! and they put that exclamation point there as part of the title, as if it wasn\u2019t already dumb enough. And now, I can\u2019t write anything, I can\u2019t come up with anything decent, I\u2019m completely and utterly stuck.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Why was Thing One always around during her weaker moments? Swallowing, she pressed her lips together and looked away. The sky had clouded over, and it was darker in the west. Another growl of thunder came from the far distance.</p><p>A second later, she felt his hand on hers. Warm and calloused and...comforting.</p><p>\u201cEverything will turn out fine, Parker,\u201d he said. \u201cThis summer\u2019s just a bump in the road.\u201d</p><p>Please, God, that was true. She nodded, not trusting her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Harvard grad, as you like to remind me. You\u2019ll find a job. And your son loves you. That won\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him\u2014he was looking at her steadily, and those deep, dark eyes were kind. She gave his hand a quick squeeze. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>No one looked at a person that way anymore. They checked their phones, or scanned the horizon, or glanced around. But Thing One kept looking at her. Kept holding her hand, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, James,\u201d she admitted, and her voice was a little husky.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d His thumb moved over the back of her hand, and suddenly, Lady Land perked up. Those eyes...that whole face, in fact...that warm hand...</p><p>He leaned a little closer, and her heart rate tripled. She remembered what it had been like to kiss James Cahill, and her legs tingled. Remembered his hands on her, against her skin, his mouth on her neck, on her\u2014</p><p>Then a bolt of thunder cracked right overhead, Parker jumped and Beauty leaped up and streaked for the house. The first fat drops of rain smacked down on the dock.</p><p>Moment over. Sign from God.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Parker said, her voice breathy. \u201cLooks like rain.\u201d Yes. Rain tended to look like rain. She stood up, her legs still tingly, her hand feeling cold and empty. \u201cWe better hurry.\u201d</p><p>Careful not to look at him, she grabbed a few things at random, a plate, a glass, a napkin. Then the heavens opened, and she raced up the stairs, as much a coward as Beauty.</p><p>The cold rain on her shoulders was almost a relief.</p><p>WHEN JAMES GOT UP to the house, he was soaked. And the power was out. Looked as if all of Gideon\u2019s Cove had lost power, in fact. He put down the things Parker hadn\u2019t managed to grab and ran his hands through his wet hair.</p><p>\u201cJames, leave everything, okay?\u201d Parker\u2019s voice came from down the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll clean up in the morning. Uh, Beauty\u2019s scared, and she\u2019s hiding under my bed, so I\u2019ll stay in here. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Beauty wasn\u2019t the only one who was hiding. \u201cGood night,\u201d he said. Another bolt of thunder crackled across the sky.</p><p>He\u2019d almost kissed her. Which was a dumb idea, no matter how much he wanted to.</p><p>It would be a long time till he fell asleep, he knew. Rather than fight it, he opened the quiet fridge and groped around for a beer, took it out onto the back patio and sat, watching the storm roll and flash over the harbor, the pine trees black in the harsh flashes of lightning, the lobster boats starkly white.</p><p>What do you think\u2019s gonna happen, idiot? his conscience chided in the harsh voice of his father. She\u2019s already blown you off once. Think you measure up to the Paragon? And what happens when she finds out what you did?</p><p>James took a long pull on his beer. There were plenty of women out there who\u2019d be a lot easier than Parker, that was for sure. Leah back home would love to see more of him. It\u2019s just that there wasn\u2019t a lot to Leah. Sweet girl. Fun to hang out with, fun in bed. But while she tended to talk...and talk...and talk, she never seemed to say anything. Which was cute for a while, that chattering. Cute for about two hours, at which point they\u2019d fool around, then she\u2019d chatter some more, then he\u2019d leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So no, not Leah. But surely there was someone else out there. Someone who was not Parker. For crying out loud. One time, three years ago, and he was still hung up on her, even though she\u2019d made it very clear that he was a drunken mistake.</p><p>Stupid. Men were stupid, and he was no exception.</p><p>The storm was moving down the coast, the bulk of the thunder south of them now. He wondered if Mary Elizabeth was getting any of this weather, even though they were inland a bit. She hated storms. He fished out his phone and hit her number. \u201cHi, honey,\u201d he said when she answered. \u201cHow you doing? Getting any thunder down there? Well, you have Spike with you, right? All right, then, you\u2019re all set. He won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you, you know that... .Because he\u2019s an angel, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p> <p>\u201cGOOD. YOU\u2019RE HERE. And oh, you brought your dog.\u201d Lavinia knelt down to pet Beauty, who ducked her head and hid behind Parker\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shy,\u201d Parker explained. \u201cShe\u2019ll warm up to you eventually.\u201d She set down the coffee she\u2019d brought for her cousin and took a sip of her own.</p><p>Vin twisted around, cracking her vertebrae. \u201cHeard you got Dewey\u2019s nephew working over there with you. That your family friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Less said the better on that subject.</p><p>\u201cYou two doing the nasty?\u201d</p> <p>Parker choked on her coffee. \u201cUm, no. He...he works for my father. He\u2019s just helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you say so. Seems like a waste, though, not doing that cute boy. Anyway. You know anything about flower arranging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I took a class once. At camp.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia surveyed her through squinted eyes. \u201cDid you? Well, the first rule is, you\u2019re going to get dirty. That shirt of yours...silk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Parker glanced down. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll get ruined. You need to dress more like me.\u201d</p> <p>Please, God, never that. Lavinia was dressed in aqua-blue stirrup pants and a green-and-red flannel shirt. \u201cCome on, then,\u201d her cousin said. \u201cLet me give you the tour. This here\u2019s the cooler. We get a delivery maybe once a week, less in the winter, when business slows down.\u201d</p><p>With Beauty practically attached to her leg, Parker looked into the case, where there was a small variety of flowers: carnations, roses, lilies, baby\u2019s breath. \u201cOver here,\u201d Vin continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got the containers, vases, angels, a few boxes of chocolate. I wouldn\u2019t eat those if I were you\u2014can\u2019t tell how old they are\u2014but if someone wants them, buyer beware, right?\u201d Lavinia coughed and lit up another cigarette.</p><p>\u201cThink the smoke is bad for the flowers?\u201d Parker asked, waving her hand.</p><p>\u201cProbably. At any rate, cards are over here. Rolls of tissue paper, cellophane, all the tools you might need, and be careful with those scissors, \u2019cause those\u2019ll cut you faster than a cat can lick its ass.\u201d</p><p>The kitty cat licked its cute little bum. Oh, those worms were so itchy! \u201cIf only someone would adopt me, I could get these pesky intestinal parasites taken care of!\u201d Another winner.</p><p>\u201cYou listening to me?\u201d Lavinia pointed to a heavy oak door with a large pane of frosted glass. \u201cThis here\u2019s the greenhouse. Don\u2019t go in there, got it? It\u2019s temperature controlled. That\u2019s why there\u2019s the lock on the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you grow back there?\u201d Parker asked. She could see a blur of green, a few splotches of pink. Beauty was sufficiently interested to sniff at the door.</p><p>\u201cRare orchids, shit like that. Wicked particular about hot and cold. Okay? I\u2019m the only one what takes care of those.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Parker turned back to the older woman. \u201cLavinia, I really appreciate you letting me work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. That\u2019s what family\u2019s for.\u201d She smiled, her face crackling into an array of wrinkles that Parker found quite attractive. Althea, who was roughly the same age as Vin, didn\u2019t sport any wrinkles, having had her face paralyzed by Botox far too many times to count.</p><p>\u201cSo you and my mom played together as kids?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Back when we were really little. Couple, three times is all. Then we moved to town, over by the fisheries plant.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia was quiet for a moment, and Parker wondered what her silence meant. Once, Lavinia had lived in a mansion; now, she chain-smoked and wore stirrup pants.</p><p>\u201cVin, why do you think Julia left the house to me? Instead of you or my mom? You were her nieces. I\u2019m just a grand-niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Julia was always mad at someone or another,\u201d Vin answered, lighting another cigarette. \u201cShe was furious when my brother sold the Pines, even though he gave her that little cottage. Pissed that he got himself into financial trouble and whatnot. As for your mother, Julia didn\u2019t approve of divorce, so I guess that\u2019s why she picked you. Not many of us to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never got married? No kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Always wanted a kid. Never a husband, though. I\u2019m too fickle. You, too, from the look of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you? Forty?\u201d</p><p>Parker winced. \u201cNo. Thirty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with being fickle when it comes to men. Keep those options open, I always say. Anyway, most of our orders are pretty basic. Got your bible right there.\u201d She picked up a huge and faded book and swiped it against her butt, a shower of gray flakes falling to the floor. Between the dust and the smoke, Parker could practically feel her lungs shriveling. \u201cOftentimes, we don\u2019t have the right stuff in stock, but we do our best. Folks understand. Well, hello there, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>Beauty crouched behind Parker\u2019s legs as Maggie came in. \u201cHi, Lavinia! Hi, Parker!\u201d she said. \u201cHow are you? Oh, you have a dog! Hi, puppy! Can I pet her?\u201d</p><p>Ah, love. The woman\u2019s happiness was palpable, and heck, it was awfully romantic, the way her guy had popped the question in front of everyone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty shy,\u201d Parker said, but Maggie knelt down, and to Parker\u2019s amazement, Beauty\u2019s tail wiggled a little bit.</p><p>\u201cShy is fine,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cNothing wrong with shy.\u201d Beauty sniffed Maggie\u2019s hand, then offered a lick.</p><p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a dog person. You should bring her over sometime. She can play with Peaches. That\u2019s my dog. Malone gave her to me.\u201d At the name of her honey, Maggie blushed. \u201cAnd speaking of Malone, I\u2019m here to talk about the wedding. It\u2019s a quicky job. Not in that sense of the word\u2014I\u2019m not pregnant, at least not to my knowledge. It\u2019s just, you know, Malone, he\u2019d rather get it done, plus his daughter\u2019s only here for a month... Crikey, listen to me.\u201d She smiled sheepishly. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019re getting married a week from Saturday. Sorry it\u2019s such short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like people are lined up around the block. And for you, Maggie, no problem, sweetheart.\u201d Lavinia\u2019s face melted again into wrinkles as she flashed some browning teeth. \u201cWhat kind of bouquet were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heck, I don\u2019t care. Whatever you think is pretty. My dad said he\u2019ll pay for the wedding, but I don\u2019t want to drain him dry, either. Hydrangeas are in season, right? Those are nice. Whatever\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your budget?\u201d Vin asked.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred dollars sound okay?\u201d Parker tried not to wince. Three hundred was nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh, ayuh,\u201d said Vin. \u201cWe can do real nice for three hundred.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Parker could honestly say that she\u2019d never met a bride like Maggie. Lucy had been pretty easygoing, but they\u2019d had a girls\u2019 night with Corinne, Lucy\u2019s sister, and pored over Martha Stewart Weddings magazines, drank wine, and it had been a blast. As far as Esme, please. There\u2019d been more tantrums during that engagement than at a day-care center during a full moon. Bloodlust and fury over things like flowers and seating arrangements and limos. Even her own mother, who had weddings down to a science, got religious with details; Althea\u2019s last bouquet had cost three thousand dollars\u2014just the bouquet, which was made of rare lavender roses and vivid pink orchids flown in from South America, all wrapped in satin ribbons embroidered with Althea and Maury and studded with Swarovski crystals.</p><p>Maggie smiled at Parker. \u201cYou helping Vin out this summer, I heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cCool. I bet you have great taste. I love your clothes. You always look so nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Parker said, feeling a blush.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Maggie blurted, \u201cyou should come to Dewey\u2019s tonight! We\u2019re having a girls\u2019 night out. I think it\u2019s sort of my bridal shower, too. Just bring something for the food pantry. No gifts. Want to? Vinnie\u2019s coming. You can meet everyone.\u201d</p><p>Parker opened her mouth to pass\u2014she barely knew Maggie\u2014then realized her standard excuses were not going to work. No kid to go home to. No manuscript to work on.</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t go out, she\u2019d be home with Thing One of the eyes and the hands and the smile. \u201cThanks. I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>WHEN PARKER PULLED INTO the short driveway of her place, Thing One was up on the roof.</p><p>Shirtless. Again.</p><p>At the sight of him, every egg in her ovaries leaped to attention and started banging their tiny fists against the wall. Let us out, Parker! Now!</p><p>He wore carpenter-style shorts and a tool belt and work boots and nothing else but sweat, and Parker suddenly realized her mouth was dry.</p><p>Thing One. Was. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d she croaked, and he turned, wiping the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He started toward the ladder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come down! I brought sandwiches from the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He disobeyed her order, jumping the last few rungs. And now he was getting closer, and she could smell that nice, clean sweatiness of him.</p><p>\u201cDid you put on sunscreen?\u201d she heard herself ask.</p><p>He smiled. Her knees tingled dangerously. \u201cThanks for bringing lunch.\u201d</p><p>Parker swallowed. \u201cOh, you\u2019re welcome. You know. The least I can do is feed you.\u201d</p><p>His arms were most...unlawyerly, curving with muscle, glistening. No shirt. Had she mentioned that? And he was standing approximately four inches in front of her. Should she choose to lean in and taste him just for the hell of it, it wouldn\u2019t be hard at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, realizing abruptly that he was talking. \u201cSorry. Um, Beauty, stop, honey.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. Use the dog as an excuse. Good play. Not that the dog was doing anything other than cowering behind her legs.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ll be up on the roof most of the day. There\u2019s a part of the floor in the kitchen that\u2019s rotted out, thanks to a leak, so I figured the roof was a priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call.\u201d As if she knew anything. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get going, then. Cleaning. And I might get started doing the, um, prep stuff. For painting. Cleaning and taping. I need to sponge down the walls in your room.\u201d Did that sound dirty? It sounded dirty to her. Sponge down. Sponge bath. Your room. Your bed. \u201cUm, is Apollo locked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He was smiling at her, that knowing, faint smile. The I\u2019ve seen you na**d smile.</p><p>Without another word, she went into the house.</p><p>Parker managed to avoid Thing One for much of the rest of the day. He went to the hardware store; she talked to Nicky twice, once after lunch, once after he\u2019d seen a deer and wanted to tell her about it. Mostly, though, she cleaned.</p><p>Parker found that she liked hard physical labor. The last time she\u2019d worked this hard, she\u2019d been pushing out a baby; her housework at home didn\u2019t usually entail more than making Nicky\u2019s bunk bed\u2014which was awkward, let\u2019s give credit where it was due. But this stuff, this schlepping and bending and wiping and sweeping...forget Zumba or Pilates. Body by Hoarding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t get to James\u2019s room. It felt a little...personal. But the living room and kitchen walls had been washed with bleach and water, and she\u2019d taped all around the windows, cupboards and doors. Tomorrow she\u2019d start painting. Rolly and Ben were coming over to help.</p><p>That would be good, having some people there. People other than Thing One.</p><p>He\u2019s awfully cute, the female Holy Rollers said.</p><p>\u201cShush, you guys.\u201d But maybe James needed a drink. Parker filled a glass and went outside, where James was coming down from the roof. \u201cHow\u2019s it going up there?\u201d she asked, handing him the glass and gazing out at the harbor\u2014not at his shirtless glory, no, of course not.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He took a long pull of water, then dumped the rest over his head and ran a hand through his thick, wavy hair. God. She was going to need a pulsating showerhead, and soon.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m gonna take a shower,\u201d she said. That sounds like an offer, the HRs advised. \u201cI\u2019m going out tonight. With the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie and Chantal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She kept forgetting he had roots here. \u201cYeah. Well, Maggie. I don\u2019t know about Chantal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. You all set for, um, everything? Dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set.\u201d</p><p>Pretty soon, Parker told herself, she should confront the elephant in the room. James, we slept together once, she\u2019d say. Not gonna happen again. We\u2019re both copacetic with that, yes? So even if you look like a chocolate lava cake and I haven\u2019t had dessert in three years, it\u2019s not gonna happen. I\u2019m almost positive.</p><p>An hour later, Parker was clean and sweet-smelling and surveying the dark interior of a shabby little bar decorated with wooden lobster traps and the occasional lobster claw. There were about ten tables, a few booths and a counter.</p><p>\u201cParker! Over here!\u201d There was Maggie, at a table in the back. Or it was the other one, her twin. They waved in unison. A busty redheaded woman was nursing a baby, and four or five men watched unabashedly. Beth, the woman from the animal shelter, was also there.</p><p>Parker went over. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, suddenly feeling shy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could come!\u201d Maggie said. Parker assumed it was Maggie, because she had on a Hello Kitty tiara. \u201cHave you met my sister? This is Christy, and she refuses to get a big C branded onto her forehead so people can tell us apart. Really, Christy, you\u2019re so difficult sometimes. This is Beth, who says you\u2019ve already met her, and Chantal, our sister-in-law, and Luke, our nephew. Isn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he is,\u201d Parker said, though admiring the child would mean staring at Chantal\u2019s boob, which apparently was the thing to do.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re nursing, Chantal,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cBest for baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ayuh,\u201d the others murmured from their trance.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Beauty doing?\u201d Beth asked Parker.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s good. Very shy, but she\u2019s getting there.\u201d Parker smiled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t let the poor thing be put down.\u201d</p><p>Christy gave Beth a look. \u201cI thought you never put animals down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Parker. I lied,\u201d Beth said with a grin.</p> <p>\u201cAh, well. She\u2019s a great dog,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, girls,\u201d Christy said, \u201clet\u2019s get our new pal here a drink. Dewey!\u201d Parker jumped at the bellow. \u201cBring our friend a mojito!\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up!\u201d Dewey was apparently the large man behind the bar. Didn\u2019t look much like James, not that she could tell, anyway.</p><p>Christy leaned forward. \u201cWhile we wait, ladies, let me tell you something. I saw the hottest guy in the world today, outside of my own husband, of course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Malone,\u201d added Maggie.</p><p>\u201cAnd your brother,\u201d added Chantal.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d chorused the twins, and all three of them laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, as I was saying,\u201d Christy went on, \u201cthe hottest guy. Now, Parker, you don\u2019t understand. This town is rather difficult. I had to import my husband from away. But locally, if you like surly alpha males, we had one, and sorry, Maggie got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Maggie confirmed, sucking up the last of her mojito. \u201cHe\u2019s my surly alpha male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you like irritating, lazy, annoying but cute guys,\u201d Christy went on, \u201cthere was exactly one, and he\u2019s our brother, and for some ungodly reason, Chantal married him. Otherwise, there\u2019s Crazy Dave, named that for a reason, Pete Duchamps, our local alcoholic, and Mickey Tatum, our sixty-year-old fire chief. So a cute guy in town...this is big news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is incredibly exciting,\u201d Beth said. \u201cI can tell he\u2019s my soul mate already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Christy nodded sagely. \u201cWho is he, and how can we get him to marry Beth?\u201d</p><p>Parker had a feeling she knew who the hot guy was. How many gorgeous new strangers could be bopping around a town of 1,400 people? \u201cDark hair? Red pickup truck?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes! You know him? Is he yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine. My nephew,\u201d said the bartender, who\u2019d arrived with a round of drinks. He looked down at her. \u201cHello. You must be Parker.\u201d</p><p>She stood up. \u201cHi. Are you Dewey?\u201d He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to meet you, and thanks for your help with the house. You\u2019ve been great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, dear,\u201d he said. \u201cThe least I could do for Jamie\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh! That was Jamie Cahill?\u201d Christy said. \u201cHe turned out so nice!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Dewey said. \u201cNot married. Drink up, girls, and have fun. Nice meeting you at last,\u201d he added to Parker, then lumbered back to the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen Jamie Cahill, hugged him and copped a feel,\u201d Chantal said. \u201cSorry, Christy, old news.\u201d She popped the baby off her breast and covered up. \u201cShow\u2019s over, boys,\u201d she said to her audience. \u201cWho wants to burp him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take him, Maggie. I have my own little burp machine at home.\u201d Christy smiled at Parker. \u201cI have a two-year-old and a two-month-old, and I couldn\u2019t get out of the house fast enough tonight. Shoved both of them at my husband, got in the car and floored it.\u201d</p><p>Maggie practically lunged for the baby and kissed his fat little cheek before assuming the position and patting the baby on the back.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you know Jamie?\u201d Christy asked.</p><p>Parker took a sip of her drink. \u201cHe worked for my dad, and he\u2019s helping me flip a house. Over near Douglas Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hovel just before the Pines,\u201d Chantal supplied.</p><p>Parker gave a painful laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he seeing anyone?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cUm, not that I know of.\u201d Though I almost kissed him the other night and have dirty thoughts of him hourly.</p><p>\u201cIf I weren\u2019t happily married, et cetera, et cetera,\u201d Chantal said, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d Lavinia plunked herself into the chair next to Parker. \u201cI was watching Jim Cantore on The Weather Channel. When Storms Kill or some-such. I would do him in a New York minute. So. Who\u2019re we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDewey\u2019s hot nephew,\u201d Chantal said. \u201cJamie Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle young for me,\u201d Lavinia said.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s he like, Parker?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>Yes, said Spike. Do tell. \u201cWell, he\u2019s...he\u2019s very handy.\u201d</p><p>This set the women off in gales of laughter. \u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Chantal said, adjusting a breast. \u201cJamie! Over here!\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s ears began tingling as James walked over. Christy gave him a hug; apparently he\u2019d seen Maggie at the diner, knew Lavinia from his summers here and shook hands with Beth, which caused her to blush a fire-engine red.</p><p>\u201cJamie, this is my son,\u201d Chantal said, reclaiming her little bundle. \u201cAdmire away.\u201d</p><p>James looked at the baby, who gazed back, then spit up. \u201cVery, um...well fed,\u201d he said, smiling at Chantal. Then his gaze shifted to Parker, and Lady Land stirred. Bugger.</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair and charm us, James,\u201d Chantal commanded. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of Maggie\u2019s shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make your drinks instead,\u201d James said. \u201cI told Dewey I\u2019d help out tonight. But have fun, girls.\u201d He turned and went back to the bar.</p><p>\u201cTell me you don\u2019t want a bite of that,\u201d Chantal said, watching him walk away.</p><p>\u201cPreach it, sister,\u201d Beth murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo, Parker, I have to ask you,\u201d Christy said. \u201cAre you the Parker Welles who writes those books about the angels?\u201d</p><p>Parker took another healthy sip of her mojito. \u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone gave me a few Holy Rollers books when Violet was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t have to pretend you like them,\u201d Parker said easily. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty nauseating.\u201d</p><p>Hey! We have feelings! The HRs pouted.</p><p>No, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re imaginary, Parker countered.</p><p>\u201cWas that the one where the kitten gets crushed by the tractor?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cThat was my favorite one,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cCried like a baby.\u201d Thank you! the angels chorused. At Parker\u2019s questioning look, Vin added, \u201cHey. You\u2019re my cousin. I did a Google search on you.\u201d</p><p>Parker finished her drink. \u201cAnyway. The series is over, thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you working on now?\u201d Beth said.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not really sure yet,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI have a few ideas.\u201d That\u2019s great news! the Holy Rollers cheered. Yay, you!</p><p>If only.</p><p>\u201cThat dear boy is looking at you, Parker,\u201d Chantal said. \u201cYou guys doing each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnore her,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cChantal has sex on the brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Your brother is a happy man,\u201d Chantal answered, raising a perfect eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo more sex talk about our brother!\u201d Christy ordered.</p><p>Parker laughed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s my father\u2019s lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Chantal asked. \u201cHe\u2019s living with you. Have you seen him na**d yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! And even if I was interested\u2014\u201d which you totally are \u201c\u2014he\u2019s got the triple crown of no against him,\u201d Parker said. \u201cYounger, unemployed, um...\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpotent?\u201d Christy asked.</p><p>\u201cPrison record?\u201d Beth offered.</p><p>\u201cMarried to the church?\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s not impotent,\u201d Chantal murmured, raising an eyebrow. \u201cAt least\u2014\u201d she paused for effect \u201c\u2014he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Chantal. Are you kidding?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, somebody had to do it. He was seventeen, and so cute.\u201d Chantal grinned, and Parker felt an odd twang of...something. Another sip of mojito fixed that.</p><p>\u201cOkay, time for a subject change,\u201d Maggie announced. \u201cLet\u2019s leave poor James alone and talk about something else. I wear the crown of Kitty, so I\u2019m the boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd such a lightweight,\u201d Christy added.</p><p>\u201cTrue. So, Parker, are you married? You have a little boy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, never married,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son is five. Nicholas Giacomo Mirabelli.\u201d She fished out her phone so Nicky\u2019s sweet face could be admired.</p><p>\u201cIs there a story of forbidden love here? Or did you get knocked up, like me?\u201d Chantal asked, peering at the photo. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with getting knocked up,\u201d said a male voice. \u201cChantal never would\u2019ve married me if I hadn\u2019t knocked her up, right, babe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJonah, shush,\u201d Maggie and Christy said in unison, then laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou shush, girls,\u201d he retorted. \u201cYou\u2019re both love children, too. I\u2019m the only child Mom and Dad really wanted.\u201d He turned to Parker. \u201cHi. Jonah, long-suffering brother of the idiot twins here. I\u2019ve seen you out on your dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Jonah,\u201d Maggie commanded. The pink-beaded tiara she was wearing was slightly askew. \u201cGo to the boys\u2019 section. This is for women only. Shoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are ugly when you drink.\u201d He bent down and kissed Chantal. \u201cSee you at home, gorgeous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye, honey.\u201d Chantal beamed up at him and patted his ass as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d Christy said.</p><p>\u201cSo gross,\u201d Maggie added. \u201cSo anyway, you were telling us, Parker, before my brother so rudely interrupted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Parker said, \u201clet\u2019s say I have this thing for emotionally unavailable men.\u201d</p><p>The table burst into laughter. \u201cPlease. You have no idea who you\u2019re talking to,\u201d Maggie said. At Parker\u2019s questioning look, she added, \u201cI was in love with a priest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s hard to top,\u201d Parker acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cAnd I shtupped my best friend\u2019s baby brother. Have I mentioned Jonah is thirteen years younger than I am?\u201d Chantal said, smiling. \u201cCougar, baby. The only way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I slept with a certain married Massachusetts senator whose last name starts with K,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cWasn\u2019t really worth the effort, I\u2019d have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how was your guy emotionally unavailable?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds worse than it is, but he was in love with someone else,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t figure it out until after Miss Egg and Mr. Sperm met, so I have a five-year-old, and we have joint custody, and it\u2019s all very friendly and civilized.\u201d</p><p>Huh. Her second mojito was gone. The last time you had two drinks and Sweet Baby James was around, you did the drag-and-shag, Spike, now in his early twenties, pointed out. Speaking of cougars. Just sayin\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cSo have you dated at all?\u201d Beth asked. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a decent guy these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, haven\u2019t really dated. Maybe a first date every few months, but nothing real,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex since your five-year-old was born?\u201d Chantal asked, her mouth hanging open in horror.</p><p>This was, of course, the moment that James brought another round of drinks over.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d Lavinia said, shaking her head. \u201cThank you, James, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Parker didn\u2019t answer. James put a glass in front of her. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, not daring to look at him.</p><p>\u201cAnything else, girls?\u201d he asked, his voice warm and smiley.</p><p>\u201cWould you take off your shirt?\u201d Christy asked. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get Maggie a stripper.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, and the sound scraped something deep down in Lady Land. Something that liked being scraped. James had almost kissed her the other night. Right? It had seemed to her that a kiss had been possible, there on the dock, before the thunder, when she\u2019d bolted like a scared little baby horse.</p><p>Okay. No more mojitos. Who referred to themselves as scared little baby horses? Mojito-enhanced people, that\u2019s who.</p><p>James looked down at Parker, who decided that now would be an excellent time to drain that mojito. The straw stuck her in the eye, but she squinted and managed a swallow or two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home when you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo need, Thing One,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I can canter on home all by myself.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and there it was again, that scraping. Meow. \u201cI\u2019ll do it anyway.\u201d</p><p>All righty, then. If he insisted. He could walk her home. He was paid by Harry to walk her home, she reminded herself. No matter how cute he was, no matter how smiley were those eyes, he was in Harry\u2019s pocket, and Harry was in jail and not a nice person, and James was here to babysit her and assuage Harry\u2019s conscience. Sex would not be part of the equation.</p><p>A while later, the party broke up. Maggie had to open the diner early, Christy\u2019s baby didn\u2019t yet sleep through the night, and Jonah was giving Chantal the look of love, according to her. Parker stood, too. James was nowhere to be seen, but after the sobering thoughts earlier, she really didn\u2019t want to wait. She was thirty-five years old, for heaven\u2019s sake. Didn\u2019t need an escort.</p><p>The air was surprisingly chilly, thick with the salty smell of the ocean. The bar had been loud, and as Parker walked toward the harbor, the quiet of the night settled around her companionably. Mackerly was pretty quiet, too, and also surrounded by water, but it wasn\u2019t like this. This was a place where livelihoods were still made on the sea, a town that was remote and craggy. So far, she hadn\u2019t seen any condos or McMansions on the water; the Pines was it as far as it went for posh real estate.</p><p>Waves slapped briskly against the hulls of the lobster boats in the otherwise quiet night. In the far distance, Parker heard an eerie, laughing noise; a loon, perhaps, not that she\u2019d ever heard one before.</p><p>She fished her phone out of her bag and hit Ethan. Then, before it could connect, she hung up. She\u2019d talked to Nicky three times today, and while she knew Ethan and Lucy wouldn\u2019t mind one more call, it seemed...needy.</p><p>And sleeping with James\u2014not that she was thinking about it (cough)\u2014would be needy, too. A lonely older woman who was in the midst of financial ruin and a career crisis should not have a fling. No matter how chocolate lava cake was her housemate.</p><p>\u201cParker. Wait up.\u201d Speaking of cake.</p><p>She turned as James loped down the half block that separated them. \u201cThing One,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMiss Welles. I believe I said I\u2019d walk you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of your duties for Harry?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a measured look. \u201cNo. Just a concerned citizen who doesn\u2019t want you falling into the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I could drink you under the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true. But since we\u2019re heading to the same place, why not?\u201d He grinned, and she looked away quickly.</p><p>\u201cFine. Thank you, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo were you girls talking about how handsome and strong I am?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cLittle bit,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI hear you and Chantal have a history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe kindly relieved me of my virginity,\u201d James answered. \u201cAnd I will forever be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent summers here, Thing One?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. A few, anyway.\u201d He hesitated, and Parker got the sense he was going to say more, but he stayed silent as they walked past the little diner, the dock, the harbor itself.</p><p>There were no streetlights on Shoreline Drive, and though it was past ten, the sky was just now deepening from indigo to black, the stars brightening overhead. The loon called again.</p><p>\u201cSo, Parker, any thought of maybe staying up here for a while?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a puzzled look. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou can work from anywhere, right? You have some family up here. You could have the house winterized\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never take Nicky away from his father.\u201d Her posture stiffened to Miss Porter\u2019s Finest.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Ethan live away for most of Nicky\u2019s life?\u201d James asked, his tone mild.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, he traveled a lot, but he was home every weekend. And then he switched careers so he could live in town. We\u2019re five minutes apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>There was something in his tone that grated on Parker\u2019s nerves. \u201cEthan\u2019s a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is. Isn\u2019t my tone hushed and reverent enough? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with Ethan?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI mean, really, Thing One. You barely know him.\u201d</p><p>James nodded, then picked up a rock and threw it out into the sea, where it hit the water with a hollow dunk. \u201cHow long were you with him, back when you were dating?\u201d</p><p>He probably already knew the answer. \u201cA couple of months,\u201d she answered, her tone icy.</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019d you break up?\u201d</p><p>She walked a little faster. \u201cIs it any of your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, probably not. But he sounds so very perfect in every way. It\u2019s a little confusing as to why you didn\u2019t snatch him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dubious charm is wearing thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe married your best friend, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that! I barely knew Lucy when he and I were dating. We only got close after I broke up with him. And I broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. So sorry, Majesty. Didn\u2019t mean to criticize the Paragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan. The Paragon of Perfection.\u201d</p><p>Well, bugger. She was either going to smack him or\u2014or agree with him. \u201cOh, look, home sweet home. Sleep tight, Thing One.\u201d With that, she jerked open the front door of the little house, got Beauty and went out the back to go sit on the dock.</p><p>She didn\u2019t slam the door.</p><p>But she wanted to.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cSO YOU GOT THIS? You can hold down the fort, and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Vin. You go. Have a great time.\u201d Parker smiled at her cousin. She couldn\u2019t wait till Vin was gone so she could start cleaning. The shop was filthy.</p><p>\u201cThanks. \u2019Cause I haven\u2019t been laid in God knows how long.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m going. A sex date. And I cannot wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy? Knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d her cousin continued, squinting appreciatively as she took a long drag on her cigarette, her face contorting into a sea of wrinkles. \u201cSome men, it\u2019s just in and out, right? Nawt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this little circly thing. Makes me crazy.\u201d Lavinia stubbed the cigarette out on her palm, then fished her bra strap up from where it had slid down her crepey, mole-encrusted arm. \u201cHe might be hairy, God knows, but once you get used to the friction, it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>Parker had never thought of herself as a prude, nope, but damn if she didn\u2019t throw up in her mouth a little bit. \u201cWell, then. Maybe you should get going. Um, traffic and all that.\u201d Yes. The fabled traffic of Gideon\u2019s Cove, Maine, where once in a while you had to wait four or five seconds to make a left-hand turn onto Elm Street.</p><p>\u201cGood point, kid.\u201d Lavinia punched Parker on the arm fondly. \u201cHave a great day. And thanks. I\u2019m off to have my orgasms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl,\u201d Parker said, swallowing. Would definitely be throwing away that cranberry muffin from Joe\u2019s, no matter how good it had looked a half hour ago. Lavinia saluted as she left, hitching up the waistband of her drooping shorts.</p><p>As soon as her cousin was down the block, Parker opened the windows. She liked Lavinia, sure, but the smell of cigarette smoke was nasty. Made Parker look forward to her swim later on even more than usual.</p><p>Funny thing about that swim\u2014the water seemed to do wonders for Beauty, who acted like a normal dog, leaping off the dock, retrieving whatever happened to be floating, joyfully paddling after Parker, making her funny little woofing breaths. But James...James clearly didn\u2019t like it. Wherever he was, he\u2019d stop and watch her go. It wasn\u2019t the bikini thing\u2014though she had to admit, his reaction upon seeing her that first time was very gratifying. No, he ignored her as she went out, and as she came in, but the whole time she was in the water, she could feel his eyes on her. Must\u2019ve seen Jaws too many times as a kid.</p><p>But the swims were glorious as far as Parker was concerned. The icy bite of the water, the tang of salt, the sure, strong strokes as she swam. Maybe she could get a job as a swim coach or something. Not that she could support Nicky on that, but it was a thought. She\u2019d been on the swim team in college, after all. Had been the third Olympic alternate, which by Olympic standards meant she was a loser, but by normal human standards meant she was pretty great. Swimming was one of the few times she felt as if she knew exactly what she was doing. That, and being Nicky\u2019s mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the thought of Nicky, she glanced at the calendar. Thirteen more days.</p><p>The house was shaping up, as James had predicted. A week and a half, and he had on a new roof. Chimney fixed, most of the old shingles off the side. He worked like an ox, she\u2019d give him that.</p><p>But it was still...uncomfortable, being around him. There were definitely moments where she really, really liked Thing One. And then she\u2019d remember how he\u2019d known she and Nicky were about to be financially ruined. How he\u2019d known they\u2019d have to move. How he\u2019d taken care of his own interests and not said a word to her, even knowing that she and Nicky were completely dependent on that stupid family trust. Well, Nicky had Ethan to support him. There was that.</p><p>But even as those things seemed to matter less, there were those phone calls from Harry. Oh, yes. She\u2019d overheard them. The easy camaraderie between the two men. Practically father and son. BFFs till the end of time.</p> <p>Harry hadn\u2019t called her once. She made her own dutiful weekly call, but they never talked for more than three minutes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the old wound,\u201d she said, quoting the dying Lancelot. Paternal rejection left a mark on a girl. A woman. Bugger and damn, she was thirty-five. Hardly a girl anymore. Half a decade older than Thing One. Ethan, too for that matter, which had never seemed to be an issue. He had an old soul. James did not.</p><p>Time to whip out Mr. Clean, her favorite male these days. Lavinia didn\u2019t really seem to care much about where things were in the flower shop, but Parker had been itching to rearrange. It was a tiny little space, jammed with all the detritus of the business. Not that there was a lot of business. Maggie and Malone\u2019s wedding was coming up. Otherwise, there\u2019d been a couple of get-well arrangements, one sheepish-looking husband in for a bouquet, two new babies. So far, if Parker was at the shop, Lavinia let her handle every job. Vin seemed oddly detached from the flower arranging. The only thing she really seemed to care about was the small greenhouse that housed the orchids, where she spent hours each day, misting, watering, checking soil pH. Parker had offered to help and was immediately waved off.</p><p>\u201cYou like doing the flowers? Run with it,\u201d she\u2019d told Parker. \u201cThis back here is my baby.\u201d</p><p>And Parker loved doing the flowers. She\u2019d spent a summer down at a finishing school of sorts, where she\u2019d learned helpful things like how to pour tea, make conversation without expressing an actual opinion and yes, walk with a book on her head. The flower arranging had been the only thing she\u2019d really enjoyed. At night, there had been other lessons\u2014how to buy drugs, water down your parents\u2019 alcohol so they wouldn\u2019t realize you were drinking, give a blow job, demonstrated on a banana by Caitlynn Swann, whose father owned most of North Carolina. Obviously, these nighttime lessons weren\u2019t on the curriculum, but the older girls had taken it upon themselves to share. Parker had been fourteen at the time.</p> <p>At any rate, she\u2019d always liked flowers. Back in her Grayhurst days, she\u2019d cut a bunch every Monday from the vast garden and put together something for the kitchen table, her nightstand, Nicky\u2019s room\u2014though he had a tendency to pick off any red petals and glue them on his Star Wars figurines to represent blood. She\u2019d even put an arrangement in the bathroom. It always felt nice, flowers in the loo. Made brushing your teeth seem much more pleasant.</p><p>Four hours later, Parker was dusty, sweaty and more than pleased with her efforts. She\u2019d dragged the card display to be near the cash register and rearranged the shelves with all the little tchotchkes. The shop was now much easier to navigate, the dusty porcelain figurines and candles wiped clean and placed in the corner. She put the houseplants on the wide shelf in the front window\u2014Lavinia had them against the back wall, for some reason\u2014and made a gorgeous arrangement of gerbera daisies, larkspur, irises and ferns for the counter, the colors all in shades of pink and purple. Beautiful.</p><p>She hoped Lavinia would let her do Maggie\u2019s wedding bouquet. Maggie had been so nice to her, so welcoming. Parker had gotten an invitation to the wedding, even. And Malone had smiled at her the other night. Maybe. It was sort of hard to tell, but Parker had a bit of a soft spot for him, as he was the first resident she\u2019d met. She liked looking out for his boat each night, knowing he was safely back home and on his way to Nice Maggie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be cynical,\u201d Parker said aloud to Beauty as she swept the floor. \u201cBut I\u2019m not. I love love. Gross, huh?\u201d</p><p>Beauty\u2019s tail swished in agreement, her eyes never leaving Parker.</p><p>It was too bad they couldn\u2019t keep the cottage as a summer place. It was hard not to fall in love with this town.</p> <p>Well. Maybe someday.</p><p>The bell over the door rang, and Parker looked up to see who it was. An older man in a suit, not someone she\u2019d met before. Beauty fled to her hiding spot under the worktable behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a potted plant for my mother,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSure. Take a look around. Is it a special occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we had to put her in a nursing home, poor thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t make it up here too often.\u201d He gave her a once-over. \u201cI live in Winter Haven. Ever been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that I have.\u201d</p><p>He reminded her of Harry; his suit was expensive, and his leather briefcase gleamed. Parker would bet he drove a German car and lived in a house on the water. He glanced dismissively at the Boston ferns and African violets, the jade plant and the cheerful yellow primrose. \u201cGot anything else? Something a bit more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExotic?\u201d Parker supplied.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he answered, smiling. \u201cYou read my mind.\u201d Another glance at her chest. In a way, flattering that he was checking her out, as she was filthy from cleaning and dressed in a once-white T-shirt and jeans. On the other hand, he exuded that entitled vibe\u2014I can look at your boobs because I\u2019m rich, and you\u2019re a serving wench as far as I\u2019m concerned.</p><p>\u201cWell, what you see is pretty much it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the greenhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Um, we have some rare plants back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind showing me those?\u201d</p><p>Parker hesitated; it really was Vinnie\u2019s domain. Then again, her cousin grew them to sell, ostensibly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind paying extra,\u201d the guy said. \u201cMy mom deserves the best.\u201d</p><p>And Vin could use the money. \u201cSure. Let me get the key. We have some orchids. Does your mom like those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re almost as pretty as you. Dan Jacobs, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Yep. A Harry. Dan Jacobs had to be sixty-five if he was a day, complete with wedding ring, but it seemed that once a man passed forty, he suffered some kind of acute stroke that affected his mathematical abilities, encouraging him to hit on women young enough to be his daughter. The Hugh Hefner School of Nasty.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cParker. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Beauty growled, very softly. Indeed, sweetie. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have,\u201d Parker said, her voice brisk. She took Vin\u2019s key from the drawer, opened the padlocked door and pushed it open.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been in here yet. There were orchids, all right. About ten of them were in rather sparse bloom, a couple of blossoms here and there, but nothing really striking. More of the orchids were dormant\u2014unremarkable, rubbery green leaves in pots. But the other plants, maybe fifty in all, looked like houseplants\u2014densely growing, delicate leaves, almost like a miniature green Japanese maple. Some of them had fluffy white flowers akin to something Dr. Seuss might\u2019ve drawn. They were very pretty, though Parker had no idea what they were.</p><p>\u201cI like those,\u201d Dan Jacobs said. \u201cAre they orchids, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Parker said. She checked one or two of the pots for an identifying plastic stick. Nothing. No sticker on the bottom, either.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take one,\u201d the guy said. \u201cWrap it up with some pretty foil, if you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Parker could find no price tag...well, she\u2019d charge him seventy-five dollars. Looked as if he could afford it.</p><p>As she wrapped the pot and tied some ribbon around it, Dan Jacobs leaned forward, the thick smell of his cologne enveloping her. \u201cSo I wonder if a beautiful woman like you would like to have dinner with me,\u201d he said, showing a whitened grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your wife wouldn\u2019t like that,\u201d Parker answered, smiling to soften the blow.</p><p>\u201cMy wife has nothing to do with this,\u201d he said.</p><p>The guy was just like her dad. Hey, what did marriage mean when you could bang a younger woman, right?</p><p>\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Parker answered. \u201cYou\u2019re a few decades too old for me. That\u2019ll be seventy-five dollars, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he muttered, very softly. He put down four twenties and walked out of the store without waiting for change.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d Parker sang out once he was out of sight. Well, at least it was a good sale. Vin would be pleased; the African violets were six bucks apiece.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed quietly. By two o\u2019clock, Parker found herself wondering what James was doing. If he was doing it without his shirt. No, no, that\u2019s right. He wasn\u2019t at the house today. She\u2019d given him the day off. Ordered him to take the day off, more like it.</p><p>They\u2019d been skirting each other the past few days...polite, pleasant, but not intimate. Not since that first dinner on the dock, when he\u2019d taken her hand. Since he\u2019d almost kissed her, and she\u2019d almost let him.</p><p>But there was something about James. The memory of his hard, na**d body against hers at Esme\u2019s wedding\u2014that tawdry, smokin\u2019-hot, p**n o memory, yes, that was something indeed. He\u2019d done incredible things with the cottage\u2014that was for sure\u2014a steady and hard worker, completely uncomplaining about the amount there was to do. But there was something else. Something quiet. Something a little bit sad, maybe.</p><p>Today was the first day they\u2019d been apart since he arrived. And let\u2019s face it. It wasn\u2019t because he deserved a day off\u2014which he absolutely did. It was because if she had to keep seeing him shirtless, her thin resolve not to climb him like a tree might crumble, after all.</p><p>Just then, the bells rang out in alarm as the door was jerked open, and there he was, Dan Jacobs, her customer du jour. \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d he said, his face florid.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Parker said. Holy crap, was that a cop with him? It was.</p><p>Dan pointed. \u201cShe\u2019s the one. The one who sold me the drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she yelped, getting an answering yelp from Beauty. \u201cI did not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, you have the right to remain silent,\u201d the cop began.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>The Harry-clone jammed his fists on his hips. \u201cYou sold me a marijuana plant! For my mother, no less!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>\u201cI DIDN\u2019T KNOW it was marijuana!\u201d Parker protested for the fifth time as the cop led her inside the police station.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t want to say anything till your lawyer gets here,\u201d the cop said. His nameplate said Bottoms.</p><p>\u201cAre you related to Billy Bottoms?\u201d Parker asked, her voice a little tremulous. Because hell, she was handcuffed! And she was being processed! Holy halos, they were pressing her fingers into ink! For fingerprinting!</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my father,\u201d the cop replied. \u201cI\u2019m Young Billy.\u201d</p><p>She took the wipe he offered and cleaned her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s nice. Your dad.\u201d Please let that show that I\u2019m a good person! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAyuh. Hold this number and look up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you taking a mug shot? I don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d The bulb flashed. Her mug shot had been taken. The cop put the cuffs back on\u2014This is horrifying! the female Holy Rollers whimpered. What\u2019s happened to you?\u2014and led her across the room to the curious stare of the secretary, a middle-aged woman who was talking on the phone.</p><p>\u201cListen, Billy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go by Young Billy, actually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, okay. Well, um, Young Billy, I\u2019m a mother. I would never sell drugs, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelp, you sold a marijuana plant, sweetheart. I\u2019d say that\u2019s selling drugs, mother or not. It\u2019s a little hard to believe you don\u2019t know what pot looks like. Haven\u2019t you ever seen a Bob Marley T-shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was bonsai or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Well. Come on down here, watch your head.\u201d He led her down a set of medieval-looking stone steps into a dank cellar, lit by a flickering fluorescent light. \u201cIn you go. You sit tight. No need to worry.\u201d</p><p>No need to worry? She was in jail. The clanking of a cell door...not a sound she was likely to forget.</p> <p>Little Pup whimpered as the cage slammed closed behind him. Note to self: must not poop on the Evil King\u2019s yard.</p><p>Speaking of little pups... \u201cYoung Billy?\u201d she called.</p><p>His head appeared around the door. \u201cWhat is it, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>At least he was nice. \u201cMy dog\u2019s still at the flower shop.\u201d</p><p>Billy frowned. \u201cAnyone you could call to come get her?\u201d</p><p>Parker thought for a second. \u201cMaggie Beaumont, maybe? She runs the diner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know who she is,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll swing by, ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to tell her? About this? Is it public record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably all over town by now.\u201d</p><p>Great. \u201cWhen can I make my phone call? I get a phone call, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. We have to process the contents of your purse, then we\u2019ll be right in.\u201d He disappeared again.</p><p>She was alone. In a cell. In a basement. Like the place Hannibal Lecter was kept.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The flat monotone voice echoed off the stone walls, and Parker jumped, squeaking, hands fluttering. Oh, God. She wasn\u2019t alone! That was much worse! Someone was in the cell with her\u2014no, no, the cell next to her. Parker looked over, her heart convulsing in her chest. A man. A criminal, staring at her through the bars.</p> <p>She looked away, and fast.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She should not be here. She didn\u2019t know it was pot! Oh, and speaking of pot, Lavinia was growing it! Where was she, huh? Being shtupped by a hirsute man with hidden talents and not available to clear up this misunderstanding! Because if anyone should be in jail, it should be Lavinia.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Why was he chanting that? Like a spell or something. A whimper escaped her throat. She looked around the cell, which was, well, rather spacious, actually, bigger than her bedroom in the cottage. A bunk bed with steel mattresses was on the far side of the cell. A steel toilet with no seat. A steel sink.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Her son\u2019s mother was in jail. The Mirabellis would die! This actually might bring on the heart attack Gianni kept threatening to have. And what if this affected her custody of Nicky? What if he had to live with Ethan all the time?</p><p>No, no. That couldn\u2019t happen. It was an accident. She didn\u2019t know it was pot!</p><p>Nevertheless, Parker had been processed. Processed! What if this got on the news? What if Nicky saw it? Daughter of Convicted Wall Street Baron Harry Welles Arrested on Drug Charges. The Coven would be thrilled. Former Children\u2019s Author Turns to Marijuana. Save the Children would give all the money back. Oh, God!</p><p>If Harvard could see her now. She, who\u2019d never even had a speeding ticket, who\u2019d never done drugs, never so much as inhaled\u2014and at Harvard, please, there should\u2019ve been a special award for that\u2014was in jail.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>And another thing. The man in the next cell was bat-shit crazy, that was clear. Hopefully harmlessly crazy. Then again, he was in jail. Parker swallowed, glancing over again at her...companion. His gray hair was matted, and he looked very, very dirty. Dirtier even than Nicky after a day of making meatballs and sauce with Gianni and Marie. He was still staring at her as if she was a Thanksgiving turkey and he was coming off a hunger strike.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019 Hello. You\u2019re very pretty.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear Jesus. \u201cI love that poem,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. Yes, yes, make friends! In case he was thinking about shivving her. Was that the right term? \u201c\u2018Charge of the Light Brigade,\u2019 right?\u201d Thank you, Miss Porter\u2019s!</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Young Billy was back with her cell phone. \u201cOne call,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her hands were shaking, she noticed. There. Thing One. She hit his number, very, very grateful that she\u2019d saved it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reached James Cahill. Leave a message, and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>No! No no no no no.</p><p>\u201cJames, it\u2019s Parker. Um, I\u2019m in jail. In Gideon\u2019s Cove? Next to the town hall? I, um, seem to have sold a marijuana plant by accident. Could you come here as fast as you can? Thank you so much. Please hurry, James. I really need you to get here. Fast.\u201d She glanced at Young Billy. \u201cOkay. I guess that\u2019s it. Drive safely. But fast, okay? Bye.\u201d She clicked off. \u201cMy attorney.\u201d</p><p>Young Billy took the phone back. \u201cAll righty, then, we\u2019ll bring him right in when he gets here. In the meantime, you sit tight. Want a magazine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Parker whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe got Hemmings Motor News or InStyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInStyle, please,\u201d she said, feeling her lips quiver. The cop handed her a magazine, soft with age. \u201cYoung Billy, is that guy...sane?\u201d She nodded toward the Tennyson fan.</p><p>\u201cWho, Crazy Dave?\u201d Billy asked. Guess that answered that question. \u201cWell, he\u2019s a little off. Hears voices. But he\u2019s harmless. We keep him here once in a while, make sure he eats some dinner. Right, Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Young Billy laughed. \u201cYou bet, buddy.\u201d With that, he left Parker and Crazy Dave alone.</p><p>Parker looked at the clock across the hall from her cell. She\u2019d been in here fourteen minutes. Childbirth had flown by compared with this.</p><p>She thought of Harry, who was in an actual prison, not just a holding cell where the police officer was as nice as pie. Did he have a roommate? Those kinds of details didn\u2019t come up. She\u2019d asked how it was, and his answer was abrupt. \u201cIt\u2019s prison, Parker. How do you think?\u201d</p><p>What that meant, she didn\u2019t know. Gangs? Homemade tattoos? Probably not, as it was one of those white-collar, minimum-security places. But still. Prison was prison.</p><p>Where was James? Why had she insisted that he take today off, of all days? Why hadn\u2019t he answered his cell phone? God, what if he hadn\u2019t taken it? What if it was sitting in his room or on a windowsill? Holy halos, what if he\u2019d gone to Rhode Island for something? It could be hours before he got here! It could be tomorrow!</p><p>Parker noted that she was hyperventilating. \u201cSettle down, settle down,\u201d she whispered, trying to get her breathing under control. Dude, chill, said Spike. It\u2019s jail. You\u2019re just killin\u2019 your number. Great. Now he talked like a gang member.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said a voice. Parker looked up. Crazy Dave had pressed his face against the bars that separated their cells. His eyes were red-rimmed, and his filthy nails were way too long. Like a werewolf\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a little bound up lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. Um, sorry to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that seems to be resolving now. I\u2019ll be needing the facilities.\u201d</p><p>Without turning her head, she glanced at his steel toilet, which was, alas, in full view. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t wish to use that one. Can I use yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Nope. Um, that\u2019s your cell, and this is mine, and I don\u2019t have a key or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d His voice was pleasant. Not as if he were about to shank her.</p><p>Then Crazy Dave pulled down his pants and squatted, and Parker leaped back to the far wall of the cell, grabbed her copy of InStyle and buried her face in great dresses from the 2007 Emmys.</p><p>\u201cYou really are quite pretty,\u201d Crazy Dave said between grunts.</p><p>Where the hell was James?</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cI\u2019LL SEE YOU SOON,\u201d James said into Mary Elizabeth\u2019s hair. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Why don\u2019t you live here?\u201d she asked, smiling up at him. \u201cWe could be together all the time.\u201d</p><p>She always asked, and it always sliced him right open, that question. \u201cWell, I have to work,\u201d he said, tucking some of her curly hair behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cWork here.\u201d Her blue eyes were as innocent as the sky. \u201cYou should work here, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could. I\u2019ll see you soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big present. I want a present, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and walked to his truck.</p><p>Parker had been right. It was good to take a day off. First he\u2019d gone to see Harry, a helluva drive, more than four hours across the state of Maine, just over the New Hampshire line. His boss had been nicely surprised. He looked fairly awful, though, gray-faced and a little slack. The wages of sobriety, at least at first. They\u2019d talked for an hour or so, shooting the breeze, talking about the Red Sox and their excellent fielding, sure to collapse when hopes were high, as usual. Harry had some funny stories about some of his fellow inmates, most of whom, like him, were in for white-collar crimes or too many petty misdemeanors. There\u2019d been a Ping-Pong tournament. Movie night.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t ask about Parker, not directly. About Nicky\u2019s trip, and the progress on the house, yes. But nothing more. As ever, James had the impression that while Harry loved him like a son, the subject of Parker was off-limits.</p><p>Then, on the way home, James stopped by to see Mary Elizabeth, which was always a painfully happy occasion. As ever, she was overjoyed to see him. Luckily, she\u2019d had no other visitors today, because God knew, that made things awkward.</p><p>As he left Mary Elizabeth\u2019s, James checked his phone. No service, that was right. They were in East Boonies, Maine, after all. Still, it was a beautiful place. And only forty minutes from his parents\u2019. But that was a stop he wouldn\u2019t make, though he supposed eventually he\u2019d have to.</p><p>Once back on the interstate, James\u2019s phone chirped. One missed call...Parker.</p><p>Well. That was kind of nice. Maybe she wanted him to pick something up for dinner, as it was now after six. Unlikely, but maybe. They\u2019d been in this war of supreme pleasantness since the night he\u2019d dared to mention St. Ethan.</p><p>He pulled over and listened to her message. Listened to it again. And a third time.</p><p>Well, holy crap. He\u2019d better put the pedal to the metal. Unfortunately, he was still an hour and a half away.</p><p>James couldn\u2019t help laughing as he pulled back on the highway. Parker Harrington Welles, in a holding cell. He couldn\u2019t wait to see it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WHEN HE WALKED INTO the Gideon\u2019s Cove Police Department, it was eight o\u2019clock. James had been on the phone most of his drive, first with Dewey, then with Lavinia, who was out of town herself, then with Maggie Beaumont, who knew everything. James had called the local judge, set up an arraignment, took care of Parker\u2019s bail and left a message for the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cJames Cahill,\u201d he said to the sergeant on duty. \u201cAttorney for Parker Welles.\u201d</p><p>As Officer Dewitt led him down the stone stairs to the holding cell, James could hear Parker...crying? His heart lurched. But no, not crying. Singing? And my God, that smell!</p><p>\u201c\u2018Half a league, half a league, half a league onward,\u2019\u201d someone\u2014a man\u2014chanted.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018All in the valley of Death rode the six hundred,\u2019\u201d Parker answered back.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Forward, the light brigade,\u2019\u201d the man shouted triumphantly.</p><p>She was lying on the steel bunk, an old magazine with a picture of Cameron Diaz covering her face. \u201c\u2018Into the valley of Death rode the six hundred,\u2019\u201d she said, definitely a panicky edge to her voice.</p><p>\u201cYour attorney\u2019s here,\u201d Officer Dewitt said, unlocking the door.</p><p>Parker jerked upright, hitting her head on the top bunk. \u201cJames!\u201d She hurtled across the cell, and before he knew it, she was in his arms, hugging him hard, and though she smelled a little dank from her time in the basement, it was sure better than that other smell, and man, he hadn\u2019t felt anything this good in years, her hair silky against his cheek, her body pressed against his.</p> <p>\u201cParker. Always lovely to see you,\u201d he murmured, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cJames, oh, James, thank God you\u2019re here,\u201d she blurted into his shoulder. \u201cThat man over there, he pooped on the floor, and holy halos, there was so much of it! He hasn\u2019t stopped chanting that horrible poem for hours, and if I don\u2019t stop reciting \u2018Charge of the Light Brigade,\u2019 I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you have to stay overnight,\u201d James said.</p><p>She pulled back, eyes wide with horror.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>Those beautiful eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re a horrible man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m not the drug dealer here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin is growing pot in her greenhouse,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing. Pot, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore on that later,\u201d he said, taking her hand and leading her up the stone stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home. Thanks, Officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, sitting at his desk and picking up a newspaper.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks for nothing,\u201d Parker echoed. \u201cWhat happened to Young Billy? He would\u2019ve come down here and cleaned up that mess, I bet. I only called for you a thousand or so times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how many drunks we get bellowing for us all the time?\u201d the cop said, turning a page of the newspaper. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a drunk! I should never have been in here. I thought it was a fern!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt looked like a fern.\u201d The officer rolled his eyes. Parker turned to James. \u201cIt looked like a fern, James. Or a miniature Japanese maple tree. It was actually quite pretty. And since I\u2019m not a drug dealer and in fact made it all the way to the ripe old age of thirty-five without ever having smoked marijuana or even a cigarette, I can tell you, I had no idea what it was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet a ninety-nine-year-old lady in the nursing home ID\u2019d it immediately,\u201d the cop said.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe she\u2019s a pot smoker! I\u2019m not!\u201d Parker snapped.</p><p>\u201cOkay, settle down, honey,\u201d James said.</p><p>At the term of endearment, she glanced at him sharply. Then she took a deep breath and flicked the cop\u2019s newspaper. \u201cThank you so much for your hospitality, Officer,\u201d she said. \u201cHave a wonderful day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that rich chick, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said, finally looking up. \u201cThe one whose father is in jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuns in the family, I see.\u201d</p><p>She straightened into princess posture and tilted her head slightly. \u201cAnd inbreeding must run in yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Parker, let\u2019s go,\u201d James said. \u201cDon\u2019t get into more trouble.\u201d He took her hand more firmly this time and led her out into the cool, clear night.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get Beauty,\u201d Parker said. \u201cShe\u2019s at Maggie\u2019s\u2014at least I think she is. Young Billy Bottoms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already picked her up. She\u2019s in the truck.\u201d</p><p>James held the door for Parker, and at the sight of her dog, she seemed to melt a little. \u201cHi, honey,\u201d she murmured, burying her face in the dog\u2019s neck. Same as she\u2019d done to him.</p><p>\u201cSo. Jail,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess you can cross that off your bucket list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That and amputating a toe, just for fun.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as he backed out and headed past the diner. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeachy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hug was nice,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer for a minute, though her cheeks flushed slightly. \u201cDid you have to...arraign me or whatever? Put up bail?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Emphatically.</p><p>\u201cAny word from Lavinia?\u201d she asked, looking out the window.</p><p>\u201cI talked to her. Says she wants to grow medical marijuana, fully intended to get a license one of these days. Doesn\u2019t seem really concerned about prosecution. She said she slept with the D.A. back in the seventies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful. So what happens next?\u201d</p><p>James glanced at her profile. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a hearing. You\u2019ll tell the judge that you didn\u2019t intend to sell an illegal substance. Maybe a fine, some community service. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Lavinia will have to give her plants to a licensed marijuana grower.\u201d He was already going through a mental Rolodex to see if he had any friends from law school practicing in Maine who might be able to do him a favor.</p><p>They were home within minutes. Parker jumped out of the truck, Beauty on her heels. The dog had been friendly enough when James had picked her up at Maggie\u2019s house, where she\u2019d been rolling around on the floor with Maggie\u2019s much bigger yellow Lab, but now that Parker was back, he was once again persona non grata.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you something to eat,\u201d James offered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I have to call Nicky,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell him what happened?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look. \u201cNo, James. He\u2019s five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Stupid question.</p><p>\u201cBut first, a shower. I thought Crazy Dave was going to throw poop at me, like the gorillas do at the zoo.\u201d She shuddered, gave him a grin and disappeared into the bathroom. A second later, the door popped open, and for one ridiculous, wonderful instant, he thought she was about to invite him in.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James. For the bail and whatever else you had to do. And for getting Beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said.</p><p>Another smile, and she closed the door, leaving him standing there.</p><p>A half hour later, Parker was down on the dock, though it was now fully dark, laughing on the phone as she told Mr. and Mrs. Paragon about her day in the clink, no doubt.</p><p>Her hair was about the only thing he could see now. It had brightened in the sunlight; she\u2019d been working outside, hacking the long grass, digging up the scrubby bushes that overhung the stairs to the water. She hadn\u2019t complained once since getting the news, hadn\u2019t blinked at the backbreaking work. She really hadn\u2019t even complained too much about spending six hours in a cell.</p><p>Harry would be proud of her, James thought. Or he should be.</p><p>Why Harry could barely tolerate his only child was a mystery. James had seen that unique look of hers leveled at Harry so many times\u2014that jaded, knowing look, the same one she\u2019d given James himself so often, though less lately. But sometimes, when she was looking at Harry, James was almost sure he\u2019d seen something else. A flash of hope. Regret. Sorrow.</p><p>Then again, he knew jack about relationships and people and certainly nothing about fathers and daughters. But if he ever did have a daughter\u2014unlikely, but still\u2014a look like that would kill him.</p><p>Her laughter rang out against the shushing of the waves against the rocky shore.</p><p>Damn Ethan Mirabelli. Parker would smile at James, thank him\u2014oh, yes, she was wicked polite\u2014but she would never let him in her inner circle. He couldn\u2019t blame her, not really. He wasn\u2019t good with kids. His father liked to tell him he didn\u2019t take life seriously enough, disgusted that he hadn\u2019t done more\u2014more what, he wasn\u2019t sure. More penance, probably. He\u2019d done well enough in college and law school, but it wasn\u2019t as if he was brilliant. Once, a professor had written a comment on one of James\u2019s papers: \u201cWell written but lacking substance.\u201d Kind of struck a chord. Then James took a boring desk job for the money, and now he was unemployed.</p><p>James finished his beer and went to the stove. Took some bread, cut a hole the size of a fifty-cent piece in each slice, added some olive oil to the pan, then the bread. Cracked an egg. Toad in the hole. Comfort food for the woman who\u2019d been in prison, whether she wanted his comfort or not.</p><p>As he approached the dock, he could hear her talking. A story, actually. He paused before stepping onto the creaky wooden dock, not wanting her to know he was there.</p><p>\u201cMickey never forgot what it was like to be left out,\u201d she was saying. \u201cFrom that day on, he shared all the calls with Wensley, and in time, Wensley became a great fire truck, too, same as Mickey, and the two were great friends. Mickey was a legend, and all the children of New York knew his story, and whenever he went racing through the city, little kids and their parents, grown-ups going to work, rich people and poor people, police officers and tourists...all would stop and watch as the bravest fire truck there ever was went out to do the job he loved so well. The end.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou still awake, sweetheart? Nicky? I love you, honey.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cHey, Ethan. Guess he was pretty worn-out. Okay. You guys have a great day tomorrow. No, I won\u2019t. I\u2019m a model citizen from now on.\u201d She laughed. \u201cGood night, buddy. Give Lucy a smooch from me.\u201d</p><p>She clicked off and stroked Beauty\u2019s cheek; the dog was lying with her head on Parker\u2019s lap, and gave a little wag. James stepped onto the dock, and Parker looked up.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Thought you might be hungry,\u201d he said, setting the plate down next to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, actually. Thank you, James. It smells great. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToad in the hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet outta town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s the sad truth.\u201d She smiled and took a bite. \u201cGoes great with this sauvignon blanc I stole from Harry\u2019s wine cellar. Want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d He sat next to her, though the rocking of the dock was a little unsettling. Beauty moved closer to Parker\u2019s chair, though not to the other side. Progress. \u201cSo was that the tail end of Mickey the Fire Engine I overheard?\u201d</p><p>She looked up sharply. \u201cYes. How\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHarry asked me to double-check Grayhurst one more time. I found a box in the attic. It\u2019s in the house somewhere. I meant to give it to you before. Anyway, it\u2019s got some of your papers from college. Mickey the Fire Engine, too.\u201d He glanced at her, shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you also read my essay on the significance of language in The Sound and the Fury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassed on that one. Too many big words.\u201d</p><p>She went back to her toad. \u201cMickey was my first manuscript,\u201d she said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sell it to save my life. That copy is the last one. I burned all the others along with the rejection letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was great,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Her voice was wry.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Even got choked up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>James grinned. \u201cWell, there were fire trucks involved. Doesn\u2019t every boy love fire trucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you work in publishing, apparently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the writing coming along?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t hit on the right idea yet. Guess the Holy Rollers burned me out a little bit.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a few minutes. The sky was completely clear, and the stars so brilliant they looked almost like a thin veil of clouds. Taking care not to move too quickly, or to look at her, James reached down and stroked Beauty\u2019s head. The dog allowed it. Taking that as a sign, he decided to go for it.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a personal question, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it that a Harvard grad can\u2019t recognize marijuana?\u201d she said, offering the last bite of toad in the hole to her dog, who took it delicately.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Harry get along?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t move for a second, just let Beauty lick her fingers. Then she poured herself a little more wine and looked up at the sky. Sighed. He could smell her soap from here.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Thing One,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cMaybe he wanted a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cNo.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cSo I guess I owe you a real answer, huh? Since you bailed me out and chose to spend your summer up here, working like an ox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do. I do.\u201d She shifted in her seat and looked at him, then back out at the water. A loon called from past Douglas Point. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. When I was little, I worshipped Harry. I mean, what little girl doesn\u2019t love her dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they all do.\u201d</p><p>Parker took a sip of wine and petted her dog, her hand very close to James\u2019s, though she didn\u2019t appear to notice. \u201cIt was hard not to. He had the whole package\u2014looks, charm, brilliance. If Harry had you in his sights, you felt like the most amazing, interesting person in the world.\u201d</p> <p>James grunted. True enough.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know, it was a long time ago, but he seemed to adore me, too. I used to\u2014\u201d She broke off for a second, not choked up as much as lost in a memory. \u201cI used to go running into Welles Financial and his whole staff would treat me like a princess. And it didn\u2019t matter if he was on the phone or in a meeting, he\u2019d tell whoever it was that his daughter was here and kick them out, or he\u2019d introduce me, pull me onto his lap and then keep talking, like I was smart enough to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what changed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe summer I was ten, I caught him in bed with my babysitter.\u201d</p><p>James flinched. \u201cAh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d She stroked Beauty\u2019s ear, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Parker.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a minute. \u201cKeep that to yourself, okay? Nobody else knows. Well, my mother. And the babysitter, but she was paid off.\u201d She finished her wine. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. Thank you for everything, James.\u201d She stood up, and he lurched to his feet, blocking her path.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cWhat more should there be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Parker. You drop an announcement like that and then hike off to bed?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, just looked at him, her brows drawn together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you for years,\u201d he heard himself say with a sinking sense of dread. Shut up, idiot. \u201cWe slept together once. You could talk to me, Parker. You could...we could be friends.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Chicks loved when you begged. How about if he went ahead and handed her his balls and said, Do what you will. Any second, she was going to smother a laugh or roll her eyes or call him Thing One, and\u2014</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek, her lips a soft, sweet press, her summery dress swishing against his arm. \u201cThank you, James,\u201d she said, her voice softer now.</p><p>Then she stepped around him, Beauty scuttling past, as well, and went up the stairs to the house.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>PARKER LAY AWAKE for a long, long time, Beauty a silky ball of warmth at her side. James didn\u2019t come in for a good hour, and she was glad.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure him out. He\u2019d spent years attached to her father like a remora attaches to a shark. She knew he was here under Harry\u2019s command and on Harry\u2019s payroll, because while her father might not love her, she was his only child, and he\u2019d damn well keep tabs on her. She didn\u2019t appreciate James\u2019s little digs about Ethan, and she didn\u2019t appreciate that sleepy, hot, knowing look he sometimes got around her. The I slept with you look. He\u2019d ingratiated himself to Harry so that Harry couldn\u2019t even visit his grandson without his sycophant tagalong.</p><p>That\u2019s what she used to think, anyway.</p><p>But for the past ten days, James had been a prince. No getting over that. When she\u2019d seen him there outside her cell, her heart had leaped. And not only because he was getting her away from the Excrement King, either. It was because she felt something for him. Something beyond garden-variety cougar lust.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>As for his offer of friendship, well, hell. She thought for one second that she was going to cry. Because though she was pretty good at sounding cavalier and worldly, the fact remained that one doesn\u2019t tell another person about the day one\u2019s childhood died an abrupt death without feeling it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought about Lila for a long, long time.</p><p>It was during what would be her last childhood summer at Grayhurst, though she didn\u2019t know that yet. Lila wasn\u2019t a real nanny\u2014Parker was ten, after all. No, Lila was a Mackerly girl who\u2019d just finished college and came every day to keep Parker company, take her to tennis lessons or swimming in the ocean. Parker liked her a lot...Lila didn\u2019t read magazines or talk to her friends on the phone or pump Parker for details on how much money her family had, like most of Parker\u2019s babysitters. She was twenty-two but treated Parker like an equal. Even when they were drawing fairies and unicorns, Lila seemed to think Parker was cool. She was always up for a swim, no matter how cold the water was. And she\u2019d make fun snacks, too, the kind that Althea would\u2019ve never allowed: s\u2019mores and raw cookie dough and orange macaroni and cheese that, fascinatingly, came from a box.</p><p>Sometimes, Lila would complain about her college boyfriend to Parker, and Parker would be almost breathless with the coolness, the adultness of the conversation. No one talked to her like that. Her cousins had become a closed circle, and her mom was prickly this summer. And Daddy...things were different with him these days, too. Lately, he\u2019d been distracted, less interested in hearing about school trips and grades. Her parents had been arguing a lot lately, so Parker had tried to be at her best\u2014smart, charming, cheerful\u2014then find something else to do. Ten going on thirty, her father liked to say, and she knew it was a compliment.</p><p>At any rate, that particular day was hot and clear, the best of a New England summer, a hearty breeze off the water and the sun baking the air. Althea had gone into Boston for the day to do some shopping; Harry was working in the house. Parker and Lila had been making sand castles on the beach, with moats and tunnels and turrets and everything, and Lila had seemed just as interested as Parker. But after an hour or so, Lila had to go to the bathroom. As long as she was in the house, she said she\u2019d make them a snack, too. Root-beer floats, maybe. Parker would be okay on her own, right? She wouldn\u2019t go in the water.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. Plus, I can swim better than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Lila answered fondly. \u201cBut I had to say it. Back in ten.\u201d</p><p>Parker added some seaweed to a turret. Daddy would appreciate how much time they\u2019d spent on this little fiefdom\u2014she\u2019d only recently learned that word, and she was going to use it, because he always loved when she used words that most grown-ups didn\u2019t know. Yes. This fiefdom would win back his approval, most def. Which would be nice after yesterday.</p><p>Harry had come to her swimming lesson the day before, and they were teaching diving off the high platform. All the other kids had done it, but when it was Parker\u2019s turn, she froze, quite unexpectedly. The water looked so far away, so shallow. How long would it take to hit the water? What if she flubbed the dive? Her legs began to shake.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Parker,\u201d her dad called, his voice already tinged with irritation. Even so, she couldn\u2019t move, picturing the crack of her back as she slammed the water, sinking to the bottom, paralyzed, dying, blood floating in a cloud. Just do it, she whispered to herself. Go. Jump.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t even climb down the ladder herself. One of the teachers had to come up and go down first, his arms gripping the bars around her, his voice kind and reassuring, telling her it happened to him, too, his first time.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. Her father was peeved. She\u2019d stared out the window all the way home so he couldn\u2019t see her tears, listening to a heated lecture on being brave, taking chances, how his valuable time had been wasted.</p><p>Well. Today was a new day. She\u2019d make him forget her cowardice with a few smart words. He always loved that kind of thing. She sat back in the sand. Maybe, if he wasn\u2019t irritated anymore, they might watch a movie or take a sail. Not to be disloyal to her mom, but it was always fun when Althea was away on a shopping trip. Harry traveled a lot, so time alone with him was precious.</p><p>\u201cFiefdom,\u201d she said, so she wouldn\u2019t forget.</p><p>The seaweed flag looked great. She stuck a few more seashells on the side. Perfect. A fiddler crab for the moat, and the thing was really a work of art.</p><p>However, Parker had sand in her bathing suit, and that did not feel very good. Though she wasn\u2019t supposed to go in the water alone, she wasn\u2019t going to sit there with a lump in her suit, either. She glanced up at the house\u2014no sign of Lila\u2014and went to the water\u2019s edge. It was high tide, but the water was calm and flat. No big waves today.</p><p>She went in up to her waist and pulled out the edge of her suit. Much better. Then she went back to shore and waited a little more. The crab wasn\u2019t happy. Would it die if she left it there? She didn\u2019t want to kill anything. She might become a vegetarian, in fact, having recently learned where veal came from.</p><p>Where was Lila? She\u2019d been gone so long that Parker had to pee now, too.</p><p>With a sigh\u2014grown-ups, so irresponsible\u2014she went up the forty-two stairs that led from the beach to Grayhurst\u2019s backyard. Across the thick, lush carpet of grass, onto the hot slate patio, into the kitchen.</p><p>No sign of Lila.</p><p>Parker used the loo\u2014she\u2019d come across that word in an Agatha Christie novel, and it sounded vastly superior to bathroom or, as Althea said, little girls\u2019 room. Another word to drop in front of her father.</p><p>Grayhurst was huge, but to Parker, it was an old friend. Her grandfather had died three years ago, but Parker would try to summon his ghost once in a while, feeling equal parts melancholy for Granddad and terror in case she succeeded. Right now, the house was quiet. Dead quiet, like in that movie Demon Seed that Lila had let her watch, where it got really quiet right before all the killing.</p><p>Feeling the abrupt need to find someone, Parker went to her father\u2019s study. Empty. She headed upstairs. Maybe Lila was sick. Or maybe she wanted to use one of the fancier bathrooms. Besides, Parker wanted to change. Having a soggy bottom was getting yucky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought dawned that maybe Lila was stealing something. They\u2019d fired two people this year for stealing. Parker\u2019s heart sank. The last thing she wanted was to lose Lila.</p><p>She made a deal with herself. If Lila was stealing, she\u2019d tell her to put it back and she wouldn\u2019t tell on her or anything.</p><p>As Parker got to the wing that held the family bedrooms, she heard a noise. A...grunt or something. As if someone was sick.</p><p>There it was again.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Parker whispered. She knew her father was rich and important. Would someone try to kidnap him? Had they already knocked Lila out? This would explain why there were no root-beer floats. Why Parker had been left out on the beach for longer than ten minutes. Both parents were very strict about her being left alone by the water.</p><p>She tiptoed down the hallway. Past her own room, which had just been redecorated and was, in her father\u2019s words, \u201cthe prettiest room for the prettiest girl,\u201d awash in shades of pale green with light pink trim.</p><p>Another sound. She wasn\u2019t about to stop for dry clothes. Not when her father might be hurt or tied up. She\u2019d be brave and save him. She\u2019d need a weapon or something, though. Like a knife. Or a gun. Her father kept guns in his study. One of them used to belong to Teddy Roosevelt. Should she get it?</p><p>Parker\u2019s mouth was sticky and dry, terror nailing her to the floor. Something bad was happening in that room. She knew it. She didn\u2019t want to see it, though. But her father was in that room, and if she went downstairs for the gun, she might miss the chance to save him.</p><p>Don\u2019t be so chicken, she told herself. She\u2019d been a chicken yesterday on the high dive. This time, no. She\u2019d be brave. And smart. She\u2019d peek and then if there were bad guys, she\u2019d run really fast and quietly and call the police and then she\u2019d get TR\u2019s gun, and she\u2019d hold the bad guys off until the police came, and her father would be amazed at her courage, and it totally would make up for her not jumping off the high platform.</p> <p>Her parents\u2019 bedroom was at the end of the hall. There was that grunt again. Oh, God. Her heart thudding, nerves stretched so tight it seemed as if she was floating, Parker opened her parents\u2019 bedroom door.</p><p>At first, she thought they were strangers. Naked strangers, wrestling, that was her first thought. But no, they were having sex. Gross! In her parents\u2019 bedroom!</p><p>Then in a flash that also seemed to last a full minute, she realized that one of the people was her father, moving on top of someone. They were both making those moaning hurt noises.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Mr. Welles, don\u2019t stop,\u201d said the other person.</p><p>It was Lila.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Parker asked, her voice small.</p> <p>The word was electrifying. Both Harry and Lila jumped, scrambling for covers, but not before Parker had seen Lila\u2019s boobies, and her father\u2019s graying chest hair.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Parker, get out!\u201d her father yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I think she peed herself,\u201d Lila said, her face twisted with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d Parker shouted, her face broiling hot. \u201cI did not, you...you...slut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, this is not what you think,\u201d her father said sternly.</p><p>She was downstairs, feet flying so fast she wondered how she didn\u2019t fall, almost wished she would fall, crack her head open on the marble floor, go to the hospital; that would punish them. Down another flight, through the wine cellar that had always creeped her out, into the garage where her father kept his fancy cars. She climbed into the Porsche and curled up on the floor of the passenger seat.</p><p>Hours later, Esteban, one of the gardeners, found her and lifted her out. Althea was back, white-faced with fury and screaming at Harry. She grabbed Parker and half dragged her upstairs, yanked out some suitcases and began hurling clothes inside.</p><p>\u201cAlthea, don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Harry barked. \u201cIt\u2019s not what she thought! She\u2019s read too many books, that\u2019s all. She misunderstood.\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother looking at her.</p> <p>Maybe that was the worst part. She was ten going on thirty, after all. Her father was...what was that expression Lila the Slut used? Throwing her under the bus.</p><p>It\u2019s not what she thought. \u201cBullshit,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cParker, don\u2019t swear,\u201d her father said automatically. \u201cIt\u2019s crass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d she yelled. \u201cIt was what I thought. It was gross! You\u2019re disgusting, Da\u2014\u201d No. He didn\u2019t deserve to be called Daddy. \u201cYou make me sick, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Althea yanked the suitcase closed. \u201cYou had to screw the babysitter. That\u2019s your legacy to your child. Rot in hell, you bastard,\u201d she said. She grabbed Parker by the hand, and an hour later, she and her mother were in a suite in the Devon Hotel, her mother already on the phone with her attorney.</p><p>Parker sat in the bed, ostensibly watching TV. Piercing her heart was an icicle of fear.</p><p>Their family had ended. And her father...her father didn\u2019t love her anymore.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cEVERYONE HAS LEFT US. Everyone. You, Nicky, Lucy and that Ethan. We\u2019re bereft. Bereft, Parker.\u201d</p><p>Parker grinned. Ethan\u2019s mother didn\u2019t believe in Skype, and therefore couldn\u2019t see Parker enjoying the melodrama. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marie. I miss you and Gianni, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur grandson! Six weeks without him! I don\u2019t know if Gianni\u2019s heart can take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ethan will be back soon, Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho takes three weeks for a vacation? And then Ethan\u2019s taking that precious boy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so alone. To think we left Valle de Muerte to be abandoned by our family.\u201d</p><p>Parker bit down on a laugh. She got quite a kick out of the Mirabellis, who\u2019d always been good to her, so long as she could ignore the many, many, many nudges, hints and suggestions on how to raise Nicky and why she should\u2019ve married Ethan\u2014at least that battle hymn had stopped since he married Lucy\u2014and how Parker should eat much, much more.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s new up there? In Maine?\u201d Marie said the word suspiciously, as if not quite certain Maine was a true part of the United States.</p><p>\u201cOh, not too much.\u201d Parker opted not to mention her stint in the clink. \u201cLots of work to do before Nicky gets here.\u201d</p><p>There was a gusty sigh. \u201cYou could come home,\u201d Marie suggested. Parker had told her and Gianni about her father\u2014hard to miss when CNN had done a special on him\u2014and the change in her finances, but Marie didn\u2019t always pay attention to facts she deemed unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I get this house ready to be sold, I\u2019ll be back. Nicky and I will be home at the end of August at the latest.\u201d She had to be; Nicky started kindergarten after Labor Day. All-day kindergarten. The thought caused her heart to spasm.</p><p>\u201cAugust. I could be dead by August.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, true. Well, I have work to do, so I should get going, Marie,\u201d Parker said, having fielded enough guilt for the day. She loved the Mirabellis. She was also very grateful not to be their daughter-in-law and could therefore hang up, whereas Lucy could not. \u201cI\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating enough? You\u2019re too skinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw! Thanks! I\u2019ve gained eleven pounds this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not enough. We love you, sweetheart. Gianni says hello. You know how he is\u2014he won\u2019t talk on the phone. Bye-bye.\u201d</p><p>Parker hung up and went outside. It was two days after her inadvertent drug dealing, and before Marie\u2019s call, she\u2019d been working at improving the house\u2019s curb appeal, mainly by hacking up the roots of the sumac trees and scrubby pines. She\u2019d buy some hanging baskets, since she knew the wholesalers now, and put out some pots of geranium and sweet-potato vine. Who knew? Maybe it would trick someone into buying the place.</p><p>James had been right about her sentence of community service. Yesterday, when the judge had found out that she was a children\u2019s author, he ordered her to do a library program on the Holy Rollers, the favorite books of His Honor\u2019s six-year-old grandchild. Frankly, Parker would rather have spent another day in jail with Crazy Dave (who was out with no fines at all, go figure). Lavinia had been told to file for a medical-marijuana-growers\u2019 license, and would also be having dinner with the judge on Saturday with a possible session of \u201cslapping uglies\u201d afterward.</p><p>As for James, he was on the roof right now, doing God knew what. Looking beautiful, apparently. Killer tan, too, no matter that she\u2019d bought him his own 100-factor sunscreen. His hair was curling from sweat, and the skin on his back glistened. She did love a sweaty man.</p><p>That\u2019s icky, said Golly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll appreciate it when you\u2019re older,\u201d Parker muttered. Yes, she was thirty-five years old and hadn\u2019t been laid in three years. Time to look away. Time to focus.</p><p>Funds were running low. A part-time job at the flower shop was not doing much other than covering groceries. To her own eyes, the cottage didn\u2019t look much better. In fact, it looked worse. The sides were stripped and covered in Tyvek, the shingles having yet to be delivered. The grass, which she\u2019d hacked away at like some Amazon explorer, was uneven, rife with weeds and dry, thanks to a notable lack of rain this summer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much,\u201d James called, reading her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s getting there. It looks worse before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d she said, a bit irked that she was so transparent. An electrician had put in a few more outlets and given them a discount, as he was an old schoolmate of Dewey\u2019s. The bathroom shower no longer leaked onto the floor; the Three Musketeers had come over to supervise her caulking. She couldn\u2019t change the fact that the tiles were pink, but she was working on how to make that look cute and retro, rather than hideous and dated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So this was what house flipping was like. Backbreaking, ever more expensive, built on a frail hope, but kind of fun anyway.</p><p>Especially with Thing One. He was eternally patient with her dopey questions\u2014she hadn\u2019t been able to figure out how to change a vacuum-cleaner bag the other day\u2014and he never made her feel useless, the way Harry did. And when he smiled at her, she felt a rush of something so sharp and sweet, it actually hurt her chest. Add to this the fact that he walked around half-dressed all the time, and heck yeah!</p><p>James knelt down to check something on the roof, then stood and crossed his beautiful arms over his beautiful chest. \u201cPut up or shut up,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cJeesh, Thing One! Such an ego.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut you are fun to look at.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look nice, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on fire. Stunned with lust.\u201d Her beige carpenter pants were grubby, the T-shirt from Gianni\u2019s Ristorante Italiano was torn, and her hair was stuffed under a Yankees baseball cap\u2014one didn\u2019t forget where one was born, after all, and Parker had been born at Columbia Presbyterian, New York, New York, thank you too much. She was sweating like a racehorse and could only imagine the shade of red her face had taken on: beet or boiled lobster. Either way, she was not flushed a delicate pink; she knew that. The bathroom had a mirror, after all.</p><p>Well. She\u2019d cool off with a swim in another hour or so, and hopefully James would be the one ogling then. Seemed only fair. She knew he didn\u2019t like her swimming\u2014he watched her like Nana watched the kids in Peter Pan when she was out there\u2014but she also knew he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her, eleven pounds be damned.</p><p>So. Mutual lusting. Always fun.</p><p>\u201cParker? Oh, dear God, tell me that isn\u2019t you, sweating like an Ecuadoran stonemason.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s eyes widened in shock at the sound of the voice. She turned. Oh, Lord. It was true. \u201cMom? What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Althea Harrington Welles Foster Brandheiser Levinstein was staring with openmouthed horror at Parker, the house, the yard. She wore Jackie O\u2013style sunglasses, a long silky scarf and a white linen suit. The car was a red BMW with rental plates.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Althea said. \u201cThis is what Julia left you? Oh, the old shrew! I\u2019d kill her if she wasn\u2019t already dead! She always made it sound like... Oh, Parker, you poor, poor thing. And that father of yours. I\u2019ll kill him, too. I hope he\u2019s someone\u2019s girlfriend in prison. I hope he\u2019s on a chain gang. I hope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! Wow. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here.\u201d Parker wiped her forehead with her sleeve and walked toward Althea.</p><p>\u201cNeither can I. I\u2019m rather hoping this is a bad dream or a hallucination. Tell me I\u2019m wrong. Tell me you inherited the Pines. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it. It\u2019s all I have in the world, Mother dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. You may as well throw yourself off that dock and hope to drown quickly. The smell in this town! How can you bear it?\u201d</p> <p>Actually, Parker had gotten used to the smell of baitfish. She gave her mother a robust hug, which Althea accepted, daintily patting Parker\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt is what it is, Mom. But what are you doing here? Why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>Her mother removed her sunglasses and gave Parker a level look. \u201cWhen one hears that one\u2019s daughter has been in prison, one hops on the next plane. Apparently, you\u2019re following your father into a life of crime.\u201d</p><p>Parker sighed. \u201cYes, Mother. That\u2019s it exactly. I\u2019m a drug dealer. It wasn\u2019t prison, by the way. It was just a holding cell. And the charges were dropped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a holding cell. Dear Lord, what have we come to? Have you gained weight? You look beefy.\u201d</p><p>Only Althea would call a size ten beefy. She herself had the scrawny size-four physique of the desperately middle-aged\u2014those women who were liposuctioned and implanted and had tans applied and paid a personal trainer to deny Nature its due. \u201cAnd calling me? Why was that a bad idea?\u201d</p><p>Althea stared. She might\u2019ve been scowling, but Botox had frozen her eyebrows into that shiny, plasticine look, as well as given her a permanent half smile, so Parker could never tell.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you could get phone calls, dear. I thought time might\u2019ve been of the essence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was in trouble?\u201d Parker asked.</p> <p>\u201cLavinia tracked me down on Facebook, then called. My goodness, the woman sounds like Yul Brynner on his deathbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you and Lavinia talk to each other? She told me she hadn\u2019t seen you since you were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciated the call, Parker. I\u2019m here because I thought you might need bail money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Althea would never win Mother of the Year, but her heart was in the right place.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d her mother asked, squinting as best she was able. Beauty stood on the steps, not quite ready to defend the place, not quite ready to back down from a stranger, either. Progress, in other words. \u201cIs that a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot, I thought it was a pony. No, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a dog. Dang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarcasm is the lowest form of humor, Parker. Did Harvard teach you nothing? And who on earth is that?\u201d</p><p>James was coming down the ladder. He walked over, all sweaty male glory, and extended his hand. \u201cHi. James Cahill. We\u2019ve met a few times.\u201d</p><p>Althea deigned to look at him. \u201cHave we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. At your grandson\u2019s christening and again on his third birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works for Harry, Mom. He\u2019s helping me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he? How fascinating. Put a shirt on, young man. If I wanted to see a na**d man, I would\u2019ve stopped at Chippendales.\u201d</p><p>James smiled that wonderful, achingly wide smile, causing Parker\u2019s Lady Land to squeeze hot and hard. He gave Parker an amused glance and went off. He did not, she was pleased to see, put his shirt back on.</p><p>Althea huffed. \u201cWell, this ruins my plans. I thought we might spend some time together, do a little redecorating, but I see it\u2019s hopeless. I absolutely cannot stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you could have my room, and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll find somewhere. Surely there\u2019s a B and B around this godforsaken area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burned over the winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall wonder. Well. Give me some time. I\u2019ll see what I can find. Dinner tonight, darling? I\u2019ll pick you up around six.\u201d She put her sunglasses back on and climbed back behind the wheel, then gunned the motor, leaving Parker in a cloud of dust.</p><p>\u201cWhat a happy surprise,\u201d James offered.</p><p>\u201cSo happy,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d he added, \u201cI think you look great, beefy or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not beefy,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was that knowing grin, the I\u2019ve seen you na**d look. \u201cJust...just pipe down, you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Thing One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve pushed your credibility enough for one day. I\u2019m going swimming. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>That shut him up. \u201cNo thanks. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>And as always, she felt his eyes on her as she and her little dog swam through the cold water.</p><p>AT SIX O\u2019CLOCK that evening, Parker heard the purr of an expensive car coming down the road.</p><p>\u201cHere comes trouble,\u201d she said, opening the front door. James came up behind her, smelling of soap and laundry detergent and sun. So good it should be illegal. She could feel his warmth behind her, and if she stepped back a little bit, she\u2019d be nicely cozied up against his\u2014</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cMy next stepfather?\u201d Parker guessed.</p><p>\u201cSweet ride,\u201d he murmured, his breath stirring her hair. And not only her hair. Lady Land perked right up. She cleared her throat and stepped forward a little bit.</p><p>Her mother was sitting in the passenger seat of a chocolate-brown Porsche convertible; at least it wasn\u2019t black or red, so points to the driver for not living the total midlife crisis clich\u00e9. He was blond, maybe forty years old and wore aviator sunglasses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, darling!\u201d her mother called, vaulting out of the car, her half smile as unchanging and disturbing as Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker. \u201cGuess into whom I ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Into whom I ran\u2019?\u201d James echoed. \u201cThat is some very impressive grammar.\u201d</p><p>Althea hustled to the door and, ignoring James completely, whispered, \u201cThis is Collier Rhodes, he owns the Pines, he\u2019s loaded, don\u2019t blow this. Husband material, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you or for me?\u201d Parker asked.</p> <p>\u201cFor you! Don\u2019t be ridiculous! I\u2019m blissfully happy with Maury. Let\u2019s go! Hurry up. I don\u2019t want him to see this pigpen any more than he already has.\u201d She glanced back. \u201cCollier, we\u2019ll be one second! Oh, damn, he\u2019s coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, Mother,\u201d Parker murmured. \u201cHi,\u201d she said to the man. \u201cI\u2019m the daughter.\u201d She was positive the man had already been briefed on her blue blood, education, career and fertility.</p><p>The man removed his sunglasses, revealing very blue eyes. Nice. He smiled. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Collier. I guess we\u2019re neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker Welles. This is my friend, James Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, man,\u201d Collier said as they shook hands.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not her friend per se,\u201d Althea chirped. \u201cHe\u2019s the help.\u201d</p><p>Parker raised an eyebrow. \u201cActually, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Althea interrupted, widening her tightened eyes with great effort. \u201cCollier has been so sweet! I wandered up to the Pines, a little nostalgic, and there he was, and before I knew it, he\u2019d invited us to stay for a few days!\u201d</p><p>Mmm-hmm. A little nostalgic, her ass. It wasn\u2019t surprising Althea had tracked down the town\u2019s biggest landowner. She had a nose like a drug-sniffing bloodhound when it came to rich men.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s having a little dinner party tonight for us. Isn\u2019t that wonderful? So let\u2019s go.\u201d She gave Parker a quick scan and apparently found her dress acceptable, though she unsubtly tucked her finger into her own neckline and made a downward motion, sign language for Show more boob and he\u2019ll pop the question faster.</p><p>\u201cJames, you free? You\u2019re more than welcome,\u201d Collier said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he had other plans,\u201d Althea said. \u201cMy ex-husband sent him to do a little work for Parker, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Parker glanced back at James. His hair was still damp from the shower. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come, James?\u201d she asked, suddenly quite aware that she really, really wanted his company.</p><p>\u201cThe more the merrier,\u201d Collier said enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019d love it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are you sure, Collier?\u201d Althea said, laying a hand on his arm. \u201cJames wouldn\u2019t want to put you out. You\u2019ve already been so, ah, generous with the locals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love him to come,\u201d the man said, his blue eyes blazing. Gay, maybe, Parker thought. \u201cWhat do you say, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d James said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Collier said. \u201cOff we go, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, you simply must sit in front,\u201d Althea said as they walked down the path to the Porsche. \u201cIt\u2019s such a darling car. Parker\u2019s father loves Porsches.\u201d Translation: She comes from money, too.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, Mother. You know what they say. Age before beauty.\u201d Smiling at her mother\u2019s murderous look, she slid into the backseat with James.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>TWO HOURS LATER, James was fairly sure he hated Collier Rhodes.</p><p>Apparently, Collier knew every famous person on the face of the earth, from Lindsay Lohan to the president. He couldn\u2019t stop talking about his famous pals, his money, his career, his travels, and all with such false modesty that it was making James ill. At least Harry was honest about his own self-admiration.</p><p>Maggie Beaumont and her fianc\u00e9, Malone, were here, in addition to Lavinia. And thank God for that, because otherwise, James was pretty certain Althea would\u2019ve locked her daughter in a bedroom with Collier until consummation occurred. Between her references to Parker\u2019s suitability as a bride and Collier\u2019s name-dropping, James was feeling quite homicidal. He took another sip of whatever wildly expensive wine Collier was serving and tried not to roll his eyes as Collier dropped the seventh celebrity name of the night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d said Maggie. \u201cYou actually went rock climbing with Aron Ralston? The guy who cut off his own arm?\u201d</p><p>Collier considered the question. It wasn\u2019t a hard question, but he seemed to need time to answer. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t really notice a person\u2019s disabilities. It\u2019s not my way of seeing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice that he only had one arm?\u201d Parker asked. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a big thing to miss.\u201d</p><p>Atta girl. She was sitting next to James, as ever so close and so out of reach.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m made,\u201d Collier answered thoughtfully. \u201cTo me, we were just two kindred spirits communing with nature. It was the same when Steve and I\u2014Stephen Hawking, that is\u2014were having drinks one time. I mean, yeah, he\u2019s in a wheelchair, but to me, that stuff\u2019s invisible.\u201d</p><p>The invisible wheelchair. Like Wonder Woman\u2019s plane.</p><p>\u201cHow do you have drinks with a man who\u2019s completely paralyzed?\u201d Lavinia asked. \u201cFeeding tube? Straw?\u201d</p><p>Good question, Vin. \u201cGo on, Collier,\u201d said Parker\u2019s mother, staring at her cousin with her creepy frozen face. \u201cTell us about the, ah, climber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that Aron can really fly when it comes to free-climbing. He almost beat me to the summit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so neat,\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Parker\u2019s mother seconded. \u201cCollier, the stories you have! Such a fascinating life you\u2019ve led!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, wait a minute,\u201d Lavinia barked. \u201cWho just said he cut off his own arm? Maggie, are you shitting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not discuss that at dinner,\u201d Althea said. \u201cCollier, tell us about that novel you mentioned. Parker, Collier wants to write a book, too!\u201d</p><p>Oh, kill me now. Just one more reason Collier was perfect for Parker. James closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing you have in common,\u201d Althea said brightly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to hear about my little idea,\u201d Collier said, gazing upon each guest in turn.</p><p>\u201cMost authors don\u2019t like discussing their work,\u201d James offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that, too,\u201d Malone said, giving James a commiserating look. At least James wasn\u2019t the only one suffering.</p><p>\u201cI just read a book,\u201d Lavinia said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cPretty steamy stuff. Written by some Chinese chick. Very dirty. I enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell us, Collier! I know I\u2019m dying to hear about it,\u201d Althea said.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jim there has a point.\u201d That was another thing. Jim. \u201cBut if you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do!\u201d Althea chirped. Malone sighed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Collier said, holding his hands up in mock defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s about this retired Microsoft executive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you?\u201d Parker asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cWell, not really. But maybe. He\u2019s a little like me in that he retired young after making his fortune.\u201d Making his fortune? Did people talk that way? \u201cAnd then he comes across this painting by Picasso. But there\u2019s this code in it, and no one\u2019s ever deciphered it before. But coding is what the Microsoft guy does. His name is Wolfe, Wolfe Shepherd, and he\u2019s the only one who sees that this code is actually a treasure map, so then he embarks on this amazing journey that leads him to the secrets of the Vatican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like The Da Vinci Code,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of it,\u201d Collier said a bit sharply. \u201cI only read literature. Anyway, when the Vatican finds out he\u2019s on the trail...\u201d</p><p>The guy went on. And on. And on. This was hell. Worst of all, Parker seemed totally into it. Laughing, asking questions.</p><p>Then again, he was from the same world she was. Maybe she liked him.</p><p>\u201cBut enough about me,\u201d Collier said. \u201cI was thinking about maybe getting a boat and doing a little lobstering, like you, Malone. Cowboys of the sea, right?\u201d</p><p>James would bet both lungs that Malone had never thought of himself as a cowboy of the sea. For crying out loud.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it that,\u201d Malone said. Maggie elbowed him in the ribs. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Collier said. \u201cHey, you guys want more wine? It\u2019s from a little vineyard I\u2019m part owner in, this sweet place in the Loire Valley. Now, not to brag, but Robert Parker gave this a score of ninety-eight. You can\u2019t get it here in the States, but, well, ownership has some privileges. Hey, Parker, your dad has quite the wine cellar, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHis defrauded investors own it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right. Sorry to hear about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he had it coming,\u201d Althea said. \u201cAlways was a cheater.\u201d</p><p>James glanced at Parker. Her expression was pleasant and composed.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been horribly surprised to hear her story of Harry and the babysitter. He knew how Harry was with women, after all. But he winced at picturing Parker at age ten, walking in on her father. And though his boss had been a complete and utter shit, he could well imagine Harry\u2019s panic on being discovered. Harry didn\u2019t like people knowing he had feet of clay; he tended to fire them if they found out. But you couldn\u2019t fire your kid. It sure explained the origins of the father-daughter cold war.</p><p>\u201cSo you two kids are getting married this weekend?\u201d Collier said, turning those freaky blue eyes on Maggie and Malone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cYou should come! We\u2019d love it.\u201d Malone winced, then coughed to cover.</p><p>\u201cMan, I wish I could,\u201d Collier said. \u201cI have a meeting with my portfolio manager, then have plans to pop down to Maryland to look at a sailboat. But hey! Where are you going on your honeymoon? You\u2019d be welcome to use my place in Aspen. I\u2019ll call the caretaker, and it\u2019s yours. Or New York! I have a little apartment there on Central Park.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow little?\u201d Althea asked. The woman practically had dollar signs in her eyes. \u201cParker loves the city. Of course, she grew up there. You two should get together sometime! Parker, wouldn\u2019t that be nice?\u201d</p><p>James was suddenly aware his jaw was aching, he was clenching it so hard.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Parker said, \u201cI don\u2019t get down there too often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your mom\u2019s right,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWe should! But, Maggie, if you\u2019d like to use it, feel free, anytime. It\u2019s only three bedrooms, but I like it. Minimalist, a little Japanese flair. The view of the park is very nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet, Collier, and thank you,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably go away in the winter, when it\u2019s not so busy around here. But we\u2019ll keep your offer in mind.\u201d</p><p>An older woman James recognized from Dewey\u2019s came out with a platter of something. \u201cBananas Foster,\u201d she said, setting the tray down with a clatter. She groped in her pocket for a match, and set fire to the dish, making Collier clap like a little kid.</p><p>\u201cWe supposed to eat that now?\u201d Lavinia asked. The woman rolled her eyes and began serving the dish once the flames burned out. Rich people. Always looking for more ways to gild the lily.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jamie, I haven\u2019t really had the chance to talk to you,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cChantal says you\u2019re a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d James said. \u201cI worked for Parker\u2019s father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay he rot in prison,\u201d Althea added, sucking down the last of her martini. The cook put a plate of slimy, burned bananas in front of him. Nasty.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a carpenter,\u201d Collier said.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I worked on a construction crew in college.\u201d He met Collier\u2019s eerie gaze.</p><p>\u201cAnd are you and Parker dating?\u201d Collier asked.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no!\u201d Althea cried. \u201cNo, Parker\u2019s completely unattached.\u201d</p><p>Collier looked at Parker. \u201cIs that right?\u201d he asked with a small smile.</p> <p>James stared at the tablecloth. Good question, Parker. You\u2019ve been ogling me since I got here, you worship the Paragon...are you unattached?</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her glance at him, as if feeling his thoughts. He didn\u2019t look up. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m a single mom. Not much time for dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Nicholas is four years old,\u201d Althea said. \u201cHe\u2019s hardly aware of your comings and goings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s five and a half,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James,\u201d Parker murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou have to think of yourself first,\u201d Collier said, folding his hands.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s the other way around. Child first, parent second. In most cases, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Collier shook his head as if coming out of a daydream. \u201cAnyway, Jim, with Harry Welles in jail, you must be looking for a job. Want me to ask around? I know a lot of people.\u201d</p> <p>As you\u2019ve told us. \u201cI\u2019m fine on my own, but thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s James, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you retire from Microsoft?\u201d Althea asked, pushing around her charred bananas.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Collier answered. \u201cI guess I wanted to be more than Bill\u2019s right hand. Not that he isn\u2019t one of my closest friends, right? I mean, just last week, he and Melinda and the kids and I had the nicest time. Have you been to their place? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s getting a little late,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married in two days, and we have a ton to do. Thanks so much for a wonderful night, Collier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always great to see you, Maggie,\u201d Collier said. \u201cBest wishes for a long and fruitful marriage. See you in a week or so. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make a beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>And off went the happy couple. The rest of the dinner guests weren\u2019t so lucky. Althea insisted they stay longer, Vin was working on her third plate of bananas Foster, and Parker seemed to be having a fine time.</p><p>The thing was, the idiot known as Collier was the answer to all of Parker\u2019s financial worries for several lifetimes at least. Richer than God. Richer, perhaps, than Harry had been. And with Althea pushing Parker like a broodmare...</p><p>\u201cNo, she was only in labor for a few hours. Born to be a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Parker said, smiling. \u201cWant to see a picture? Not of childbirth, but of my son?\u201d She pulled out her phone and handed it to Collier.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Collier exclaimed. \u201cWow. What a cute kid.\u201d He slid his finger on the screen to view another shot. \u201cAw, man! Adorable. I love kids.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. The guy was flippin\u2019 perfect. He and Parker should have a double wedding with Maggie and Malone.</p><p>\u201cParker, I\u2019d love for you to stay here, at least for a few days,\u201d Collier said now. \u201cReally! Come on, let me show you the guest suite. Well, it\u2019s one of three, actually. Your mom took the Osprey\u2019s Nest, but the Loon and the Puffin are both available. They have Jacuzzis, too, if you like that sort of thing. Me, I like to start the day off with an early-morning swim, and man, that tub feels incredible when you get back.\u201d</p><p>See? Perfect. The Paragon might\u2019ve been taken, but here was another one, dying to hook up with her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, don\u2019t be silly!\u201d Althea said. \u201cGo see the suite! Go! They\u2019re beautiful! And this is, in a way, your ancestral home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least see what you\u2019re turning down,\u201d Collier said. He stood up and took her hand. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s really pretty!\u201d</p><p>Parker hesitated. James said nothing. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I really have to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shack is not your home, dear,\u201d Althea said. \u201cThis is much more what you\u2019re used to. I\u2019ll come, too.\u201d</p><p>The three of them left the room.</p><p>\u201cYou want another drink, Vin?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d She leaned back in her chair and cracked her knuckles. \u201cYou gonna sit on your ass, son, and let him take your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019d like her to be.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a dark look. She shrugged. \u201cHow\u2019s the judge?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still got it,\u201d she answered. \u201cBeen a few decades, and things have all dropped a few inches, if you know what I\u2019m saying, but he\u2019s still got it.\u201d</p><p>James couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, sweetheart?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are your plans after this summer?\u201d</p><p>Excellent question. \u201cNot really sure, Vin. Gotta find a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. It\u2019s been nice having you back around. You sure were a sad sack back then.\u201d She reached over and squeezed his hand. \u201cI dated your uncle for a while, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was one of those fast-and-furious love affairs, you know? Burned out pretty fast. It was hot while it lasted, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... Yeah. Okay.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia sighed fondly. \u201cOh, good, here they come. I gotta get home and put some Bengay on my back.\u201d</p><p>Althea, Collier and Parker came back into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Collier was saying. \u201cTell me that bathroom didn\u2019t tempt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Collier,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut I\u2019m fine in the cottage. It\u2019s very cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being silly,\u201d Althea said. \u201cBut do what you will! You always do. She\u2019s got her own ideas, Collier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I totally respect,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive these two back,\u201d Lavinia announced cheerfully. \u201cNo need for you to get in the car again, Collier. And hey, thanks for inviting me. It was great to see the old place again.\u201d</p><p>James offered Collier his hand. \u201cThanks for including me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Collier squeezed hard and stared at him with his vivid eyes. \u201cAbsolutely, man.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were back at the cottage. Cute, Parker had called it. Right.</p><p>She was down on the dock with a glass of water, talking to her kid and the Paragon, while James stared at her, his hands jammed in his pockets, from the back porch, irritable as a hungover porcupine.</p><p>He was mad. Jealous and mad and an idiot.</p><p>Collier. What an ass. And Althea, pimping her daughter. And his own stupid self, sulking like a teenager. And Parker, constantly...just...whatever. She was sitting, dog at her side, feet in the water, her white dress glowing in the darkness. God forbid she decide that now was a good time for a midnight swim, because he\u2019d have to go in after her, no matter how good she was. No one should go in the ocean in the dark, alone. Currents, tides, drowning. Daylight was bad enough. Seriously, who the hell swam in the ocean up here?</p><p>But knowing her, she\u2019d do something like that. Midnight swim. Midnight skinny-dipping, even. Yep. She\u2019d take that dress off and jump in, half to torture him, half because she was the type to jump in dark, freezing water and come up laughing. Right before some drunken Masshole mowed her down in a powerboat.</p><p>It could happen. Plus, it gave him the excuse he needed. He was halfway down the stairs before he\u2019d even finished the thought.</p><p>At the sound of his footsteps, Parker stood up, Beauty, too, her tail wagging a little.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Parker said. \u201cEntertaining night, didn\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He only stopped walking when his arms were around her and his mouth was on hers. She made a surprised little squeak, but oh, God, her lips were so soft, and he kissed her hard, too hard, maybe, one hand sliding through her silky, cool hair, gripping the back of her head, a kiss that reached right in and clamped his heart in a fist...the taste of her, the smell of her, her softness melded against him. The kind of kiss that ruined a man.</p><p>Then he let her go, turned around and left her standing on the dock, one hand over her lips, her dog standing at her side.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>PARKER WAS GONE when James woke up at the late hour of 6:38 a.m. the next morning. There was a note next to the coffeepot:</p><p>Early delivery @ flower shop, library thing at 10. If you go out, make sure you shut Beauty in my room, okay?</p><p>Nothing about last night, of course. Parker Harrington Welles was not the type to leave a note saying, Thanks for the kiss, it changed my entire perception of you, let\u2019s get it on, shall we? or Never kiss me again, Thing One. Don\u2019t even look at me. Nope. He\u2019d bet his left nut she\u2019d never bring it up again.</p><p>And look. He was stroking the words as if he was that idiot Romeo, the prince of poor planning, and little Miss Capulet had sent him a lock of hair. Totally whipped. With a hearty sigh, he started making breakfast.</p><p>Parker\u2019s dog was watching him from the doorway of the bedroom. He had yet to convince the scared little thing he wasn\u2019t about to kick her. \u201cWant some bacon?\u201d he said. She didn\u2019t move. He dropped half a piece on the floor and glanced over at her. Beauty wagged her tail and licked her chops but didn\u2019t move from her spot. Another female who wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>Yep. Whipped.</p><p>Well. Nothing a little hard labor and some headbanger noise wouldn\u2019t cure. He went outside, flipped the radio on to the metal station. \u201cDream On\u201d by Aerosmith.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d James said.</p><p>The tin roof was on, the chimney repaired. Time for some deeply satisfying physical labor. Forget the nail gun for now. James picked up his hammer in one hand, a cedar shingle in the other and got to work.</p><p>Too bad his father couldn\u2019t see the tidy job James had done. Of all four boys, James had always been the one most interested in their father\u2019s work. The best at it, too. Tom was a general contractor, like their dad; Matt worked at a factory that made Adirondack chairs, and Pete did finish carpentry. If he\u2019d thought there\u2019d been a chance in hell they\u2019d have come up here, James would\u2019ve asked for the help. Sure. At the end of the day, they\u2019d get a six-pack and take turns flirting with Parker, and his brothers would bust his stones over his crush until their father told them to knock it off, at which point Parker would give him a sweet smile as she passed, and Dad would agree that yes, James was pathetic, and the ribbing would start again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dream on was right. What had his father called him the last time they\u2019d spoken? A slick little bastard. Which had not stopped dear old dad from cashing any of the checks James had ever sent.</p><p>Helping Parker was a way to do Harry a final favor, after all the man had done for him. Not just the healthy salary, either. He\u2019d given James a place in the world when James had had none, given him a father figure, and when your own father hasn\u2019t looked you in the eye since you were twelve years old, that meant something. Harry was the only person James had ever told about Mary Elizabeth, and one of the few who saw him as a loyal, decent person.</p><p>The irony was so thick, James would need an ax to cut it.</p><p>So yeah. He owed Harry. And he owed his own family. He sure as hell owed Mary Elizabeth. And Parker. And her son.</p> <p>But it got tiring, owing everybody everything all the time. Living in a debt of guilt. Trying to look at yourself in the mirror.</p><p>He felt a tickle at the back of his leg and looked down. It was Parker\u2019s dog, standing next to him, looking up at him with those big brown eyes. Her tail gave a tiny, noncommittal wag.</p><p>\u201cHey, Beauty,\u201d he said. She wagged again. \u201cAre you a sweet girl?\u201d She bent her head, seeming to acknowledge that yes, in fact, she was. Very slowly, he knelt down. She didn\u2019t run. \u201cAre you a pretty girl, Beauty?\u201d The wagging grew more constant, though still tentative. \u201cYou got any pointers for me, dog?\u201d</p><p>When James was a kid, they\u2019d had a dog. Brandy, a big old Irish setter. After what happened, it seemed as if she was the only one left who still liked him. She died two years later, and the Cahills had never gotten another.</p><p>Slowly, James reached out to pet Beauty\u2019s head, but just as he almost touched her, a car came roaring up to the house, and the dog bolted, disappearing around the front and down the stairs toward the dock.</p> <p>Collier Rhodes. Why not Jay Gatsby, right? Same overall message. The Porsche purred to a stop, and James threw his hammer down with more gusto than was perhaps necessary and walked over to the driveway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jim! How\u2019s it going here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is Parker around?\u201d</p><p>Why don\u2019t you go step on a rusty nail, huh, pal? \u201cShe\u2019s either at the flower shop or the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d Collier glanced around the cluttered little yard. \u201cThink she\u2019d be interested in having dinner on my boat tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Yep. Lockjaw would definitely improve you. \u201cBetter ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d The guy looked at him for a second. \u201cSo this buddy of mine and I were talking the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian Junger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Though he and I did shoot the breeze at a fundraiser a few years ago. Why? You know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Collier frowned. \u201cAnyway, this buddy of mine happens to work at the SEC.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>James gave him a long look, noting the smug gleam in the alien blue eyes. \u201cI have to get back to work,\u201d he said. He turned and walked back to the side of the house.</p> <p>\u201cDoes she know?\u201d Collier called.</p><p>James didn\u2019t answer, and a minute later, he heard the snug thunk of the sports-car door closing, then the expensive thrum of the motor as Collier left.</p><p>\u201cPOOR LITTLE KITTEN went through the pearly gates into heaven, where there were rainbows and butterflies and flowers and fields, and so many friends! Poor Little Kitten was not poor anymore, nor was she squished from the tractor. \u2018It\u2019s beautiful here!\u2019 she mewed happily.</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 said Spike. \u2018Now, don\u2019t forget, you have to choose a heaven-name.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I choose Princess,\u2019 said the sweet little cat, and all the other cats cheered. With that, Spike kissed the little kitten on her soft, fluffy head, then sped back to earth on his magical roller skates.</p><p>\u2018Her heaven-name is Princess,\u2019 he told the children as their tears dried in the sunshine, \u2018and she\u2019s very, very happy. Now, who wants some angel food cake?\u2019 And with that, Golly, Polly and Molly, Ike, Mike and Spike brought the mortal children to their special tree house, ate cake, and everyone felt much, much happier. The end.\u201d</p><p>Un-fricking-believable that these books had made a fortune.</p><p>Parker swallowed the familiar bile that had crept up her throat during the reading and looked at the assembled children. Collier and her mother stood together in the back, and Lord have mercy, Collier was wiping away tears. Grow a pair, pal, she thought, even as she nodded with a smile.</p><p>James wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Just thinking his name made her heart speed up. But James was absent, despite her note telling him exactly where she\u2019d be. So what was that about? A guy kisses the stuffing out of you, you\u2019d think he\u2019d accept a blatant invitation to come see you. But he hadn\u2019t. And it was a bit surprising how disappointing that was.</p><p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you write Harry Potter?\u201d asked a cute little blonde girl. Judge Freeman\u2019s granddaughter, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey, I didn\u2019t, but I sure love those books, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna go to Hollywood and see the movie of your books?\u201d asked another little girl.</p><p>\u201cNo, not to Hollywood. But my son and I will see the movie, sure. He\u2019s five. Anybody else here five?\u201d</p><p>Several hands shot in the air, and for the next hour, Parker took questions. Which Holy Roller was her favorite? Why did Mike have blue eyes and Ike have brown? Did she draw the pictures? Why not? Was she rich? Why not? Had she ever met Harry Potter? Why not?</p><p>Was she writing more books?</p><p>The little bloodsuckers always asked the hard questions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a little break this summer,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut I\u2019m reading a lot. What are some of your favorite books?\u201d</p><p>There. Truth deferred.</p><p>The truth was, Parker still had nothing. Every day, she\u2019d tried, and yet every idea had been so ridiculous that she couldn\u2019t bear to go on. Fairies, leprechauns, gnomes, dwarves, giants. Farm animals, wild animals, domestic animals. City kids, country kids, kids from the future, kids from the past, kids on drugs\u2014that was going to be a young adult novel, which had petered out after sentence number four. Horses with wings, horses with horns, horses with psychic powers. Wild cats, domestic cats, long-haired cats, big cats, blind cats who formed a penal colony and ruled using their heightened sense of smell.</p><p>Yeah. The only decent things she\u2019d written this summer were the postcards to Nicky, so he\u2019d have something from her every day.</p><p>\u201cWell, kids, hasn\u2019t this been wonderful?\u201d the children\u2019s librarian said. \u201cCan everyone thank Miss Welles for coming in today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Welles!\u201d they chorused, and Parker gave out hugs and autographs. Being with the kids made the Nicky-ache swell, but the hugs were so sweet, given with unhesitating affection. Maybe she could get her master\u2019s and teach.</p><p>At the moment, though, she couldn\u2019t afford to go back to school.</p><p>When the kids had left, Althea approached, her arm through Collier\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cParker, I\u2019m really, really moved,\u201d Collier said, his eyes still wet. \u201cI\u2019m so moved. Wow. That was beautiful! Such a statement of faith and simplicity. Truly touching, Parker. Where on earth did you get the inspiration?\u201d</p><p>A pair. Grow one. \u201cOh, heck. You know how it is, right? I mean, you\u2019re a writer, too.\u201d</p><p>Collier gave a pleased shrug. \u201cI guess I do. Yes. Yes. Hard to put a finger on exactly where ideas are born. The muse strikes when she chooses. Well said. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d Althea put a bejeweled hand on Parker\u2019s bare arm. \u201cLet\u2019s have lunch, shall we? Collier knows a wonderful little place in Bar Harbor. He\u2019s friends with the owner.\u201d</p><p>Of course he was. \u201cActually, Collier, do you mind if I steal my mom so we can have a little time alone?\u201d she asked, smiling up at the guy. \u201cI\u2019m going on Skype with my son, and he\u2019d love to see his mimi\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMimi. That\u2019s adorable. Of course. I understand completely. Your son comes first.\u201d He winked, as if showing her he\u2019d Truly Been Listening last night, then kissed Althea on the cheek. \u201cSee you later, beautiful ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think you have a shot with him,\u201d Althea said as they watched him leave.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want one,\u201d Parker said. \u201cCome on, Mom. I was serious about Nicky. Over here.\u201d She waved to the librarian, who was used to Parker coming in every day, and sat in front of the computer. A few minutes later, she was looking at her son\u2019s beautiful face, his twinkling brown eyes, that adorable nose.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby!\u201d she said, the sight of him filling her with a bubble of joy.</p><p>\u201cI have a loose tooth!\u201d he announced. \u201cLook!\u201d He grabbed his top front tooth and leaned closer to the computer screen and wiggled. Nothing seemed to move, but Parker cooed anyway.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nick! That\u2019s so exciting! Hey, buddy, look who\u2019s here. It\u2019s Mimi!\u201d She slid over and gestured for her mother to get closer to the screen.</p><p>\u201cHello there, Nicky,\u201d Althea said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mimi! My tooth is loose! See?\u201d Again he demonstrated the alleged looseness of the tooth. \u201cGuess what? Daddy got me a knife. I whittle now. I\u2019ll make you a bird, Mimi. Or a worm. A worm\u2019s easier because I\u2019m not too good yet. Also, my knife isn\u2019t sharp. Daddy says he\u2019ll sharp it up when I get better.\u201d</p><p>As her son babbled on, Parker felt almost dizzy with love. Sweet, sweet Nicky. He didn\u2019t think it was strange that Althea rarely visited; it was simply the way it was. Faraway Mimi, Close-Up Nonny, he\u2019d once said.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re such a handsome boy,\u201d Althea said, and her frozen smile seemed to grow a bit. \u201cAre you having fun in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYosemite,\u201d Parker supplied in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYosemite?\u201d Althea added.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great. I\u2019m gonna live here when I\u2019m a grown-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that Althea I hear?\u201d came Ethan\u2019s voice. A second later, his face appeared next to Nick\u2019s on the screen. \u201cHello, you gorgeous creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ethan, you devil. How are you? I hear you got married. Such a shame.\u201d</p><p>Parker rolled her eyes. Ethan had a way with the hot-flash crowd, it was undeniable. Part of his appeal. As her mother chatted with Nicky and Ethan, Parker checked her phone. No messages.</p><p>Not that James would call her. Not when they lived in the same house.</p><p>Not when he was steaming mad.</p><p>That kiss last night...she\u2019d never been kissed like that, just grabbed and...and...owned.</p><p>She swallowed. Hot. It was hot in here.</p><p>\u201cMommy! I found a rock this morning. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Hold it up,\u201d she said. Rocks were Nicky\u2019s thing. Ethan had already shipped a box back home, he\u2019d told her, since clearly Rhode Island didn\u2019t have enough.</p><p>When she signed off from Skype after blowing twelve kisses to Nicky, she turned to her mom. \u201cWant to have lunch at the diner? It\u2019s really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat diner was here when I was a girl,\u201d Althea said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a classic, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s go. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why you\u2019re getting beefy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, beef. You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll get a cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, Parker was eating her beef with gusto as Althea picked at her salad, low-fat dressing on the side. \u201cHow is everything?\u201d Maggie called as she came out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d Parker called back. \u201cUm...aren\u2019t you getting married tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly am.\u201d Maggie smiled.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be doing something other than working?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a low-key thing. How are the flowers coming? Have you started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be beautiful,\u201d Parker said. She hoped that was true. Lavinia hadn\u2019t seemed too concerned over what they were making.</p><p>Maggie checked her watch. \u201cOops. Gotta fly. I have to pick up my dress in an hour. I ate so much last night, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll fit.\u201d She waved and bopped into the kitchen. The woman seemed perpetually happy. Then again, with tall, dark and smokin\u2019 as her fianc\u00e9, why wouldn\u2019t she? Plus, she was a twin, which Parker had always thought would be so cool. A brother, too, Chantal\u2019s husband. Nice, to have siblings. Or so Parker imagined.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back there cleaning,\u201d Althea said incredulously, craning her head. \u201cShe\u2019s getting married tomorrow, and she\u2019s cleaning!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe seems pretty laid-back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker, guess what?\u201d Georgie said, stopping by their booth. \u201cI got a tux. I\u2019m the best man. For Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, Georgie. That\u2019s really great. Are you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit. I\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d He solemnly pantomimed reaching into his pocket and handing over the ring.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got it nailed,\u201d Parker said.</p> <p>\u201cThanks! It\u2019s a nice day, isn\u2019t it? Well, I have to mop the kitchen floor. Bye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, pal.\u201d</p><p>Althea was frowning. Sort of. Must be time for another shot of botulism if Parker could read her expression. \u201cParker, how do you know all these people?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSmall town, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you fit right in, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cI guess. Lavinia helps. I\u2019m related to her, can\u2019t be too bad, that sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Althea shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on, Mom?\u201d Parker asked gently, taking a sip of her milk shake.</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t answer right away, choosing to examine her water glass for smudges. Finally, she spoke. \u201cI thought you inherited the Pines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you might be able to loan me some money.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s head jerked back.</p><p>Her mom sighed and nudged a cherry tomato with her fork. \u201cParker, I know it seems like I\u2019m well-off, but the truth is, I\u2019m not. Maury is, and the shriveled old bastard keeps me on a budget. A small budget. He wants me to look good, so things like clothes and jewelry, that\u2019s fine. Anything else, anything that\u2019s just for me, forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were really happy,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBliss incarnate and all that.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother rolled her eyes. \u201cNo. I was embarrassed. Fourth husband, you\u2019d think I could get it right. But it turns out that he has control issues, in addition to that bowel thing. Honestly, I should be getting hardship pay.\u201d</p><p>Parker set down her burger, appetite gone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave him, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Althea blushed. \u201cI\u2019m sixty-two years old, honey. I need to stay married. How would I support myself? Really?\u201d</p><p>Parker swallowed, her eyes stinging. \u201cI wish you\u2019d told me earlier. I would\u2019ve given you money, Mom.\u201d She reached across the table and held her mother\u2019s hand. Crap. Two months ago, she could\u2019ve given her mother as much as she needed. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cI was holding out hope that Maury and I would be happy again. I was in denial, whatever.\u201d She paused. \u201cAunt Julia told me years ago you were going to inherit her place, and for whatever reason, I thought she meant the Pines. You know I never kept in touch with them once you were out of high school. Then Lavinia called me and said you\u2019d been in jail, and I really did want to help. But I also thought...well. I thought I could leave Maury and start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d really leave him, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s going to divorce me for a younger model, and with that prenup he made me sign, I don\u2019t have much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help there. But you have three ex-husbands, Mom. Didn\u2019t you save anything? And what about the Harrington money?\u201d</p><p>Another huge sigh. \u201cThe Harrington money was gone before I was born. All that was left was the memory of what it was like to be rich and a little set aside for my education. At least there was that. And when this all happened with your father, and I heard about your trust fund, I wanted to kill him, because I know how you gave all your book money to the World Wildlife Fund\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave the Children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing. So now we\u2019re both stuck, it seems.\u201d Althea sighed and rubbed her forehead. \u201cAt least you\u2019re young. Ish. You could probably get Collier to marry you by the end of the year. He\u2019s clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed. Me, I\u2019ll have to look for someone even older than Maury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always...\u201d Parker\u2019s voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI could always what, dear? Become a party planner?\u201d</p><p>She had a point. Althea had never worked, outside of the tremendous efforts she put into husband hunting and wrestling Father Time. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mom. We could figure something out.\u201d</p><p>Her mother snorted. \u201cWell. Being dependent on a man seems to be the way of the world. My world, anyway. Father or husband, you and I have always had some man paying the bills.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cGuess those days are done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. I hope you\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019d feel so much better if you did marry Collier.\u201d</p><p>Poor Althea. She seemed completely unaware of her contradictions. Being dependent on men had gotten her where she was, but she wanted the same thing for Parker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Mom. I\u2019m doing okay. I can get a job, I have a great education, and I\u2019ll even have a little nest egg when I sell Julia\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shack.\u201d</p><p>Althea nodded. \u201cI do have a little squirreled away, honey. If you need it. If Nicky needs it.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s heart softened in a rush. \u201cThank you, Mom. But we\u2019ll be okay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Althea opened her eyes. \u201cYes. You always were a tough little customer.\u201d She smiled more broadly. \u201cAnd Collier is definitely interested, if you need a backup plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a type, dear?\u201d</p><p>An image of James grinning at her, all dark hair and tanned skin and sweat and smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want more children, you\u2019d better get on it. Those eggs don\u2019t last forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the reminder.\u201d Parker couldn\u2019t help a laugh, and after a second, her mother smiled.</p><p>\u201cI only want what\u2019s best for you, Parker. Whatever that might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back at you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Underneath the table, her mother\u2019s foot nudged hers. It was the most genuine gesture of affection Parker could remember. \u201cDo you want to stay here?\u201d she asked. \u201cNicky\u2019s coming up a week from Sunday. He\u2019d love to spend time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, honey. I need to get back and see what I can squeeze out of that cadaver before he serves me with divorce papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeesh, Mom.\u201d Parker laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I have a flight out of Bangor at six. Tomorrow\u2019s our charity fashion show. I\u2019m walking the runway. Can you believe it? Part of the tryouts for Real Housewives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were afraid Maury\u2019s divorcing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with the show, sweetheart? Half those marriages are shams. More than half, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, good luck,\u201d Parker said, grimacing. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gown. Feathers. It\u2019s a Christian Siriano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who that is, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I claim you as mine.\u201d Althea stood up. \u201cLunch is on me, darling. Back to the coal mines. Don\u2019t marry an older man, Parker. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was properly laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to Lavinia. The woman is a walking sex education.\u201d</p><p>Althea smiled. \u201cShe always was. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by her shop. Well, take care, darling.\u201d She air-kissed Parker on each side, but Parker pulled her bony little mother against her and hugged her properly, getting a little contact high on Chanel No. Five.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Althea squeezed her back. \u201cI love you, too, honey. By the way, Pilates will do wonders for that little tummy of yours. And trust me, in five years, this\u2014\u201d she pinched Parker\u2019s ass \u201c\u2014will be three inches lower than it is now. Tempus fugit. Bye! I\u2019ll call soon.\u201d</p><p>Bemused, Parker watched her mother leave, seemingly resigned to her fate with Maury. For the moment, anyway. Odd, that she\u2019d come to Parker for help. Odd, but nice.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>\u201cDON\u2019T KNOW WHY your panties are in such a twist,\u201d Lavinia said a few hours later. \u201cIt\u2019s not your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I like Maggie. And Malone.\u201d She wound a blue ribbon around the stem of a bouquet, fingers flying.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cJust don\u2019t see what\u2019s so awful about them there.\u201d She gestured toward the Teleflora book, circa 1972, at the arrangements she\u2019d told Parker they\u2019d be reproducing.</p><p>\u201cOrange chrysanthemums, Vin? We\u2019re not doing orange chrysanthemum centerpieces. Trust me. We can do gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for three hundred bucks, it\u2019s gonna be only so gorgeous.\u201d Lavinia did her trademark stub-out, and while Parker\u2019s own hands had developed some calluses these past couple of weeks, the sight of ciggie against palm still made her flinch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be gorgeous. You\u2019ll see. Get here early, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell I\u2019m getting up at 5:00 a.m., Parker. I got a date with His Honor tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure what he\u2019s doing is illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is, all right. In some states.\u201d</p><p>Parker laughed. \u201cI meant, making you go out with him instead of fining you for growing pot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedical marijuana, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014without a license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Parker. I\u2019m just scraping by with the flowers. Figured the pot would help. I\u2019m hardly a drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s me.\u201d Parker set down the flower-girl bouquet and started on the bridesmaid\u2019s.</p><p>Vin laughed. \u201cLook at you, Miss Busy Bee. Want my help with anything?\u201d</p><p>Parker straightened up and looked around. The shop was a mess. \u201cYou can do the boutonnieres, okay? A little bitty sprig of hydrangea, and a piece of ivy, like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can make a boutonniere, Parker,\u201d her cousin said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in business for thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Sorry, Vin.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia gave her a grudging smile. \u201cAh, well. I admit...you\u2019re not half-bad at this.\u201d</p><p>By four o\u2019clock, Parker\u2019s back was aching, and they still had miles to go. But Lavinia was growling about the judge, and honestly, everything that could be done today was done. She\u2019d take care of the rest in the morning.</p><p>\u201cVin, you go ahead. You have a date. I\u2019ll clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more of a sex date. What do you kids call that these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooty call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my eyes are wide open. Men would f**k a fur-lined knothole, you know what I mean? I\u2019m just glad to be getting a little some-some at my age.\u201d</p><p>Parker grinned. \u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re related,\u201d she said honestly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good cousin,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cNot much like your mother, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat branch of the family never got over being rich. We had more practice, over on my side. Ah, well. Gotta go pluck some hairs and shave my legs,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cThanks, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p> <p>Parker cleaned up the mess of stems and bits of blossom and ribbon, then swept the floor. Admit it, Spike said, stubbing out a ciggie the same way Lavinia did. You\u2019re avoiding him.</p><p>It was true.</p><p>James was five years younger than she was. Did he want a serious relationship with a single mom, or a roll in the hay? Did she want more? James always seemed so much like Harry...slick, insincere. Parker, always lovely to see you. She couldn\u2019t help feeling as if he was mocking her, that lifted eyebrow, that gleam in his eye. His compliments on her books always stung a little, as if she didn\u2019t already know they were nauseating and fake.</p><p>And yet, James had spent the past two weeks working like a draft horse. There had been moments between them, sure. Chemistry and all that. But the truth was, she really didn\u2019t know what kind of a man he was, and...</p><p>She paused in her sweeping, a little surprised at the thought that was forming in her brain.</p> <p>...and if James ever found out just how lonely she really was, it would be horrible.</p><p>Because nobody knew that.</p><p>She wanted a husband. She wanted more kids, maybe, and yes, she was thirty-five. She wanted someone who loved her the way Ethan loved Lucy, who looked at her the way Malone looked at Maggie, and let\u2019s be honest. She\u2019d never had anything even close.</p><p>James was here under orders from her father. He wanted her, sure. But Nicky was coming in nine days.</p><p>Well. She couldn\u2019t avoid him forever. She locked up the shop and headed for home. The Volvo was comforting, the smell of Goldfish crackers and old leather, the indentation in the backseat from Nicky\u2019s booster, reminding her who she really was.</p><p>A mom. With a sigh, she pulled into the driveway.</p> <p>James was shirtless, sweaty and doing stuff for her house. Parker\u2019s knees weakened. He\u2019s beautiful, said Golly. \u201cPreach it, sister,\u201d Parker muttered. She forced her attention to the house. Her purpose in being in Maine, after all. Flip the house. Earn a little money for a place back home.</p><p>She dragged her eyes off Thing One\u2019s arms, those lean, muscular, capable arms that had crushed her against him last night, a kiss so fierce and angry and hot that\u2014House, Parker, house!</p><p>James had reshingled the entire western side of the house. For now, the color was creamy-cedar, but the salt winds and water would turn the shingles to gray. He didn\u2019t look up as she got out of the car, but Beauty came bounding over, her plumy tail wagging, her nose cool against Parker\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cWow, Thing One. You\u2019ve been busy,\u201d Parker said as she bent to pet her little dog. Yes. Adopt a casual attitude. Definitely the way to go. \u201cIt looks great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Still no eye contact.</p><p>Beauty lay down in the grass and put her muzzle on her paws, watching the two humans avoid meaningful conversation.</p> <p>\u201cSo the library thing was kind of fun, as debts to society go,\u201d Parker said, reaching out to touch a shingle with one finger.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Bang! The sound of the air gun made her jump. James bent\u2014his ass...perfect\u2014and picked up another shingle. Bang!</p><p>\u201cCollier was there,\u201d Parker said. No comment. \u201cI reduced him to tears as the Holy Rollers helped bury the squashed kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sensitive soul.\u201d Bang!</p><p>Was James jealous? Please, she wasn\u2019t that desperate. Still, perhaps clarification would be in order. \u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s very nice and all, but I don\u2019t think I could be friends with a man who took those books seriously.\u201d</p><p>No comment. His neck glistened with sweat.</p><p>\u201cSo, James, you kissed me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bang!</p><p>Parker reached out and put a hand on his warm, hard shoulder. \u201cWould you please stop for a second and talk to me?\u201d</p><p>He put down the nail gun and folded his arms across his chest and looked at her with those dark, dark eyes. No smile. It was a little intimidating. In a very hot way. In a smoldering, brooding, alpha way. Heck yeah!</p><p>\u201cPut a shirt on, Thing One. Cover up all that male beauty and stop distracting me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that, and crap, it was worse than ever, because that smile melted her, and the idea that she could make him look that happy had her heart swelling. It felt good, earning that smile. James obeyed, getting his T-shirt from the railing of the porch and pulling it over his head. \u201cThere. Can you think straight now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she said. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. I kissed you.\u201d He stared at her, the wind ruffling his thick hair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cAnd while it had a certain effect, I don\u2019t think it should happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it should.\u201d</p><p>Bang! No nail gun this time, just her rabbity heart. Nine days. Nine days till her son came back. \u201cWell, things are uncertain in my life, as you\u2019re aware, and even though you\u2019re very cute, and yes, we\u2019ve done the deed before, it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Not sure, actually. \u201cUm...it just is.\u201d</p><p>A smile began at the corner of his mouth and spread slowly. Parker\u2019s skin actually broke out into goose bumps. Get a grip, Parker, she told herself.</p><p>Fling! Fling! Fling! chanted Lady Land.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCould be, Thing One. Or it could be that I\u2019m smart. Either way, not gonna happen again. Okay? I\u2019m flattered, and as I said, you\u2019re quite cute, but no. Thank you. Now, I\u2019m going inside to start painting your bedroom. Can I get you a drink of water?\u201d</p><p>The smile was full-blown now. Devastating smile. Two more seconds of that smile, and James would find himself flat on his back with her on top of him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great, Parker. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She stood there another second. How could she have thought he looked sulky and brooding when he had the most wonderful, open, generous, happy, genuine smile in the whole world?</p><p>Crikey.</p><p>\u201cOne ice water, coming up for my hardworking boy.\u201d She smiled, too\u2014See? We can get along just great!\u2014and went inside, stuck her head in the freezer and told Lady Land to pipe down.</p><p>An hour later, Parker paused outside James\u2019s bedroom, which would soon be Nicky\u2019s bedroom. His was the last room to be painted.</p><p>She\u2019d discovered that she loved painting rooms. Painting was good for the soul. It was soothing and exciting both, the invigorating smell and luscious texture of the paint, the hissing of the roller as she zipped it against the walls. Pulling off painter\u2019s tape, the revelation of the perfect line, the tidiness of it all, had become one of the great thrills of her life. Pathetic but true.</p><p>She\u2019d chosen a very pale green for her bedroom\u2014Sage Mist\u2014and repainted the trim bright white. Amazing how it perked up the room. Her quilt was green, blue and pink, and the other day, Maggie had taken her to World of Curtains\u2014Maggie was moving in with Malone, who had no curtains, which both women had found stunning and inexplicable. Parker had found some pale green drapes a shade or two lighter than her walls, lined with pink, and they were eighty percent off. Bargain shopping, another new experience for Parker, was also proving quite thrilling.</p><p>The kitchen was a nice sunny-yellow\u2014Northern Sunrise\u2014the battered cupboards much improved by a glossy red. With the Formica-and-steel table and the funny yellow chairs, it now looked pretty nice\u2014if you could overlook the linoleum, which was the color of dried blood. A new\u2014and cheap\u2014floor was next on her list.</p><p>Maggie had had a tag sale a few days ago, so there was finally a little furniture in the living room\u2014a couch and a pretty nice-looking Mission-style chair. One day, while out walking Beauty, Parker had come across a great hunk of bleached driftwood and hefted it home as the dog tried to chew on it. Ordered a piece of beveled glass from the boys at the hardware store, and voil\u00e0. A coffee table was born.</p><p>The shack was becoming pretty cute, and completely unrecognizable from the hoarder\u2019s hell she\u2019d first seen.</p><p>It was almost too bad she had to sell it.</p><p>At any rate, it was time to paint James\u2019s room.</p><p>It felt extraordinarily intimate, for some reason, opening his door. Also, her father\u2019s snake was in there. She paused, then went back to the kitchen, where she could see him through the open window. \u201cI\u2019m going to start painting your room now,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to move your p**n o stash first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all up here,\u201d James said, tapping his temple.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Hope your diary\u2019s not open. I\u2019d hate to see how you yearn for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly a secret,\u201d he said, his tone cheery, his smile killer.</p><p>\u201cIs Apollo\u2019s cage locked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is.\u201d Then he hefted the ladder, his biceps bulging most attractively, and moved past the window.</p><p>Lady Land was getting downright hostile. She sighed, then went back down the hallway.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been in here since Day One. It contained almost nothing: bed, night table, battered old bureau, the glass tank containing her father\u2019s beloved. Had she mentioned the bed? A sudden image of James\u2019s tanned skin against the white sheets made her mouth dry. Down, girl. On the night table was a battered paperback by Harlan Coben. A clock.</p><p>The room was as neat as a pin; neater than her room, which always seemed to have a towel or a pair of shoes lying around somewhere, no matter how she tried to keep it tidy. His room was like a monk\u2019s quarters. No p**n o stash anywhere that she could see. She got a towel from the bathroom and draped it over Apollo\u2019s tank so she wouldn\u2019t have to see the creature.</p><p>There was a single framed photo on the bureau. Parker went over and picked it up. It was of James hugging a woman with dark hair. The woman\u2019s face was buried in his shoulder, but Parker could see enough of her face to tell that the woman was laughing. James was smiling, his chin resting on the woman\u2019s head, his eyes crinkling. A happy, happy picture.</p><p>Had James ever been married? The thought lanced Parker with an abrupt arrow of shame. She\u2019d never asked. Was he divorced? A widower? Or was this laughing woman his sister? He had mentioned a sister, as well as three brothers, but Parker couldn\u2019t see enough of her face to tell if they looked like each other.</p><p>But she could see that the woman had curly hair, beautiful skin and that she loved James. And he loved her back.</p><p>Very carefully, she put the picture back and started on the taping. When she was done with that, she pulled the bed away from the wall. There was hardly enough room to get past, as James\u2019s room was significantly smaller than her own. A thought occurred to her. \u201cHey, James?\u201d she called, going back into the hallway. He was right there, and she jumped back. \u201cOh. You\u2019re in. I thought you were, um, still outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna shower and head for Dewey\u2019s,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Malone\u2019s bachelor party,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cRight. I knew that.\u201d Too bad they couldn\u2019t shower together. Save time and all. Wet, naked, soapy James and her own wet, na**d self\u2014holy halos, Batman. Her knees softened, then thunked into place, locked. Great. She was staggering without even taking a step. \u201cWell, have fun, Thing One.\u201d Her voice was brisk. \u201cDon\u2019t drink and drive, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do.\u201d He leaned against the wall and looked at her. He hadn\u2019t shaved today. He was still fairly baby-faced, in fact, not one of those men who could grow a beard in a couple days, like Malone or, um, what\u2019s-his-name. Ethan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did you need?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>What indeed.

So maybe you should sleep at your uncle\u2019s house. Or on the couch. Or something.\u201d Your bed is pretty big, Parker, the Holy Rollers pointed out. Great.

It\u2019s all good.\u201d You babble when you\u2019re nervous, the HRs noted. \u201cThanks,\u201d Parker added, then closed her eyes. \u201cSo who\u2019s the woman in the picture?\u201d She inclined her head toward his bureau.</p> <p>\u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>Oh, goody. Sister. Not wife. \u201cYou guys are close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His mouth pulled up on one side, and her knees wobbled again.</p><p>\u201cWell. You have fun tonight, James.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and went past her, and the brush of his arm against hers was enough to make her entire side tingle.</p> <p>Fling.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>JAMES WAS POSSIBLY a little bit drunk.</p><p>The thing was, he never really could hold his liquor. His father and brothers, man, those guys could pound beers like coal miners or teamsters or some other group who drank a lot of beers. And these lobstermen, damn, they were drinkers, too. But James had been working in the hot sun all day; he hadn\u2019t slept much the night before because of that kiss, and he might\u2019ve been pretty dehydrated and fairly exhausted before those beers hit his system. Three beers, one cheeseburger, a very loud bachelor party with guys making toasts to things like \u201cnot being a priest\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s desserts\u201d and stuff like that.</p><p>Jonah, the brother of the bride and Chantal\u2019s husband, lucky bastard, was sitting next to him, talking about nothing the way men do\u2014why Boston could beat the Yankees in practically every game this season yet still be in third place. Guy stuff. Same sort of nothing James talked about with his buddies in Providence.</p><p>All in all, James felt slightly dizzy, pretty foggy and generally happy. \u201cI got a question for you, Jonah,\u201d he said, watching as Malone won another game of pool. \u201cHow\u2019d you get Chantal to marry you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGot her pregnant,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I kept bugging her till she said yes. Why? Oh, hang on a sec. Georgie\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d James said, possibly slurring a little, \u201cI have a thing for this woman, right? A big thing. But it\u2019s like her heart is...I dunno. Made outta Plexiglas. Stuff bounces off Plexiglas, right? And that shit\u2019s hard to break, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you are whipped,\u201d a female voice said. James blinked. He thought he\u2019d been talking to Jonah, but this was not Jonah next to him. No. It was a woman. A very, very, veryveryvery beautiful woman who could even give Perfect Parker a run for her money. If you liked black-haired, blue-eyed Liv Tyler type of princesses, that was. Which guys did.</p><p>And you know what? He was a guy. Who probably should look for a woman whose heart wasn\u2019t made out of Plexiglas. She looked like...what was that thing that turned into a seal? Mary Elizabeth loved that book. A selkie. That was it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m James. You are so beautiful, I shouldn\u2019t even look directly at you or I might go blind.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, growing even more beautifuller, if that was a word. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Emory. Malone\u2019s eighteen-year-old daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I take it back and apologize, and if we could pretend this conversation never happened, that\u2019d be great.\u201d He looked at her glass. \u201cAlso, I hope that\u2019s soda, because I\u2019m an officer of the court.\u201d Yep. Drunk.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s root beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here? Aren\u2019t women banned from these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I hardly get to see my dad, so I got to come. Dad! Come over here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d James said, but Malone turned, his eyes locking on James in an unmistakable look\u2014If you touch my daughter, I will kill you, cut up your body and use it as bait. James shoved his chair a little farther away from the Liv Tyler selkie thing as Malone approached.</p><p>\u201cIs he bothering you?\u201d Malone growled.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d James said. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not. Absolutely not. I barely even know her. Besides, I like someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather dear, James was telling me his romantic woes. He\u2019s in love with someone who doesn\u2019t love him back. It\u2019s really tragic.\u201d</p><p>Malone\u2019s face creased a little. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d James asked. Malone here was psychic or something. Cool.</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Parker, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! Parker,\u201d James said, nodding. Nodding made him feel a little sick, so he stopped. \u201cYou guessed? Is it really obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>Okay, here was a guy who had spoken maybe three sentences that James could remember, but he was marrying the cutest girl\u2014woman\u2014in town. There was Jonah, who wasn\u2019t even as old as James, and he\u2019d dated and mated Chantal the Delicious.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d you do it, man?\u201d James asked. \u201c\u2019Cuz I\u2019m trying my best, and she doesn\u2019t seem to even notice. Her heart is like Plexiglas. Or cement. Something really hard, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeezum crow,\u201d Emory said, taking a sip of her soda. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a puppy being put to sleep. Help him out, Malone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Help me out, Malone,\u201d James said. \u201c\u2019Cuz you got Maggie, who\u2019s so cute.\u201d Another glare from Scary Lobsterman Guy. \u201cSorry. She\u2019s not. I mean, she is... I\u2019ll stop now. Good job, is what I meant to say.\u201d</p><p>Emory laughed. \u201cYeah, well, it wasn\u2019t that easy, James. My dad was as pathetic as you are. Right, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Malone took a sip of his beer. \u201cAyuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo whatja do?\u201d James said.</p><p>Malone shrugged. \u201cWaited her out, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Emory shoved his shoulder. \u201cHe didn\u2019t wait. He kissed her, and according to her, he\u2019s a great kisser, which made me throw up in my mouth. I mean, ew! We have to have a talk about boundaries, since she\u2019s gonna be my stepmother and all. And why anyone would want to kiss that ugly mug...\u201d</p><p>Malone slid his arm around his selkie\u2019s shoulders and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI tried the kissing,\u201d James said. \u201cDidn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Malone grinned. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>James leaned back in his chair and pretended to fire a pistol at Malone. \u201cGood advice, partner,\u201d he said, just before the chair tipped over.</p><p>An hour or so later, James followed his uncle upstairs to the little apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou have fun, kid?\u201d Dewey asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d James answered. \u201cThanks for letting me crash here.\u201d He\u2019d switched to water after Beer #3 and was feeling much improved.</p><p>\u201cYour mom called today,\u201d Dewey said, pulling a blanket out of the closet and handing it to James.</p><p>So much for feeling improved. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Worried about you. She saw something on the news about your boss and whatnot. Figured out you\u2019re unemployed.\u201d</p><p>James nodded. \u201cI paid Beckham for the next few years. She doesn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p>Dewey folded his arms across his massive belly. \u201cI think she was worried about you, Jamie. When was the last time you saw them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Well, they\u2019re your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>His uncle sighed. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, kid. And for whatever it\u2019s worth, you\u2019re welcome to stay here as long as you need. Wouldn\u2019t mind having you around more. You were always my favorite nephew.\u201d</p><p>James gave a halfhearted smile. Staying was a nice thought. Find a sweet, easygoing girl, do some blue-collar job. Carpentry, maybe. Those options, however, had died when he was much younger. \u201cThanks, Unc. But I can\u2019t. Gotta make the big bucks. Or at least as big as I can manage.\u201d</p><p>Dewey nodded. \u201cRight. Well. You\u2019re a good kid, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>He probably wouldn\u2019t. The clock was ticking on getting a real job, taking care of his responsibilities. He couldn\u2019t play house with Parker forever, and the thought of leaving her, of not seeing her anymore\u2014ever, maybe\u2014made his chest hurt.</p><p>Tomorrow, he\u2019d be helping Dewey set up for the wedding, basically transporting the bar over to the town green, serving drinks, cleaning up. Parker would be doing the flowers and whatnot.</p><p>It occurred to James that the last time he\u2019d been at a wedding with Parker, they\u2019d ended up in bed.</p><p>A guy had to wonder if he might get that lucky again.</p><p>As he lay there on Dewey\u2019s lumpy couch, James felt the beginning of a smile. Weddings had always been good to him.</p><p>Maybe there was reason to hope tomorrow\u2019s would be, too.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>PARKER WOKE UP at five\u2014the curse of a parent. Nicky had always been an early-to-bed, early-to-rise kind of kid. He could sleep through fireworks, thunderstorms and alien invasions, but he was bright eyed and bushy tailed long before the sun came up.</p><p>Well, the one small benefit of having him with Lucy and Ethan for three weeks was that at least she didn\u2019t have to answer his endless stream of questions before having two cups of coffee. She stretched, and her little dog did the same.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d Parker whispered, petting the dog\u2019s silky head. She\u2019d have to make sure Nicky understood how shy Beauty was, as the little guy tended to charge toward whatever caught his fancy. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sweet to Nicky, right?\u201d Parker asked the dog, and Beauty\u2019s tail gave a slight wag.</p><p>Today was the wedding, and she had a ton to do. She got out of bed, pulled on jeans and a Joe\u2019s Diner sweatshirt\u2014because prior to this month, she hadn\u2019t owned a sweatshirt, for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>James wasn\u2019t on the couch; Parker figured he must\u2019ve opted for his uncle\u2019s place instead.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d found some cute woman who didn\u2019t have so many hang-ups and suspicions. That was a definite possibility. Sure, he\u2019d kissed her the other night. And she\u2019d told him not to do it again.</p><p>You really need to figure out what you want, Spike advised sagely.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d she told him.</p><p>When the coffee was finished brewing, Parker filled a travel mug, clipped a leash on Beauty and got into her car. She drove through the silent town, past the lovely brick town hall, the more modern and uglier police station, where she\u2019d been a guest. Across the diner was a paper banner\u2014Congratulations, Maggie and Malone!</p><p>The couple was getting married by a justice of the peace right on the town green, in the little gazebo next to the flagpole and war memorial. A potluck reception\u2014Parker had never been to one of those\u2014would be held under the white tent. The tables and chairs were already there, Parker could see, though not yet set up.</p><p>They might not have much in the way of a flower budget, and Maggie was definitely a casual bride, but there was something really touching about the two of them\u2014lovely, outgoing Maggie and the quiet, honorable Malone\u2014and Parker wanted to make their day beautiful. Going to all those wildly expensive, over-the-top weddings of her cousins and family friends and college mates...well. She knew something about floral arrangements.</p><p>A short way out of town she pulled off the road. A field rich with lupine was just past the scrubby pines that lined the road. Parker had never seen the cone-shaped wildflowers in bloom before, but last week, she\u2019d nearly driven off the road at first glimpse.</p><p>She pulled over, got a few buckets out of the back of the Volvo and started cutting.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>BY THREE O\u2019CLOCK that afternoon, Parker was finally satisfied. Everything looked...well, stunning; she really had to give herself credit here.</p><p>The gazebo was twined with garlands of ivy and hydrangea blossoms, most of which she\u2019d, er, appropriated from a lush bank at the edge of the Pines property. Collier wasn\u2019t around, but Parker figured that he wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014or even notice. On the wide steps leading into the gazebo were two huge arrangements of pine, lupine, twigs and more ivy and phlox, a riot of color and deep, dark green. Parker had filled eight tin buckets with smaller versions of the arrangements and set them out at intervals along the makeshift aisle.</p><p>Inside the tent, she\u2019d strung up fairy lights; Vin had had some in a closet, and last week, Parker had emptied a going-out-of-business craft store of its cache. All the supports and poles were lit up like the old Tavern on the Green in Central Park and twined with more blossoms of hydrangea, wild roses, baby\u2019s breath and lupine. For the centerpieces, Rolly had helped her drill holes into split white birch logs, into which Parker had put tall white candles, then set that into a bed of pine, roses and fern.</p><p>It was magical and lush and uniquely Maine, and she couldn\u2019t wait to see the look on Maggie\u2019s face.</p> <p>Lavinia was delivering the bouquets and boutonnieres to the bride and groom, so Parker was free to go. She took one more smug look around the tent. Time to go home, shower and change. Good thing Lucy had convinced her to bring a really nice dress in case of a fling.</p><p>And speaking of flings and weddings, it was hard not to remember Esme\u2019s big day, when Parker had ended up with James. He\u2019d been little more than a stranger back then.</p><p>This time, she had reason to like him.</p><p>The thought made her knees wobble a bit.</p><p>LIKE MOST MEN, James wasn\u2019t crazy about most weddings. Ceremonies were mostly the same, give or take. Brides looked pretty. Food was mediocre and took too long to be served. The expense always seemed a little grotesque. Single women tended to eye him the way a starving coyote might eye a plump, blind baby bunny, then make their predictable and unsubtle advances. In fact, that\u2019s how he and Leah had met. A New Year\u2019s Eve wedding. She\u2019d been cute, she eyed him, she kept positioning herself closer and closer, till she could accidentally bump into him and apologize, with plenty of hand laying and hair tossing.</p> <p>Parker\u2019s wedding pass had been, by far, the least subtle ever. She\u2019d been no sneaky coyote, no. More like a strike from a great white. Didn\u2019t see it coming, was completely stunned.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d complained.</p><p>This wedding, he acknowledged, was nicer than most. Parker and Vin had done a great job on the flowers; in fact, Maggie\u2019s mouth had dropped open when she got out of the limo, and people couldn\u2019t stop talking about how pretty everything looked. Every time he heard someone gushing, he felt a little rush of pride for his housemate.</p><p>And speaking of, she looked...perfect. Wearing a long blue dress cut low in the front and low in the back. Hair up in a twist. She wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, and the sight of her toes peeping out from under the silky fabric was getting him a little aroused. Didn\u2019t take much where she was concerned. Whether she wore that horrible Yankees cap and stained jeans or a gown, she was beautiful.</p><p>She was also avoiding him. She\u2019d waved. He\u2019d waved back. She seemed to be arming herself with babies; first Chantal\u2019s fat little package, then a smaller baby, then one that could walk.</p><p>The bride herself appeared. \u201cJamie, you don\u2019t have to stay glued behind the bar,\u201d she said, her cheeks flushed with happiness. \u201cEat something! We can pour our own wine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure look pretty, Maggie,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled, and for a second, she looked exactly like the cute waitress he\u2019d had a crush on way back when. \u201cThanks,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut go. I\u2019m the boss of today, right? Go eat something. Dance with someone. Parker, for example. Malone said you have a huge crush.\u201d</p><p>James shot Malone a look. \u201cThanks, pal.\u201d</p><p>Maggie leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came up this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kissing other men,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, we\u2019re married,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cI forgot why I was wearing this white dress.\u201d She slid her arms around Malone\u2019s waist. \u201cGo, James. I am queen and therefore dismiss you. Have fun. Oh, hang on, there\u2019s Parker. Parker! Over here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really bossy,\u201d James muttered to the groom.</p><p>\u201cAyuh,\u201d he agreed.</p> <p>Because Maggie was queen, Parker came over, and James felt his nerve endings do the now-familiar howl.</p><p>\u201cParker, these flowers are amazing! I can\u2019t get over it!\u201d Maggie said, hugging her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maggie. So glad you like everything.\u201d She paused. \u201cHi, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker. Always lovely to see you,\u201d he said. Her cheeks grew pink. James smiled. Used to be, he could only make her ears turn pink. Now he had the whole face. Progress.</p><p>\u201cOh, I love this song,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cCome on, Malone, let\u2019s dance.\u201d Malone grimaced\u2014what straight guy wouldn\u2019t\u2014it was something by Beyonc\u00e9 about all the single ladies.</p><p>\u201cYou have to obey her,\u201d James said. \u201cShe\u2019s the queen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for nothing,\u201d Malone muttered, following his wife as she dragged him onto the dance floor. Poor slob. Well, he wasn\u2019t that poor. He was smiling.</p><p>James turned to Parker. Her blush deepened. \u201cDid you have fun last night?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stayed at your uncle\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She smelled so good. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she answered, then cleared her throat. \u201cYou look very...um, nice to see you dressed.\u201d She winced, closing her eyes. \u201cDressed up, I meant. In a suit. More like yourself. Whatever, don\u2019t listen to me. Nice wedding, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She was nervous; he could feel the electrical current radiating from her. She licked her lips\u2014God\u2014and the blood made the cheerful and familiar flight from James\u2019s brain straight to his groin. \u201cThe flowers look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Such pleasant chitchat, when what he really wanted to do was...her. Yeah. That was right. Just clear off this table and tip her back on it, and let nature do its sweet thing.</p><p>A lock of her hair slipped out of its twist, brushing against her cheek. James reached out and slowly tucked it behind her ear, his fingertips brushing her silken skin, touching her earlobe. Her lips parted. He looked in those green eyes, which had grown soft and unguarded, and felt his heart slow to thick, solid beats.</p><p>The Beyonc\u00e9 song ended, and something slow came on. \u201cWant to dance?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance, Parker?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and seemed to come out of the trance that had wrapped around them both. \u201cOh, I should\u2014 I have to check something. Um, rain check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>With that, she turned and fled, like a scared little horse or something, stopped and fussed with an arrangement, and glanced back at him, then looked quickly away.</p><p>James felt a smile begin in his chest. Parker was afraid of dancing with him. Had to be a good sign.</p><p>He looked over the guests. There were a couple of age-appropriate women there, giving him the coyote stare. Not today, ladies, he thought, and approached a tiny, ancient old lady who was looking at the group on the dance floor with a bit of longing on her face. Bingo. His date for the evening. \u201cWould you do me a favor and dance with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my word!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI can barely stand, let alone dance, sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely handsome and strong,\u201d he said. \u201cYou sure you want to turn me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019ve convinced me,\u201d she said, standing with the help of her cane. She came up to his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames Francis Xavier Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! What a lovely name! I always did love the name James! I was so sorry when they shortened James Stewart to Jimmy.\u201d She patted his shoulder fondly. \u201cYou can call me Bess. Do you know it\u2019s been at least a dozen years since I danced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re lying,\u201d he said, maneuvering very carefully among the other dancers. \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty to be on the sidelines. You must have at least three boyfriends.\u201d He grinned as she laughed.</p><p>Parker had made herself scarce.</p><p>Well. They happened to live together, so she couldn\u2019t hide forever.</p><p>James also danced with Lavinia, danced with Maggie\u2019s mother, dodged a pass from a woman he didn\u2019t know, and made his way back behind the bar and stayed there, watching the crowd. Parker stayed on the sidelines, though she did dance with one of the Three Musketeers, the guy whose wife died earlier this year.</p><p>She didn\u2019t come his way again.</p><p>A while later, his uncle approached, sweaty from having danced with Maggie\u2019s twin. He sat down in front of the bar and eyed James. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home, kid?\u201d he said, wiping his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re all set here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stay, Unc. Help you pack things in later on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You did all the setup. Don\u2019t worry. The McConnell kid will do it. He needs a little money. Going off to Dartmouth this fall.\u201d</p><p>James hesitated. \u201cOkay.\u201d He started to walk off, then stopped. \u201cDewey,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor letting me come stay with you when I was a kid. When things were tough.\u201d</p><p>Dewey\u2019s expression changed. \u201cSure, kid. Now go home. Go. Git. I\u2019m gonna see if Chantal will dance with me for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>LITTLE MONKEY WATCHED the other monkeys swinging through the vines. Gosh, it looked like fun! But what if she missed the vine? She might fall, breaking her bones as she crashed through the branches, possibly rupturing some organs as she fell to the jungle floor, where Hungry Jaguar was waiting to gobble her up. On second thought, maybe she\u2019d stay in the tree instead, make a martini and call it a day.</p><p>Parker sighed, put aside the red notebook and sat back in the old wooden chair. She\u2019d slipped away from the wedding and was down on the dock, still in her dress. Beauty lay at her feet, contentedly staring out at the water, which was a purplish-blue under the darkening sky.</p><p>Lovely wedding. Just lovely, all that happiness so palpable. She\u2019d laughed and eaten and truly enjoyed sitting with Lavinia and watching the bride and groom. Little Violet Jones fell asleep on her lap, an achingly wonderful moment, the sweet smell of the little girl\u2019s head, her limp, warm weight so welcome.</p><p>But mostly, she\u2019d felt James. Felt his every smile, directed at her or not. When he\u2019d touched her face, his eyes so dark, she\u2019d been unable to even breathe. Thought he might kiss her for a second. So, in typical fashion, she bolted, but from that moment on, she\u2019d felt him. His laugh hit her in the stomach in a warm, aching squeeze, and each time those smiley, dark eyes met hers...well, hell, there it was again, that strong, tingling pull she\u2019d only ever felt around him.</p><p>Music from the reception drifted down from the green and out over the water, the thump of bass and occasional roll of laughter easily heard from the dock. The music changed from fast to slow...something by Norah Jones, the words just out of reach.</p><p>The tingling pull started again. She turned her head, and there he was, the sleeves of his dress shirt rolled up, his tie loosened, standing at the foot of the dock, watching her. Beauty\u2019s tail swished.</p><p>\u201cHey, James,\u201d she said mildly.</p><p>Mildly, right. Her heart was shuddering, it was beating so fast. Jump him, Spike advised. He\u2019s a guy. He\u2019ll love it. In her mind, the former child angel wore a black leather jacket and squinted through a haze of cigarette smoke. She should look into medication for this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>James came over to her, the dock rocking gently. He stood in front of her and held out his hand. \u201cCome on, coward,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou owe me a dance.\u201d</p><p>His hand was warm and sure. He pulled her to her feet, right against him, and Parker thought she might actually swoon, because he smelled so good, was so warm. Her entire body seemed to melt into his as his arm slipped around her waist. Her hand went to his shoulder, and James tipped his head and smiled at her, just a little. Parker swallowed, then put her cheek on his solid shoulder.</p><p>Norah Jones\u2019s smoky voice floated across the water, and the waves lapped against the dock, and she and James stood there, barely moving. Do something, James, she thought. Help me out here.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, he slid his hands down her bare arms, threading his fingers through hers. His hair tickled her neck as he bent his head, his lips warm as he kissed her shoulder, and the relief was so immense that her knees wobbled. He smiled against her neck.</p> <p>Parker slipped one hand against his chest, feeling the solid thumping of his heart, such a sweet, intimate feeling that the ache in her grew sharply. His lips moved higher up her neck, his beautiful mouth smooth and warm against her skin.</p><p>Beauty suddenly decided that James was all right, because she chose that moment to stand, putting her paws against his knee, as if she was cutting in. James smiled down at the little dog, then looked at Parker, and honest to God, she was actually dizzy, his smile was that good, crinkling his eyes, changing his face.</p><p>He leaned in a little closer, still smiling, still not kissing her, but please, it\u2019d better be soon or she might die. She closed her eyes, and thank goodness, his lips were against hers, the softest brush, so smooth and warm. Another brush. Then he did kiss her, a gentle, soft kiss that she returned carefully, almost shyly.</p><p>This was so different from that first time, so long ago, when she\u2019d barely been thinking, when she\u2019d used him to distract herself from loneliness. This was slow and tender and meltingly wonderful, James\u2019s mouth against hers, waiting for her response. Then he cradled her head in his hands, angling for better access to her mouth, and kissed her more fully. Her hand slid into his thick, curling hair, and he held her closer, that beautiful mouth kissing hers as if there was nothing more he wanted to do other than stand out here and do exactly what they were doing.</p><p>Beauty whined, and James smiled. He pulled back a little and smoothed Parker\u2019s hair back from her hot face.</p> <p>\u201cThe blackflies are starting to bite,\u201d Parker whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go in,\u201d he said, that smile still playing at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Then he took her hand and led her off the dock, up the stairs and into the house, and Parker went with him as if it was normal, not as if her legs were watery and her whole body was pulsing with a warm, honeyed glow; as if this was old hat, no big deal, when the truth was, she felt something akin to terror here, all that warm, glowing stuff aside. Beauty leaped neatly onto the couch, ditching them, the good dog. James led her down the hall, past his room. There was her bedroom. Yep. Terror.</p><p>James stopped outside her door, tilted her chin up and kissed her again. He stopped almost immediately this time, pulling back to look at her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d His voice was gentle. Which made sense. He was a gentle man.</p><p>The thought somehow made her more scared than ever.</p> <p>\u201cYeah! No. It\u2019s just...I\u2019m a little...nervous,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>Yes. The woman who\u2019d given birth to an eight-pound, nine-ounce bouncing baby boy in a total of three hours. No drugs, either. Not really virgin-bride material.</p><p>His eyes were dark. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything, Parker,\u201d he murmured, and his voice alone made Lady Land croon.</p><p>\u201cRight. No, I know that. Which, thank you, by the way.\u201d She took a shaky breath. \u201cNo, James, it\u2019s just the last guy I was with was...\u201d She felt her head wiggling around like a bobble-head figurine and managed to stop. She looked at his chest, which seemed like a safe place to park her eyes. \u201cYou. You\u2019re the last guy I was with.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. She continued looking at his chest. Fascinating shirt, all white and, um...cottony. Then he cupped her face so she really did have to look at him.</p><p>His eyes were soft. And he was smiling. He looked so relaxed, how could he be relaxed when she was about to jump out of her skin?</p><p>\u201cAnd that was... But this...\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels\u2014it feels different.\u201d Her voice was a whisper now.</p><p>Very slowly, as if she were a skittish fawn\u2014Why a fawn? Why not a skittish mule or ferret? Oh, Lord, her brain was going to explode\u2014James kissed her, just a soft brush on the lips. \u201cMaybe because we\u2019re friends now,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>And that was it exactly. Whether it was good or bad, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>It was probably good.</p><p>He leaned in, so slowly, and kissed her again, and without quite realizing she\u2019d moved, she found her hands were sliding against his lean rib cage, up to his chest.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d he whispered, pulling back the slightest bit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a yes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He reached behind her and opened the door, his mouth finding her again, hot and slow and sweet. Backed her into the room, one hand undoing her hair clip, sliding his fingers through her hair, down her back. Her dress was suddenly looser\u2014he\u2019d unzipped it, clever lad\u2014and his tongue brushed hers, and suddenly her hands remembered what they were for. They were for unbuttoning his shirt, even if they were shaking a little. His skin was hot and smooth, and she jerked his shirt open, exposing that beautiful torso, and pulled him down on the bed, suddenly desperate to get him on her, in her.</p><p>He captured her hands in his and pinned them gently above her head, his fingers twining with hers. \u201cNot this time,\u201d he whispered, kissing just below her ear. \u201cThis time, we take things slow.\u201d</p><p>Then, his mouth hot and sure as he tasted her neck, his hands releasing hers to slip her dress off her shoulders, James proceeded to show her why some things in life shouldn\u2019t be rushed.</p><p>And you know what?</p><p>The guy had a point.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>WHEN JAMES WOKE up, the sun was at an odd angle, shining right into his face. The bed felt different.</p><p>He bolted upright. Reality, or really, really excellent dream? Nope, this was her room. Clock said 8:13 a.m. The latest he\u2019d slept in months. He turned his head, and sure enough, a gorgeous female was looking at him.</p><p>Just not the one he expected.</p><p>\u201cHey, Beauty,\u201d he said, and the dog wriggled closer and rolled on her back, offering her stomach, which he rubbed obligingly.</p><p>Man. Best night of his life. Parker Harrington Welles, with him. All night. For a few seconds there, when they\u2019d come up from the dock, he\u2019d thought she might bolt and they\u2019d have to start all over again. Or never.</p><p>Nope. The Fates smiled on him, and if she wasn\u2019t the most beautiful, softest...the way she\u2019d said his name with a little gasp of surprise as she came, and the sweet, soft sinking afterward, as if her bones had dissolved and all she could do was curl against him, her hair cool and smooth against his shoulder.</p><p>Shocking. It was shocking, how good it had felt. Maybe it was years of unrequited imagining, but James could honestly say that there was sex, which was always a good thing.</p><p>And then there was last night. Which was unbelievable.</p><p>Where was she, anyway? He didn\u2019t hear anything going on in the rest of the house. No shower running, no noise from the kitchen.</p><p>He got out of bed and pulled on some clothes, an image of Parker on top of him actually making him stop in his tracks.</p><p>Best. Night. Ever.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the kitchen. Wasn\u2019t on the dock. Wasn\u2019t painting in his room, wasn\u2019t outside in the little yard. Wasn\u2019t swimming, thank God.</p><p>No note, either. Odd, because she\u2019d been leaving him little notes as to her whereabouts lately.</p><p>At that moment, his cell phone rang. New Hampshire Correctional.</p><p>Shit. \u201cHey, Harry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJames. How are you?\u201d</p><p>Great, Harry. Just shagged your daughter. A few times, actually. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cHow\u2019s Parker?\u201d</p><p>So, so good. James grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s excellent. I mean, uh, very good. She\u2019s fine. I mean, she\u2019s looking forward to seeing her son next weekend.\u201d He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood. How\u2019s the house coming along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been to see me. You think you could get her to come down?\u201d</p><p>James paused. \u201cWell, I think you should ask her yourself, Harry. It\u2019d probably mean more, coming from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right? And now you know my daughter better than I do?\u201d</p><p>Oh, most definitely, boss. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be pleasant, James, if my only child decided she could get her ass in the car and visit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll pass that message on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was curt.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s sobriety?\u201d James asked.</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s harder than I thought,\u201d Harry acknowledged. \u201cSorry if I\u2019m being a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, you\u2019re fine. You\u2019re in prison. You\u2019re supposed to be in a bad mood. Maybe you should join a gang, make some friends.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re the only friend I have, kid.\u201d There was an unfamiliar note of sincerity in his voice. \u201cAll right, James. Take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Bringing up Harry was not really on James\u2019s list of top ten things to talk about with Parker. Especially now, when she\u2019d apparently bolted. Her car wasn\u2019t in the driveway, so she must be either at the diner or the flower shop. Or on the Interstate.</p><p>A note would\u2019ve been nice.</p><p>Parker, warm and sleepy in bed next to him, would\u2019ve been even better.</p><p>With a sigh, James took a shower, fed the dog and walked into town. She wasn\u2019t at the diner, which was packed with pretty much the same folks he\u2019d seen at the wedding yesterday. He said hello to a dozen or so people, got two coffees to go and headed for Lavinia\u2019s.</p><p>As he walked in front of the open window of the shop, he heard Parker curse. \u201cTell him I\u2019m on a delivery,\u201d she hissed, completely audible. James rolled his eyes and went in.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lavinia,\u201d he said, setting one cup of coffee on the counter and taking a sip of his own. \u201cBrought you a coffee. Didn\u2019t think you were open so early. On a Sunday. And look at you, here all by your lonesome.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia stubbed out her cigarette on her palm, looking somewhat like a creased and grumpy badger. \u201cI don\u2019t usually open so early on a Sunday morning, you\u2019re right. But as you might know, I live upstairs, and some crazed idiot was unlocking the door at six-fuckin\u2019-thirty. To clean up the shop, she said.\u201d Lavinia picked up the coffee and took a sip. \u201cThanks for this, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So this crazed idiot, I guess she\u2019s on a delivery, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. Something to that effect.\u201d</p><p>James nodded. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to send her flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what I want the card to say. You ready?\u201d</p><p>Lavinia picked up a pen and grinned. \u201cGo for it, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Parker, thank you for the best sex I\u2019ve ever had, even counting the last time you did me, which was also fantastic. Still, last night was even better. I\u2019d love to have these encounters more than once every few years, and as we are currently living together\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door to the back room opened. \u201cOkay! Fine! I\u2019m here. Stop embarrassing yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cParker, hi, what a shock. I thought you were on a delivery.\u201d He grinned at the sight of her flushed face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two lovers alone,\u201d Lavinia said with a rusty chuckle. \u201cEavesdropping the whole time, of course.\u201d</p><p>Parker waited till Lavinia went into the back room. \u201cJames, I\u2019m sorry I had to leave so early. I, um, had to clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You\u2019re avoiding me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, yes, I\u2019m avoiding you.\u201d She shoved a piece of hair behind her ear, pinched her pinkie, then folded her arms over her chest and looked at the floor, Princess Agitation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pinched her pinkie again, biting her lip, as well. Very agitated indeed. \u201cI\u2014 Can we\u2014\u201d She stopped herself, looked down for a second. Sighed, then raised her eyes back to him. \u201cLast night might\u2019ve been a huge mistake. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not really sure what I want here, or what you want, or what... Anyway, I need to think a little bit, and I\u2019m not ready for a conversation yet.\u201d</p><p>He was not going to let her shovel some wrongheaded story again. \u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, last night wasn\u2019t a huge mistake, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And I don\u2019t believe you think it was, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014 You might be right. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d he said, his voice containing a hard edge. Good. \u201cYou blew me off the last time, Parker. You really gonna do that again?\u201d</p><p>She looked at the floor again. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking. Okay? I\u2019m not blowing you off. And I\u2019m sorry that I bolted this morning. As you might be aware, I\u2019m not really good at relationships.\u201d</p><p>She looked so miserable that he wanted to leap over the counter and kiss her stupid.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few hours, okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Well, shit. He couldn\u2019t really say no, could he? Still, he couldn\u2019t suppress a sigh, either. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for finding me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was very sweet.\u201d</p> <p>That was the thing with Parker. Made him crazy on one hand, made him crazy on the other, but for two entirely different reasons. Plexiglas heart vs. gooey caramel center.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be thinking of you the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Gawd, that\u2019s wicked romantic,\u201d Lavinia called. \u201cNice one, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Vin,\u201d he called, not looking away from Parker.</p><p>Then, what else could a guy do? He went home.</p><p>\u201cFIVE YEARS? PLEASE. Jonah\u2019s thirteen years younger than I am. Jamie\u2019s what? Twenty-nine? Thirty? That\u2019s totally legal. So he\u2019s your beautiful boy toy. Run with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats the electronic solution,\u201d Lavinia added.</p><p>Parker sighed. Advice from Chantal and Lavinia\u2014probably not the best role models.</p> <p>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a good ending here,\u201d she said, trying yet again to explain. \u201cWhen I thought about a summer fling, it was with someone I barely knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrashy,\u201d Vin said admiringly.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s not just a fling. But he\u2019s not stepfather material, either. He\u2019s...I don\u2019t know. Glib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he glib? What does glib mean, exactly?\u201d Lavinia said, scratching her head.</p><p>\u201cIt means insincere and shallow,\u201d Chantal answered.</p><p>They were drinking cheap white wine at some odd little structure in the middle of nowhere, half bar, half restaurant and the only alternative to Dewey\u2019s in a forty-mile radius. Chantal had dropped by the shop to chat that afternoon, and Lavinia, claiming Chantal was an expert on all things male, had spilled out Parker\u2019s deeply personal issues. A girls\u2019 night had been deemed necessary, and as Parker wasn\u2019t really sure about going home, here they were at Jason\u2019s Taverne.</p><p>Parker sighed. \u201cSee, he\u2019s only here this summer because my father told him to come. He\u2019s being paid. Not to have sex with me, maybe, but still. I can never tell if he\u2019s sincere or jerking my chain. And half the time, I think he\u2019s only nice to me because it\u2019s part of his job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your father\u2019s in jail, so James doesn\u2019t have a job, does he?\u201d Vin asked. Parker shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd he might be glib,\u201d Chantal said thoughtfully, \u201cbut he has the best ass in town since Father Tim. Hey, I\u2019m married, not blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have a fling,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cGod knows you could use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Vin. You\u2019re so sweet to say so.\u201d Parker sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not, Parker?\u201d Chantal agreed. \u201cLavinia\u2019s right. Have a fling. He\u2019s there, he\u2019s edible, you\u2019re horny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. What if I\u2019m not fling material?\u201d Parker said, cheeks hot. This whole conversation was extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short,\u201d Chantal said, eating some popcorn and waving to some guy at the bar who was eyeballing her. \u201cSorry,\u201d she called. \u201cHappily married.\u201d She refocused on Parker. \u201cCall it a summer romance. What are you afraid of? If James was good at seventeen, I can only imagine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again, I\u2019m so uncomfortable talking about this,\u201d Parker said, leaning her forehead against her fist. The cheap wine was doing its trick. \u201cWhat if I break his heart or something? What if he breaks mine?\u201d</p><p>Lavinia drained her Seven and Seven. \u201cThen you\u2019ll both be older and wiser and write a song about it or something. I don\u2019t know, sweetheart. He seems like a guy who\u2019s been around a bit. Looking like that, hell, he probably has to hold women off with a bowie knife.\u201d</p><p>Where Lavinia came up with her expressions was a mystery.</p><p>\u201cWhen does your son come up?\u201d Chantal asked.</p><p>\u201cSunday. A week from today,\u201d Parker said. Thank God, Nicky would be back in her life. Her little rock.</p><p>\u201cSo have a fling for a week, Parker. Enjoy yourself. Live a little.\u201d Chantal patted her hand. Just then her phone rang. \u201cSpeaking of boy toys,\u201d she said, clicking on. \u201cHi, babe. Don\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m out with the girls. Oh, really?\u201d Her expression changed to a sex-kitten purr. \u201cIs that right? Uh-huh. Go on. You did not. You did? Ooh. The whole thing? Well, I love you, too. I\u2019ll be home in twenty minutes.\u201d She hung up the phone. \u201cBaby\u2019s asleep, Jonah did the dishes and washed the kitchen floor.\u201d She stood up and smoothed her dress over her lush hips. \u201cMy husband is about to get laid. Parker, my advice is, go for it. See you, girls.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia drove Parker back to Gideon\u2019s Cove. \u201cWant me to drop you off?\u201d she asked as she came up to the flower shop.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll walk. I could use the air. Thanks, though.\u201d Parker sat for a second. \u201cYou\u2019ve been really good to me, Lavinia. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot. I wish I\u2019d known you when I was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re hardly in the grave now, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not. You\u2019re gonna love Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will, sweetheart. Now get outta my car.\u201d</p><p>The stars were blazing overhead. No light pollution up here, that was for sure. The town was quiet, as it was after 9:00 p.m., and the smell of pines and salt filled the air. The shushing of the water in the cove was soft and lovely tonight.</p><p>She could do a fling. Sure. Maybe. Probably not, actually. Last night hadn\u2019t felt like a fling. The first time, at Esme\u2019s wedding, yes. That was p**n o-movie sex. Definitely flingish. But last night had been slow and long and tender, and there\u2019d been smiling, even.</p><p>Bugger.</p><p>I fail to see a problem here, Spike said.</p><p>Parker stood for a minute, looking at the little cottage. It was a far sight better than her first glimpse. The new shingles and roof had perked it up. The back porch had been fortified, the grass cut. She\u2019d paint the doors and railings this week.</p><p>She could never have done this without Thing One.</p><p>Going inside, she stopped to pet Beauty, who must\u2019ve heard her and was waiting at the door. \u201cHi, sweetie,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSorry I left you all day.\u201d Then she straightened up. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d she said more loudly.</p><p>James stepped out of the bathroom, his hair damp. He was brushing his teeth.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s how it\u2019ll be,\u201d Parker said, shoving her hands in her pockets. \u201cI can\u2019t have a real relationship, because my life is very unpredictable these days, first of all, and more importantly, I don\u2019t think that would be fair to Nicky, since Ethan and Lucy got married six months ago, and with the move out of Grayhurst and starting kindergarten in September, he\u2019s got a lot of change going on, so me having a, um, boyfriend, it\u2019s not gonna happen. And I can\u2019t have you here when Nick is here, so you\u2019re going to have to either go back to Rhode Island or find somewhere else, because I\u2019m really sorry, but you can\u2019t stay\u2014it\u2019s not the example I want to set. But obviously I find you attractive, so if you agree, then I would say let\u2019s enjoy each other\u2019s company this week, and when my son comes on Sunday, we can part as friends.\u201d</p><p>Crap. That was long. Palms sweaty, face burning. But yeah, she thought she covered everything.</p><p>James was staring at her. \u201cCan I spit now?\u201d he asked thickly.</p><p>\u201cOh! Sure. Sorry. I\u2019ll be, um, in the living room.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, then closed the bathroom door and turned on the water.</p><p>Rolling her eyes at herself, Parker went down the hall and sat down hard on the couch. Beauty came up to her and pushed her nose against Parker\u2019s hand. Such a soft little muzzle, the nap of her fur so deep and velvety. \u201cHow\u2019d you think that went?\u201d Parker whispered. The dog wagged her tail. \u201cGood. Me, too.\u201d The dog jumped neatly onto the couch and curled against her side.</p><p>Nice to have a pet. She should\u2019ve gotten one long ago.</p><p>The water stopped running, and James appeared, smelling of soap and mint. Kind of hard to look him in the eye after her speech. But he was smiling, and her stomach flipped as he knelt in front of her. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>Parker swallowed. \u201cOkay to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo everything.\u201d</p><p>Then he was kissing her, his work-roughened hands under her shirt, hot against her skin, and without further ado, he pulled her to her feet and did her against the wall without even bothering to take off all her clothes.</p><p>Meow.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>ON DAY THREE of the Seven Days in Paradise, as he was thinking of it, James called Lavinia and asked her if she\u2019d look after Beauty for the day.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to take Parker out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two gonna elope?\u201d she said, coughing that rusty bark. \u201cShe\u2019s been all smiles the past few days.\u201d</p><p>James laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re not eloping. I\u2019m not that lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, listen to him. Sure, I\u2019ll watch the dog. Bring me a present. I\u2019m low on ciggies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Vin.\u201d</p><p>Parker was in the shower when he got back. She was singing. He tilted his head. \u201cWheels on the Bus.\u201d Maybe it was because her kid was coming up this Sunday, but she did seem happier.</p><p>He sure was.</p><p>For years now, Parker had been in the back of his mind\u2014and in the front a lot of times, too. Though he\u2019d had the expected hookups with Leah on and off for the past year, as well as a few before her, James hadn\u2019t really been in what he thought of as a real relationship. He\u2019d never met a girl\u2019s parents. Never thought of himself as wanting more, except for a few hours at the cousin\u2019s wedding, that was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Last night, he and Parker had gone down to the dock with a bottle of wine and the dog. Spread out a blanket and just lay there, looking up at the stars, Parker\u2019s head on his shoulder as she pointed out constellations he pretended he could see, blinded by the perfection of the moment. The water lapped gently at the rocky shore, and his fingers had played in Parker\u2019s smooth hair, and it occurred to James that he\u2019d never even imagined a moment like this happening to a guy like him.</p><p>\u201cAnd right there, see? That\u2019s Orion. See the belt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, seeing nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s Armani, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. You don\u2019t have to mock me. It\u2019s just that Harvard had a fabulous planetarium, and until now, I haven\u2019t had anyone to impress.\u201d</p> <p>He held her a little closer. \u201cIn that case, impress away.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d rolled on top of him instead. And hell, he\u2019d been very impressed at what she\u2019d done next.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Parker!\u201d he yelled now, thumping on the bathroom door. \u201cYou rich girls take forever in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rich anymore,\u201d she said, opening the door. Wearing a towel, her wet hair streaming down her back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cHurry up. We have a long drive.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and padded into her bedroom. She sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cYou sure we should go anywhere?\u201d Those green cat eyes were inviting.</p><p>\u201cActually, we can wait a little,\u201d James said.</p><p>And so it was that they were a little late in getting down to Machias. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could see a movie,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhich movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker. The Holy Rollers in 3-D! opened a few days ago.\u201d He glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cOh, crikey,\u201d she said, putting her hand over her eyes. \u201cDang. I knew there was something great about having spotty internet.\u201d She peeked at James. \u201cHow\u2019d it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen million, second only to the alien flick.\u201d He was well aware that she\u2019d been paid quite a bit for the film rights, all of which had been donated to Save the Children.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to see it? I\u2019m taking Nicky as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it over with. You can make gagging noises with me. With him, you\u2019ll have to behave,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they were in the little theater, along with about twenty rowdy kids between the ages of chair kicking and squealy texting. The previews began\u2014Smurfs, gnomes, wizards, dogs. The kid behind him spilled his popcorn and started to cry. The tweenie girls in front of them giggled shrilly. \u201cMommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy?\u201d one kid chanted over and over while her mother ignored her and talked to another kid\u2019s mom.</p> <p>Even Dante couldn\u2019t have imagined this circle of hell.</p><p>He glanced at Parker, whose face was a little gray. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll suck, James,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cTerrible attitude. Put on your glasses, it\u2019s starting.\u201d</p><p>The lights lowered completely, and the movie began.</p><p>Parker was right. The Holy Rollers in 3-D! was ghastly. Obvious, blatant, manipulative and all wrapped up in more sugary coating than Lucky Charms cereal. Could there be any more shades of pink in the Holy Rollers\u2019 tree house? One angel\u2019s voice was so high that James imagined every dog in a two-block radius was howling. Rainbow-colored butterflies floated out at them in 3-D effect, as did bubbles, bluebirds and the glittery rush of angelic roller skates.</p><p>James glanced at his watch. Fifteen minutes had passed. This felt longer than a problematic colonoscopy.</p><p>He sighed and put his arm around Parker, who was staring, horrified, at the screen. He kissed her temple, but she was mesmerized. \u201cI can\u2019t believe people paid money to see this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Golly, Polly and Molly, Ike, Mike and Spike whooshed in and out of regular kids\u2019 lives, ate angel food cake and soothed mortal children. A cat died and went to heaven. A dog learned that his limp wasn\u2019t so bad. A bat, previously thought to have rabies, was accepted by the owl family, and throughout it all, the Holy Rollers delivered squeaky messages of mercy and good cheer.</p><p>A lifetime later, the Sappy Six had earned their sparkly wings\u2014which seemed to flutter right into the audience. A few kids clapped. The tweenie girls pronounced the movie \u201cso, like, totally stupid\u201d and the audience filed out. Parker and James sat there, watching the credits.</p><p>There. Based on the bestselling children\u2019s book series by Parker Welles.</p><p>James looked over at her. Even wearing 3-D glasses, she was beautiful.</p><p>She was also crying.</p><p>\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d he said, taking her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was,\u201d she said unevenly. \u201cAnd the thing is, I hate the Holy Rollers, James, but somehow they\u2019re the best thing I ever did, and how rotten does that make me feel? I can\u2019t write anything else, I\u2019m completely tapped out for ideas and this is my legacy.\u201d She tucked her face against his shoulder, her back heaving in little spasms. \u201cMeanwhile, Nicky\u2019s having the best summer of his life, Lucy\u2019s the world\u2019s greatest stepmother\u2014she bakes cookies every day, James. Every day! They have this cute little family, Ethan is perfect, and you know they\u2019ll have kids of their own pretty soon, and Nicky will have siblings. He\u2019d probably miss me if I died, for a couple weeks, anyway, but Lucy would be a great mom, and the only thing I\u2019m good at is being fake. Those squeaky little bastards were the best I could do, and now even that\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, her face wet and blotchy, and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSo much self-pity in one big sloppy breath. I can\u2019t believe I slept with you.\u201d Then he grinned, and she gave a little surprised snort of laughter and smacked him on the shoulder. Hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no help. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. You\u2019re just my boy toy.\u201d She swallowed and wiped her eyes with a napkin.</p><p>James looked at her for a long minute. \u201cCome on, princess. I want you to meet someone.\u201d</p><p>IT TOOK TWO HOURS TO GET from Machias to wherever James was taking her. They didn\u2019t talk too much on the way. They did hold hands, though.</p><p>Parker couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d held hands with someone other than Nicky, who always grabbed on without thinking. It was admittedly the sweetest feeling in the world, his warm little hand in hers. But James holding her hand so firmly, so naturally...this was pretty great, too.</p><p>Around four, they slowed down in front of a long, solid-looking rock wall. The sign said Beckham Institute in brass letters. James pulled up to the guardhouse, which sat in front of an iron gate. \u201cHey, Bert,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, James, how\u2019s it going?\u201d The guard looked into the window. \u201cHello there,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Parker answered, feeling suddenly shy.</p><p>Bert punched a code, the gate swung open and James drove in.</p><p>The grounds were lush and beautiful, carefully landscaped, dotted with robust beds of red and white impatiens, well-placed trees and brick pathways. It looked like a college campus, the old brick buildings in good repair, window boxes overflowing with ivy and geraniums.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a college. There were a lot of staff members identified by the red shirts they wore, Beckham written in white letters across the back. There were also quite a few people in wheelchairs. Parker saw one man on a bench, wearing a helmet, rocking, as a staffer chatted with another client, this one on the type of metal crutches that bespoke lifelong use. Some of the clients were older, with white hair and spines bent from osteoporosis. Others were heartbreakingly young.</p><p>Someone was kicking a ball. Parker could hear snatches of music. There was a large playground with wider-than-usual swings and pathways\u2014to accommodate wheelchairs, Parker guessed. She\u2019d seen one such playground before.</p><p>James parked in front of a more modern building and got out. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, extending his hand.</p><p>Parker would\u2019ve asked who was here, but the lump in her throat was too big. She had a good idea, anyway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Carol,\u201d James said to the woman at the front desk.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey!\u201d she said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. This is my friend Parker.\u201d He bent to sign a book, writing Parker\u2019s name, as well, she noted.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s in her room,\u201d Carol said. \u201cThey just got out of music therapy. She\u2019ll be thrilled to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d James went down the hallway, and Parker followed.</p><p>How had she never known?</p><p>Then James stopped in front of room 111, knocked once and opened the door to a dorm-style room: a twin bed, posters on the wall, stuffed animals. Parker hovered half in the doorway, half in the hall.</p><p>\u201cHi, sis,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d the woman exclaimed. \u201cHi, James! Hi!\u201d She launched herself into James\u2019s arms, laughing with joy. \u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>It was the woman from the photo on James\u2019s bureau. The blue-eyed, dark-haired woman.</p><p>She had her brother\u2019s smile.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d he asked, kissing her on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cI had art. I made a bird. It\u2019s not so good. I kept it, though. It\u2019s drying. Pete sent me a teddy bear.\u201d She picked up a bear from her bed and handed it to James, then twisted her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a really nice bear,\u201d James said. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. Teddy. It\u2019s a teddy bear, James. Pete sent it.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look. \u201cI know what it is, Mary Elizabeth. But you don\u2019t have to name them all Teddy. James is a great name for a bear. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d</p><p>Mary Elizabeth found this pretty funny, because she stopped twining her fingers and laughed, a big openmouthed laugh that ended in a squeak. \u201cJames! That\u2019s your name!\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached up to smooth her curly hair. \u201cHey, Mary Elizabeth, I brought someone to see you,\u201d James said. \u201cThis is my friend, Parker. Parker, my sister.\u201d</p><p>Mary Elizabeth looked at her a bit warily.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mary Elizabeth,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, glancing back at her brother. The finger twisting began again. \u201cOkay, bye, James\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna stay a little while,\u201d James said. \u201cYou know the Holy Rollers, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh, James. The Holy Rollers and the Blind Little Bunny. You gave me a Spike doll. He\u2019s the head angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Parker here, she wrote those books,\u201d James said.</p><p>Mary Elizabeth\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou did?\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou wrote those books? You wrote the Holy Rollers books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Parker said.</p><p>The girl\u2019s\u2014woman\u2019s\u2014mouth dropped open, her fingers moving faster now.</p><p>\u201cYou like those books, right, Mare?\u201d James asked.</p><p>\u201cI like those books. I love those books! I have a Spike doll! They live in a tree fort!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw the movie, Mare. It was great. I\u2019ll take you next week, okay?\u201d James offered.</p><p>Mary Elizabeth Cahill had all the Holy Rollers books on a shelf. James had given them to her, she said. For the next hour, Parker fielded the girl\u2019s\u2014woman\u2019s\u2014questions as best she could, agreeing that yes, The Holy Rollers and the Big Mean Bully was the best of all the books, and yes, angel food cake was her favorite dessert, too, but no, she had never had a tree fort.</p><p>Throughout the interrogation, Parker kept looking at James, who sat on the window seat, his face neutral as Mary Elizabeth chattered. Occasionally, he made a joke, but mostly he was quiet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, an aide of some kind knocked on the door. \u201cSorry to break this up, guys. Mary Elizabeth, it\u2019s time for dinner, hon. James, you and your friend gonna stay?\u201d</p><p>James glanced at Parker. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Mary Elizabeth announced. She stood up and looked at Parker. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mare,\u201d James said with an exaggerated sigh. \u201cI thought I was your best friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my brother. You can\u2019t be best friends with your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo true, Mary Elizabeth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him\u2014he\u2019s just grumpy.\u201d</p><p>Mary Elizabeth seemed to like that. \u201cYou\u2019re just grumpy, James,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re grumpy.\u201d She looked at Parker, a gleam of conspiratorial delight in her eyes. \u201cI love you, James\u2019s friend,\u201d she added, hugging Parker hard.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Parker said. Then Mary Elizabeth detached and hugged her brother. \u201cBye, James! See you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mare. I love you.\u201d James hugged his sister back, kissed her twice, then waved as she and the aide walked from the room.</p> <p>\u201cSee you tomorrow?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really have a sense of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>James stood up and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cWell. Thank you for making her life.\u201d He grinned, but it was a pale imitation of the usual. \u201cWant to take a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>James clearly knew the place well, and several people, clients and staff alike, said hello, calling him by name. They walked through the campus, down a wide brick pathway to a little garden. There was a fountain in the middle, and two sparrows were taking a bath. The grounds were quieter now, and Parker could smell garlic and roast chicken.</p> <p>\u201cFood\u2019s pretty good here,\u201d James said, as if he heard her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a plus.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at the birds. \u201cThe technical term is anoxic brain injury. Deprived of air during a near drowning.\u201d</p><p>Parker bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned back, took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair. Then he told her the story.</p><p>Mary Elizabeth had been a surprise baby\u2014the four Cahill boys had been born within six years of each other, with Mary Elizabeth coming five years after James, the youngest son. She\u2019d been as spoiled as a little girl could be; if one brother failed to obey her command, surely another would. She had them all wrapped, James said. Especially their father, who viewed Mary Elizabeth as a reward for enduring four boys. Her brothers would give her piggybacks, ride her on the handlebars of their bikes, even play princess tea party with her. She was the light of the family, everyone\u2019s favorite.</p><p>Then, when James was twelve and Mary Elizabeth was seven, Tommy graduated from high school. The school gave out only four tickets per family, so James volunteered to stay home and babysit. The Terminator was on, and his mother hadn\u2019t let him see it when it was in the theaters. The rest of the family went off to the high school. Mary Elizabeth asked to go swimming; the Cahills lived on a lake, and the kids swam almost every day.</p><p>James said no. Gave her some popcorn, made her a fort out of blankets in her bedroom, left her there playing with her dolls. Then he went into the living room and sat in front of the TV.</p> <p>By the time he realized she was in the lake, she was already way too far out. He yelled for her to come in, and she turned and headed for shore. All the Cahills were excellent swimmers. But she was tired. When her head slipped beneath the surface, it took him a second to realize what was happening. There was no splashing, no yelling, no flailing. She just disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI remembered what my dad always told us\u2014row, throw, go. Row out, throw them something or go for help.\u201d James\u2019s voice was horribly quiet and calm. \u201cWe had a little dinghy, and I don\u2019t even remember getting in it. I was pulling the oars as hard as I could, and I could hear myself screaming her name... .\u201d</p><p>He jumped in where he thought she\u2019d gone under, but the lake was murky, and it was hard to see anything. He swam around, eyes burning, chest aching, resurfaced for air and went under again.</p><p>And then he saw his sister\u2019s hand, floating there, white against the green murkiness. He grabbed and pulled, kicking for all he was worth.</p><p>\u201cThey make it look so easy in the movies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were barely moving. She was a chubby little thing, weighed almost as much as I did back then. Then we broke the surface, and I held her face up, but the boat had drifted off in the wind, and I couldn\u2019t make it. But I couldn\u2019t let her go, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Parker whispered, wiping her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe both went down, and I thought that was it, we were dying. I could see the light getting farther and farther away, and I felt so bad for my parents, to have to find us in the pond. But at least Mare and I would die together.\u201d</p><p>Parker pressed her hand against her mouth, but a sob slipped out.</p><p>He gave her an oddly wry look. \u201cI know. It\u2019s a horrible story, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She squeezed his hand, unable to talk. \u201cSo, next thing I knew, my father had me by the arm, pulled me up, tossed me in the boat and went back for Mary. Got her to the dock, did CPR, all that. My mother was screaming, my brothers...well. It was a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, I\u2019m so, so sorry,\u201d she said in a shaky voice, the words pathetically inadequate.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe TV was still on when I went back in the house. That\u2019s what I remember. I wanted to watch the movie, and my sister almost died because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, you didn\u2019t know what would happen! You told her not to go in, and you thought she was playing. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure it is. My father grabbed the wrong kid first, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s heart seized. \u201cNo, James, you can\u2019t think like that. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a bleakly rueful grin. \u201cIt\u2019s what he used to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Parker squeezed his hand, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He took a breath, and his voice became more brisk. \u201cMare was in the hospital for weeks, then a rehab center. Mom started drinking, my brothers blamed me, and my father couldn\u2019t stand the sight of me. That\u2019s why I got shipped off to Dewey in the summers. And that\u2019s the end of the tragic tale. I guess every family has one, and that\u2019s ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold yourself responsible for that, James. You were twelve years old,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI was in charge. I knew she wanted to go in, and I knew she usually did what she wanted, but hey. The Terminator was on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, James. You were only a little kid yourself. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t contradict her, but she could tell he didn\u2019t believe her, either. The little birds were done with their bath, and a breeze rustled the leaves of the willow tree behind them.</p><p>\u201cDo you pay for this place?\u201d she asked, wiping her eyes on her sleeve.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShitty consolation prize. \u2018Hey, Mary Elizabeth, I\u2019m sorry I almost let you drown, but at least you can live in a nice institution.\u2019\u201d</p><p>No words were going to help here. Parker scootched onto his lap and wrapped her arms around him, kissed his head, her throat tight, and held him close, smoothing his hair, not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cParker?\u201d he said eventually, his face against her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned your father in to the SEC.\u201d</p><p>The words took a minute to sink in. She blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>James pulled back to look at her. \u201cHe let something slip about a deal one night. Something that would be as good as Apple. I wasn\u2019t sure at first, but it sounded...off.\u201d His eyes were sad. \u201cA drug company had a product really close to FDA approval, and he sank everything into it. He was absolutely sure it would be huge. But it didn\u2019t pass its final trial. When he came to me and asked to liquidate your trust funds, I knew he\u2019d screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She took a deep breath, utterly stunned.</p><p>James was quiet for a minute. \u201cThe law says if an attorney suspects a client is committing fraud that results in financial loss for other people, he has to turn him in. And even though I owed Harry everything, because I could never afford this place without him, I had to do it. I called the SEC, and they took it from there.\u201d</p><p>Parker blinked. A sparrow landed on the back of the bench, then flew off. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe might. He probably does\u2014he\u2019s not an idiot\u2014but he\u2019s never said anything. He knows about my sister and how I pay for this place.\u201d His dark eyes were full of so much\u2014guilt, sorrow, regret. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Parker. I knew you and Nicky would be collateral damage, but I couldn\u2019t say anything without breaking the law. If I lost my license or got indicted with Harry, I wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of Mary Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>Parker looked at him for a long, long moment, then put her hand over his heart. \u201cOh, James,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI would\u2019ve done the exact same thing.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS NOT GREAT TIMING, falling for someone four days before a relationship was scheduled to end. Parker admitted that. But that night, James asleep on one side of her, Beauty on the other, both of them sound asleep, she had to acknowledge that it was true.</p><p>She was in love.</p><p>She studied him as he slept. Cheekbones of an angel, perfect, smooth skin.</p><p>They would make beautiful babies, that was for sure.</p><p>Oh, holy halos. Where had that thought come from? Now was not the time to be thinking babies. She had a child. That child\u2014and reality\u2014were returning in four days.</p><p>And James had never said anything about wanting kids, or a future, or anything other than getting exactly what he was getting now. The L word had not been exchanged. Given the horror he\u2019d lived through, having kids was probably not on his list of things to do.</p><p>But hearing about James\u2019s past, seeing him with his sister...it changed things in her heart, if not in the world.</p><p>James stirred, frowned, then opened his eyes. \u201cHey,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his eyes softening. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Then she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek, on the chin, on the temple, until he was smiling, and then she kissed him on the mouth, and the feeling was so overwhelming, so right and wonderful, she thought her heart might come right out of her chest.</p><p>Four days. Four more days of this.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel like enough.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>ON SATURDAY NIGHT, their last night together, James sat on the dock as ordered. He could hear Parker rattling around in the kitchen, putting the final touches on dinner. She\u2019d already brought down a bottle of wine\u2014the last one from Harry\u2019s wine cellar, she\u2019d said\u2014and it was sitting in a bucket of ice next to him. The picnic blanket was spread and set. She\u2019d even put a little vase of flowers in the middle.</p><p>James didn\u2019t hate being on the dock anymore, despite the gentle rocking and deep water. Nope. It was growing on him, better late than never. The evening was warm and clear, the sun taking its time to set, lighting up Gideon\u2019s Cove in a clean, golden glow.</p><p>It was almost insultingly romantic.</p><p>His bag was packed; his bed, in which he hadn\u2019t slept for seven nights running, was now made up with fire-engine sheets for Nicky. James would be moving to Maggie Beaumont\u2019s old apartment for the next week or so; all he had to do in exchange was check in on Maggie\u2019s little old lady neighbor.</p><p>What happened with Parker after tonight, he had no idea.</p><p>A fling, she\u2019d said. A weeklong summertime fling, at the end of which, they\u2019d part as friends. Except he didn\u2019t want her as a friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she already seemed to be pulling away. Putting out her son\u2019s stuffed animals on the bed, a few books in his room, making a sign that said, Welcome, Nicky! I missed you! He was getting the message. She was shifting back into mommy mode, and he couldn\u2019t blame her. She had a lot to do back in Rhode Island\u2014get a job, find a place to live, adjust to a new lifestyle, get her kid settled in school.</p><p>Didn\u2019t stop the wanting, though.</p><p>But he had his own stuff to deal with. His own bills to pay, his own job to find.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here we are,\u201d Parker said, walking carefully with the tray. Beauty bounded onto the dock and flopped down expectantly, making Parker laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not for you, girl. It\u2019s for him. Ta-da!\u201d</p> <p>Lobster. Drawn butter, mashed potatoes, green beans. \u201cThere\u2019s peach cobbler for dessert, but it was too hot to bring down just yet,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really nice, Parker. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I owe you. For all you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Ah. He was being relegated back to the help. Got it.</p><p>The food was fantastic. Hard to really love your kiss-off meal, though. Parker chatted easily about town things...a little gossip from the flower shop, the busload of Canadians that had stopped at the diner today, Stuart from the hardware store dropping by with a \u201cblonde with sand\u201d for her today, which apparently was a cup of coffee with cream and sugar.</p> <p>All very pleasant conversation, same as she\u2019d have with the mailman.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you go out with me back then?\u201d he asked, setting down his fork. \u201cAfter your cousin\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>His question surprised James nearly as much as it surprised Parker. Her mouth opened, then closed, and she began stacking the plates neatly onto the tray, where Beauty surreptitiously gave them a few licks. Then, finally, she looked at him. \u201cWell, at the time, I didn\u2019t want to date you, James. You were Thing One. My father\u2019s minion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were okay with using me for sex.\u201d</p><p>She flinched a little. \u201cI guess so. It wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d planned anything.\u201d She looked out over the water. \u201cI figured you slept with me because my last name is Welles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept with you because you dragged me into a bedroom and mauled me, Parker, and no straight single guy in his right mind would say no to that.\u201d He smiled a little to soften the words.</p> <p>Her ears grew pink. \u201cRight. I did drag and maul. It\u2019s true. But then you went off with my father, and it seemed very...convenient. You were already in my father\u2019s back pocket\u2014now you had his daughter, too.\u201d</p><p>His smile dropped. \u201cSo you really thought I was complete scum, in other words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my father\u2019s favorite person. My father is complete scum. You were scum by association.\u201d She studied her hands. \u201cI was wrong, if it helps.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI figured if you really wanted to date me,\u201d she added quietly, \u201cyou would\u2019ve tried harder.\u201d</p><p>Women. Honestly. James leaned back in his chair. \u201cI brought you flowers. I came to your house, and you squashed me like a bug. You weren\u2019t going to date me, Parker. I was the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t that. It was more like...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think you were sincere. I figured you came over to see Harry\u2019s daughter. Not me.\u201d Her cheeks were flushed now, so at least there was that, a little shame thrown in. \u201cIf you really wanted something with me, I thought you\u2019d try again. But you didn\u2019t.\u201d She was pinching her pinkie finger. \u201cI guess it was a test or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, to me, it didn\u2019t seem like a test. I came over with flowers, and you were armed and ready with the Paragon and your kid and told me I was a drunken mistake. Kinda hard to feel the urge to call you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was a rotten thing to say. I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit, Parker. I\u2019m sorry I assumed you knew that you were an adult who knew what you wanted. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t read your mind.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Then she swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point, James,\u201d she said, her voice husky. \u201cAnd for the record, I wasn\u2019t drunk. I knew what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>There it was again, her way of saying something abruptly honest. She was so careful all the time, so vigilant about what she\u2019d tell him, and then bam, she\u2019d say something like that, and it was a sucker punch to the heart.</p><p>Also, her eyes were wet.</p><p>Their last night together, and he was making her cry.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he said, his voice soft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she lied. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how I acted back then. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I thought about you. A lot.\u201d He reached for her hand, ran his fingers over the back of it. She didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cFor years, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d</p><p>That made her glance up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Many thoughts.\u201d He grinned a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of thoughts?\u201d she asked, a smile of her own starting.</p><p>\u201cDirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow filthy?\u201d She was smiling in full now.</p><p>\u201cExtremely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny interest in pursuing those now?\u201d she asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>He stood up. \u201cRace you to the house.\u201d</p><p>LATER, AFTER SEX and peach cobbler and another\u2014and possibly last\u2014round of lovemaking, James was still awake, Parker\u2019s head on his shoulder, his fingers in her hair. She was asleep, her breathing soft and slow.</p><p>This was it, he guessed. Tomorrow her son would be here, and she was a great mom. She\u2019d focus on him, make Nicky\u2019s transitions easier and all that. The kid didn\u2019t need his mother\u2019s boyfriend in the mix. He couldn\u2019t argue with her there.</p><p>It was time to let her go. He\u2019d finish what he started with the house and head back to the real world. Parker had a lot in front of her, and she deserved this time with her son to be uncomplicated and happy.</p><p>And if that meant being Thing One again, so be it. The last thing he wanted was to make her life more difficult any more than he had already.</p><p>He just hadn\u2019t imagined it would be this hard.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>NOTHING FELT AS good as having her son back in her arms. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Mommy,\u201d he said, wrapping both his arms and legs around her.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, I missed you, too. Felt like I was going to pop without you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky laughed at that, and Parker breathed in his good Nicky smell, kissed his sweet little neck again. He\u2019d gained two pounds in the three weeks they\u2019d been apart. She could tell. \u201cLet me see your beautiful face,\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cOh, my gosh. The handsomest boy in the universe\u2014am I right, Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe image of his father,\u201d he agreed with a grin.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dog! You have a dog! Hi, doggy!\u201d He wriggled out of her arms to investigate, and Beauty, who was crouched in the corner, trembled at his approach.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a surprise for you, honey, but she\u2019s really shy,\u201d Parker said. \u201cJust hold out your hand and let her sniff it.\u201d</p><p>Nick obeyed, and, wonder of wonders, Beauty\u2019s tail wagged. \u201cShe likes me!\u201d he announced, kneeling down, and sure enough, Beauty licked his hand, then came closer. \u201cMommy, she\u2019s kissing me! What\u2019s her name? Is she mine? Can I keep her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Beauty,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd yes, we\u2019re keeping her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Beauty! You\u2019re licking me! Do you think I\u2019m lunch?\u201d He petted her on the head as the little dog licked his face. \u201cEw! She licked my mouth. Mommy, when can I go swimming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go later on. Do you have to go to the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Nick thought about that, then bolted, slamming the door of the loo behind him. \u201cSorry!\u201d he called.</p><p>Parker and Ethan shared a smile of child-adoration. \u201cI\u2019ve literally been counting the hours,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou want some iced tea? You\u2019re staying here tonight, right? It\u2019s a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky and I can sleep in his room, and you can have mine,\u201d she said. A great excuse to snuggle with her son all night.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere\u2019s fine,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI have to say, the place looks great, Parker. It\u2019s really cute. A lot better than I pictured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Um, James...you know, Thing One? My father\u2019s attorney? I told you he was here, right? Harry made him come. Anyway, he\u2019s been doing everything. I just clean and paint.\u201d Her ears started itching.</p><p>\u201cIs he around?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not today.\u201d James had said he wouldn\u2019t be by today so she could have some time alone with Nicky. He\u2019d even left Apollo, remembering that her son loved the snake, and had offered to take the creature when it was time to leave Maine for good. The thought gave her a pang; not of parting from Apollo, of course, but of the summer ending.</p><p>\u201cI always thought he was a good guy,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>She was spared from having to comment with Nicky\u2019s return. \u201cMommy, Elephant loves it here! He already found a fort!\u201d</p><p>\u201cElephant! You are so good at finding forts!\u201d She kissed Nicky\u2019s favorite stuffed animal on the nose. \u201cSo who\u2019s hungry? I have enough food for an army, or, in the case of the Mirabelli men, two people.\u201d</p><p>Ethan had pictures of the big trip on his iPad, and Parker admired them, as well as Nicky\u2019s collection of rocks, which he\u2019d brought with him. \u201cThis one\u2019s quartz,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd this one is I don\u2019t know what. And this one\u2019s shale, right, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>It was amazing, how much Nicky seemed to have grown up in the three weeks without her. But after lunch, he climbed into her lap and rested his head against her shoulder, and he fit just as well as he ever had. Parker called Lucy, who was fending off the elder Mirabellis and doing a mountain of laundry. She offered to go check on a house Parker had found online; it was a rental in a nice neighborhood\u2014not that Mackerly had slums, exactly\u2014and it was close to Nicky\u2019s school.</p><p>That night, when Nicky was asleep in his room\u2014it didn\u2019t seem like James\u2019s room at all anymore, not with Nicky\u2019s rocks and Legos and stuffed animals scattered about\u2014Ethan and Parker sat on the small back patio.</p><p>\u201cWant to go down on the dock?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Parker said, feeling her cheeks prickle with heat. \u201cHere\u2019s good. The blackflies get pretty fierce on the water.\u201d</p><p>They sat in the comfortable silence of two people who\u2019d been friends for a long time. But it was a little different now. Maybe it was the three weeks apart, but Ethan seemed...older. A little preoccupied.</p><p>\u201cSo I have to ask,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIs Lucy pregnant, Eth?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan! You dog!\u201d She jumped up and hugged him. \u201cCongratulations, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his mouth curling in what Lucy called his elvish smile, and his eyes were bright. \u201cThanks. It\u2019s really new. She started puking on the trip, and that tipped us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. I\u2019m so happy for you guys.\u201d Remembering Lucy\u2019s loss of her first husband, as well as her adoration of Nicky, brought a lump to Parker\u2019s throat. Lucy and Ethan deserved every happiness. They\u2019d both waited a long time. \u201cWhat do I have to do to be godmother? Diaper coupons? Free babysitting for life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you have it locked down,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Parker sighed happily. \u201cThat is the best news. So. New restaurant, new baby. You\u2019ll have your hands full.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn all the best ways. We figured we\u2019d wait to tell Nicky, if you\u2019re okay with that. It\u2019s early days, and nine months is a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Ethan had never made a misstep as a parent, not so far as Parker could tell, anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo are you doing okay, Parks?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m actually really good. The house is listed, and now that it\u2019s spruced up a bit, I\u2019m hoping to get an offer.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan nodded. He was quiet for a long minute. \u201cHow\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve had a few tortured conversations in which neither of us says much. According to James, he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to see him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a long drive. About four hours from here, maybe more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky was asking about him. Wanted to know if he could visit.\u201d</p> <p>Parker paused. \u201cI\u2019d have to check the place first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour call. But he\u2019s curious.\u201d Ethan stood up. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna hit the hay,\u201d he said. \u201cI was alone in the car with your son for eight hours today. I\u2019m whipped. Your son can talk, Miss Welles.\u201d</p><p>It was their habit to refer to Nicky as \u201cyour son\u201d whenever discussing his, ah, less-than-stellar moments. Your son put my phone in the washing machine today or Your son sang \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d for thirty-nine straight minutes. \u201cLike he doesn\u2019t get that from your side of the family,\u201d Parker said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s Marie\u2019s grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Althea\u2019s, let\u2019s not forget. You guys have a good visit, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really did. It was different. Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. See you in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>As Parker washed up, she could hear Ethan talking to Lucy. She went into Nicky\u2019s room, and the sight of his little form there in bed filled her with such a rush of love that her knees went weak. Beauty was snuggled at his side, her muzzle on his hip. \u201cGood girl, Beauty,\u201d Parker whispered. She wondered if Beauty sensed that Nicky was hers. The dog hadn\u2019t let Ethan near her, slinking behind something when he approached. But she already loved Nick, thank goodness.</p><p>Three weeks was too long. She made a mental note never to be away from her son that long again until he was, oh, maybe forty-five or so.</p><p>Nice that he\u2019d be a big brother. She\u2019d known it would come, that announcement, and the familiar pang of envy bounced around in her heart with her genuine happiness.</p><p>She lay down next to her little guy, stroked his silky hair. The band of worry and loneliness that had been tight around her heart loosened as she listened to his breathing. He was back with her, and all was right with the world.</p><p>Even so, she wondered how James was doing tonight. He\u2019d seemed pretty chipper when he left, his duffel bag in hand. Hadn\u2019t seemed melancholy at all, whereas she...well. This was a dopey train of thought to pursue.</p><p>She got under the covers and snuggled closer. Nicky didn\u2019t stir. The kid could sleep through a monsoon and not wake up; had in fact slept through a pretty fair hurricane last year and then had been quite confused as to why so many leaves and branches were on the ground the next morning. She kissed his neck, breathing in the smell of baby shampoo and boy.</p><p>They were back together, mother and child. She shouldn\u2019t want more.</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, Ethan made breakfast as Nicky explained how many tricks he was going to teach Beauty. \u201cShe could jump through my hula hoop. She could catch mice for Apollo. She could jump off the diving board! She can swim with me in the pool all winter long!\u201d</p> <p>Ethan and Parker exchanged a look. \u201cWell, we won\u2019t be living in a house with a pool anymore, remember, honey?\u201d Parker said.</p><p>Nicky\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d He looked around the kitchen. \u201cIs this our house now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. This is just for a couple weeks. A little vacation. Then we\u2019ll go back to Rhode Island and live near Daddy and Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll move in with you, Daddy,\u201d Nicky said as Ethan put a plate of scrambled eggs and toast in front of him.</p><p>Parker gave Ethan a look that said, Help me out here, pal. He got the message. \u201cYou and Mommy are going to have your own house, and you\u2019ll spend half the time there, and half the time with me. Just like always, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to live with Beauty all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Beauty can meet Fat Mikey, and maybe they\u2019ll be friends.\u201d Ethan grinned at Parker; the enormous cat would be more apt to eat Beauty than befriend her, but there was always hope.</p><p>\u201cThey will be,\u201d Nicky pronounced. \u201cThey\u2019ll be best friends. Except Beauty\u2019s scared of you, Daddy. You have to be nicer to her.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, a knock came on the door, and Parker\u2019s heart seemed to roll over in her chest. \u201cCome on in,\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d James said as he came down the hall.</p><p>At the sound of his voice, Beauty left Nicky\u2019s side and streaked over to him, wagging her tail and whining happily, putting her paws against his leg, the better to get an ear scratch.</p><p>\u201cHey, Beauty.\u201d James knelt to pet the waggly little dog, then stood up. \u201cEthan. Good to see you again.\u201d The men shook hands. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was great, thanks for asking. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo complaints.\u201d James\u2019s gaze dropped to Nicky. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Nicky stared back solemnly.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you remember James, right?\u201d Parker asked. \u201cMr. Cahill? Grandpa\u2019s friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicky said suspiciously. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you also remember your manners?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun on your vacation?\u201d James asked, rather solemnly.</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>Not his usual chatty self. Of course. Maybe her son sensed something. Ethan did, apparently, as he was gazing steadily at Parker.</p><p>James cleared his throat. \u201cWell, I figured I\u2019d get to work on the stairs to the dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. Um, would you like some coffee?\u201d She was abruptly aware of the little tableau she, Nicky and Ethan made.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I got some at the diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some help, James?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>James glanced at Parker. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s fine. But thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker says you\u2019ve been great,\u201d Ethan added as Nick climbed into his lap. He dropped a kiss on Nicky\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ve really been...um, great,\u201d she blurted. Lordy, this was uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWell. My pleasure.\u201d He paused. \u201cI can come back later, if that would be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s fine. Whenever you want, James,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a nail gun?\u201d Nicky asked.</p><p>James looked at Nicky. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she and Ethan said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the bosses,\u201d James said. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get to work.\u201d With that, he went out the back door, and a few seconds later, the screeching sound of wood being pried up could be heard.</p><p>\u201cI wanna help. I wanna use the nail gun,\u201d Nicky declared.</p><p>\u201cNo, Nicky. It\u2019s not for kids,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you work on teaching Beauty a trick? Maybe in your room, so you can surprise us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Nicky scrambled off Ethan\u2019s lap and ran down the hall. \u201cCome on, Beauty!\u201d he bellowed, and Beauty trotted obediently after him. \u201cCome see Apollo. Do you love Apollo? Mom, can I let Apollo out of his case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s locked, and it\u2019s gonna stay that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to come out,\u201d Nicky argued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming out,\u201d she said. Nicky grumbled but dropped it. Seemed as if he\u2019d gotten a little more willful than she remembered.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d She took a bite of toast. Didn\u2019t look at Ethan.</p><p>Right from the birth of their son, Parker and Ethan had agreed to share information that might affect Nick. Dating was one of those topics; when Ethan and Lucy had taken up with each other, he\u2019d come to her and made sure she was okay with it. Things like vacations and work schedules, family events, any kind of change that might impact Nick had always been discussed.</p><p>The subject of Parker having a boyfriend had never come up. She sensed it was about to.</p><p>\u201cAre you and James seeing each other?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she whispered. She was actually more afraid that James would hear; Nick was chanting the word Jump over and over in his room. \u201cWe, um...we had...\u201d Jump. Jump. \u201cHe was staying here.\u201d Jump. Jump. Jump, Beauty, jump. \u201cIt made more sense, with all the work we had to do. We hung out a little bit. But it\u2019s done now.\u201d Ouch. Saying the words out loud...it hurt. She cleared her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Nicky to be overloaded.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed, then looked at the ceiling and scratched his chin. He was quiet for a minute. \u201cJames always struck me as a decent guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no, he is. Very decent.\u201d She paused. \u201cI didn\u2019t always think so, but I do now.\u201d Jump. Jump. Jump, Beauty.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nothing. We had a little summer fling, at the recommendation of your wife, I might add, and it was fun. It\u2019s also finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want it to be more than a fling?\u201d</p><p>She took a sharp breath, an unexpected flare of anger arrowing through her. \u201cWell, Ethan, I guess because Nicky\u2019s got a lot on his plate right now. Grandpa in prison, new house, new school, new stepmother, new sibling on the way. His mother having a boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t say anything for a minute. \u201cYou have a point. It\u2019s a lot. But I\u2019d hate for you to think that your job was to just serve Nicky. If you were in a relationship, he\u2019d adjust, and happily, if it was the right person. I mean, do you think he\u2019s less happy because Lucy and I are married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s probably happier. He adores her. But that\u2019s different. He\u2019s known her his whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s known James his whole life, too.\u201d</p><p>Heck. That was true. And she was tremendously hung up on James; that was also true.</p><p>But a real relationship? She had no idea what James had planned for the future. She could ask, of course. Or wait and see, maybe. That seemed safer.</p><p>Ethan cleared his plate. \u201cWell, it\u2019s obviously up to you. Just don\u2019t martyr yourself on the altar of motherhood.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cEthan Mirabelli! Bite me.\u201d She flipped him the bird.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019d rather hug you. I should hit the road, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because you\u2019re a pain in the ass. Get out of here.\u201d She hugged him, then smacked him on the side of the head. \u201cTell your parents I miss them and I\u2019ll be home in a couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel man.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, then went down the hall to say goodbye to their boy.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>JAMES WAS BEING watched. For the second day in a row, Nicky Mirabelli was staring him down, sitting at the top of the hill that led down to the dock, idly digging a hole with a gardening spade. Parker was planting flowers, and Nick was allegedly helping. More than that, he was staring at James. Occasionally, he\u2019d announce a fact: I can swim a mile. I can eat five pancakes. I\u2019m stronger than you.</p><p>It was making James nervous. He\u2019d never felt comfortable around kids, not that he got much chance. The natural, automatic affection that flowed effortlessly from both Parker and Ethan toward their kid...he couldn\u2019t imagine that. Maybe it happened when it was your kid. Maybe he wasn\u2019t the kid type. That seemed more likely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can use the nail gun,\u201d Nicky said now. \u201cMy mother said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d James said. \u201cWell, if she tells me that herself, I\u2019ll show you how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d the kid bellowed. \u201cMr. Cahill said I can use his gun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not say that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJames,\u201d Parker said, appearing at the top of the hill, sweaty and beautiful, a red bandanna around her blond hair, \u201che can\u2019t use the nail gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I didn\u2019t tell him he could.\u201d</p><p>Nicky scowled at James and flung a little dirt down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nick, leave Mr. Cahill alone. Why don\u2019t you fill up Beauty\u2019s water dish, huh? Make sure it\u2019s nice and cold.\u201d</p><p>The kid trotted off obediently.</p> <p>\u201cYou better have a talk with him about going in the water,\u201d James said, turning his attention back to the ancient, splintering staircase. \u201cHe tells me he\u2019s a great swimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, and he already knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get one of those leashes they have. Make sure he doesn\u2019t decide to jump off the dock, like his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leash my child, James.\u201d Her voice was sharp. \u201cHe won\u2019t go swimming without me. He grew up at Grayhurst. He knows the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did my sister.\u201d</p><p>Parker looked away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a gentler tone. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him again. But please don\u2019t tell me to use a leash on my son. He\u2019s a good boy.\u201d</p> <p>James nodded, tore up another chunk of wood. \u201cSo how are Mr. and Mrs. Paragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous? Is that what this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m just the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the\u2014 You know what? I think I\u2019ll strangle you. With a leash. How would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die happy, so long as I was in your golden presence.\u201d He smiled at her, perversely happy to see her irritation.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and turned to go.</p><p>\u201cParker.\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2014\u201d Your kid is giving me chest pains. \u201cYour kid doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cSure he does. He likes everyone. Nicky! Come here, honey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d James muttered. The kid cantered over.</p><p>\u201cDo I get to use the nail gun?\u201d he asked, chewing on the ear of a stuffed animal.</p><p>That stuffed animal...</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to use the nail gun. Mr. Cahill might stay for lunch. We can have a picnic on the dock and maybe go swimming after that. How would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I use the nail gun then?\u201d Nicky asked.</p><p>James was only half listening. The stuffed animal was familiar. \u201cI like your rabbit,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nicky spit out the ear. \u201cHis name is Elephant. \u2019Cuz he has big ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>James looked at Parker, who suddenly felt the need to look out to sea. \u201cI think I gave you that rabbit. When you were born,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Someone else gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cahill\u2019s right, Nicky,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe brought you that in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>So she remembered.</p><p>\u201cYou brought me Elephant?\u201d Nicky repeated.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I use your nail gun, then?\u201d</p><p>Parker laughed, but Nicky was serious. \u201cSorry, pal,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nicky. Let\u2019s finish the flowers.\u201d Parker turned and walked back toward the house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d James answered. It was more mature, he was almost sure, than saying, I\u2019m not sure I like you, either.</p><p>\u201cHOW\u2019S THAT, MRS. K.?\u201d James asked, wiping sweat from his forehead. Maggie Beaumont\u2019s ancient tenant was a tyrant; this was the fourth time James had rearranged her bulky living room furniture in three days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, honey!\u201d she chirped. \u201cI\u2019m finally getting the hang of feng shui!\u201d</p><p>Or James was, as the muscle of the operation. \u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I do anything else for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve been an angel! It\u2019s true! Besides, I\u2019m having dinner with Maggie and that nice husband of hers tonight. Do you know him? Mahoney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMalone. I was at their wedding, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, dear. You\u2019re quite a good dancer. Malone, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s his name. For some reason, I can never remember!\u201d</p><p>James smiled. Mrs. K. was a sweetheart, even if she was a despot. And a spy. Still, it was kind of nice to have someone caring when he came and went.</p><p>He went upstairs to the tiny apartment, got a beer from the fridge and sat on the floor. The only furniture left was a bed, a little kitchen table and two chairs. But he\u2019d be leaving soon, so it didn\u2019t really matter.</p><p>The kid had been here for five days. Parker\u2019s stairs were nearly finished. And that was a problem, because James was running out of things to do.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to see Mary Elizabeth yesterday and sat through The Holy Rollers in 3-D! for the second time, which definitely registered him for sainthood. Had a near miss with his father, but luckily, he\u2019d caught a glimpse of his father\u2019s battered truck from Mary Elizabeth\u2019s window and said his goodbyes before dear old Dad had appeared.</p><p>He\u2019d told Dewey he\u2019d help with a few things at the bar. The door to the men\u2019s room stuck, a windstorm had blown the gutter off, a faucet leaked in the kitchen. If James was slow and lazy, he maybe had a week\u2019s worth of excuses to stay in Gideon\u2019s Cove. Real life was waiting. It was time to get back to work.</p><p>This morning, he\u2019d had a phone interview with an old crony of Harry\u2019s, who was a partner at Goldman Sachs. James was fairly sure a job offer would be coming, the old-boy network in play, despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014Harry\u2019s felony. He\u2019d have to move to New York, not that he really wanted to, but a job was a job. A buddy from law school had even offered to sublet his Brooklyn apartment for a year. It would be stupid not to take it.</p><p>Except he didn\u2019t want to leave Parker. Even the kid had his moments. Well, one moment, anyway. James had been at the hardware store this morning, shooting the shit with Rolly and Ben, and picked up a pair of lobsterman gloves for Nicky. The kid had gone wild. Wore them all morning, chasing the dog around the yard, digging with them, trying to eat lunch with them.</p><p>\u201cYou give really good presents,\u201d Parker observed. Then, as if realizing this was too intimate a thing to say, now that they weren\u2019t together anymore, she\u2019d sidled off to start the dishes.</p><p>That was about as close as they\u2019d come to a conversation lately.</p><p>A knock on the door startled him.</p><p>Speak of the devil. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, opening the door. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d She smiled. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really cute,\u201d she said, looking around at the empty rooms. He was going to have to buy a bottle of the shampoo she used and keep it around for an occasional hit, because he was incredibly pathetic. He glanced at her; she was staring at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Um, how\u2019s Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you left him two hours ago, you mean?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>Okay, so it was a stupid question. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s excellent. We had an early dinner at Lavinia\u2019s, and the two of them are playing Nintendo.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Soldier of Fortune\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Parker laughed. \u201cShe does own that one, but no. This is Mario Brothers or something. Anyway.\u201d She sat down on one of the two chairs. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Ah. So this was a booty call. There was nothing wrong with being used for sex. Right? So why was he pissed off?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. You want a beer, Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He got her a Sam Adams and poured it into a glass. This was Parker Harrington Welles, after all.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d he asked, handing her the glass.</p><p>\u201cUm, just went for a walk. Thought I\u2019d check on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to fool around, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. Uh...\u201d The tips of her ears flushed. \u201cI thought we could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to talk about?\u201d</p><p>She set her beer on the table. \u201cAre you mad at me, James?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Because the answer was, of course, yes. He hadn\u2019t realized it until now.</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Funny, he used to know how to talk to women.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you want, then?\u201d Her voice was sharp.</p><p>You. All I want is you. I want what I saw in the kitchen when Ethan was here. I want your kid to like me. I want you to love me. \u201cSex would be great, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re being an ass. I\u2019ll go now.\u201d She got up and went to the door, and if James had a pin, he would\u2019ve stuck it in his eye, because he was an idiot.</p><p>\u201cParker, wait.\u201d She stopped by the door, turned and folded her arms over her chest. Not exactly conducive to soul-baring, but who could blame her? \u201cLook,\u201d he began, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI know you and Ethan have a kid together. And I know what a great guy he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also know that when he was with you, he was in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cI fail to see why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that problem.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened a little, and her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be nothing to you, Parker. I don\u2019t have to be...ah, hell, I don\u2019t know. But I miss you. I\u2019m with you every day and I miss you, and I hate being near you and not being able to... This summer\u2019s been so...\u201d</p><p>This was careening toward idiocy. Talking sucked. He took her by the shoulders and kissed her. Hard. Pushed her against the door and kissed her, that beautiful, soft mouth, just kissed her with all the pent-up frustration that had been building in him for the past week. He slid his fingers into her cool, smooth hair and tilted her face for better access to her mouth, his kiss softening as she opened her lips and let him taste her, and please, God, he wanted her so much that his damn heart was about to burst.</p><p>She pulled back, her breathing shaky. \u201cDoes this place have a bed?\u201d she asked, and James could definitely see why people believed in prayer.</p><p>\u201cJAMES! JAMES, DEAR! I need a tiny favor!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Kandinsky\u2019s peeping voice came clearly through the heating vent, piercing the warm, drowsy fog.</p><p>\u201cIs that your other girlfriend?\u201d Parker whispered.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to keep you two apart,\u201d James said. He leaned over the bed and shouted, \u201cBe there in a few, Mrs. K.!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear! You\u2019re an angel!\u201d she chirped.</p><p>\u201cI should get back, anyway.\u201d Parker propped her head on her hand and looked at him a long moment, her face serious. \u201cYou\u2019re not nothing to me, James,\u201d she said gently, and the words felt like a gift.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d he murmured, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI do want something with you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to be honest, I have no idea how to do this. Whatever it is, it\u2019s going to be glacier-slow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like glaciers.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and there it was again, that aching pressure in his chest. Love, or a heart attack. Kind of the same thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They pulled on their clothes. James followed her to the door and kissed her, and watched as she blushed and then made her way down the stairs. She waved from the sidewalk, then walked briskly away.</p><p>He closed the door, smiling like a fool. An hour ago, he\u2019d been moody, horny and glum.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t any of those things anymore.</p><p>Life was good. Wicked good.</p> <p>\u201cJames, dear! The pretty blonde is gone! Could you help me find the remote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing, Mrs. K.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>CHANTAL HAD SHOWN the house twice, and the second couple had seemed genuinely interested. It was August now, and Parker had to face facts. Her time in Maine was winding down. She sighed, sitting down at the kitchen table, the sun streaming in through the windows.</p><p>Two nights ago, she and James and Nicky had gone to Dewey\u2019s, along with half of Gideon\u2019s Cove. Nicky had shown off his impressive belching abilities, though Lavinia had him beat in that area; Parker had held little Luke Beaumont while Chantal and Jonah danced; Maggie sat on Malone\u2019s lap to make room for Collier Rhodes, who\u2019d come in to mingle with the locals.</p> <p>And every time she\u2019d glanced at James, he seemed to be looking at her, a little smile playing on his face.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t slept together since she\u2019d gone to his apartment. There\u2019d been some very hot groping on the couch after Nicky had fallen asleep one night\u2014the things her boy toy could do with his hands, without even taking off her clothes, should be documented and sent to men everywhere\u2014but James didn\u2019t seem to mind that it hadn\u2019t gone further. \u201cAnother satisfied customer,\u201d he\u2019d murmured against her neck, and if she hadn\u2019t been so weak and trembly, she would\u2019ve smacked him. Ended up kissing him instead. He\u2019d left with a grin on his face.</p><p>During the day, James was around, putting on some final touches to spruce up the little house. The fresh shingles, green tin roof and the pots of flowers had sweetened the place; it might not be a jewel, but it definitely looked like a house. Not a shack.</p><p>As for Nicky, well, if he didn\u2019t adore James, he didn\u2019t hate him, either. But while James did have a knack for bringing her son great presents\u2014the lobsterman gloves, a key chain flashlight and a shovel that folded\u2014he wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable around her boy. She caught him watching Nick a lot, almost the way a person once bitten by a dog might watch a puppy, as if he wanted to like her son but wasn\u2019t quite sure how to.</p><p>But real life was waiting. Parker had to get a job. Since the ridiculous Ark Angels, she hadn\u2019t managed to send in another idea for a series, and the weekly prodding emails from her editor only made her sweaty. The creative part of her brain felt utterly empty.</p><p>We were your one and onlies, Spike informed her.</p> <p>The truth was, she didn\u2019t really miss writing\u2014Thanks a lot! the HRs said, pouting. She loved working with Lavinia, though; Vin had passed most of the duties off to her and spent her time smoking and reminiscing on the great loves of her life. Her cousin adored Nicky, and the two of them spent a lot of time drawing pictures of swords and maces, Nicky\u2019s latest passion.</p><p>Another thing to miss about Gideon\u2019s Cove. Lavinia.</p><p>But Parker missed Mackerly, too; missed Lucy and the sweet little town, the bakery, the Mirabellis. And now, she actually had a place to live. The rental deal had gone through, according to the email she\u2019d gotten earlier.</p><p>\u201cNicky!\u201d she called. \u201cCome see our new place. The internet\u2019s back up.\u201d James had brought her an antenna for her Mac, so she no longer had to traipse to the library to go online.</p><p>Nick came running into the kitchen; James followed, smelling sharply of wood and paint. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d her son demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about three blocks from Daddy\u2019s restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be a chef,\u201d Nicky announced. \u201cLike Daddy. Or a spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr both,\u201d James said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah! Both! Which one\u2019s my room, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>She clicked on a photo. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like this one. See the slanty ceilings!\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s eyes widened in a most gratifying manner. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fort! Or jail! Like where Grandpa Harry lives!\u201d</p><p>Okay. Change of subject called for. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the yard,\u201d she said, clicking on another picture. Tidy and tiny, filled with flowers.</p><p>\u201cI could definitely hide there,\u201d Nick said. \u201cMommy, put my room back on, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She clicked on the photo of his room again. A whole lot smaller than his room at Grayhurst, not that he seemed to care. \u201cWhen are we going back?\u201d he asked. \u201cI miss Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably next week, honey. Right, James?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him, feeling a pang already. But he\u2019d be heading back to Rhode Island, too, so they\u2019d still see each other. They just hadn\u2019t worked out the particulars.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re pretty much done,\u201d he confirmed. His face was somber.</p><p>\u201cCan I try the nail gun? Please? I\u2019m really careful,\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at James, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOnly with James holding it, too,\u201d she told her son.</p><p>\u201cYes! Let\u2019s make something, James! Come on, come on!\u201d He grabbed James\u2019s hand and towed him outside. James glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he answered. He smiled, and her heart lurched. Her guy, her son, together. She sneaked outside, camera in hand.</p><p>James was kneeling behind Nicky, putting on safety glasses. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to shoot your eye out, so you always wear these,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI love these,\u201d Nicky answered reverently.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now we\u2019re gonna hold the nail gun up like this\u2014nope, I\u2019ll hold the shingle, okay? You put the gun right there, where the nail\u2019s gonna go...good boy, now squeeze\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bam! The nail went in and Nicky flinched, dropping the gun. James caught it. \u201cGood job, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d Nicky\u2019s face was alight with joy. Men and their tools, Parker thought with a smile. She raised her camera and took a stealth picture.</p><p>\u201cCan I do more?\u201d Nicky asked James.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nice and careful, now, and try not to drop the gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes a loud noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Parker went back inside, feeling a wicked case of the Warm Fuzzles. Nauseating term, excellent feeling. Her menfolk, bonding. It\u2019d be good for them both.</p><p>The photo of Nicky\u2019s attic room was still on the computer screen.</p><p>A jail, like where Grandpa Harry lives.</p><p>A bit hesitantly, Parker picked up her phone.</p><p>James hadn\u2019t mentioned Harry lately. She herself hadn\u2019t talked to her father for a while. Well. Being a minimum-security place, inmates were allowed to get phone calls pretty liberally. She figured she\u2019d give it a shot.</p><p>\u201cHarry Welles, please? This is his daughter speaking.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, her father\u2019s commanding voice came on the line. \u201cParker. Is anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry. No, everything\u2019s fine. I had a second, figured I\u2019d call.\u201d A breeze blew in from the cove, fluttering the kitchen curtains.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d There was a pause. Another bang from the nail gun came from the side of the house. \u201cHow\u2019s my grandson?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wonderful. He\u2019s here, in Maine with me. He had a great time in Yosemite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Another breeze. Nice day, the sun shining, temps in the upper seventies.</p><p>\u201cSo how are you, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot enough to read?\u201d It was the only question that came to mind.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Parker glanced at the computer. \u201cNicky and I found a place to live. In Mackerly. We\u2019ll be heading back next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. He\u2019s starting school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. After Labor Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish him luck for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything else to say. She waited to see if her father would offer any other subject, but there was only silence. \u201cWell, take care, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>A memory of her father picking her up from Stanhope Academy on the Upper West Side came to her. She\u2019d been in second grade, wore a white shirt and green plaid skirt as a uniform. Her father rarely came to get her from school, and the sight of him there, so unexpected and so impressive, had practically lifted her off the pavement. \u201cDaddy!\u201d she\u2019d said, running to him, and she remembered how small her hand felt in his. How safe Harry had made her feel.</p><p>Back then, her father had been her favorite person in the world.</p><p>She swallowed the unexpected lump in her throat.</p><p>Parker went back outside. \u201cBoys,\u201d she said, \u201cI think we should go on a picnic.\u201d</p><p>TWO HOURS LATER, Parker, James, Nicky and Lavinia were at a lake somewhere west of Gideon\u2019s Cove. Beauty and Nicky were already wet, having dashed in the second they\u2019d gotten there. Nick hurled sticks as far as his little arm would let him, which wasn\u2019t terribly far, but Beauty charged in each time. James and Vin were sitting on a blanket, laughing. Those two were BFFs, practically.</p><p>Pine trees surrounded the lake in a dense wall, broken only by the occasional boulder. There was a dock about thirty yards out, and three teenage boys had canoed out there. They were shoving each other and laughing, falling in occasionally, diving like otters, constantly in motion. She snapped a few photos. Maybe this could be her new job\u2014photographer. Or, given her actual skill set, cashier at Wal-Mart, if Wal-Mart would kindly hire her.</p><p>\u201cMom! Mommy! Watch me! I\u2019m a dolphin! I\u2019m dolphin diving!\u201d Nicky yelled. She watched, laughed and snapped a few shots. \u201cNow I\u2019m a shark, Mommy! See? See my fin! I\u2019m eating a seal!\u201d Nicky thrashed around, causing Beauty to yelp in ecstasy.</p><p>The sun beat on her hair. No need for highlights after this summer, though she probably had a few new wrinkles after all the wind and sunshine. A few more muscles, too, though the eleven pounds hadn\u2019t gone anywhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Nick said, sloshing onto shore. \u201cVinny, can I please have some chips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, gorgeous,\u201d Lavinia said, offering Nick the bag. Parker looked out at the deep blue lake, so pure and inviting.</p><p>\u201cVin? Want to go swimming?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d her cousin answered.</p><p>Parker sighed. \u201cJames, that leaves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d James echoed.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Nicky said, falling to his knees and digging in the sand like a dog. Beauty joined the effort.</p><p>\u201cCome on, James,\u201d Parker said. She took off her sweatshirt and slid out of her shorts.</p><p>\u201cThat bathing suit is not fair,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou look like one of those whatchamacallits,\u201d Vin said, taking off her post-cataract-surgery sunglasses. \u201cSports Illustrated models.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Just with stretch marks and the cellulite I got for my last birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d Vin said. \u201cGo with her, Jamie. Buddy system and all.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared, James?\u201d Nicky asked, pausing in his digging.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cReally? But you\u2019re a grown-up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrown-ups can be scared, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swim a lot,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI could probably swim ten or thirty miles. It\u2019s not scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not scary. I only think it is,\u201d James said.</p><p>Parker studied his face. \u201cHave you been swimming at all since...then?\u201d she asked quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come now?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. Glanced at Nick.</p><p>\u201cWhoever goes swimming with me gets ten kisses,\u201d Parker announced. \u201cNicky? Want ten kisses?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kiss me all the time. I want ten dollars. Or ten lobster claws. Or ten nail guns!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavinia?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with the kid. Ten bucks, maybe. For fifty bucks, definitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>He looked out to the water. \u201cHow far do I have to swim for these ten kisses?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cTo the raft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t kiss you, James,\u201d Nicky explained, his tone tolerant. \u201cShe\u2019s not your mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, you two,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the kid.\u201d</p><p>James glanced at Lavinia, then back at Parker. With a sigh, he pulled his T-shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re talking perfect,\u201d Lavinia said, lighting up a cigarette and squinting appreciatively. \u201cVery nice, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Parker took his hand and towed him to the water\u2019s edge, where he stopped. \u201cCome on, James. You can do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She went in up to her knees, still holding his hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>His jaw was tight, and no smile lightened his face at the moment. Took a few steps in. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d she said, going in a bit deeper, not letting go of his hand. He followed, reluctantly.</p><p>When they were waist deep, Parker stopped to let him get acclimated. His face was a little pale under his tan. She swam out a few feet, then turned to look at him. \u201cHarvard Varsity Swim Team, James. Third Olympic alternate. Red Cross certified in lifeguarding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery impressive,\u201d he murmured, his eyes on the raft. The three boys had gotten back in their canoe and were now fishing in the middle of the lake.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Parker swam out a little farther and started to tread water. \u201cSwim to me, beautiful man,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were dark and a little tormented. \u201cNot fair,\u201d he said, and with that, he dived under the water. He surfaced just past her and swam, steadily, if a little desperately. One yard. Four. Ten. Parker kept pace easily off his right, her eyes never leaving him. When he reached the raft, he grabbed onto the ladder and waited for her to get up first, then followed, water streaming, his hair nearly black with the wetness, drops of moisture sliding down the planes of his face. He didn\u2019t look at her, just sat, breathing hard.</p><p>Parker slipped her hand in his. He was shaking. Probably not from cold.</p><p>\u201cYou did it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHated every second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did it,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look at her, just stared back at the shore. Nicky waved. \u201cSee? It\u2019s not scary!\u201d he yelled, and James waved back.</p><p>The planks of the raft were dry and gray, and the water lapped softly at the edges. A seagull called from overhead. Lavinia coughed, then said something to Nicky. The sound of his laughter floated out to them.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d said James. \u201cI have to swim back, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid so,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Finally, he looked at her, squinting a little in the sun, and studied her face. \u201cWhen do I get to collect my prize?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced at Nicky, who was occupied with digging. \u201cNow works for me,\u201d she said, her legs tingling a little.</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her, a long, lingering kiss. \u201cThat\u2019s one,\u201d she said when he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cEw! Gross!\u201d her son yelled from shore. Shoot. Busted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Nick,\u201d James yelled back, grinning. \u201cI should\u2019ve asked for ten dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woulda held out for at least twenty,\u201d Lavinia called.</p><p>James looked back at Parker, the drops of water sliding down his brown skin. His smile faded, and his eyes were serious. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he pushed off the raft and was in the water, swimming back to the safety of the shore, leaving her feeling fragile and precious and completely new.</p><p>FROM WHERE HE LAY on the dock back home, James could hear Parker singing \u201cHome on the Range,\u201d which was apparently her son\u2019s favorite bedtime song. Lavinia had left an hour or so before, and Parker\u2019s voice and the gentle slap of the waves were the only sounds. Overhead, the sky was a dark purple, a sliver of crescent moon slicing through the clouds that slipped past.</p><p>Happiness wasn\u2019t a feeling he was used to. He\u2019d been pretty content the past few years, grateful to Harry, glad to be able to provide for Mary Elizabeth. He\u2019d had fun, sure\u2014Leah had been fun, as had been dinners with Harry, playing basketball with the guys on Saturday mornings, catching the occasional baseball game.</p><p>But that was nothing compared with this. Today, he\u2019d been part of something.</p><p>A family.</p><p>The kid wasn\u2019t his, but the little guy\u2019s wriggling delight at finally being able to use the nail gun, the way he\u2019d grabbed James\u2019s hand...it had touched some part of James he\u2019d thought had been erased eighteen years ago.</p><p>But now, the time before the tragedy kept running through his head. Christmas mornings, fishing trips, running for the school bus with his three brothers, telling Mary Elizabeth stories well past her bedtime. He\u2019d been part of a family once, and when that family fell apart because of him, he\u2019d assumed that was it. When you\u2019re told over and over by the father you once worshipped that you don\u2019t deserve to be loved...it sinks in. It seems true.</p><p>James had simply thought that some people were cut out for family life. Others, like him, were not.</p><p>Until today. Today, he\u2019d had a family\u2014Lavinia and Parker and her son. Today, a kid had held his hand. By the time they\u2019d gotten back from the lake, Nicky had been sound asleep in his booster seat, and James had lifted him out, cradling the little guy\u2019s sweaty head, shifting his limp weight onto his shoulder and carrying him inside as Parker held the door. The four of them had had hot dogs and salad for dinner, and he and Vin had done the dishes while Parker and Nicky fished off the dock.</p><p>It felt better than he could have ever imagined.</p><p>Maybe, he thought, maybe it was time to let the past go and stop blaming himself for Mary Elizabeth. Maybe being an irresponsible twelve-year-old kid didn\u2019t warrant a life sentence.</p><p>Earlier today, he\u2019d gotten the call from New York. The job offer had been finalized, the package details had come through today; the pay was close to what Harry paid him, signing bonus, sweet benefits...all thanks to Harry\u2019s recommendation. Last month, he would\u2019ve taken that job without hesitation. Last week, even.</p><p>Things were different now. For him, certainly. For Parker, too. Whatever she wanted, however she wanted it to be, that was all fine with him, so long as he could be near her.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Kind of a caveman word. It fit, though. She was his. He\u2019d seen it in her eyes today on the dock.</p><p>He heard the back door close, and Beauty came trotting down the new stairs and flopped down next to him on the blanket. Then the dock rocked a little harder, and the other beauty came, her long hair down, wearing a white dress, her feet bare. \u201cShoo, puppy,\u201d she said, and the good dog obeyed. Parker sat down next to him. \u201cNicky\u2019s asleep. Tired from all that swimming.\u201d She paused. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t wake up if there was a buffalo stampede through his room. I\u2019m just mentioning that.\u201d She was smiling.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d He felt himself smiling, too, and reached up to touch her cheek.</p><p>Parker reached down and started unbuttoning his shirt. Yep. Best day ever.</p><p>But next week was looming; New York wanted an answer by Friday, and today was Wednesday. He put his hand over hers. \u201cParker, I should tell you something.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes to his. \u201cSo serious, Thing One. You\u2019re not pregnant, are you?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cUh...no. Are you?\u201d He jerked into a sitting position, the same icy rush of terror he\u2019d felt today just before diving under the water washing over him.</p><p>\u201cMe? No, no, I was...I was kidding.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Great. Try not to kill me, Parker.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed a little. Shit. \u201cBut if I was\u2014I\u2019m not, don\u2019t worry\u2014would that be horrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d These were the conversations that doomed many a man. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, no. Not horrible.\u201d</p><p>Beauty, maybe guessing that James had given the wrong answer, crept closer to him and curled at his side.</p><p>\u201cNot horrible.\u201d Parker glanced out at the water. \u201cOkay, maybe this isn\u2019t time for a big conversation, but maybe it is, too. Look, obviously the summer-fling idea has grown into...more. And this afternoon at the lake, I believe you made a certain declaration.\u201d She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not proposing or anything, James.\u201d She squeezed her little finger. \u201cI just assumed you meant in a long-term, monogamous kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t just drunk with fear?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWell, there was that. And the sight of you in your bikini. Though, admittedly, you look better out of it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, then looked down at her hands. \u201cWell, someday, maybe, I could see possibly having another baby. Adopting, maybe. Or the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cNo, James, with the guy who rotates my tires. I mean, I\u2019m not asking for anything carved in stone, okay? But I like children. And I don\u2019t want to rule out\u2014 Well, I\u2019m thinking someday in the distant future, I mean, not too distant, since I\u2019m thirty-five. But not tomorrow, either.\u201d She was squeezing her little finger half to death. \u201cYou know what? I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I have no idea how we got on this subject. Can we forget I ever said anything?\u201d She pulled her hair onto one side of her neck and looked out at the lobster boats.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Now who the hell said that?</p><p>She blinked a few times. Looked back at him. He didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in. Like, you\u2019d be interested in a family. Maybe. Someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He remembered the first time he\u2019d seen her, holding her son.</p><p>Pictured the scene again. This time, though, the baby was his, too, and he was the one at her side.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>He took her hand and kissed it, then looked at her face. \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou wearing anything under that dress?\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing, the sound bouncing out over the water. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find out, Thing One?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>THE RUMBLE OF A TRUCK in the driveway the next morning made Parker\u2019s heart lift. The sight of James, clad in jeans and a Joe\u2019s Diner T-shirt, had her break into a little trot. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, ruffling his hair.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he echoed, grinning the I\u2019ve seen you na**d look. Heck yeah!</p><p>Nicky was in the yard with Beauty. \u201cJames! Watch this. Beauty, roll over! Roll over! Roll over! Like this!\u201d He demonstrated rolling in the grass as the dog yelped happily.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Parker said, surreptitiously brushing James\u2019s hand with her fingertips, \u201cI thought I\u2019d go see my father today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he said, his smiley eyes so dark and happy. \u201cHe\u2019ll be glad to see you. But listen, when you get back, I want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. We never did get to that last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile flashed again. \u201cNo. We didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it wait till I get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d His eyes dropped to her mouth. He\u2019s totally into you! the female Holy Rollers sighed. \u201cYou guys have a good time,\u201d he said, still looking at her mouth.</p><p>\u201cActually, I figured I\u2019d leave Nicky with you.\u201d</p> <p>His smile dropped. \u201cIsn\u2019t Lavinia around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s around. If you need help, you could give her a call. But I figured you boys could hang out. Pee outside, hammer things, do what men do.\u201d</p><p>James ran a hand through his hair. \u201cOkay. But I...I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, feed him once in a while, and if he asks if he can drive your truck, the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m, um, qualified.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are,\u201d she said softly. \u201cJames. He\u2019s the person I love most in the world. I wouldn\u2019t leave him with just anyone.\u201d He didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cBesides,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019d be good for him to spend some time with you.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded. \u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank me when I get back. If you still have the capacity for speech, that is.\u201d She turned to the yard. \u201cHey, Nicky! James is going to stay with you today while I run a few errands, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nicky bolted up from the grass. \u201cYes! Can we use the nail gun? Can we? Huh? Please, James? Please? Yes? Is it yes? We can do it now, if you want. Do you want to? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s mood was light as she drove the Volvo southwest. Where the talk of babies had come from last night, she had no idea. Oh, please. It was totally Freudian, Spike said. Your subconscious wanted to have the baby talk, and bang. The baby talk occurs.</p><p>\u201cI love babies,\u201d Parker said aloud.</p> <p>No matter what, though, it was nice to think about the future. Their future. I\u2019m in, he\u2019d said. Parker could see where he\u2019d be hesitant and unsure. But she\u2019d seen his face as he lifted her sleeping child from the car. She\u2019d also seen what it took for him to swim to the raft yesterday. James might not have any idea how big his heart was, but she did.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of her face in the rearview mirror. She was smiling.</p><p>So this was love. Funny how it had crept up on her, this feeling. Sure, Thing One had always been attractive, and yes, they\u2019d had that shag three years ago. But it was odd; she almost couldn\u2019t remember him before, when he was her father\u2019s puppy. Now when she thought of him, she pictured his smile, his big, work-roughened hands and kind eyes. Now, she was thinking of him as...well, hers.</p><p>Yep. Hers. Nice word. Aware that she was now not only smiling but also humming, and possibly purring, Parker pulled off the highway. She had time for a stop, and Harry would appreciate the gift. Maybe. Hopefully.</p><p>NEW HAMPSHIRE NORTH SIDE Correctional Facility looked like a big box store. The men wore blue work shirts and pants, resembling custodians more than convicts. The visiting room was a cafeteria-like space, the tables and chairs bolted to the floor.</p><p>When Harry came in, Parker almost didn\u2019t recognize him. No power suit, no sleek haircut, his gray hair now thinner and a bit scraggly. He\u2019d lost a little weight, too, and his face was slack. \u201cDad,\u201d she said, standing up. The word surprised her.</p><p>\u201cParker. How are you?\u201d They looked at each other for a second, not sure what to do next.</p><p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d the guard said, relieving them both of the awkwardness of expectations. They sat. There were several other families in the room\u2014a man and his wife and three children were playing backgammon; a couple murmured in the corner, leaning toward each other so that only an inch or two separated them.</p> <p>\u201cSo this isn\u2019t too bad, is it?\u201d Parker asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the Drake,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pulled the envelope from her bag. \u201cBrought you some pictures.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s face softened as he looked. They were of Nicky; she\u2019d stopped at a CVS on the long drive in and had them printed. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten big,\u201d Harry murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She tried to remember the last time Harry had seen her son and couldn\u2019t. Easter, maybe. \u201cHe says he has a loose tooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell, but he says so.\u201d</p><p>Her father smiled faintly, still gazing at the photos. \u201cHe looks like you.\u201d</p><p>Parker snorted. \u201cNo, he looks like Ethan. Almost exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Very much like you at that age.\u201d Harry glanced at her, suddenly wary, as if he\u2019d crossed a line. \u201cWell. A good-looking boy, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He put the photos back and passed them to her. \u201cThank you for showing me.\u201d</p><p>She slid the packet back toward him. \u201cThey\u2019re for you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well. Thank you even more.\u201d He looked at the envelope, resting his fingertips on it. \u201cHave you told him I\u2019m in jail?\u201d</p><p>Parker gave a half nod. \u201cI told him you were in a time-out for grown-ups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could talk to him sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That would be nice. Um, I did tell him you were in here for being greedy and breaking some rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Harry said, studying the table. An awkward silence fell.</p><p>Okay. So they\u2019d covered Nicky, and it was reassuring that Harry had wanted to talk to him. He might not be the best grandfather in the world, God knew, but he wasn\u2019t the worst, either. Maybe his time in here would help her father figure out some priorities.</p><p>On to the next topic. Parker racked her brain for something neutral to talk about. \u201cSo what do you do in here to pass the time?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cI read. There\u2019s a gym. Sometimes we have television privileges. Go to meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlcoholics Anonymous.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Okay, yes, she knew her father could put away the wine and scotch. Once, when Nicky was a baby, James had driven Harry to Grayhurst and put him to bed, but Parker\u2019d been too busy with trying to soothe her colicky child to really take note. Figured it was a case of overindulgence, not really alcoholism. \u201cAre you... Is it really a problem? Your drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Parker, it was AA or cribbage, and you know how I hate card games.\u201d He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cMy name is Harry, and I\u2019m an alcoholic. Didn\u2019t really realize it till I had the DTs in here, but yes, I have a problem. I hid it well,\u201d he added, reading her mind.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, probably since college, technically, though I suppose it got worse after your mother left me.\u201d</p><p>Parker shut her mouth, which was hanging open. \u201cThis is a bit of a bombshell, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I suppose that\u2019s good.\u201d Harry drummed his fingers on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Mom,\u201d Parker said, still a bit stunned. \u201cShe came to visit.\u201d</p><p>Harry pursed his lips. Parker wasn\u2019t sure, but that might\u2019ve been regret in his eyes. \u201cAnd how is she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Another silence fell. She glanced at the clock; she\u2019d been here ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s James, by the way?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>Parker felt her face warm. \u201cHe\u2019s good. Um, he\u2019s been fantastic this summer.\u201d Should she tell her father they were together? Or maybe that should come from James. She wasn\u2019t really sure how to handle that topic.</p><p>\u201cHas he started yet?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cStarted what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis job.\u201d</p><p>She felt her stomach tighten as if against a blow. \u201cHis job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Mitch Stravitz, remember him? At Goldman? No? Well, he\u2019s been to the house a number of times. Came for that wine tasting where we went through the case of the \u201982 Margaux.\u201d Harry smiled in fond remembrance. \u201cAnyway, he was happy to do me a favor. This whole insider-trading charge was completely blown out of proportion. Once I\u2019m back, it\u2019ll be like nothing ever happened. Sort of like the Mafia. Everyone does their stint in the joint.\u201d Harry laughed his client laugh, that low, insincere Hollywood laugh.</p><p>Parker was finding it hard to draw a deep breath. \u201cHang on, Harry. James is working at Goldman Sachs? In New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the legal department. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know when he starts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week, so far as I know.\u201d Harry frowned at her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention it, I gather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Parker said calmly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. He got an apartment and everything. I figured he\u2019d have told you. Is he still in Maine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Still in Maine. For now.\u201d She forced herself to smile. \u201cHow\u2019s the food here?\u201d</p><p>THE DRIVE BACK to Gideon\u2019s Cove was much longer than the drive down had been. Or so it seemed.</p><p>So while Parker had been talking about a long-term monogamous relationship with a possible baby in the future, James had been planning to trot down to Manhattan. He had a job waiting for him. He had an apartment. On the one hand, he said he loved her. On the other, he was moving. And he\u2019d never said a word. Maybe that\u2019s what tonight\u2019s talk was about.</p><p>She could see the future spreading bleakly in front of her. She\u2019d get a job, share Nicky with Ethan and Lucy. James would come up a weekend or two, but he\u2019d be busy. Time together would be harder to manage. In the end, he\u2019d feel guilty and burdened, and she\u2019d feel bitter and resentful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>It\u2019s just that last night, out on the dock...it had seemed so... Oh, crikey, how many women read into these things? How many men said what a woman wanted to hear, simply to make the moment easier?</p><p>Well. She and James were going to have that talk when she got home, that was for sure. She checked her phone. No new messages. Just as well. This was a talk to have in person, and besides, she was entering the area where cell-phone service started to cut out.</p><p>The Holy Rollers were silent. Polly patted her shoulder, but no one had anything to offer.</p><p>When she finally came into Gideon\u2019s Cove, the town seemed oddly vacant. No one was in front of Dewey\u2019s, and almost no cars lined Main Street. The sun was sinking into the sea, one last ray cutting right into her eyes as she drove past the fisheries parking lot and onto Shoreline Drive</p><p>Then she saw the lights.</p><p>Fire trucks, the ambulance, a dozen pickup trucks and cars, in front of...in front of...in front of her house.</p><p>Malone saw her coming, opened the door for her before she\u2019d come to a complete stop. She got out, but her legs buckled, and he caught her. \u201cNicky,\u201d she managed to say.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s missing,\u201d Malone said in his rumbling voice. \u201cWhole town\u2019s looking for him.\u201d</p><p>SHE COULD SEE EVERYTHING, but nothing had any impact. The fire chief had sad eyes. Maggie was holding her hand so hard it hurt. Lavinia choked on sobs, sitting on the runner of a fire truck. Rolly, Ben and Stuart stood to one side, saying nothing. James was wet. Jonah Beaumont pulled on his scuba gear, his face white. Collier Rhodes was on his phone.</p><p>Parker could hear herself answering questions, but she felt so deep inside herself that it was like looking out from the bottom of a deep, dark mine shaft. She was feeling for her son\u2014feeling for him, reaching for him. Where are you, sweet boy, come to Mommy\u2014</p><p>\u201cA blue T-shirt with a dinosaur skeleton on the front. It glows in the dark. Brown shorts,\u201d she said in answer to a question. Please, God. Please. Please. Anything but this.</p><p>Her son had been gone for two hours. Two hours, and she hadn\u2019t even known. They\u2019d tried calling her, but the damn cell-phone service sucked up here in this miserable, godforsaken county. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dive team was in the water.</p><p>The dive team was in the water.</p><p>Please, God, don\u2019t let him be in there, but the images were too clear, his little body being pulled up, limp and white, a tiny casket, Ethan devastated, their beautiful boy, gone. Parker choked, started to gasp, her breath yanking in and out of her chest. Maggie hugged her, hard. \u201cEasy, Parker, easy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>That\u2019s right. She didn\u2019t have the luxury of her own feelings. Her son needed her. She would not fall apart now.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d she said, her gaze glancing off James, who looked decades older. She put her hands over her ears, muffling the sounds of radio and talking. Closing her eyes, she thought.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the nail gun?\u201d she asked. The chief glanced at someone else, a look that clearly said, She\u2019s losing it. \u201cIs the nail gun around?\u201d</p><p>James bolted into the darkness. A second later, he was back. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my truck. That\u2019s where I left it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so he took it. The nail gun is with Nicky, so he probably went off to make something.\u201d He could\u2019ve gone down to the dock to drive nails. He could\u2019ve fallen in. \u201cHas anyone talked to Ethan? Maybe Nicky called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d James said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t heard from Nick. He\u2019s getting a flight up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere was he the last time you saw him?\u201d she asked James, forcing herself to look at him, and in that moment, she hated him, God help her, and hated herself, as well, because she\u2019d left her baby, her boy, her son, with him, and James had lost him.</p><p>James flinched, as if he knew what she was thinking. \u201cI was making dinner. Macaroni and cheese. He was on the couch, playing with his little computer thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNintendo.\u201d God, she\u2019d left her son with a man who knew nothing about children, who\u2019d told her he knew nothing about children, and she wouldn\u2019t listen, she did what she wanted\u2014</p><p>\u201c\u2014and then he was...gone.\u201d His voice broke. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t matter. Only Nicky mattered.</p><p>\u201cDid you go anywhere today? To the hardware store? To the harbor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he went to the Pines,\u201d Lavinia suggested in a wobbly voice. \u201cI told him his great-great grandfather built the place.\u201d</p><p>The chief dispatched a crew to go up the street. Collier squeezed Parker\u2019s shoulder and went with them.</p><p>It was fully dark now.</p><p>What did Nicky love? What would make him go off...?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hiding,\u201d Parker said abruptly. \u201cHe hides all the time. He loves forts, and he took the nail gun and he\u2019s hiding in a fort somewhere. Where\u2019s Beauty? Maybe she\u2019s with him.\u201d</p><p>Beauty, who never barked at strangers; Beauty, who hid when people came into the house.</p><p>\u201cCall the dog,\u201d the chief instructed. \u201cPeople, quiet down!\u201d The crowd, which had grown to maybe fifty or so, grew silent. \u201cCut the trucks.\u201d The growl of the town\u2019s three fire trucks died abruptly. \u201cGo ahead, Miss Welles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty!\u201d Her voice was quavering and weak. \u201cBeauty, girl! Come on!\u201d</p> <p>Everyone was silent, listening.</p><p>\u201cBeauty! Come on, girl! Let\u2019s go for a swim! Come on, Beauty!\u201d Better, if edged with hysteria.</p><p>There was nothing but the sound of wind and water.</p><p>Oh, please, God, please. She tried again. \u201cBeauty! Come on, sweetie! Let\u2019s go for a swim!\u201d</p><p>Then she heard it\u2014the whine of her faithful little dog.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d someone yelled, and Parker was running. People were shining lights at the bottom of the house, where James had put up latticework so no skunks could get under there. But there was a shallow scraping in the dirt, enough so that a child and a dog could fit under there. James ripped off a great chunk of the lattice, and Parker grabbed a flashlight and wriggled under, spiderwebs veiling her hair, sand in her pants. Then her light caught the reflection of her dog\u2019s eyes, and she saw Nicky\u2019s head, the cowlick he got from Ethan. \u201cNicky?\u201d she called, reaching out to touch him. He was warm. He was breathing. \u201cNicky, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Her son opened his eyes. \u201cMommy! You\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got him,\u201d she called over her shoulder, and a cheer went up from the crowd. \u201cNick, we\u2019ve been looking for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep in my fort,\u201d he said, rubbing his eyes. \u201cMommy? Why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>LATER, WHEN EVERYONE had patted her son, when Chief Tatum had given him a plastic fire hat, when the yard and road had cleared, when Ethan had been called, when Nicky had been fed and bathed, Parker just held her son on her lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nicky said for the millionth time.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you tell me if you\u2019re going to hide,\u201d Parker said, kissing his head.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here.\u201d There was a hard edge of resentment in his little voice.</p><p>No. She wasn\u2019t. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told James, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like James,\u201d Nicky said sullenly, and Parker knew he blamed James for all the fuss, for Mommy being scared and crying. \u201cI want to go home and live with Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going home in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I hate it here. And I wanna live with Daddy.\u201d He started to cry.</p><p>She kissed his head and held him a little tighter. \u201cListen, honey. Everyone makes mistakes. It\u2019s what you do after the mistake that really matters. You don\u2019t hide without telling a grown-up, and you never go somewhere you don\u2019t know is safe. Promise me, Nicky. It\u2019s really, really important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I promise.\u201d He took a shuddering breath and snuggled closer. \u201cI love you, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, I love you, too. So, so much.\u201d</p><p>She held him until he fell asleep, breathing in the scent of baby shampoo. Then she put him in her bed and got in beside him, calling quietly to Beauty to jump up next to them.</p><p>Thank you, God. She could\u2019ve been in the E.R. right now. She could\u2019ve been watching a boat drag the harbor. She could\u2019ve been picking out a little casket. Oh, Jesus, thank you for sparing me that.</p><p>Little sobs jerked out of her as she smoothed Nicky\u2019s hair. Beauty put her muzzle on Nicky\u2019s leg and watched with her mournful eyes as Parker wept.</p><p>Her cell phone buzzed, and she looked at the screen. Ethan.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispered. They\u2019d already spoken twice since Nicky had been found.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>Ethan exhaled slowly. \u201cGood. He sounded scared before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was...intense.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a long minute. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to have you both home,\u201d Ethan said eventually.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Ethan sighed. \u201cThis hiding thing...it can\u2019t happen again. He did it in Muir Woods, ducked behind a tree, didn\u2019t answer when we called, and I almost lost it. Gave him a mammoth lecture, took away dessert, made him go to bed early. I thought he was over that phase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Seeing everyone looking for him drove the point home, I think.\u201d She traced the outline of their son\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d There was another silence. \u201cPoor James. He must\u2019ve been scared shitless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I hope you get some sleep tonight, Parks. Here, Lucy wants to say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Lucy said, and the sound of her voice caused more tears to flow, but when Parker hung up sometime later, she was calmer. These things happened. Parents lost years off their life simply by being parents. The vision of the dive team in the water, looking for her son...that would haunt her forever. But Nicky was safe, and nothing else mattered.</p><p>The exhaustion of the day caught up with her in a wallop, and suddenly her eyes burned. She turned out the bedside lamp and cuddled her son close.</p><p>Just before she fell asleep, something clicked.</p><p>James had been wet because he\u2019d gone in the water, looking for her son.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>JAMES LAY AWAKE all night, adrenaline still flying through his veins, his heart stuttering and racing in fits.</p><p>The day with Nicky had been pretty okay, up until then. They\u2019d gone for a walk on the beach and climbed the rocks exposed by low tide. Had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. James had read Hungry, Hungry Sharks four times in a row. They\u2019d played hangman and tic-tac-toe. Drew pictures. Told knock-knock jokes.</p><p>The whole time, James had watched the kid like a hawk. Didn\u2019t let him out of his sight. Said no to every dangerous activity the kid suggested, which had ruled out climbing trees, jumping on Parker\u2019s bed, a game of hide-and-seek and swimming.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s use the nail gun,\u201d the kid had suggested.</p><p>James had considered it. Pictured taking Nicky to the E.R. because he had a nail through his hand. \u201cMaybe tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The kid pushed out his bottom lip. \u201cYou kissed my mom.\u201d It was an accusation.</p><p>James took a slow breath. \u201cRight. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>What do you say to that? \u201cWell, she\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. Your mother.\u201d</p><p>And the kid had seemed satisfied with that. Then he\u2019d asked if he could play his little handheld computer game, and James said sure, he had to make a quick phone call. Went into the kitchen, called Goldman Sachs and told Mitch Stravitz no thanks.</p><p>Because Parker Harrington Welles loved him, and he wasn\u2019t going to move a hundred and fifty miles away from her. No way.</p><p>He hung up, gave the mac and cheese a stir, glanced into the living room. The kid was gone.</p><p>At first, James had thought Nicky had gone to the bathroom. A minute or two later, he knocked. No answer. Opened the door. No kid. \u201cNicky?\u201d he\u2019d called.</p><p>Not in either bedroom. Not in the kitchen. Not on the patio. Not in the yard, not in the truck. James heard his voice growing louder, then more desperate.</p><p>The dock.</p><p>The water had been as cold as death, and it was hard to see, the salt stinging his eyes. Rocks. A beer can. A school of fish, darting away into the dark, deep water.</p><p>The lake water had been much clearer the day Mary Elizabeth had almost drowned. Her little hand, so peaceful almost, no resistance left in it, like an underwater plant, drifting in the current\u2014</p><p>\u201cNicky!\u201d he heard himself yell, his voice hoarse with terror. \u201cNick!\u201d</p><p>Two more dives before he realized he needed help. Called 911. Went back in the water until the dive team came and James was shaking so hard with cold that he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Then Parker\u2019s face, utterly white in the deepening gloom of the night. You lost my son, her eyes said. You killed my baby.</p><p>And then she found him. All by herself, she figured out what the entire fire and police department and twenty-five volunteers couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The little bastard was hiding.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear James calling you?\u201d she\u2019d asked sharply, even as she clutched him against her.</p><p>\u201cWe were playing! It was a game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, don\u2019t be too hard on the little guy,\u201d the fire chief had said. Easy for him to say. In that moment, James was so, so glad he wasn\u2019t a father, because honestly, he could\u2019ve killed the kid, he was so relieved.</p><p>Parker hadn\u2019t spoken to him for the rest of the night, too focused on her son. A doctor was there\u2014Maggie\u2019s brother-in-law\u2014and he\u2019d checked Nicky out for any concussion or whatnot. Hard to believe the kid had slept through fire sirens and all, but Parker confirmed her son slept like a rock. Her eyes slid off James\u2019s face as if she hated him.</p><p>Twenty-four hours from love to hate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t blame her. He\u2019d lost her son, and the kid could\u2019ve just as easily gone into the water and died, all because James had no f**king clue. You should\u2019ve paid attention, his father had screamed at him in the hospital after Mary Elizabeth had been whisked away. You stupid, selfish little shit, each word a bullet.</p><p>No. Family life was not for him.</p><p>This whole thing with Parker was over. That was clear.</p><p>WHEN THE SUN HAD FINALLY risen and a decent-enough hour approached, James got dressed. Dockers, blue oxford with the sleeves rolled up. His carpentry work was finished.</p> <p>He looked in the window; Lavinia was already here, playing cards with Nicky on the floor of the kitchen. James knocked.</p><p>\u201cHey there, Jamie,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cCome on in, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Parker, if she has a minute,\u201d he answered. \u201cHi, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Nicky didn\u2019t answer. Refused to even look at him.</p><p>At that moment, Parker came into the kitchen, and the sight of her hit him like a truck.</p> <p>\u201cJames. Hi,\u201d she said warily.</p><p>\u201cHi. Sorry it\u2019s so early.\u201d It was after nine, not really early at all. \u201cGot a sec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Um, Nicky, I\u2019ll be right back. Vin, you don\u2019t mind keeping an eye on him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bit,\u201d Lavinia answered. \u201cSee you, James.\u201d</p><p>So Lavinia already knew he was toast.</p><p>Parker came out and walked around the house to the street side. Not down on the dock, thank God. She stopped and folded her arms.</p> <p>\u201cParker, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d James began.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Nicky hides all the time. All\u2019s well that ends well. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>Sure it was. He could feel it.</p><p>\u201cThank you for trying to find him,\u201d she added, finally meeting his eyes. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been horrible for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, it was... I thought he\u2014\u201d The thought was too unspeakable to finish. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked at the yellow and orange lilies along the fence, which she\u2019d liberated from a bank of weeds a couple of weeks ago. \u201cI heard you took a job in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>Harry must\u2019ve told her. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds perfect for you. Congratulations.\u201d</p> <p>And there it was. \u201cThanks. They just called. Last week.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, glancing at him, then away again. \u201cJames, I\u2019m sorry about the conversation the other night. I was...I don\u2019t know. Caught up in the whole summer-romance thing. Sorry if I seemed like another desperate single woman talking babies. The truth is, I don\u2019t want any more kids. One\u2019s enough, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure, he\u2019s a great kid.\u201d He glanced at the house. \u201cAnything else you need me to do here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you. You were so helpful, James.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll probably see you before you head back for Rhode Island. I have to help Dewey with a couple things, so I\u2019ll be around. I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll pick up Apollo before I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he went back to his truck and backed out of the driveway.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>IT DIDN\u2019T FEEL RIGHT, having the summer end like this.</p><p>Three days after Nicky\u2019s incident, and Parker was still tense. She hadn\u2019t seen James, though he\u2019d come by when she was out and taken Apollo, leaving her a note that only said to call if she needed anything. On the house front, there\u2019d been only one solid offer, so she supposed she\u2019d have to take it, though it wasn\u2019t a heck of a lot. Another couple had made a higher offer, but they had to sell their own place first, and time was of the essence for this sale. She and Nicky needed to get back to Rhode Island, settle into the new place. Two college friends said they could hook her up with a job\u2014insurance or technical writing.</p><p>She really couldn\u2019t picture doing either one. Then again, she hadn\u2019t been able to picture fixing a leaky toilet before this summer, and she\u2019d managed to do that.</p><p>They were leaving on Monday; today was Saturday. There\u2019d be less traffic\u2014more time to pack, not that there was much to pack up. Maybe she was stalling. She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Nicky, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t wait to go. He\u2019d been sullen since the night he hid, kept asking when he could go back to Daddy, and was generally rubbing Parker\u2019s last nerve to a bloody nub. She found herself counting the hours till bedtime, then feeling like a horrible parent because she was so eager for her child to go to sleep.</p><p>It was Parker\u2019s last day at the shop. There was a funeral in the next town, and she and Vin were making huge, somber arrangements. Well, Parker was; Vin was having a smoke, watching Nicky draw on the sidewalk with chalk through the window while Beauty kept him company.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna forgive that boy?\u201d Lavinia asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cNicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Parker. Jamie Cahill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She paused. \u201cThere was nothing to forgive. It really wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he sure looks miserable. Saw him at Dewey\u2019s last night. You dumped him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Parker glanced up, then resumed stripping the leaves from a stalk of gladiola. \u201cNo. It ended. He took a job in New York. I\u2019m going back to Rhode Island. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Vin took a deep drag on her cigarette. \u201cCoulda fooled me. The kid looks like what\u2019s-his-name. Spartacus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpartacus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s-his-name. The guy who turned in Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh. That one. Guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he has nothing to feel guilty about. Here. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia turned her attention to the arrangement. \u201cShit, that\u2019s real nice.\u201d She frowned, her face creasing like a shar-pei\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Parker. Nicky, too.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s eyes suddenly filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too, Vin. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done without you this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you would\u2019ve figured something out. Don\u2019t get all mushy on me now.\u201d</p><p>Parker hugged her, trying not to breathe in the scent of smoke. \u201cWill you come visit me? Maybe for Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>Lavinia tilted her head. \u201cThat\u2019d be great, Parker. You mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Please come.\u201d</p><p>Her cousin smiled. \u201cThen sure. Being as we\u2019re family and all. Okay, gotta get this over to the church. I\u2019ll see you for dinner tomorrow. I\u2019m making clam hash. Don\u2019t make that face\u2014you\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>That afternoon, as Parker was reading David Gets in Trouble to Nicky, he suddenly pulled on her sleeve. \u201cMommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honey?\u201d</p><p>Her son\u2019s face was somber, his hands clenching his Obi-Wan and Darth Maul figurines. \u201cI heard James calling me, and I didn\u2019t want him to find me.\u201d</p><p>She closed the book. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I dunno.\u201d Nicky looked at his lap and made Darth Maul take a stab at Obi-Wan.</p><p>\u201cYou must know a little. Weren\u2019t you having fun together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Not really. He told me I couldn\u2019t use the nail gun. And I already did use it, and I know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if James said no, that was the end of it, Nicky. You don\u2019t run away and hide because you didn\u2019t get your way! Daddy and I have both talked to you about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not you or Daddy. So he\u2019s not the boss of me.\u201d Nicky slammed the figurines together, his mouth obstinate.</p><p>Ah. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not Mommy or Daddy,\u201d she said, gently turning his face so he had to look at her. \u201cBut he was the grown-up in charge, and, Nicky, you scared him! Did you know he thought you were in the ocean? He went swimming to look for you, honey. In the cold, cold water.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare him. I wanted to hide and have him be sorry he bossed me. I took the nail gun, but I didn\u2019t even use it. I listened. And then I felled asleep. It was hot under there.\u201d His mouth wobbled and two tears slipped down his chubby cheeks.</p><p>Parker took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, honey. Thank you for telling me. Will you tell James you\u2019re sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think that was true, but it was a moot point. He was heading for New York. The end. \u201cYou still have to apologize. You can write him a note and draw a picture if you\u2019d rather do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Nicky scrambled off the couch and ran into his room, slamming the door. \u201cSorry!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Parker sat for a moment, stroking Beauty\u2019s head. Maybe Lavinia would babysit for an hour or two after dinner. Because despite the job in Manhattan, despite the fact that she\u2019d made a fool of herself with talk of babies to a man who clearly didn\u2019t want any, Parker didn\u2019t want James to think that Nicky\u2019s disappearance had been in any way his fault.</p><p>Vin came over for dinner and was more than happy to babysit. Parker smiled, watching the two of them; Vin was teaching her son poker. Her cousin was definitely an unexpected benefit of this summer.</p><p>She decided to walk into town, realizing abruptly how much she\u2019d miss Gideon\u2019s Cove, the constantly changing sounds of the ocean, the rush of wind through the sea grass, the sweet smells of Maggie\u2019s baking that drifted from Joe\u2019s Diner each morning. She\u2019d miss the cries of seagulls and the rumble of the small fleet coming in each night.</p><p>She\u2019d miss the people, who\u2019d welcomed her without a second thought, without judgment.</p><p>Mostly, she\u2019d miss James.</p><p>She never thought she could be that type of woman, who blushed when a man smiled at her. Who felt a man\u2019s presence before she could see him.</p><p>That moment at the lake when he\u2019d said he loved her...that was one of the happiest moments of her life. It was shocking, the impact of those words.</p><p>Well, hell. She seemed to be crying a little bit.</p><p>She wiped her eyes and peeked inside the window of Dewey\u2019s. James might be there, after all. Apparently not. Seemed as if the rest of the town was, though. Parker could see Maggie talking animatedly, her hands flying, as Malone looked at her, a faint smile on his face, radiating Satisfied Alpha Male. Chantal and Jonah were there, cuddled against one another, and Christy and her husband. The waitress from the diner who never seemed to wait tables. Beth Seymour, who\u2019d tricked her into taking Beauty. She owed Beth a drink, that was for sure. There was Dewey, squeezing between tables, pausing at the table to talk to Rolly, Ben and Stuart. Collier Rhodes was with them, no doubt getting his fill of local color, schmoozing with\u2014and probably boring\u2014the working class.</p><p>Was that how she\u2019d been in Mackerly? Gracing the masses with her presence, swooping in from Grayhurst occasionally to buy a round at Lenny\u2019s? That wasn\u2019t how it felt, but it might\u2019ve been how it seemed. She\u2019d always been grateful to live in Mackerly; grateful to have an in via Ethan and Lucy and their families. She lived in Grayhurst because it was there, and it held some happy memories. Some bad memories, too, but more of the happy variety. She hoped she hadn\u2019t seemed like a snob, or worse, an idiot.</p><p>Well. Time to see James and say goodbye.</p><p>The thought hurt so much it pushed the air from her lungs. She didn\u2019t want to say goodbye to James. She didn\u2019t want him to go to Manhattan and become a Harry. He was better than that.</p><p>Besides, she loved him. The incident with Nicky\u2014she was past that. They could both get past that, hopefully. In her pocket was Nicky\u2019s note: a drawing of Beauty holding Apollo in her mouth\u2014it looked as if Beauty was eating the python, but no, Nicky had informed her Apollo was simply getting a ride\u2014and the words I\u2019m sorry James from Nicholas Giacomo Mirabelli. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She went onto the porch of the two-family house where he was staying and paused, looking in the window of the first floor; the little old lady who lived on the bottom floor of the house was sleeping in front of her huge TV, where a slasher flick was playing in gruesome detail. Parker smiled a little, then went up the stairs to James\u2019s apartment.</p><p>She knocked, albeit very quietly. Her heart was pounding rather erratically in her chest. Crikey, it was terrifying, this...this vulnerability. But he\u2019d said he loved her. That had to count for something.</p><p>There was no answer to her knock, and she couldn\u2019t see anything through the little window. Maybe he\u2019d already left town. The thought made her mouth dry.</p><p>The door was unlocked. Parker went in, biting her lip. \u201cJames?\u201d she said quietly, setting Nicky\u2019s drawing on the counter.</p> <p>The bedroom door was closed, but light shone from under the door, and she could catch a few strains of music. Okay, great, he was here. She ran a hand over her hair, swallowed, then knocked and opened the door at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby!\u201d said a voice.</p><p>A woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>A woman was in the bed. Naked. A very surprised-looking, very well-endowed, very perky young woman. Wow. No cellulite there\u2014or anywhere\u2014that was for sure. Candles flickering on the windowsill. Harp music coming from an iPod speaker.</p><p>James had left. He was gone.</p> <p>The two women stared at each other, frozen for a horrible second. Then Boobalicious jerked the sheet up to her chin. \u201cOh, my gosh! I\u2019m so, so sorry!\u201d she spluttered. \u201cI thought you were someone else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, me, too,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d moved out. She\u2019d missed her chance. Her throat tightened as if Apollo was wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll go,\u201d Parker said. \u201cMy friend used to live here. I didn\u2019t realize he already... I\u2019ll\u2014 I\u2019m so embarrassed. And so sorry.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled sheepishly. \u201cNo, no, I should\u2019ve locked the door. My bad, totally. I\u2019m waiting for my boyfriend. Obviously. Duh, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Parker half grimaced, half smiled. \u201cYou have a good night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Beautiful girl. Woman. Whatever.</p><p>Parker turned to leave, then froze.</p><p>Apollo\u2019s glass tank was in the corner, complete with the python curled up inside.</p><p>Then the bedroom door opened, and there was James, a six-pack of beer under one arm.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d Parker breathed.</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d the na**d woman said at the same time, albeit much more enthusiastically. \u201cHi, baby!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>THIS COULDN\u2019T BE HAPPENING. His luck wasn\u2019t this bad. A guy goes to Jason\u2019s for supper, comes home to find...this?</p> <p>James\u2019s eyes ricocheted from one woman to the other. Nope, his luck really, really sucked, apparently. And what do you say in a situation like this?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he ventured.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d Leah said. \u201cUm, this nice lady came to see her friend, who, like, lived here before and just moved. Awkward! Right?\u201d</p><p>Oh, indeed. James seemed to be paralyzed. Speak, idiot, his brain commanded. But Leah was in his bed\u2014Leah, for God\u2019s sake. How the hell had she found him, even, let alone wound up in his apartment, in his bed, naked? Because yeah, there was her left breast, and while it was a completely excellent breast, he could\u2019ve sworn they broke up, and she and her fabulous rack really had no business being here.</p><p>But here she was. Her pretty red hair was curled, she was all made up, there were candles burning\u2014he didn\u2019t even have candles...hell, she must\u2019ve brought them herself\u2014and it was clear what Leah had in mind.</p><p>And in this corner, there was Parker, wearing jeans and a Joe\u2019s T-shirt and flip-flops, her hair in a ponytail. And if\u2014just if\u2014she\u2019d come over to offer the proverbial olive branch, James sensed his odds were falling. That instead of a branch, she might whip out a chain saw and cut off his arm. Or another body part.</p><p>He was so screwed. \u201cUh...Parker, this is a friend from home. Leah, this is Parker.\u201d Yes. What was the etiquette in a situation like this? Last names? No?</p><p>Leah sat up straighter, finally pulling the sheet over her breast. \u201cParker? Parker, like, Welles? I\u2019m so happy to meet you! You\u2019re Harry\u2019s daughter, right? Cool! James has told me a lot about you! You\u2019re an author, right? Really cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasure to meet you, too, Leah,\u201d Parker said, her rich-girl drawl in full glory. \u201cI gather you\u2019re James\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>If looks could castrate...</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d Leah\u2019s voice was charmingly sheepish. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together since, oh, man, that wedding on New Year\u2019s, right, James?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cEight months. That\u2019s great,\u201d Parker said. Her expression and tone were completely pleasant. \u201cObviously, my business with James can wait until after you two catch up. Welcome to Gideon\u2019s Cove. Have a wonderful night.\u201d</p><p>She walked past James, not touching him. \u201cShe\u2019s totally nice!\u201d Leah said. \u201cI thought she\u2019d be so stuck-up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d James said. \u201cStay here.\u201d The door to his apartment closed as Parker left. Way too classy to slam it, of course.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to surprise you,\u201d Leah said, a hint of a pout creeping into her voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd you did,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cBe back soon.\u201d</p><p>He bolted out the door, clattered down the stairs. \u201cJames!\u201d said Mrs. Kandinsky, opening the door. \u201cThere\u2019s a very pretty young lady here to see you! And I believe that children\u2019s author just left!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mrs. K.,\u201d he said, not stopping.</p><p>\u201cAlways in such a hurry, you young people,\u201d she commented.</p><p>Parker was already a block ahead of him. \u201cParker! Wait up!\u201d he called. She didn\u2019t slow down. He didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>He caught up to her in front of Dewey\u2019s and grabbed her by the arm. She shook him off. Already, people inside were watching them. \u201cParker, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>She gave a bitter laugh. \u201cWow. That was really the wrong thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was coming! I had no idea! You heard her. It was a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Parker tilted her head and looked at him, her expression calm. \u201cHow old is she? Just out of curiosity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, twenty-two? Twenty-three?\u201d</p><p>Clearly that was the wrong answer, because Parker jerked the door open and walked up to the bar. \u201cHello, Dewey,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019d like a glass of your best scotch, neat, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, Parker.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cParker.\u201d James came up beside her. \u201cI really need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey there, Parker!\u201d said one of the Three Musketeers...Stuart, who\u2019d helped Parker paint her bedroom. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, smiling at the old man, \u201cI\u2019ve been better, Stu. How are you? How\u2019s your knee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so bad. You look upset, sweetheart. Anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could keep James here from talking to me, that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>James flinched. \u201cParker, please let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady doesn\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d Stuart said pleasantly. \u201cSorry, son.\u201d</p><p>Dewey placed the glass in front of her, and she drained it in one gulp. His uncle\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cParker\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, I do not wish to speak to you at this time. Please leave me alone.\u201d Her voice carried through the bar quite clearly, especially as everyone had stopped talking.</p><p>James glanced around. Chantal shot him a smile, and her husband made a sympathetic Dude, you\u2019re screwed grimace. Malone was less friendly, giving him the Stare of Death.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea she was coming,\u201d James said, turning back to the subject at hand and doing his best to ignore the nearly silent bar. \u201cI had no idea you were coming. You could\u2019ve called, Parker. You have my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely wish I had called, believe me,\u201d she answered, not looking at him. \u201cThen I might\u2019ve learned that you have a girlfriend. Dewey, can I have another one? Thanks, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend. I broke up with her. Months ago,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure the fact that she came all the way up here, lit all those candles, took off her clothes, got into your bed and called you \u2018baby\u2019 shows that she, at least, thinks you have a girlfriend.\u201d Her eyes were diamond-hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not honorable, man.\u201d This from the rich guy. Great. Collier Rhodes, there to pick up the pieces.</p><p>\u201cParker, Leah is not the... She\u2019s not my girlfriend. We hung out a few times. I told her I was going to Maine for the summer\u2014 Do we have to discuss this here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s ironic. I used to think you were just like my father, but you changed my mind this summer. But here you are, exactly like him. The son he never had. Twenty-two, huh? Twenty-two. Wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d James ground out, \u201cplease tell me why you wanted to see me.\u201d</p><p>Parker swallowed her second scotch and turned to look at him fully. \u201cI came to tell you this, Thing One.\u201d Great. He was back to Thing One. \u201cNicky told me today that he hid on you. On purpose. He heard you calling and he didn\u2019t want to come out. And I was concerned about you, James, because I knew you felt responsible for losing him.\u201d Her voice thickened with tears. \u201cSo don\u2019t. Don\u2019t feel guilty about that.\u201d Her voice took on an edge, rising in volume. \u201cBut the fact that you were planning to move to New York while I was thinking about babies and long-term relationships? Feel guilty for leading me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParker, I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cOh, and the na**d woman in your bed with the candles and music? Yes. Go ahead and feel guilty about that, Thing One!\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of absolute silence in the bar.</p><p>\u201cUnattended candles are a leading cause of house fires,\u201d someone said, and there was a ripple of nervous laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Parker,\u201d James said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed, looking at him, and for a second, he saw hurt flash across her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d She reached into her pocket and fished out some bills.</p><p>\u201cOn the house, honey,\u201d Dewey said, giving James a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you home.\u201d Collier Rhodes stood next to James. \u201cBuddy, I think she\u2019s done with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Collier.\u201d Parker stood up and looked over the bar patrons. \u201cGuys, it\u2019s been absolutely lovely being here this summer. Thank you for all your help and hospitality. I hope to come back and visit. Sorry for the drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Chantal said. \u201cDon\u2019t even worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the diner for breakfast tomorrow,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cBring your little cutie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she left, not looking back at him. Collier held the door.</p><p>When James got back to the apartment, Leah was dressed, her little overnight bag sitting by the door. \u201cHi,\u201d she said wetly.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go. I\u2019m really sorry. I should\u2019ve called.\u201d</p><p>James sighed and glanced at his watch. He sat heavily in the other kitchen chair and scrubbed a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cLeah, I have to say, I\u2019m really surprised to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped in at the hardware store, and some old guy told me where you lived.\u201d She looked like a pinup girl, all chest and h*ps and little rosebud mouth. Pretty as anything. She bit her fingernail, then folded her hands. \u201cJames, I know we put things on hold, sort of. Well, you did. I was pretty into you. I thought if I could surprise you and remind you that I\u2019m really fun, then maybe you\u2019d want to get together again.\u201d Her voice faded to a whisper as she spoke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed. God, he was tired. He hadn\u2019t slept much since Nicky disappeared. \u201cYou are fun, Leah. You\u2019re really nice and sweet and fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d A tear dropped onto the table, and she smeared it with one fingertip. \u201cYou\u2019re a really good guy, James. That\u2019s not easy to find.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her a long minute, then took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and shrugged, trying to smile. \u201cSo you and Parker finally hooked up, huh?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cHooked up and broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in love with her?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cFigures. I\u2019d probably be, too, if I was a guy. Or a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>He had to smile at that. \u201cLeah, I meant what I said. You\u2019re great, and you\u2019re gorgeous, and someday, you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeet the right guy someday and have babies and a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. But I\u2019m not the right guy.\u201d</p><p>She surreptitiously wiped away a tear. \u201cAt least you never led me on. Never pretended it was more than it was.\u201d</p><p>No. He\u2019d used her and let her use him, and somewhere along the line, she\u2019d fallen for him, and he hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cStay here tonight. You can have the bed. It\u2019s a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, squeezed her hand and stood up. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asked. \u201cI make some killer pancakes.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>TWENTY-TWO.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t what should\u2019ve stuck with Parker, but hell. Twenty-two. Thing One\u2019s girlfriend was thirteen years younger than she was. Thirteen years! No stretch marks there. No droopage. No crow\u2019s feet when you\u2019re twenty-two.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, Parker,\u201d Maggie said, setting down a plate of French toast and bacon. \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Her son was washing the floor with Georgie, apparently the greatest activity on God\u2019s green earth.</p><p>\u201cSo how are you today?\u201d Maggie asked gently.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty embarrassed. I don\u2019t usually go to bars and screech at people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo? A pity.\u201d Maggie smiled. \u201cOnce, I got drunk at a church supper and told our priest I was in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel better,\u201d Parker said. She squeezed Maggie\u2019s hand. \u201cEveryone has been so nice to me in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like you,\u201d Maggie said simply. \u201cSo tell me about home.\u201d</p><p>Parker did, describing Mackerly and its many charms, the Mirabellis, Lucy\u2019s little caf\u00e9, the beautiful library where she and Nicky had spent so many hours, the bridge over the tidal river.</p><p>It would be so good to get back. Back and safe from the vagaries of love and lust and whatever else was mucking up her life.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll come visit sometime,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to Rhode Island in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that! Malone was the first person I met here. I\u2019m very...fond of him. Is that okay to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hot, what can I tell you? Women love him. And he has no idea, which only makes him hotter. Oh, hey, speak of the devil. Matthew Malone, come sit with your bride. Our friend\u2019s leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Malone sat next to Maggie, who immediately popped up. \u201cOops. Tavy\u2019s giving me the evil eye. Better get back to the kitchen. You two talk. If I don\u2019t see you before you go...well, I have your email.\u201d She reached down and hugged Parker, and Parker hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cYou married well,\u201d she said to Malone as Maggie went back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d Malone watched his wife, a smile playing around his eyes, then looked at Parker. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAyuh.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to say that for two months now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in full. Damn. The guy was hot, all right. Good for Maggie.</p><p>From the corner, Nicky laughed at the wonder of the mop bucket. \u201cMommy! I want to be a bubble boy when I grow up! Like Georgie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d she said, smiling over her shoulder. \u201cThanks for watching him, Georgie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not watching me, Mom! I\u2019m his helper.\u201d</p><p>Parker winked at Georgie, who was clearly enjoying having a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \u201cMy bad.\u201d She turned back to her breakfast companion, who seemed utterly content never to say another word. Made him seem wise. \u201cSo. Fun doings last night, huh?\u201d</p><p>He gave a half nod. \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-two.</p><p>She believed James. Well, she believed that he thought, kindasorta, that he\u2019d broken up with the Playboy bunny in his bed. But men were often vague, weren\u2019t they? They might not be real clear, in case things with someone else didn\u2019t work out. They might make promises they didn\u2019t really mean\u2014I\u2019ll call you when I get back from Maine, he might\u2019ve said to the bunny. Or, I\u2019m in when asked if he might want to settle down and be part of a family.</p><p>Yes, men had their little escape hatches. If life got boring, they could always screw the babysitter, for example. Weren\u2019t entire chapters of The World According to Garp devoted to screwing babysitters? Men always had ways of keeping their distance. Jobs, another example. They had to work hard in big cities and spend their free time with twenty-two-year-olds while their wives raised their kids and hoped they\u2019d come home.</p><p>You never knew.</p><p>Malone was looking at her. She took a sip of coffee. After last night, she felt she\u2019d spilled more than enough.</p><p>\u201cHey, good morning. How are you? I was really concerned.\u201d Malone sighed as Collier Rhodes sat next to her in the booth.</p><p>\u201cHey, Collier. Thanks again for the ride,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, my pleasure, of course. Damsel in distress, right? I\u2019m so sorry that you were victimized.\u201d</p><p>Parker suppressed her own sigh. Her own fault for stomping into Dewey\u2019s and making a scene\u2014though it had been somewhat satisfying. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it victimized, but I appreciated the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Hey, Judy,\u201d he said, calling to the heavyset waitress, who appeared engrossed in a crossword puzzle. \u201cI\u2019d love the house special today! Except, maybe instead of eggs, it could be egg whites? With a little fresh cilantro, if you have it? And no bacon...maybe some turkey bacon if you have that. Some OJ, no pulp, and a flaxseed muffin, if Maggie made any of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what flaxseed is,\u201d Judy said, not looking up from her paper. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Maggie yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! Will do, Judy! Gosh, this is the best place, isn\u2019t it? I love it here. I come in every day.\u201d</p><p>Malone raised an eyebrow at Parker, and she stifled a smile.</p><p>\u201cSay, Parker, I saw the for-sale sign in front of your house,\u201d Collier said, turning to look at her. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Malone, who rolled his eyes. \u201cBecause it\u2019s for sale?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cExcellent! I was thinking it\u2019d be a great house for a caretaker. Because, like, my travel schedule is a little crazy. Did I tell you I\u2019m booked on a speaking tour? It\u2019s called \u2018Living the Life Fantastic.\u2019 Now, I didn\u2019t pick the name, trust me, my agent did, but I thought, yeah, I need a caretaker. Back before I retired, I\u2019d close up the house for the winter, but since I plan to pop back and forth between gigs, I\u2019d like to have someone keeping an eye on it, turn on the heat, stock the fridge. Is your place winterized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, it needs a little work.\u201d A furnace, for example. A cellar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a jewel,\u201d Malone said gruffly.</p><p>Parker blinked.</p><p>\u201cMalone, my man, you\u2019re so right!\u201d Collier exclaimed. Parker suspected he had a man-crush. \u201cIt really is a jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistoric, too,\u201d Malone said, taking a sip of coffee. \u201cBuilt as a companion house to your own.\u201d</p><p>Historic companion house, her ass. It was a fortified shed. She felt the wriggle of laughter trying to force its way up her throat. The creases around Malone\u2019s eyes deepened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not winterized, Collier,\u201d she said, unable to lie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay! Have you had any offers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m, uh, considering a couple right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWell, what would I have to offer to beat it?\u201d</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cWell, Chantal is handling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble it,\u201d Malone suggested. \u201cYou want the house, go for it.\u201d</p><p>Holy halos. Malone was pimping her house. Even so, doubling it was crazy, and Collier had been nothing but nice, if somewhat vacuous. \u201cWell, Collier, doubling it would be a bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMalone\u2019s right. I want the house. I\u2019ll double the higher bid. I\u2019m sure I can swing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can, too,\u201d Malone said. \u201cA man of action.\u201d He toasted Collier with his mug and smiled at Parker.</p><p>\u201cFantastic! This is so great! Thank you, Parker! I\u2019ll call Chantal and get you a cashier\u2019s check right away.\u201d Collier beamed, then got up to harass Maggie about his omelet.</p><p>Parker sat there for a minute. \u201cMalone,\u201d she said, \u201cdon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I love you.\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cTake care, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, hottie.\u201d Then she got up, tousled his hair and fetched her son from the wonders of the storage room.</p><p>SHE PACKED UP NICKY and left at dawn the next day, not wanting to see anyone on the way out. It was hard enough. Beauty was curled up next to Nicky\u2019s booster seat, and her son was chattering away.</p><p>She\u2019d deposited half of Collier\u2019s check into her bank account yesterday afternoon. It would be a pretty good nest egg, enough to carry her and Nicky until she settled into a job, enough to put a little into savings. She planned to make a donation to the lobstermen\u2019s society in honor of Malone, and another one to the Gideon\u2019s Cove Animal Shelter.</p><p>The other half would go to James. Parker had given Chantal instructions to give him a cashier\u2019s check. He\u2019d certainly earned it. And aside from that, she wasn\u2019t going to think about James Francis Xavier Cahill.</p><p>There was a lump in her throat as she turned past Joe\u2019s. You\u2019re Leaving Gideon\u2019s Cove, a sign announced. We Hope You\u2019ll Come Again!</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S THOSE IDIOT parents of hers,\u201d Lavinia said at Dewey\u2019s on Sunday night. \u201cThey screwed her up and good. And the father of her kid, he\u2019s no help. Mr. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d James muttered.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you gonna do, sweetheart? I got the impression she was pretty fond of you.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNot so much anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to agree.\u201d He looked at Lavinia\u2019s face. \u201cI thought you were pretty happy, though. You and the judge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that ran its course. Just physical. We broke up last night. Think he coulda told me before we played two rounds of \u2018Spank Me, Nanny,\u2019 but no.\u201d</p><p>James choked. \u201cMen,\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She gave him a long look. \u201cSo what are you gonna do, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go home, get a job, keep on keeping on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jamie Cahill, you come visit me when you\u2019re in town. You\u2019re a good egg.\u201d</p><p>James smiled. \u201cThanks, Vin.\u201d</p><p>He said the rest of his goodbyes the next morning; his uncle hugged him and messed up his hair, Maggie and Christy and Chantal all kissed him and fussed over him, so it was apparent that no one really held the Leah issue against him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one but Parker, of course.</p><p>The cashier\u2019s check for his half had been like a kick in the groin. And while he could\u2019ve used it for Mary Elizabeth\u2019s fees, he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cTell you what,\u201d he\u2019d said to Chantal. \u201cMake it out to Save the Children.\u201d</p><p>He had almost nothing to pack\u2014just a duffel bag with his clothes and his tools.</p><p>First stop, Mary Elizabeth\u2019s.</p> <p>As always, seeing his sister lifted his spirits. They took a walk. She didn\u2019t ask about Parker, but he saw that her room was filled with Holy Rollers crapola\u2014a big poster from the movie, Manga versions of the book and several stuffed animals, including a kitten that could flatten out as if roadkill, then pop open again, with wings coming out of a zippered compartment in its back. Sick, really. Carol at the front desk told him it had come from New York the week before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m drawing a horse,\u201d Mary Elizabeth announced now, reaching for the crayon box.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m drawing a cow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t draw a cow, James,\u201d she chided. \u201cYou can\u2019t ride a cow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a riding cow,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. It could beat your horse in a race any day.\u201d</p> <p>His sister looked up at him, her eyes so blue, and laughed her squeaky laugh, then went back to her artwork.</p><p>What would life be like if she\u2019d listened to him that day? If he\u2019d been a better brother, a better babysitter, paid more attention? Would he have left Dresner, or stayed and become a carpenter? He\u2019d probably be married by now. Maybe a couple of kids, even.</p><p>He remembered Nicky\u2019s warm, sweet weight as he\u2019d lifted the boy from the car. The joy on his face when James had let him use the nail gun.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d be a good father?\u201d he asked his sister.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a little young for that?\u201d she asked, sounding for the life of him like a normally functioning adult.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty, Mare.\u201d</p> <p>She looked up from her drawing. \u201cYou are?\u201d He nodded. \u201cIs that old enough to be a father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give good presents. That\u2019s important. Presents are important.\u201d She bent back over her drawing.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou always take good care of me,\u201d she added, and her words clamped like a vise around his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou take good care of me, too,\u201d he said unevenly, leaning over to kiss her cheek.</p><p>She glanced at his picture. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst cow I ever saw.\u201d</p><p>THE LAST TIME HE\u2019D BEEN in Dresner had been two Christmases ago, at his brother Peter\u2019s house. He\u2019d stayed out of the way, gave all the kids the latest model of iPod and counted the minutes till he could leave. Only Mary Elizabeth, who left Beckham Institute for holidays and one weekend a month, had been really happy to see him.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t been to his parents\u2019 house in, oh, maybe seven, eight years.</p><p>The place looked the same. His father\u2019s pickup was in the driveway, along with Mom\u2019s old Buick. Not that she drove much anymore.</p><p>He knocked on the door, heart pumping in slow, heavy beats. His mother answered. \u201cYes?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, James! Hello! Come in, honey! What a nice surprise.\u201d She was slurring, and her hair was matted on one side, as if she\u2019d just woken up.</p><p>He kissed her cheek dutifully. Yep. Thems were Jack Daniel\u2019s fumes.</p><p>\u201cFrank, look who\u2019s here! It\u2019s James!\u201d Mom weaved into the kitchen and sat down. \u201cYou want some coffee, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d James said. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d He extended his hand; his father shook it, not looking him directly in the eye.</p><p>\u201cSo what brings you here?\u201d Mom asked, taking a sip of her own doctored beverage from a mug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home,\u201d James said, sitting down.</p><p>\u201cYou still working for that Ponzi-scheme guy?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m unemployed at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your brother tells us.\u201d Frank Cahill looked both pissed off and pleased.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, honey,\u201d his mother said, smiling. She\u2019d always been the kind of drunk who thought she covered well.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Mom.\u201d He shifted in his chair, the same worn vinyl chairs they\u2019d had since he was a kid. \u201cI just saw Mary Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy angel,\u201d Mom murmured, her mouth wobbling. His father rose to leave.</p><p>\u201cDad, wait. Please. I need to ask you guys something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, sit down!\u201d Mom said. \u201cJames is hardly ever here.\u201d</p><p>His father sat back down. \u201cWhat?\u201d he growled.</p><p>James took a deep breath and looked at his parents, his bleary- and blue-eyed mother, his angry, bitter father. \u201cI want you to forgive me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAh, Jesus,\u201d his father said.</p><p>\u201cDad, Mom, I wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish! Who cares what you wish? You were supposed to take care of your little sister!\u201d his father barked, slamming his hand down on the table. \u201cYou said you\u2019d stay home and watch her, and instead I come home to find her half-dead! All because you wanted to watch the f**king television!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look at her now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how dare you ask us to forgive you? Your mother\u2019s never gotten over it. Neither have I. And Mary Elizabeth...\u201d His voice choked off. \u201cShe has to be cared for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll always take care of her. I\u2019d have her live with me, if you\u2019d let me. I\u2019ve asked you that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So you can ignore her again? She\u2019s got the mind of a seven-year-old, James! You can\u2019t take care of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. And I would. I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>James looked down at the table. \u201cOkay. She\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Frank sat back in his seat and folded his arms.</p><p>James sighed. \u201cI\u2019d still like you to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this,\u201d his mother said, pulling a tissue from her pocket and wiping her eyes. \u201cThis is not pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d James said, looking at the scarred tabletop. \u201cI screwed up. But I was twelve years old, and you know how she was. She did what she wanted, and we all let her get away with it. I told her not to go swimming, and she didn\u2019t listen, and yeah, I should\u2019ve watched her better. But, Dad...kids screw up. I tried to save her. I did my best. I did everything I could, and I\u2019ll always be sorry it wasn\u2019t enough. I would\u2019ve given my life for her. But I can\u2019t keep living under what happened when I was twelve. It\u2019s killing me, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look dead to me,\u201d his father said coldly. \u201cYou destroyed this family.\u201d</p><p>James nodded wearily. \u201cBut I love my sister.\u201d</p><p>Frank gave a disgusted snort. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to go.\u201d</p><p>How easy, James thought, staring at his father\u2019s face, to pin all the blame on someone else. His father had spoiled Mary Elizabeth most of all, had made excuses for her not listening, had let the rules change according to what Mare wanted. His father had been the decision maker in the family, the one who deemed James old enough to watch his sister for the day.</p><p>Maybe Frank blamed him because to acknowledge that he\u2019d failed Mary Elizabeth, too...maybe that was more than his father could bear.</p><p>It had been worth a shot. James paused, then stood up. \u201cTake care, Mom,\u201d he said, kissing his mother\u2019s head. She sniffled in response. He dropped a hand on his father\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSee you, Dad.\u201d He removed his hand before Frank could shrug it off and walked through the house.</p><p>There was the funky little closet where Mary Elizabeth always hid during hide-and-seek; James and his brothers would have to pretend to be stumped, wandering around the house, saying, \u201cWhere could she be? I can\u2019t find her anywhere,\u201d as she giggled wildly inside. There was the railing Pete had encouraged him to slide down, neglecting to warn against the ball-busting newel post at the bottom. The dining room, which had always looked so magical at Christmas, filled with Grandma\u2019s cut-glass bowls, the candles and the good china, which only came out on holidays.</p><p>Once upon a time, this house had been a happy place.</p><p>It\u2019d be good to be back in Rhode Island, where nothing had ever been too complicated. Saturday-morning basketball games, the occasional bike ride, beers with the guys, flirting with some girls.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d call Harry\u2019s friend from Goldman. It might not be too late.</p><p>He opened the door and went out, closing it quietly behind him. Crossed the tired yard.</p><p>\u201cJamie. Wait.\u201d</p><p>It was his mother, shielding her eyes from the sun. \u201cWhat is it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She came up to him. \u201cYour father\u2019s sorry. It\u2019s hard for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how he is. He\u2019s strung so tight, and your brothers, well, they\u2019re not much better. Tom\u2019s exactly like him\u2014they\u2019re peas in a pod. Petey\u2019s not bad. You should call him more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d His mother beamed.</p><p>\u201cI should go. It\u2019s a long drive.\u201d He opened the truck door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be her guardian, you know. Once your father and I die.\u201d</p><p>James froze.</p><p>\u201cWe signed the papers when you graduated from law school. You\u2019ve always been a good brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand. \u201cAnd this problem of mine, the drinking... That started before. Long time ago.\u201d She gave a shaky smile, then ran a hand through her hair, making it wilder than ever. Then her eyes filled with tears. \u201cHoney, that day...as horrible as it was, my God, and it was...I thought I\u2019d lost you both. We\u2019d just pulled into the driveway, and I happened to look over at the lake, and there you were, trying to save her, screaming her name. When you went under, I thought you were both dead.\u201d His mother wiped her eyes, then smiled apologetically. \u201cSometimes, afterward, I\u2019d wake up at night and think you really did drown, and I\u2019d sit by your bed at night and pet your hair and just look at you. My baby boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>\u201cI know you tried, honey. I watched you try. Without you, she\u2019d be dead. Don\u2019t you forget that.\u201d</p><p>James rubbed his forehead, looking at the ground. \u201cMom, if you ever wanted to come live with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, why would I want to do that? I love your father. Even if he can\u2019t get over what happened with Mary Elizabeth. He\u2019s very good with her, you know. He visits her twice a week, Wednesdays and Sundays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I see the visitors\u2019 log.\u201d He paused. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to live with me, but I sure would like it if you visited.\u201d</p><p>His mother smiled, looking her age and then some. \u201cMaybe, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d come get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her then, hugged her for a long time, breathing in the scent of whiskey and shampoo and the musty smell of his childhood home.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>SEVEN WEEKS AFTER arriving back in Rhode Island, Parker opened a flower shop.</p><p>Blossom was on the far side of Mackerly, away from the little green. It had occurred to Parker that while Ethan and Lucy were hugely important in her life, she probably shouldn\u2019t take a storefront on the same block as their restaurant and pastry shop. So over to the other side of the island, next to a pizza place and a shoe store. An old, Lavinia-style flower shop was going out of business, and the timing had been perfect. A little construction for a new counter, made by Gianni, who was grumpy in his retirement and looked for odd jobs to keep him out of the house. A cozy little corner with a wing chair, a love seat and a coffee table, should a bride come in for a consultation. Parker had ordered some giant Georgia O\u2019Keeffe posters and hung them on the brick wall, stocked up on tissue paper in every conceivable color and ribbons to match, and gotten to work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She loved Blossom, loved Tuesday mornings, when she\u2019d be at the shop at 5:00 a.m. to get the week\u2019s delivery from the wholesaler. She loved the waxy, clean smell of flowers, loved Carlotta, whom she hired after the first week to run deliveries and cover some hours. Carlotta had six grown children and seventeen ear piercings, spoke Portuguese and often brought Parker a coffee.</p><p>After two weeks, Blossom already had repeat customers, including Ethan, bless his heart, who ordered all the flowers for his restaurant from her, ensuring some continuity. He also stopped by for flowers for his bride about once a week. She\u2019d done one funeral and one birthday party. She had a wedding booked for Christmastime, and had sent out beautiful printed announcements, complete with pressed flowers, to her Harvard and Miss Porter\u2019s classmates.</p><p>There was a lot of reason to hope she\u2019d do just fine.</p><p>The shop was ten minutes from Nicky\u2019s school, fifteen from the little Victorian they\u2019d rented. Parker was already hoping to buy the house eventually. It was snug and adorable, more than enough room for her and Nicky. A spiral staircase led to Nicky\u2019s room on the third floor, which he called the Bat Cave. Parker\u2019s room was on the second floor, along with two smaller bedrooms, and downstairs was a galley kitchen, a dining room and a living room. Her favorite part, though, was a front porch.</p> <p>Every night, Parker and Nicky sat out there before dinner. He\u2019d tell her about his day, the games the gym teacher came up with, the art classes, his sight words, how Colette was the prettiest girl in kindergarten and the nicest, how she sat with him on the bus and they would probably get married.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d he said, zipping his Matchbox cars over the porch railing. \u201cYou can live with us and our eight babies.\u201d It was a simple statement, but Parker\u2019s eyes filled with tears. It had been happening a lot.</p><p>Another plus of the front porch and normal neighborhood: accessibility to other humans. Christina and Louis, the newlyweds next door, talked in baby voices to each other, which, though exceedingly nauseating, was also kind of sweet. Jennifer, the single mom with the beautiful toddler, was lonely and often stopped for a chat.</p><p>Sometimes, Parker wondered how\u2019d she\u2019d managed to live at Grayhurst all those years.</p><p>One night, when Nicky was at Ethan\u2019s, Parker sat on the porch, nursing a glass of wine, one foot on Beauty, who was snoring gently, when Lucy came up the front walk.</p> <p>\u201cHey there,\u201d she called, smiling. \u201cI left the boys to do manly things. Figured we could hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Parker said. \u201cGlass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Lucy said, patting her belly, which had begun to pop. \u201cThose doctors are so mean. Know what they said last week? \u2018Limit your chocolate intake.\u2019 Don\u2019t they know who I am?\u201d</p><p>Parker laughed, and Lucy sat next to her. They chatted till it got dark\u2014Nicky, Ethan, baby names, work\u2014then went inside, little Beauty padding after them, then curling up in the corner to keep an eye on Lucy. She was still shy, though her abject terror at outsiders seemed to have passed.</p><p>\u201cI love this place,\u201d Lucy said, looking around. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a nice job, Parker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. She\u2019d painted the walls a soft green, filled the bookshelves and hung some framed artwork by her son. \u201cI never really had a place of my own. I mean, I had apartments and stuff, but my mom would come in with her decorator and take over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you mind?\u201d Lucy asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. It was her way of taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s fine. She\u2019s in the final ten for Real Housewives of Las Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She might come out for Thanksgiving. But my cousin is a definite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great,\u201d Lucy said. They were coming, too, as well as Gianni and Marie. A full house.</p><p>Lucy took a sip of her seltzer water, then pulled a throw pillow into her lap. \u201cSo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-oh. Are you going to lecture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucy smiled. \u201cYou were so good at lecturing me about this time last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Figured it was my turn.\u201d</p><p>Parker sighed and took a sip of wine. \u201cOkay. Go for it. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Well, it seems to me that on some levels, you\u2019ve never been better. The shop is fantastic, and you seem to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Parker said. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d be a florist, but you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this house feels so much more like you than Grayhurst ever did.\u201d</p><p>Parker gave a half nod. \u201cYeah. Hard to feel at home in a mansion when it\u2019s just two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky\u2019s doing great, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Colette. Do you approve?\u201d</p><p>Parker smiled. \u201cI do. She came over on Sunday and has beautiful manners.\u201d</p><p>Lucy was quiet for a minute. \u201cYou ever hear from James?\u201d</p><p>Parker looked down. \u201cNo. We...we\u2019re done. Summer lovin\u2019, and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, no singing.\u201d Lucy smiled. \u201cThe thing is...well, you\u2019ve been different since you got back. A little sad.\u201d</p><p>Dang. There were those ninja tears again, slipping up on her without warning. \u201cUm, you know. A lot of change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cBut I know you had feelings for James.\u201d</p><p>Parker took a sip of wine. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know that\u2019s pretty rare for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I was in love with John Stamos for quite some time. Of course, I called him Jesse back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, so John Stamos, sure, who didn\u2019t love him? And the Old Spice man, we can\u2019t forget him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saw me through a lot of lonely hours,\u201d Parker seconded.</p><p>Lucy smiled again, her soft, gentle smile. \u201cBut in all seriousness, Parker, the fact that this guy got to you...that\u2019s huge. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her words brought a lump to Parker\u2019s throat. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot like my father.\u201d Her voice was just above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I never got that impression. I always thought James was kind of sweet. And a little lonely, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Parker swallowed. \u201cHe is. Or he\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know, Luce. I was thinking about a future, a relationship, and the whole time he already had a job lined up in New York. And the girlfriend...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, you told me the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So at the very best, it was a huge miscommunication. At worst, he was cheating on me. Or her.\u201d</p><p>Lucy was quiet for a long minute. \u201cWell, let me say something, and don\u2019t get mad, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate when people say that,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cRight, but I\u2019m in a delicate condition, so you have to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire away, Pregnita.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked at her hand for a minute, and twisted her wedding ring. \u201cIt\u2019s just that sometimes, the right guy seems really wrong. And sometimes, it\u2019s easier to grab hold of an excuse, because really going for it, putting yourself out there...that\u2019s hard. You know that. You saw me through that last year.\u201d</p><p>Parker conceded the point with a nod.</p><p>\u201cSo, welcome to the world, Parker. Loving someone can be terrifying.\u201d She set her glass down gently. \u201cAnd it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>ON SUNDAY, WHEN THE SHOP was closed and Nicky was with Ethan, Parker got into the Volvo and headed north. It had been a week since the Lecture from Lucy, and she\u2019d been itchy and scratchy ever since.</p><p>Life would be much simpler without a relationship.</p><p>She had a son to raise.</p><p>She had a business to run.</p><p>James didn\u2019t want what she did. Or so he said. Except for that one time, on the dock. I\u2019m in.</p><p>He\u2019d gone into the water looking for her son.</p><p>As she turned onto the street of dear old dad\u2019s correctional facility, a car pulled out of the parking lot. She caught the quickest glimpse of the driver, and before her brain registered who it was, longing surged up so fast and strong that her chest actually ached.</p><p>James.</p><p>Her hands zinged with adrenaline, and she bit her lip hard. But he didn\u2019t see her, turned the other way, didn\u2019t seem to glance in his rearview mirror, didn\u2019t tap his brakes.</p><p>She went in, the guards as polite as the waiters at the Pierre, and went into the visiting room. A few minutes later, Harry appeared.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d he said. He looked better than last time. \u201cWhat a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great. He wants to get married and have eight kids.\u201d She pushed some hair behind her ears, her heart thudding sickly, though she wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>\u201cSeems like a lot.\u201d Harry gave a small smile, and Parker felt something shift in her chest.</p><p>\u201cSo I saw James leaving as I pulled in,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her father nodded. \u201cHe comes every other weekend or so. Good kid.\u201d Her father paused, tracing an invisible design on the tabletop. \u201cOf course, he should come see me, since he\u2019s the one who put me here.\u201d</p><p>Parker\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cHe told me a few weeks ago, but I already suspected. I was stupid. He did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you? That he\u2019s the one responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the truth is, I\u2019d have probably gotten caught anyway. He jump-started the process, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d</p><p>Parker shook her head. \u201cDid you want to get caught, Harry? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You get to a point where you think you\u2019re invincible. That you\u2019re smarter than everyone else. Maybe I wanted to see how far I could push things.\u201d</p><p>You always did.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you, Harry,\u201d she said, her voice low.</p><p>For the first time during the visit, her father looked uncomfortable. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, her stomach twisting. Say it, Spike advised. She swallowed. \u201cHow is it that you could be such a crappy father to me and be so...easy with James? The first time I ever saw you two together, you were already closer than you and I have ever been. He put you in here, and you don\u2019t seem to hold anything against him.\u201d Her voice was shaking.</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYou barely speak to me. We\u2019ve talked more since you were convicted than we have in a decade, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because you\u2019re bored. But James...James is your BFF, even now. Did you always want a son? Is that my problem? I was born with the wrong parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he snapped. He glanced over her shoulder, thinking, then looked at her again. \u201cIt\u2019s not that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what is it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that you\u2019ve been waiting for me to screw up again since you were ten years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I walked in on you doing the babysitter, you mean?\u201d Her voice was loud, and several people looked over.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes were stony. \u201cExactly. And ever since that day, you\u2019ve sat in judgment, just like your mother. You moved into Grayhurst to remind me of that day, to remind me that I was dog shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were screwing my babysitter, Harry! You were dog shit!\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head \u201cSee, that\u2019s your problem, Parker. Granted, I\u2019m completely to blame for that day. But nothing I could do afterward could ever make up for that one stupid roll in the sack. You wouldn\u2019t forgive me. Ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never apologized,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to wait for people to disappoint you, Parker,\u201d he continued, ignoring her comment. \u201cAnd guess what? They will. People make mistakes. We\u2019re not perfect. You want to know why I like James? Because he likes me, Parker. Not many people do, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. It was nice to be with someone who wasn\u2019t simply kissing my ass or talking behind my back. He didn\u2019t sit and judge and wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paid him well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t paid him since May\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and yet he\u2019s the only one who comes to see me, other than one visit from you. Two, counting today, which I gather is for you to vent your spleen and tell me what a shitty father I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much I missed you, Dad?\u201d</p><p>The question shocked them both. Harry\u2019s eyes widened, but he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d she went on, slowly, as the thoughts seemed to form only as she spoke, \u201cyou made me feel like the most important person in the world. I worshipped you, Harry. Everything I did, I did to impress you. But after that day, you could hardly look at me. It was like you hated me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hate you,\u201d he said. \u201cI never hated you.\u201d His gaze dropped to the table.</p><p>Parker looked at her father, the once-powerful legend of Wall Street. For years, it seemed that Harry had a pact with the devil, barely aging, the only change the silvering of his hair. But in prison, the years had caught up. He\u2019d missed a spot shaving, and the skin under his eyes was puffy. His hair was longer, and a lock stood up in the back, same way Nicky\u2019s did. Maybe her son\u2019s cowlick wasn\u2019t courtesy of Ethan\u2019s gene pool. Maybe her son looked a little bit like his grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI never hated you, either, Dad,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI moved into Grayhurst because it was where my happiest times were. Except for that one day.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, and his eyes were wet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your trust fund,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to make it up to you and Nicky both when I get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Parker answered. \u201cLosing it was the best thing that ever happened to us.\u201d</p><p>There was another long silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the babysitter,\u201d he said, so quietly she almost didn\u2019t hear.</p> <p>She reached over and covered his hand with hers. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d said the guard. Parker squeezed her father\u2019s hand, then obeyed.</p><p>SO THAT WAS SOMETHING, she thought as she drove home. Obviously, you didn\u2019t repair a relationship that had been neglected for a quarter century in one conversation. But they\u2019d said more across that little metal table than they\u2019d said in years. Decades. It was a start.</p><p>Her father\u2019s words echoed in her head. You wait for people to disappoint you.</p><p>No one had ever called Harry Welles dumb.</p><p>Beauty greeted her at the door, wagging vigorously, sniffing her shoes to see where she\u2019d been. Parker bent to pet the dog\u2019s soft head. \u201cHow was your day? Tell me you didn\u2019t just lie on the couch and watch QVC.\u201d The dog wagged some more, her eyes filled with love.</p><p>Funny, how Parker really hadn\u2019t been looking for a dog and now couldn\u2019t imagine life without her little pal.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetie,\u201d she said, heading upstairs.</p> <p>Nick had left his drawing pad on her bed; they\u2019d been coloring last night. She missed her son in the familiar rush, even though he hadn\u2019t been gone for even twenty-four hours. Flipping through his pad, she saw the chronicle of their recent life\u2014a girl with curly hair and blue eyes who could only be Colette, Nicky\u2019s love. A brown-and-white dog. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d she said, holding out the pad for Beauty to see. Lots of pictures of swords and maces. Darth Maul, his face distinguishable by the red-and-black coloring. A school bus with smiling faces in the windows. Sweet.</p><p>The next one gave her pause. Two smiling stick figures next to a house with a triangle for a roof. The smaller figure had spiky hair and held a gun and a square. The taller figure had curly brown hair.</p><p>James and Nicky and the nail gun.</p><p>He must have drawn this recently; the drawing pad was the one she\u2019d bought him for school.</p><p>So he\u2019d been thinking about James. Remembering him fondly, even, because the stick figures were holding hands.</p><p>She put the pad down and, on impulse, went to her closet for the box of stuff she\u2019d taken from the house in Maine. Some rocks her son had insisted they bring. The plastic tomato with the top hat and eyelashes. The red notebook of her wretched story ideas. The manuscript of Mickey the Fire Engine. A piece of driftwood Beauty had brought her. Two pieces of blue sea glass.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d been looking for. Sighing, she opened the notebook. There were the pulverized chipmunks. Swimmy the Shark, being eaten by his mommy. The Lonely Maggot. Nice. Quite a theme of distress here, most def. Oh, crikey, the Ark Angels. That one was really scraping the barrel.</p><p>She turned back to Mickey, the story Nicky loved. Now that was the book that should\u2019ve made her famous. A hardworking but aging fire truck bumped into disservice by the bigger, shinier truck. Only Firefighter Bill had kept the faith in Mickey, and on that frigid winter night when the apartment building was on fire and the newer truck\u2019s engine couldn\u2019t start, Bill asked Mickey to come through just one more time.</p><p>Wonderful themes about being chosen, being useful, commitment and friendship. Of showing up when you were needed the most. Of forgiveness.</p><p>James had said he loved Mickey.</p><p>Beauty rested her muzzle on Parker\u2019s shin. \u201cReally? You think so?\u201d Parker asked, rubbing the dog\u2019s velvety snout. The dog blinked. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>She brought the manuscript downstairs, rustled around in her desk and pulled out a manila envelope and did a Google search of the address. James F. X. Cahill, c/o Goldman Sachs, 200 West Street, New York, NY.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING in there. You\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hardly killed anyone this year,\u201d James said. \u201cCome on. I feel like an idiot as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cuz you are an idiot, man. Go yourself. Leave me out of this, skinny.\u201d</p><p>James could feel his teeth turning to dust, he was grinding them so hard. When he\u2019d signed up for Big Brothers Big Sisters, he\u2019d envisioned taking some cute little kid to the movies, shooting hoops, going out for ice cream. Someone around Nicky Mirabelli\u2019s age, for example, or maybe seven or eight. In this scenario, he\u2019d pick up the kid in a poor but respectable neighborhood where the parent(s) would be delighted to see him.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d been greeted by the dead-eyed stare of an enormous man who\u2019d exuded boredom and contempt like a toxic gas.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m James Cahill from Big Brothers? I\u2019m here for Taymal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d He grabbed a jacket, then stopped. \u201cWhat? You got a problem?\u201d</p><p>So yeah. Taymal was fifteen years old, stood six feet three and had the physique of a Patriots linebacker. He looked as if he could\u2014and might\u2014snap James in half.</p><p>Nevertheless, James couldn\u2019t exactly say, \u201cI was looking for someone cuter and less frightening,\u201d so here they were, standing poolside at the Providence YMCA. \u201cLook. I signed us both up,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat is not my problem, skinny.\u201d</p><p>It was probably a hundred degrees in here, and about a thousand little kids seemed to be having a screaming contest for who could sound the most in peril. James\u2019s skin was crawling, his nerves were like piano wire, and he was trying not to let Taymal see that he was fricking terrified.</p><p>While Taymal refused to go in the pool, he had nonetheless let James spend $89 on a pair of swim trunks an hour before, since he didn\u2019t own any. He also asked if James would buy him a $165 pair of Nike sneakers. When James asked if he liked basketball, Taymal gave him a very loud and eloquent lecture on racial stereotyping, then asked if he could get a Kobe Bryant shirt.</p><p>\u201cJust try it, Taymal. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know how to swim. We\u2019re here for lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, skinny. I can swim. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Why? You think black people can\u2019t swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! Are you James and Taymal? I\u2019m Quinn! I\u2019m your swim instructor!\u201d A very beautiful girl bounced up to them. Red bathing suit, blue eyes, brown, curly hair streaked with the greenish-blond of a swimmer. \u201cAre you guys ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, I am so ready,\u201d Taymal said, pursing his lips and giving her an appreciative scan.</p><p>\u201cTaymal. Stop.\u201d This was a really, really bad idea. \u201cShow some respect, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed. Quinn, honey, I respect you, baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you actually will have to stop or I get to drown you,\u201d Quinn said, tapping her clipboard. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the rules.\u201d</p><p>Taymal rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going swimming. Uh-uh. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d James said. \u201cWell, let\u2019s stand here for an hour, then, and listen to the children scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you two a minute. How\u2019s that?\u201d Quinn said, bouncing away again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wanna swim for, anyway?\u201d Taymal said.</p><p>James thought about the answer he\u2019d prepared: really important skill to have, the importance of wholesome hobbies. They could swim here in the winter and go to the beach in the summer\u2014though whether Taymal would tolerate him for even ten more minutes was dubious. He sighed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ll take you out to eat instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d</p><p>James looked at all those little kids in the shallow end of the pool, shrieking and splashing. \u201cI almost drowned when I was a kid. My sister, too. She has brain damage because of it, and I\u2019ve been scared to swim ever since. I thought maybe if I had someone with me, it wouldn\u2019t be so hard. But it still seems hard. See?\u201d He held up his hand, which was shaking.</p><p>\u201cShit, man. That is one sad story. Where do you wanna eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Chili\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>James turned to go. \u201cSorry, Quinn,\u201d he called. \u201cWe have to cancel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d she answered.</p><p>When he got to the door, he found that Taymal wasn\u2019t with him. The kid\u2014the Hulk\u2014was still at the edge of the pool. James sighed and went back.</p><p>\u201cYou really wanna do this?\u201d Taymal asked, jerking his chin at the water.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, I actually do know how to swim\u2014I just hate it. But if you don\u2019t want to do this, I\u2019ll come back another time without you.\u201d</p><p>Taymal gave him a long-suffering look. \u201cDude, you\u2019re about to piss your pants as it is. You won\u2019t come back. Yo, Quinn! Come on over, beautiful! My man\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>WHEN JAMES GOT HOME late that afternoon, he was exhausted, his head was killing him and he was fairly sure there was some nasty-ass pool water lurking in his left lung.</p><p>But.</p><p>He\u2019d been swimming. Not as rewarding as when Parker had bribed him out to the dock, but he\u2019d done it. Taymal had howled with laughter, shown off his own pretty solid swimming skills and then, at Chili\u2019s, eaten a bacon burger, a full order of baby back ribs and the Triple Dipper platter. Extra fries.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see me again?\u201d James asked as he pulled up in front of Taymal\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you my girlfriend now?\u201d the kid asked. \u201cDude, this is part of my parole, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>James stared him down.

And that\u2019s you, dude. Pretty sad, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not have to see your skinny white legs again, though. Next time, maybe we can do something else?\u201d</p> <p>James smiled. \u201cSure. You like baseball? We could go see the Sox, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, are you kidding? Take me to Yankee Stadium, hook us up in a hotel for the night, that fancy-ass Waldorf Astoria, get us some box seats. We\u2019ll be all set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can go down for one game. No hotel, and no box seats, though. I don\u2019t make that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. My cousin Louis? His Big Brother took him to the seventh game of the World Series, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never take you to the World Series. You still want me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018You still want me?\u2019 Man, you sound like a girl. Later, dude. Call my mother, set something up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The kid heaved himself out of the car and sauntered inside.</p><p>So, given how it\u2019d begun, the afternoon had been a smashing success, in a horrible sort of way. He could see Taymal growing on him. He could see\u2014maybe someday\u2014overcoming his fear of swimming.</p><p>The condo was quiet, as it always was. He should look into selling it, even with the real estate market in the toilet, because his new job wasn\u2019t paying what his old job did, and while he\u2019d paid Beckham Institute in advance for the next four years, that time would be over before he knew it.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d be promoted by then; as it was, he was working entry-level pay and hours, and grateful for it. The firm handled mostly corporate law, a little pro bono on the side. It was nice to work with people again. Actually, it was Stella, his old secretary, who\u2019d gotten him the interview through a lawyer she taught in her jujitsu class. It was a decent firm; one of the senior partners seemed to like him. So four years, sure, he might be on partner track. Could even be married in four years. You never knew.</p><p>He went over to the fridge, took out a beer and stared at the photo on the door.</p> <p>It was a picture of Parker and Nicky, sitting on the dock, taken from behind. The sun shone on Parker\u2019s hair. Her arm was around her boy, her face turned slightly toward him. They\u2019d been fishing, and when a miracle happened and Nicky actually caught something, they\u2019d both yelled for James to come down and unhook the fish. Which he\u2019d been happy to do.</p><p>It had been nice to be needed.</p><p>Well. Taymal might think he was an idiot, but he was needed there. And he\u2019d been calling home more regularly, talking to his mom. He\u2019d even called Pete and talked to his niece, Morgan, who\u2019d answered the phone. She sounded like a sweet kid.</p><p>Funny that three months ago, James hadn\u2019t wanted much more than he had. Now that he\u2019d had more, though, it was harder to be content.</p><p>He touched the edge of the picture, then turned.</p><p>There was a FedEx envelope on his table with a sticky note on it: \u201cSigned for this today. Barb from 3G.\u201d He\u2019d have to remember to thank her.</p><p>The package was from Goldman Sachs. That was odd; maybe he\u2019d been put on their mailing list since almost taking the job. He opened it up to find a note on corporate letterhead, as well as a sealed envelope addressed to him, care of Goldman. No return address. A note said,</p><p>This came for you. Took me a while to find your address. Delia Summers, Assistant Director, External Correspondence Department, Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>No wonder the country\u2019s financial system was in danger. The mail room had become the External Correspondence Department.</p><p>James opened the package. Inside was the manuscript for Mickey the Fire Engine.</p><p>The last copy, Parker had told him. The refrigerator cycled on, the only sound in the quiet kitchen. James turned the page. The last copy of the book she loved.</p><p>Indeed, as Taymal would say.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>PARKER WAS AT BLOSSOM on a Tuesday morning, lugging buckets of fresh flowers into the cooler, when an unexpected visitor walked through the door. \u201cMom!\u201d she said, setting down the gerbera daisies with a slosh.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d Althea said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here! Again without calling! What a nice surprise!\u201d She hugged her mom, who looked strange...wait, it was that she looked normal, actually. The Botox had worn off, and Althea\u2019s face had lost that tight, shiny look.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, I should\u2019ve called. I wanted to surprise you again.\u201d Her mother looked around the shop. \u201cThis is very pretty, Parker. Oh, you have a dog. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Beauty. Beauty, come say hi.\u201d The dog declined to leave her little bed, but she granted Althea a small tail wag. \u201cSo, Mom. What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left Maury.\u201d</p><p>Parker blinked. \u201cOh. Wow.\u201d</p><p>Althea sighed. \u201cDo you have any coffee? A nonfat vanilla soy latte would really soothe my soul about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plain old coffee. How would that be?\u201d</p><p>The story was, Althea said, that she got tired of walking on eggshells, trying to please a curmudgeonly old man who was, she suspected, going to dump her anyway. \u201cOne day, darling, I said, \u2018Althea, what are you thinking? You deserve better. You\u2019re more than someone\u2019s wife.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Parker nodded, a little stunned. Her mother had never gone more than eight months without a husband, had been first married at age twenty-one to Harry. Being a wife was her entire career. \u201cThat\u2019s huge, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the truth is, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do. So I figured the first thing would be to visit my grandchild.\u201d She paused. \u201cI didn\u2019t call because I was afraid you\u2019d say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! I wouldn\u2019t say no! I\u2019m really proud of you. Of course you can stay with us. The new place is small, but we have a guest room. It\u2019ll be great!\u201d</p><p>Althea smiled. She had lovely crow\u2019s feet, Parker noticed. \u201cI was sort of counting on that.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep it up, Parker. It\u2019s exhausting, trying to be the person someone wants you to be and completely losing the person you once were.\u201d She blew her nose. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t stay forever. It\u2019s just been so long for me, I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Here\u2019s where you start.\u201d She leaned over and kissed her mom\u2019s cheek. \u201cNicky will be so happy when he sees you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019ll surprise him when he gets off the bus. He comes here after school.\u201d</p><p>Parker spent the rest of the day showing her mother around the shop, letting her watch as she filled orders, talking about Nicky and the adjustments to their new lifestyle. They got lunch from the deli down the street and ate it in the little sitting area in the shop.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re happy?\u201d Althea asked a trifle suspiciously.</p><p>Parker took a bite of her sandwich and thought about the question as she chewed. \u201cI am. I love doing flowers, and even though I thought I\u2019d hate it, I like that Nicky\u2019s in school. Though I did cry a lot the first couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Her mom smiled. \u201cWhat about\u2014what was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did you date him?\u201d Althea asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s a nice guy, but kind of a dope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, actually, I meant the other one. The one who was living with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Did that ever...?\u201d Her mother raised her eyebrows. So odd to see her with normal facial movement.</p><p>\u201cWe parted ways,\u201d Parker said. She was quiet for a moment. She\u2019d spent the past week berating herself for sending the manuscript. It had seemed cute; in the face of his nonresponse, it now seemed really stupid. She should\u2019ve been more direct. Just written him a note, or called him and said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, I miss you, please give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, sweetheart,\u201d Althea said, patting her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re two single women. We can do facials and have movie nights, and I can make your favorite dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even know what that is, Mom?\u201d Parker asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cNo. But you can tell me, and I\u2019ll give it a whirl.\u201d</p><p>NICKY WAS INDEED EXCITED to have Faraway Mimi up close. He wanted to show off the new house, especially the fort he\u2019d made in his room, so Parker switched his booster seat to Althea\u2019s rental car and let him go home with her. Her mom beeped the horn and turned at the corner.</p><p>Parker watched them go, a little bemused. Aside from a few summers here and there, she hadn\u2019t lived with her mom since she was thirteen years old. The cynical side of her wanted to take a bet on how long it would take Althea to find another husband. The better part of her was proud. Althea had never left a husband willingly. Well. Except for Harry.</p><p>Althea had put up with a lot from her husbands over the years, proving the old saying that if you married for money, you earned every cent. But she\u2019d married Harry Welles before he\u2019d become a big deal; she\u2019d loved him once, and when he cheated on her and traumatized their only child, Althea walked away. Her mother had protected her, as best as she\u2019d known how, and that...that was worth a lot.</p><p>Parker sat down at her desk, smiling at Nicky\u2019s kindergarten photo. He\u2019d worn a bow tie, at his own insistence, \u201cso Colette will see me as husband material,\u201d he\u2019d announced the night before when they\u2019d all been eating at Mirabelli\u2019s, and Ethan had laughed so hard he\u2019d cried. Her son looked cheesy and adorable in the photo, all his baby teeth still present and accounted for.</p><p>This was what her life was now\u2014a business to run, bills to pay, a son to raise. A new home, her friends, sweet little Beauty curled at her feet and now her mom staying with her for a while, trying on some independence for size.</p><p>A nice life. A full life.</p><p>She did some bookkeeping for the next hour, the quiet of the fragrant little shop as soothing as a cup of cocoa. She had to order more roses; the wholesaler was short on them this week. She\u2019d work late on Friday for a Saturday wedding, but the thought gave her a tingle of excitement. Maggie Beaumont\u2014well, Maggie Malone now\u2014had emailed her pictures of the arrangements so Parker could put them on Blossom\u2019s website, and the bride had loved the look.</p><p>Maybe, if she could swing it, she and Nicky could go up to Gideon\u2019s Cove for a week this summer. See Vin and the rest of the people she\u2019d met. Eat at Joe\u2019s, see how the babies had grown.</p><p>The phone rang, and Parker glanced at the clock. Five minutes till closing. She could let the machine get it; if it was an order, she wouldn\u2019t have time to fill it until tomorrow. Then again, she\u2019d be a fool to turn away business.</p><p>\u201cBlossom, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d said the female voice on the other end. \u201cI need to place an order for my boss? It\u2019s his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just about to close. Are these for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>Parker paused. \u201cWell, for twenty-five years, I guess I can stay open a little longer. What\u2019s he looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said something gorgeous. And expensive.\u201d</p><p>Oh, goody. Hopefully, he\u2019d remember that she stayed open for him on his special day and use her again. She took out her pen \u201cAnd the card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let me read that\u2014he wrote it out for me. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I\u2019ve loved you since the first moment I saw you, and I haven\u2019t stopped since. Thank you for our beautiful children, thank you for our life together, and thank you for being my wife. Hope we can fool around later.\u2019\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parker laughed. \u201cOkay, got it. It\u2019ll be ready in about half an hour. Do you have a credit-card number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he pay cash when he comes by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks for choosing Blossom.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five years, and the guy was still cheeky, Parker thought, reading the card once more. Poetic, too.</p> <p>Well. He\u2019d get a beautiful bouquet to bring home to his wife, that was for sure. Not because he was spending a lot, but because he sounded like a good husband. \u201cAnd let\u2019s face it,\u201d she said to Beauty, \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for love.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a dozen yellow roses, some brilliant purple lisianthus, a few deep orange lilies. Four branches of pink phalaenopsis orchid. Some heather and fern. This couple was fun. No mere roses and baby\u2019s breath for them. Something extravagant and vivid and memorable.</p><p>She pictured the husband as she worked\u2014somewhere in his fifties, probably, an insurance executive or doctor, maybe. The wife would\u2019ve gotten home a little early, knowing her hubby was not the type to forget their anniversary. The kids were off at college, so the place would be all theirs. He\u2019d come through the door, the beautiful arrangement in one hand, a bottle of bubbly in the other, and she\u2019d be wearing nothing but a smile.</p><p>And because he loved her, it wouldn\u2019t matter that she wasn\u2019t twenty-two or thirty or forty anymore. In his eyes, she was truly the most beautiful woman in the world. The thought brought tears to Parker\u2019s eyes. A sucker for love indeed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked Beauty when she was finished. The dog wagged her tail appreciatively. The bouquet was wildly beautiful, filled with intense colors and odd combinations. She wrapped it in purple tissue paper and tied it with lots of red ribbon.</p> <p>Then the door to her shop opened, and she looked up, expecting to see her customer.</p><p>Instead, it was James.</p><p>Her mouth fell open. The rest of her froze.</p><p>Beauty, however, had no compunction. She ran over to James, whimpering happily, putting her front paws on his knee. \u201cHey, girl,\u201d he said, bending to pet her, and oh, that smile, it was even better than she remembered. Beauty began crooning in joy, her tail swishing wildly.</p><p>Then he straightened up and looked at her. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>\u201cSo. Mickey the Fire Engine. I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s about more than trucks.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was jackhammering so hard she\u2019d bet he could see it, fluttering under her shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s an, um, a metaphor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Damn if her mind wasn\u2019t completely blank. \u201cSecond chances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>\u201cGood. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Crikey. \u201cHow\u2019s New York?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I live in Providence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>He lived in Providence. Not New York. \u201cI thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sounded like an idiot. Clearing her throat, she said, \u201cUm, James, I\u2019m very happy to see you. And maybe we can have a drink or something, and talk...but I have to wait for a customer. It\u2019s his anniversary\u2014\u201d</p><p>James smiled, and her heart seemed to leap toward him. \u201cOh, right, the flowers. Actually, those are for you.\u201d He nodded at the arrangement she\u2019d just finished. \u201cI\u2019m a couple decades early, but I\u2019m optimistic, too.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Oh. She glanced at the card. \u201cAre you... Is...is that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head as if thinking. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA marriage proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reject it,\u201d she said.</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I wanted to do the asking.\u201d Holy halos. Where was this coming from?</p><p>Go for it, the Holy Rollers said. For a nanosecond, she pictured them, the six angels all in a line, smiling and nodding, Spike in his leather jacket, giving her the thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d James said. He was smiling.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Parker\u2019s eyes suddenly filled with tears. \u201cJames,\u201d she said, her voice wobbling, \u201cI\u2019d really like you to overlook the fact that I was a snob and ignored you and thought you were scum, and then, when we finally did hook up for real, basically jumped at the first chance to ditch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any qualities to recommend you?\u201d he asked, laughing, and she smiled, though a couple of tears slid down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYes. I do. Um, I\u2019m smart, and a great swimmer, as you know, and once I love someone, I tend to keep them really close, and I think I have a good sense of humor. I put out, as you also know, and I can do all the voices in Harry Potter.\u201d She paused. \u201cAlso, I love you. A lot. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept,\u201d he said. \u201cNow could you come out from behind that counter and kiss me?\u201d</p><p>She did just that, flew across the small space and wrapped her arms around his neck and looked at him for a second, those beautiful eyes, the smile that took up his whole face.</p><p>\u201cThank God you finally wised up,\u201d he said, and with that, he kissed her, and Parker had to wonder how she ever got so lucky.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Eighteen months later</p><p>JUST BEFORE IT WAS TIME to walk down the aisle, Parker peeked into the main part of St. Andrew\u2019s. The flowers were amazing\u2014of course, she\u2019d done them herself last night with help from Lavinia. And the place was packed.</p><p>The great state of Maine was well represented\u2014Maggie and Malone had come down with their little boy, Aedan, who was happily tugging on his father\u2019s hair at the moment. Lavinia and Dewey sat together; according to Vin, they were back together, having dated sometime in the \u201990s. Parker had invited Chantal and Jonah, too, but Chantal was expecting another baby any minute, so they hadn\u2019t been able to make it.</p><p>James\u2019s mom had come down with Mary Elizabeth\u2014who was holding her Spike doll, Parker noted. James\u2019s brother Pete and his wife and two daughters had come, too, which was so nice. Mr. Cahill and the other two brothers had opted not to come, but James had been okay with that.</p><p>Ellen, Parker\u2019s agent, had come, too. In one of those ironic twists of life, Parker had sent Mickey the Fire Engine to her publisher, though they\u2019d originally rejected it years before. This time, however, the story had been deemed a winner. And while the advance had been hefty and the royalties were flowing in, Parker had decided that being a florist and the wife of an up-and-coming lawyer would ensure a solid living. So once again, all proceeds from the book were going to Save the Children.</p><p>Lucy\u2019s aunts and mother, who\u2019d always treated Parker like another niece, were sitting with the elder Mirabellis, as well as with Althea, who wore a fabulous hat. Friends from town, some of Nicky\u2019s schoolmates and their parents. A few Harvard chums, Suze from Miss Porter\u2019s. Lucy was matron of honor, so pretty in her lavender dress. Ethan sat in the front row with their daughter, Lily, who was supposed to have been flower girl but had fallen asleep instead. Taymal, James\u2019s Little Brother, was best man and looked utterly gorgeous in a tux. He was winking at Lucy\u2019s aunts at the moment, causing a ripple of giggles from the two old ladies.</p><p>And in the back row, accompanied by a plainclothes guard, was Harry. The judge had granted him a furlough for today. He glanced back, caught her eye and tapped his hand over his heart, and Parker smiled. He was far from perfect, but a woman only got one father.</p><p>Well. Time to marry her man. The thought caused a rush of warmth from her toes to her scalp. \u201cYou ready?\u201d she asked Nicky.</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ve been ready for nine minutes,\u201d he answered, showing her his watch. Both his front teeth were missing\u2014finally\u2014and the gap gave him an adorable lisp.</p><p>Nicky wasn\u2019t giving her away, absolutely not. But he was accompanying her down the aisle.</p><p>Parker glanced down at her dress\u2014a simple, pale peach silk dress that stopped just above her knee. No white for her. She was thirty-seven, for heaven\u2019s sake. But Althea had wept in a most gratifying manner when Parker had emerged from the dressing room, and with the bouquet of apricot, cream and white roses and still-green hydrangeas, as well as a few roses in her hair, she felt quite bridal indeed.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get this show on the road,\u201d she said, and Nicky offered his arm with a grin, looking as ever like a miniature of his father. But she could see bits of herself, too. His eyebrows, and maybe his cheekbones.</p><p>So many people here, and everyone she loved. Malone grinned, Maggie was smiling and teary-eyed, Vin already sobbing into a bandanna. Her mom blew her a kiss, and Parker returned the gesture. Nicky gave a stately nod to Colette and ducked as Ethan reached out to ruffle his hair.</p><p>And James. He was so handsome in his tux, his eyes crinkled with a smile, and he looked completely and utterly sure.</p><p>She got to the altar and handed her flowers to Lucy. The music stopped, and everyone sat down. Then she bent down and kissed Nicky twice on the cheek, and he smiled and wiped it off, making everyone laugh. \u201cYou can go sit with Daddy, honey,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIn a sec,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reverend Covers cleared his throat. \u201cDearly beloved, welcome to this very happy occasion. Before we get started, the groom has asked if he could say something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe with you in a minute,\u201d James said to Parker, and his smile flashed. He stepped around her and took Nicky\u2019s hand and looked down at him, his face growing solemn.</p><p>Oh, man. The tears came in a rush.</p><p>\u201cI, James, take you, Nicholas, as my stepson.\u201d</p><p>An audible sigh came from the guests. James glanced at her, smiled again and then grew serious as he looked at Nicky. \u201cI promise to love you like you were my own, to always be grateful that you shared your mom with me, never to boss you unless absolutely necessary and to buy you the Lego model of the Death Star that your parents said had too many pieces, which is in my car at this very moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Nicky pumped his fist, and everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cI also promise to let you help name any baby your mom and I might have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistake,\u201d Parker said unevenly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a kid named Chewbacca.\u201d</p><p>James smiled at her again, and honestly, she hadn\u2019t known it was possible to feel so much happiness, so much love. Then he looked back at her boy. \u201cAnd, Nicky, I promise always to remember that you were your mom\u2019s son long before I was her husband.\u201d</p><p>That was perfect, said Spike. The other Holy Rollers had left her bit by bit, but Spike remained, and Parker was kind of glad.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Nicky said, mugging for the guests and getting a big laugh. \u201cOkay, my turn. I, Nicholas Giacomo Mirabelli, take you, James, as my stepfather.\u201d He pulled a piece of paper from his pocket. \u201cI promise to try eating what you cook, even though your food isn\u2019t as good as my dad\u2019s. I also promise to try to keep my room clean and not let Apollo out of his cage without asking. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re marrying my mom, because she\u2019s really happy. And also, you\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d James said, and they shook hands on it, and Nicky got a round of applause as he went to sit in the front row.</p><p>Then James took Parker\u2019s hands, and without waiting, gave her a long, hot kiss that made her nearly forget there were a hundred people watching. Then he pulled back and smiled that full, wonderful grin, his dark eyes so happy.</p><p>\u201cParker,\u201d he said, \u201calways lovely to see you.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
