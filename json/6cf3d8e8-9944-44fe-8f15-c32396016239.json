Will you help me disappear?\u201d</p><p>Callie Ward stood with her arms crossed against the blustery November wind, just out of the beams of the mini-mart\u2019s lights flooding the parking lot. She stared at Logan Edgington, nervously tapping her toe. The former Navy SEAL had no reason to help her, given how bratty she\u2019d once been to him, but he was the only person she knew who could make her vanish, this time for good.</p><p>He crossed his beefy arms over his wide chest and looked at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind. She\u2019d lost everything else, so why not?</p> <p>\u201cDisappear?\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s midnight, Callie, so yeah, Tara wasn\u2019t thrilled when you called. I left my warm house for this \u2018life or death\u2019 shit, and you\u2019re telling me now that you just want to get out of town? Didn\u2019t I hear that you\u2019re collared now?\u201d</p><p>Automatically, Callie pressed her fingers to the bare hollow of her throat, missing the familiar wire of white gold with its delicate lock. \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how this works. Talk to your Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one I\u2019m running from.\u201d Her voice trembled.</p><p>The moment Callie had realized the extent of her \u201cSir\u2019s\u201d betrayal, she\u2019d run like hell. She\u2019d gotten too comfortable. Complacent. Almost dangerously happy.</p> <p>She sniffled, then sucked it back, refusing to cry. She would not think about the fact that she\u2019d fallen in love with Sean Kirkpatrick\u2014if that was even his name.</p><p>Logan\u2019s pissed-off-Dom glower gentled as he leaned in, now all protective male. \u201cDid he threaten you? Hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Not the way Logan meant. But what the hell could she tell him without giving everything away?</p><p>Crap. The cover story she\u2019d planned on the three-hour drive from Dallas to Shreveport wasn\u2019t going to fly. Logan was too smart not to see the holes in her tale. Then again, sheer utter terror had a way of rattling a girl\u2019s train of thought.</p><p>She was going to have to trust Logan or he\u2019d walk away. It wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d ever pursued her, so she couldn\u2019t accuse him of prying the story out of her because he had ulterior motives. He\u2019d only ever had eyes for pretty redheaded Tara. And he didn\u2019t worship the almighty buck. Logan was one of the good guys, a straight shooter all the way. He couldn\u2019t be bought, nor would he ever willingly put her in danger. It made sense to choose the devil she knew over the one she apparently didn\u2019t at all.</p><p>If Logan was going to help her, he deserved the truth\u2014but not here.</p> <p>\u201cCan we sit in your car? It\u2019s freezing.\u201d And she didn\u2019t trust that hers wasn\u2019t bugged.</p><p>Logan looked as if he didn\u2019t much like the question, but after a brief hesitation, he shrugged and led her to a big black truck. He unlocked it with his key fob and opened her door. A minute later, he settled himself in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cIf this asshole hurt you, Thorpe won\u2019t stand for it, especially under his roof.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell Thorpe. She closed her eyes, picturing his familiar, stern face. So often, she could swear that his penetrating gray eyes saw right through her. He\u2019d given her a job, a home, a circle of friends, a lifestyle she craved. He was the first man she\u2019d truly loved. He\u2019d always have a chunk of her heart.</p><p>It killed her to know that she\u2019d never see him again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t drag Thorpe into this. It\u2019s too risky. Anyone who knows me would assume I\u2019d go to him first.\u201d She wrung her hands. \u201cI hate to put you in this position, but no one would suspect that I\u2019d ask you for help. Everyone at Dominion knows I\u2019m not your favorite person.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI like you a lot, Callie. I just think that, as a sub, you\u2019re bratty as hell. You don\u2019t bend much more than an inch and you don\u2019t trust worth a damn.\u201d</p><p>Callie drew in a breath and gave him a shaky nod. \u201cI know. I have reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery stubborn sub does. Look, you\u2019re not my problem anymore. I\u2019m just laying it out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really can\u2019t afford to trust anyone, but you\u2019re my last hope. I feel terrible for involving you, but more than anyone I know, you can handle it. I have nowhere else to turn. I can\u2019t go back to Dominion. Ever.\u201d She rubbed her hands together and closed her eyes, praying like hell that she wasn\u2019t making the biggest mistake of her life. If she was, she could be dead by sunrise.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you gotten into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name isn\u2019t Callie Ward. Nothing that you\u2014or anyone else\u2014thinks you know about me is true.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in the shadows, looking somewhere between skeptical and tense. \u201cOkay, then who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother called me Callie when I was little. But I\u2019m sure you know me by my full name.\u201d She swallowed. Please, God, let this be the right choice . . . \u201cI\u2019m Callindra Howe.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes nearly popped out. \u201cThe Callindra Howe, the missing heiress from Chicago?\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d heard of her. Her name had been splashed all over the news for the last nine years. There were almost as many reported sightings of her as there were of Elvis or aliens. Poor little greedy orphan who\u2019d killed her family for a buck, according to the press. Callie wrapped her arms around her middle. If they only knew the truth . . .</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You were a pain in my ass sometimes, but you\u2019re not the kind of woman to slaughter her loved ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you! I was framed. I don\u2019t even know by whom or why.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s expression turned flat. \u201cWhy should I believe you\u2019re her?\u201d</p><p>Good question. The only thing she had of her former life was her mother\u2019s Faberg\u00e9 egg, but Logan had no clue it had been Cecilia Howe\u2019s pride and joy before ovarian cancer had quickly snuffed out the bright light of her smile. With no way to corroborate the egg\u2019s authenticity at the moment, Callie had left it in her backpack, shoved in the trunk of her car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but the truth. I\u2019ll tell you what really happened and hope that you\u2019ll believe me so that when I beg you to make me disappear for good, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d He tossed his forearm over the steering wheel and stared, looking like an immovable mountain.</p><p>Callie swallowed nervously. \u201cWhat you know is that nine years ago, my father and sister were shot in our house and that the gun was found in my room, wiped clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend told everyone that you killed them for the money the night you ran off together.\u201d</p><p>Holden had been gorgeous, defiant, wild, and full of grand ideas. In retrospect, planning to run off with him had been stupid, but her sixteen-year-old heart had believed in the concept of soul mates. She\u2019d talked herself into believing that he was hers. If she\u2019d had any idea that he would end up betraying her for money, she would have never accepted that first ride in his car or given him her virginity.</p><p>\u201cHe was willing to say anything for the big bounty on my head.\u201d She snorted. \u201cI was young and na\u00efve not to realize that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d been planning to run away together for a few weeks. His family had no money, and he had a crappy home life. When he said that he wanted me to be his new family, my young heart fluttered. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to be Callindra Howe anymore. I felt like a freak. Most girls my age took dance classes and worked a summer job to buy a beat-up car. I had riding lessons. I spoke fluent French. By the time I was ten, I\u2019d visited every continent except Antarctica. I had a trust fund and got a Porsche the day I got my driver\u2019s license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound that bad,\u201d Logan drawled.</p><p>\u201cIn retrospect, it wasn\u2019t. At the time, I felt isolated. I worshipped my dad, but he\u2019d been remote since my mother\u2019s death. And my younger sister, Charlotte, had turned rebellious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when your boyfriend paid attention to you in order to get laid and get closer to your money, you thought he was the answer to your problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d And her stupidity still stung. \u201cAnyway, the night my father and sister were killed, I was late for our family dinner. The second the meal ended, I told my dad that I had to finish studying for a test. I ran back upstairs to call Holden and give him the green light. At a little after ten, I pretended to go to bed like all was normal. I\u2019d packed the night before and I was ready to leave. I grabbed my backpack and was shoving in a few last-minute items when I heard the first shot downstairs, in my father\u2019s room. I thought I had to be mistaken or my sister had turned the TV up really loud. Who would be in our house shooting? I heard Charlotte head down the hall and for the stairs.\u201d Callie clenched her fists. \u201cShe screamed suddenly. I heard another gunshot, this one much closer. She didn\u2019t scream again. I peeked out the door to see if I could help her, but the blood . . .\u201d Callie pressed her lips together. \u201cShe was only fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Her throat closed up and tears threatened, but Logan squeezed her hand. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to run to her, but the killer started charging down my hall. So I grabbed my pack and climbed out my window, down the big tree to the ground. I\u2019d done it a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cHe shot me just before I made it to the ground. Flesh wound to my hip. It stung like a bitch, and I bled off and on for days, but I kept running for my life. Holden was waiting for me in his car one street over. I got in, sobbing. I called the police and told them everything. They immediately suspected me when I told them I\u2019d fled the scene. They wanted me to come in for \u2018questioning\u2019 and swore I was just \u2018a person of interest,\u2019 but within an hour, the media had me labeled a suspect. I was too dazed and scared to face interrogation. The whole thing was a blur, and I had no witnesses who could say I hadn\u2019t killed anyone. I didn\u2019t want to face the fact that my family was gone. So I ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one suspected Holden? After all, if your father died, you stood to inherit a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe parked in front of an elderly couple\u2019s house. They spied on the teen \u2018vagrant\u2019 slouched in his beat-up Mustang for twenty minutes because he was blasting Usher in their very white upper-crust neighborhood. They were sure they\u2019d be horrifically murdered any second.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s mouth flattened in a grim line. \u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin an hour, we traded vehicles with a drunk guy in a bar\u2019s parking lot, Holden\u2019s car for his old truck. The guy was wasted enough to say yes. After that, we headed from Illinois to Indiana.\u201d</p><p>Callie hadn\u2019t told any of this to a single soul\u2014ever. Hell, she\u2019d barely let herself think about it in years. Just saying the words hurt like peeling off the layers of her skin one at a time until she was a bleeding, oozing mass. The worst part was, she could spill her guts, and Logan might not believe her. He could call the police because it was the right thing to do. They would take her to jail. And who knew what would happen then . . . except that it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cThen a few days later, your boyfriend ratted you out?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was still bleeding, my hip infected. Holden heard about the reward for turning me in and he called.\u201d And damn if she wasn\u2019t still bitter about that. \u201cWhen I stepped out of the shower for my shampoo and overheard him on the phone, I threw on my clothes, took the truck, and split.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>\u201cFrom there, I dashed to the next town over and paid cash for a little sedan. I had about thirty grand with me, money I\u2019d taken from my father over a few months so Holden and I could start a new life. My dad never missed it.</p><p>\u201cSince it was winter, I bolted south. Spent some time in Kentucky. When people there got suspicious, I adopted another name, colored my hair, and slipped over the border into Tennessee. Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma . . . Any place I could find a rent-by-the week motel and a transient job, that\u2019s where I went, at least until I thought someone might be onto me. Then I\u2019d be gone again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find Thorpe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI waited on some lifestylers while working at a twenty-four-hour diner shortly after I got to Dallas. Some were still in their fet garb at three a.m. when they walked in. I was curious, so I asked questions. They gave me answers. One of the unattached Doms invited me to go to Dominion with him. Out of curiosity, I said yes. He turned out to be a troll, and it didn\u2019t take Thorpe long to throw him out, but I begged to stay. I\u2019d finally found the perfect place to hide. A secretive community where no one expects to know your real name and no one is going to out you. I could dress different, change my hair, wear a lot of makeup, and no one would raise a brow. Not a soul who knew me as a child would ever admit to knowing what a fet club was, much less think to look for me there. Thorpe asked a lot of questions at first. I made up a lot of lies. After a while, as long as I did my job and promised to give him a heads-up if I planned to skip out so he could hire someone else, he left it alone.\u201d She sighed, struggling to hold it all in. \u201cThen came Sean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour Dom?\u201d</p><p>The sting of tears lashed Callie. She blinked to hold them back. \u201cSupposedly, yes. I\u2019ve dodged assassins and bounty hunters before and always managed to get away. This one is a different breed. He\u2019s determined enough to find me again. That\u2019s why I need your help. The man who\u2019s supposed to protect and care for me, who\u2019s pleaded with me to trust him?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Three days earlier</p><p>CALLIE trembled as she lay back on the padded table and Sean Kirkpatrick\u2019s strong fingers wrapped around her cuffed wrist, guiding it back to the bindings above her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He paused, then drew in a breath as if he sought patience. \u201cBreathe, lovely.\u201d</p><p>That gentle, deep brogue of his native Scotland brought her peace. His voice both aroused and soothed her, and she tried to let those feelings wash through her.</p><p>\u201cCan you do that for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>His fingers uncurled from her wrist, and he grazed the inside of her outstretched arm with his knuckles. As always, his touch was full of quiet strength. He made her ache. She shivered again, this time for an entirely different reason.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head, his deep blue eyes seeming to see everything she tried to hide inside. That penetrating stare scared the hell out of her. What did he see when he looked at her? How much about the real her had he pieced together?</p><p>The thought made her panic. No one could know her secret. No one. She\u2019d kept it from everyone, even Thorpe, during her four years at Dominion. She\u2019d finally found a place where she felt safe, comfortable. Of course she\u2019d have to give it up someday, probably soon. She always did. But please, not yet.</p><p>Deep breath. Don\u2019t panic. Sean wants your submission, not your secrets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to do better than try. You\u2019ve been \u2018trying\u2019 for over six months,\u201d he reminded her gently. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d truly hurt you?\u201d</p><p>No. Sean didn\u2019t seem to have a violent bone in his body. He wasn\u2019t a sadist. He never gripped her harshly. He never even raised his voice. She\u2019d jokingly thought of him as the sub whisperer because he pushed her boundaries with a gentleness she found both irresistible and insidious. Certainly, he\u2019d dragged far more out of her than any other man had. Tirelessly, he\u2019d worked to earn her trust. Callie felt terrible that she could never give it, not when doing so could be fatal.</p><p>Guilt battered her. She should stop wasting his time.</p><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she assured, blinking up at him, willing him to understand.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He pressed his chest over hers, leaning closer to delve into her eyes.</p><p>Callie couldn\u2019t resist lowering her lids, shutting out the rest of the world. Even knowing she shouldn\u2019t, she sank into the soft reassurance of his kiss. Each brush of his lips over hers soothed and aroused. Every time he touched her, her heart raced. Her skin grew tight. Her nipples hardened. Her pussy moistened and swelled. Her heart ached. Sean Kirkpatrick would be so easy to love.</p><p>As his fingers filtered into her hair, cradling her scalp, she exhaled and melted into his kiss\u2014just for a sweet moment. It was the only one she could afford.</p><p>A fierce yearning filled her. She longed for him to peel off his clothes, kiss her with that determination she often saw stamped into his eyes, and take her with the single-minded fervor she knew he was capable of. But in the months since he\u2019d collared her, he\u2019d done nothing more than stroke her body, tease her, and grant her orgasms when he thought she\u2019d earned them. She hadn\u2019t let him fully restrain her. And he hadn\u2019t yet taken her to bed.</p><p>Not knowing the feel of him deep inside her, of waiting and wanting until her body throbbed relentlessly, was making her buckets full of crazy.</p> <p>After another skillful brush of his lips, Sean ended the kiss and lifted his head, breathing hard. She clung, not ready to let him go. How had he gotten under her skin so quickly? His tenderness filled her veins like a drug. The way he had addicted Callie terrified her.</p><p>\u201cI want you. Sean, please . . .\u201d She damn near wept.</p><p>With a broad hand, he swept the stray hair from her face. Regret softened his blue eyes before he ever said a word. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to trust me as your Dom, do you think you\u2019re ready for me as a lover? I want you completely open to me before we take that step. All you have to do is trust me, lovely.\u201d</p><p>Callie slammed her eyes shut. This was so fucking pointless. She wanted to trust Sean, yearned to give him everything\u2014devotion, honesty, faith. Her past ensured that she\u2019d never give any of those to anyone. But he had feelings for her. About that, she had no doubt. They\u2019d grown just as hers had, unexpectedly, over time, a fledgling limb morphing into a sturdy vine that eventually created a bud just waiting to blossom . . . or die.</p><p>She knew which. They could never have more than this faltering Dom/sub relationship, destined to perish in a premature winter.</p><p>She should never have accepted his collar, not when she should be trying to keep her distance from everyone. The responsible choice now would be to call her safe word, walk out, quit him. Release them both from this hell. Never look back.</p><p>For the first time in nearly a decade, Callie worried that she might not have the strength to say good-bye.</p><p>What was wrong with her tonight? She was too emotional. She needed to pull up her big-girl panties and snap on her bratty attitude, pretend that nothing mattered. It was how she\u2019d coped for years. But she couldn\u2019t seem to manage that with Sean.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up in your head, instead of here with me,\u201d he gently rebuked her.</p><p>Another dose of guilt blistered her. \u201cSorry, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed heavily, stood straight, then held out his hand to her. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Callie winced. If he intended to stop the scene, that could only mean he wanted to talk. These sessions where he tried to dig through her psyche became more painful than the sexless nights she spent in unfulfilled longing under his sensual torture.</p><p>Swallowing down her frustration, she dredged up her courage, then put her hand in his.</p><p>Holding her in a steady grip, Sean led her to the far side of Dominion\u2019s dungeon, to a bench in a shadowed corner. As soon as she could see the rest of the room, Callie felt eyes on her, searing her skin. With a nonchalant glance, she looked at the others sceneing around them, but they seemed lost in their own world of pleasure, pain, groans, sweat, and need. A lingering sweep of the room revealed another sight that had the power to drop her to her knees. Thorpe in the shadows. Staring. At her with Sean. His expression wasn\u2019t one of disapproval exactly . . . but he wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>Sean sat, then pulled her onto his lap, supporting her back with a strong grip around her waist. He cupped her chin in his palm and sent her a pointed glance. \u201cEyes on me, lovely.\u201d</p><p>She complied, trying not to think about the fact that it was getting harder and harder to meet his stare and not give herself to him for real.</p><p>Originally, she\u2019d allowed Sean into her life because he irritated Thorpe, who sometimes looked at her as if she were the brightest star in the sky, then always chose another woman to master. She\u2019d wanted to make him jealous. Hell, she\u2019d wanted to see if he even gave a shit. Sean had walked into the club with his quiet sophistication and dry humor, taken one look at her, and never glanced at anyone else. It had done her ego a world of good\u2014until Thorpe had removed his protection and allowed Sean to collar her. Without so much as blinking, he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>So why the hell was Thorpe watching her now?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re away with the fairies, Callie. Get out of your head,\u201d Sean growled. \u201cFocus on me. Or we\u2019ll end tonight now.\u201d</p><p>That would be better, smarter. And everything inside her rebelled at the thought of Sean leaving. She clung, in fact. After all, she never knew if she\u2019d have a tomorrow with anyone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to be preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>His face softened a bit. \u201cWhat\u2019s troubling you?\u201d</p><p>A million things she could never confess. She plucked at the first excuse off the top of her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her face in his hands. \u201cYou have no idea how untrue that is, lovely. I fantasize about laying you out under me and sinking so deep inside you that you\u2019ll not ever forget the feel of me. Never doubt that I want you.\u201d</p><p>His words made Callie flush hot all over. \u201cDon\u2019t you think sex would bring us closer?\u201d</p><p>A wry smile crossed his wide mouth, and she couldn\u2019t resist brushing her fingers through the waves of his dark hair. He was so blindingly handsome. He\u2019d been her perfect revenge against Thorpe\u2019s indifference. She just hadn\u2019t planned on him stealing his way into her heart. And now she had no idea what to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tempting notion, isn\u2019t it? But I know me too well. Once we start that, I won\u2019t stop. And we\u2019ve far too much trust to grow between us to be distracted. I also know you. Sex is easy, isn\u2019t it? True intimacy is hard. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever had it, and you\u2019re a bit too good at dodging it. I\u2019m looking for more than a fuck, Callie. I want the real thing, and I won\u2019t rush because my cock is aching.\u201d</p><p>She had to find the only sensitive man in a BDSM dungeon. She would have been better off with someone who just wanted her to kneel, call him Sir, and liked to dish out a good paddling now and then. Perversely, that had never attracted her. Sean\u2019s big heart did, and she feared that she would break both his and hers before the end.</p><p>Maybe this time will be different. Maybe the past will stay there. Four years is the longest you\u2019ve stayed in one place. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop running and finally live.</p><p>Callie drew in a shaking breath. \u201cI\u2019ll try again. Really try. Tell me what you want, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl.\u201d Sean eased her to her feet and led her back to the padded table.</p><p>A glance up proved Thorpe had gone. Probably for the best. He was far too controlled and sexual for her. If she ever truly put herself in his hands, he\u2019d pry her soul wide open in no time at all. She couldn\u2019t take that risk.</p><p>\u201cLie flat for me, lovely.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the gorgeous Scot helped her onto the cushioned surface, she stretched out. He quickly secured her cuffed ankles. That didn\u2019t fill her with too much panic. Then he grasped her wrist and began to clip in one of the cuffs. Almost immediately, her trembling began again. Callie gritted her teeth and fought to give in to Sean. She wanted to. God knew she did.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust him. But what if someone recognized her? What if the police busted up the joint? What if she needed to flee and couldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes. Take a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>She ought to be wondering what she was going to do if she failed again and he left for the night. Or for good. She didn\u2019t want to be without him, and that kind of desperation was so dangerous . . .</p><p>Callie forced herself to comply. Instantly, her other senses jumped in. A woman in the far corner was having a very noisy orgasm. A male sub in the vicinity of the row of St. Andrew\u2019s crosses grunted with every lash of the whip from his top. Somewhere nearby, she heard one of the dungeon monitors speak in low tones. Her own labored breathing gradually canceled it all out. Her thundering heartbeat did the rest until she focused solely on Sean.</p><p>\u201cGood. What\u2019s your safe word?\u201d he crooned, leaning closer.</p><p>\u201cSummer.\u201d Callie swallowed. She missed that horse. The little brown filly had been her most constant companion after her mother\u2019s death. No doubt, the mare was dead now. She\u2019d never had the chance to say good-bye to her four-legged friend.</p><p>She let loose a ragged breath.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he praised as he bound her cuffed wrist to the table.</p><p>Her entire body tensed. She dragged in a harsh breath. Her heartbeat ramped up even more. Her palms began to sweat. Excitement and fear mingled into a heady cocktail, drugging her veins.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making progress. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d Sean cupped her cheek. \u201cRelax. Trust me. Put yourself in my hands.\u201d</p><p>How wonderful that sounded. How tempting . . . She nestled into his touch, forcing back a swell of devotion that was nothing more than a waste.</p><p>Callie wasn\u2019t one of those women who didn\u2019t know why her soul cried out to submit. It didn\u2019t take Freud to understand that a girl who\u2019d spent nearly a decade being entirely responsible for her own welfare in a life-or-death struggle sought to turn all of that over to a Dominant partner for his broad shoulders to bear. Of course, she also wanted her family alive and whole as well. She always wanted what she couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Gawd, she needed to turn out the lights on this pity party and give Sean all she could now. Tomorrow, she\u2019d apologize for being much less than he needed, then sever the ties between them\u2014before she could no longer find the will. Of course she\u2019d lie and wish him well in his quest to find another submissive who could be his true love. Watching that would be too painful, so she\u2019d soon have to leave. Sadly, Thorpe wouldn\u2019t miss her much, either. No one would. Exactly as she\u2019d planned it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The realization wrenched her heart.</p><p>Callie had been desperately ignoring the writing on the wall for months. She\u2019d allowed herself to become emotionally compromised and far too relaxed. Sean kept prying deeper into her psyche. If she wasn\u2019t careful, it wouldn\u2019t be long before he put two and two together. The questions he asked already made her nervous.</p><p>Maybe the time to depart Dominion had already come. No, she knew it had. She needed to leave everything behind. Pack up and move on. The sooner the better.</p><p>\u201cCallie . . .\u201d His tone was a warning.</p><p>She heaved in a cleansing breath and shoved every thought from her mind, centering herself on his presence and her need to submit to him just this once before she ditched him for good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sir.\u201d Before she lost her nerve, she raised her other arm above her head, an offering of her trust in him.</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d His fingers curled around her, warm and protective, his thumb stroking over the vulnerable inside of her arm before he fastened down her last cuff. \u201cThank you, lovely. You look beautiful bound for me. Your trust is heady.\u201d</p><p>And scarier than hell. \u201cI know it\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. From you, it\u2019s a great deal. I know that was hard for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I open my eyes for just a minute?\u201d</p><p>Sean paused. \u201cDo you need to see me?\u201d</p><p>Frantically, Callie nodded, fighting the insidious panic seeping from her veins.</p><p>\u201cOpen them, then. We\u2019ll go slowly.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered open, and she focused on him in the bright dungeon. Square face, sharp jaw, dark goatee, strong nose, muscled body. A furrow seemed permanently notched between his heavy brows. A little scar sat under the corner of his right eye, and she would have sworn it came from the nick of a bullet if he seemed like that kind of guy. Everything about him looked so masculine and aggressive. Yet he treated her so tenderly. If she had special-ordered the perfect man, he would be Sean. No doubt he\u2019d wondered a hundred times over what he\u2019d done to earn her distrust. The thought made her sad.</p><p>If she ever wanted to know what submission felt like, what Sean felt like, before she moved onto her next identity, she was going to have to give in this once. Simple as that.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to blindfold you now.\u201d</p><p>A scary prospect . . . but one she felt ready to handle now. Besides, her hearing had saved her the night her family had been murdered, as well as from Holden\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sean caressed her neck, his fingertips gliding down her collarbones to the swells of her breasts, thumbing her puckered nipple covered by nearly transparent white cotton. \u201cYou\u2019re pleasing me greatly.\u201d</p><p>He pleased her, too. Everything inside her yearned to show him that. She smiled and lifted her head so he could fit a silky black scrap that looked like a sleep mask over her eyes. Its weight felt light and nonthreatening. Then he clasped her hand. Callie squeezed back.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been both restrained and blindfolded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely, and only for demonstration purposes.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d actually scened with very few people. Logan Edgington had usually wanted to give her a red ass to correct her bratty behavior. His friend Xander had enjoyed arousing her body, but he\u2019d never awakened even a corner of her heart. She\u2019d spent a little time with some of the other resident Doms at Dominion with similar results. Eric had a fascination with ball gags that made her shudder. Zeb seemed a tad too excited by feet for her comprehension. His nibbling at her toes had icked her out. Jason had not only been a stickler for protocol, but a big fan of Shibari. It had taken Callie less than four minutes to scream her safe word. Then there was Thorpe . . . He was in a class all by himself. And way beyond her reach.</p><p>\u201cDemonstration?\u201d Sean sounded shocked.</p><p>Callie nodded. \u201cYeah. But I haven\u2019t done one in about two years.\u201d</p><p>Not since that December Thorpe had asked her to bottom for a demo . . . then afterward, behind closed doors, the kindling heat between them had exploded into a tangle of arms and lips, sighs and discarded clothes. She\u2019d been wet and ready and so desperate for him, naked on his bed. Then he\u2019d abruptly walked away without an explanation, behaving as if nothing had ever happened. To this day, she didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d left her. And he\u2019d never asked her to assist him in a presentation again.</p><p>That hurt didn\u2019t matter anymore. Old crap. Only Sean was important now.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to bear the restraint then because you knew someone would free you if need be? If that\u2019s the case, lovely, the dungeon monitors would have my balls in an instant if they thought I was hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d They were intensely protective of all the women in the club, but especially fellow staff.</p><p>\u201cWell, then?\u201d Sean\u2019s swift reply asked how she had managed to be tied down for Dom/sub education purposes when she could barely tolerate it with someone she yearned to put all her trust in. Her only answer was that Thorpe had been the one doing the tying. She trusted him more than she trusted anyone. He knew her quirks and had accommodated them.</p><p>But she hated Sean believing that she lacked faith in him. Callie latched on to the first explanation to hit her brain. \u201cLogically, I know you\u2019re right. Sadly, logic doesn\u2019t always penetrate fear. It\u2019s a bit like a phobia.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away, just brushed his thumb back and forth over her nipple until it tingled and she wished he\u2019d just tear off her clothes and fuck her already. She\u2019d wanted him for so many long months.</p><p>\u201cHave you always been this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I got into BDSM.\u201d She\u2019d lied to Sean often, but always tried to stay as close to the truth as possible.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what caused your fear, lovely? Was it something in your past?\u201d</p><p>Callie bit back a snort. Pretty much everything. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any one event.\u201d</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t a total lie, just a realization that restraint severely inhibited her ability to flee if her murder rap caught up to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Tell me about your childhood. Maybe something there will help me better understand.\u201d</p><p>This again? He must have asked twenty times since snapping a collar around her neck to tell him about her formative years. She managed to simply say that she was from the Midwest and was an orphan. Again, not lies . . . just not the complete truth.</p><p>She clenched her hands into fists. \u201cThe longer we talk, the more nervous I get. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will finish this conversation, lovely.\u201d</p><p>No, they wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re doing well, so I\u2019ll reward you now.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, caressed her shoulders in his big hands, then his nimble fingers made short work of the waist-cinching corset she\u2019d chosen earlier. He began unlacing it just beneath her breasts, slowly parting the panels down her torso before he detached it from her body. The garment provided enough support under her breasts to render a bra unnecessary. When he tore off the thin white tank she\u2019d worn beneath, his groan, coupled with his hands cupping her breasts reverently, told her that he approved.</p><p>\u201cAlways so damn beautiful, Callie.\u201d</p><p>No way to miss the worship in his voice. No man had ever made her feel so wanted.</p><p>He plucked at her nipples, pinching gently, turning the peaked nubs, controlling the flow of blood. The second he released them, sensation slammed into her. Hypersensitive and hard, the nubs tingled and bunched harder. She whimpered.</p><p>Then he bent to her, breathing harshly in her ear before he kissed his way down her neck, nipping at her fair skin until a shiver wracked her. She felt deliciously vulnerable, helpless to stop whatever he did to her body. He might deliver pleasure. He might heap on pain. And she could only accept what he chose.</p><p>So far, submitting was every bit as thrilling as she\u2019d imagined. Yeah, plenty of folks might think she was warped, but as much as she had feared it, the surrender of her will to Sean made her feel oddly treasured. And it aroused her, especially when he pressed soft kisses around the exposed flesh of her breasts. Beside her nipples, below them, hovering just above, he toyed and teased with his mouth. He made her gasp and hold her breath in anticipation of his every hot exhalation over her skin and every sweet nibble with his teeth.</p><p>With a little pleading mewl, she lifted her hips to him, waiting for him to realize that under her tiny black skirt, she wore the barest scrap of lace over her drenched pussy.</p><p>Sean braced the heel of his palm just above her mound and pushed down gently. \u201cI promised you a reward, lovely. Not necessarily an orgasm. Do I have to punish you to make you understand?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spanked her a few times, but she hadn\u2019t considered it much of a punishment. Instead, the release of fire under her skin went right to her clit and made her throb with unrelenting desire. Always sharp, Sean had quickly come to understand that ignoring her or acting with utter disinterest was far more effective in changing her behavior. The more she cared, the more disappointing him crushed her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d She just wanted to feel him in every way he\u2019d allow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not. I have a special plan for you, but I\u2019ll need you to be a wee bit patient.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThough I know you\u2019ll find that a torture all its own, I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>Callie grimaced. Her impatience around Dominion was well-known. A childhood of indulgence hadn\u2019t prepared her for the special hell of delayed gratification. Sean specialized in spacing out her rewards until she sometimes felt like screaming. Then again, the breath-stealing orgasms were always worth the wait.</p><p>She just wished he\u2019d let her return the favor. No matter how hard his cock looked or how much desire-induced sweat drenched his skin, he never availed himself of her body. Just like he never asked to see her outside Dominion\u2019s walls. Not for the first time, she wondered if he had a wife or girlfriend tucked away elsewhere. She was too afraid to ask.</p><p>With a snarl, Sean removed his hands. \u201cWhat the hell is in your head that\u2019s so engrossing you keep drifting away from me? I want your full attention, Callie.\u201d</p><p>Continuing her policy of honesty when possible, she gave him most of the truth. \u201cI wish I could touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019d like your hands free, to escape being bound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As hard as I found it to allow, I\u2019m enjoying your restraints. I just want the chance to give you the pleasure you give me.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cBe good and perhaps I\u2019ll let you.\u201d</p><p>The way his voice shook, Callie hoped that meant he wanted her at least half as much as she wanted him. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave, lovely. You\u2019re not in charge here.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, did her best to lie silently and let him have his way. She expected him to use those slightly rough palms of his to abrade and arouse her until she pleaded. Then he\u2019d do his best to ask questions designed to get in her head. She usually had to work to keep her wits about her and give him nothing more than a scrap of information so he would finally grant her screaming pleasure.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t on his agenda today.</p><p>Instead, Sean released her ankle restraints and detached her wrists from the table. Arms encircled her, then he helped her to her feet. She didn\u2019t often find herself topless in the club, so the feeling was hugely foreign . . . but not unwelcome. The cool air brushed her skin, beading her nipples more. It was an intriguing contrast to the pure heat rolling off Sean as he led her to dangling chains in the ceiling.</p><p>Poised behind her, he worked the snap hook attached to her bindings through the chains, securing her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs and keep them there.\u201d His words brooked no refusal, despite his calm tones. He never had to yell to make his point.</p><p>Biting her lip, Callie complied, but she didn\u2019t understand his intent. She knew she shouldn\u2019t, but she brushed her face against her extended arm to work the rim of the blindfold down, then she peeked at him over her shoulder.</p><p>Sean snapped her mask back in place. \u201cStop, you minx. Eyes front. You\u2019ll see me when I want you to, not before. Right now, focus on staying out of your head. Feel your body instead. Your skin, your breath, your pleasure. If your thoughts start intruding, try to block them.\u201d He pressed his chest to her back and cradled her breasts. \u201cI want to give this gift to you, lovely, but you have to do your part.\u201d</p><p>If this was her one night of submission to experience all Sean Kirkpatrick had to offer, then she would do her very best.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Would you like ear buds with music to help you concentrate?\u201d</p><p>And take away her ability to hear? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Take a deep breath and let it out. Clear your mind. Feel your muscles let loose.\u201d</p><p>Like preparing to do yoga.</p><p>She did everything exactly as he\u2019d commanded. It put her in a relaxed state. Well, as relaxed as she could be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. Do you know what this is?\u201d</p><p>Wide strands of something soft skimmed her from neck to ass. Air filled her lungs as she raised up, trying to extend the caress.</p><p>\u201cA flogger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeerskin, yes. Has anyone ever used one on you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWielded properly, it\u2019s not an implement of pain. Are you afraid?\u201d</p><p>Of the flogger, no. But his intent was another story. If he\u2019d gone out of his way to point out that the instrument didn\u2019t have to hurt, she didn\u2019t think he intended to test her pain threshold. And Sean had promised her a reward. Callie had a suspicion she knew where this was headed.</p><p>It scared the hell out of her as much as it made her yearn.</p><p>But she would give in tonight, see if she could separate her body from her mind in that floating paradise others called subspace. Just this once . . .</p> <p>\u201cI want whatever you\u2019d like to give me.\u201d</p><p>She sensed more than felt his approval. \u201cFine, then. Don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely cleared his lips before the tails of the flogger struck the fleshiest part of her ass in a slow thud. Sean repeated the motion\u2014full across her butt, in the low curve of her spine, up her back and down again. Never hard, never even making her sting. Rhythmic, sweet, lulling, the flogging was like a slow dance cradling her in its arms until she began to block out everything but the way he made her feel. Her heart beat in time with the tresses kissing her skin.</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t have to work very hard to block out thoughts. Sean perfectly understood her body, exactly when, where, and how hard to work the falls over her.</p><p>Her head started to swim away from her body, and she let it go for a moment. She sank toward the abyss just beyond her, calling out to her. The sensation was like having a couple of glasses of wine, but heavier and more compelling. More alluring.</p><p>Darkness swam around her thoughts. Minutes might have passed. Or hours. She didn\u2019t really feel her body anymore. The earth held her by the soles of her feet and her cuffed wrists, or she would have floated away to beautiful nothingness.</p> <p>Vaguely, she felt Sean\u2019s hand glide up and down her hot, sensitive skin, an acute rise of burn and sensation. Her head rolled forward. She felt every instant of her slow, deep breathing, almost like a waking nap\u2014except the intoxicating euphoria. How wonderful . . .</p><p>\u201cYou look stunning, Callie.\u201d</p><p>A drunk little smile curled her lips.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I wanted to give you, lovely, some respite from your head.\u201d His lips slipped up the back of her neck. He wrapped his broad hand around her and under her chin until he tipped her head back. Then he kissed his way down her jaw. \u201cI would give you more.\u201d</p><p>Please . . . She didn\u2019t have the strength to open her mouth and beg.</p><p>\u201cBut I need something from you. Come back to me just a bit,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>Callie frowned. It was the last thing she wanted to do, but the sweet splendor of silence in her head was too tempting. Complying took so much effort.</p><p>\u201cLet me into your heart, Callie. Into your head. I\u2019ve asked you for nothing since we began our journey together.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019d given her so much.</p><p>\u201cYou draw me like no other. I want to know everything about you. I don\u2019t want business to take me away from you before I\u2019ve had a chance to learn you inside and out. Before I\u2019ve had a chance to truly bind you to me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. He plucked at every one of her heartstrings, and she let him. Such exquisite words. How could she not give him a little?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start small,\u201d he assured. \u201cDid you have a pet as a child?\u201d</p><p>Pet? The first recollection to hit her brain spewed from her lips. \u201cI found a kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite six. I couldn\u2019t keep her. Mom was sick. I woke up one morning and she was gone. I cried. Mom died anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, lovely. Of what?\u201d</p><p>Callie shied away from remembering. \u201cGod takes the fragile ones back into his fold. Dad always said that. It still made me sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He petted her. \u201cDo you have any sisters? Brothers?\u201d</p><p>Chilled air suddenly smacked her toasty skin, jostling her brain. Awareness rushed back into her head. Why did he want to know?</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d Of course, Dad never knew that she\u2019d heard about his teenage romance that resulted in a son no one ever talked about. She hadn\u2019t thought about that in years, but she\u2019d spied on his son once. Apparently, being an illegitimate Howe sucked because he\u2019d been a bitter man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Callie tensed. Why would he think otherwise? His tone and the enormity of his question hit her. It might seem trifling to most, but if he suspected at all who she was and she didn\u2019t tread carefully, she might give him enough to confirm her identity.</p><p>Would he sell her down the river for the two-million-dollar bounty?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d</p><p>Sean took a step back. The flogger fell over her back, her ass, alternating, thudding, seeking to calm her again. At first, it stung against her hot skin. Then she had to resist the divine slide back into her silent cocoon.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t dare. She bit her lip to stay present, but she pretended. At least the flogger warmed her enough to stop her shivering.</p><p>\u201cDid you take any special trips as a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d wanted to go to Disney World. Dad preferred Europe and museums where she had to be quiet. A whole summer in the French countryside when she\u2019d been fifteen had seemed nearly coma inducing.</p><p>\u201cDid you go to public school?\u201d</p><p>Never. Her mother would have rolled over in her grave. \u201cMom was too religious to allow that. Guess it didn\u2019t stick very well.\u201d</p><p>Her answer was true . . . in a sense. Her mother had worshipped at the altar of Prada and been a firm believer in the church of Versace. She would never have allowed her or Charlotte to rub elbows with the middle-class kids who lived in the tract houses a few miles away. That had sucked, too. They looked like they had more fun.</p><p>\u201cCallie, you\u2019re in your head again.\u201d And Sean didn\u2019t sound pleased.</p><p>\u201cSorry. The cold rattled me and I just . . .\u201d Got scared with all the questions.</p><p>That made her even more dejected. Most likely, the man just wanted to know her. But just in case she was wrong, she had to lie. The truth was too risky.</p><p>Great basis for a relationship, Callie. Yeah, he\u2019d really love you if he knew your past.</p><p>She\u2019d be long gone before he could.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou get cold easily. I often forget because you make me sweat.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, he shuffled around to the front of her body. She drank his nearness in with a moan, smelling the musk wafting from him. Her mouth watered, her pussy wept. She wanted him so badly, had truly sought to please him . . .</p><p>\u201cI genuinely tried. I loved the floaty feeling you gave me. I never thought I\u2019d find subspace.\u201d Callie wished she could touch him. \u201cIt hurts me to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>Sean peeled the mask away, and she blinked until she adjusted to the glaring lights. His shirt was damp, his cheeks flushed. A submissive dip of her head as he unsnapped her wrists from the chains proved his cock lusciously hard.</p><p>\u201cYou came a long way tonight, lovely. It\u2019s my own impatience that makes me want you so completely right this instant. But your effort pleased me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you more.\u201d She blinked up at him uncertainly as he unfastened one of the cuffs and blood rushed back into her arms.</p><p>Disappointment in herself chiseled away at her composure. Even when she\u2019d given herself permission to let go and fully surrender to Sean, she\u2019d been unable to.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to.\u201d Useless tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>With a soothing sound, he drew her against his body, and she relished his warmth. When he pulled her into his embrace, she felt the protective wall around her heart softening, crumbling. Just once, why couldn\u2019t she give this wonderful man who\u2019d showered her with tenderness and pleasure a little fucking bit of herself? She was so closed off that even she could barely reach the real her buried inside. Certainly, she didn\u2019t know how to share, even with a man as kind as Sean.</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d He cradled her head in his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, lovely. Let\u2019s get comfortable and talk.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to argue, just pulled her along beside him, back to the bench in the corner. He removed the last cuff still dangling from her wrist and those around her ankles. Her shoulders were slightly sore. The skin on her backside still leapt with tingling life.</p><p>Sean reached for a blanket in a nearby stash, wrapped it around her, then pulled her into his lap. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up. Yes, I wanted more. But tomorrow will come.\u201d</p><p>Not for them, it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI could share myself more readily if you shared with me,\u201d she ventured. At least it sounded like a good excuse.</p><p>Settling back on the bench with a raised brow, he drew her against his chest. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we have feels so . . . one-sided. I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a sharp breath. \u201cI was raised by my grandparents in Scotland. My father served in the military in far-flung parts of the world. My mother preferred London to parenting. I attended local schools, finished university, learned how to hold my own in a fight and drink a few pints without getting too pissed. I work in project management.\u201d</p><p>Callie gathered up her courage. \u201cAre you married? Taken?\u201d</p><p>Sean let loose a hearty laugh. \u201cHas that been worrying you all this time? No, lovely. I was engaged about a decade ago, but I was already married to my job by then. We ended things amicably. I\u2019ve been alone since. And my life was empty as hell without you.\u201d</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t get to her. He shouldn\u2019t. But damn, he did. She might as well be honest about this, too. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how much my life was missing until you walked into it. I need more of you.\u201d</p><p>If they had nothing beyond tonight, she wanted him in every way he would give himself now.</p><p>Scrambling off his lap and between his feet on the concrete floor, Callie braced her hands on his knees and glanced at his cock. Then she blinked up at him, pouring her desperation into this one entreaty. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>SEAN stared down at Callie, his breath trapped in his chest, his cock about to explode. Her blue eyes, framed in thick black lashes and silently pleading, pierced his chest. Hell, they dug into his heart. He had to hold his fucking head together. But he wanted her more than he thought possible. More than he had words to express.</p><p>Of all the damn women to fall for . . .</p><p>Normally, he\u2019d remind her that he was the Dom, and she shouldn\u2019t wheedle for the terms she wanted. He knew a pretty piece of manipulation when he heard one. But Callie wasn\u2019t herself tonight. Her breakthrough actually worried him. On the one hand, he\u2019d finally peeled away layers of armor to reveal the soft woman beneath her bratty attitude. On the other hand, everything about her\u2014especially that haunted look in her eyes\u2014reeked of desperation. Of good-bye.</p><p>His gut twisted. Had something spooked her? Or someone, like him? There were a lot of reasons that letting her go wasn\u2019t an option. If he had to rearrange his priorities, so be it. But no matter what, he must keep Callie beside him.</p><p>\u201cLovely . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say. His throat felt tight. His breath thickened as her fingers dug into his thighs.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, just silently beseeched him with those sad eyes. How much unhappiness had she known to be so walled off from everyone? Right now, Sean could only imagine, but he wanted to know. And he wanted to heal her.</p><p>If he put her off now, she\u2019d only bolt sooner. As it was, he suspected that she planned to be gone when he came back for her tomorrow. But if he gave in to her tonight . . . That was the wild card.</p><p>He\u2019d ask her if she planned to flee, but she would only deny it. He knew Callie so well in some ways, yet she remained the most intriguing mystery in others.</p><p>Sean swallowed his doubts down. Fuck it. If he had this one chance to keep her, he was going to take it and deal with the metric shit ton of consequences later.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She began to scramble to her feet, the unmistakable hurt on her delicate face wrenching.</p><p>He braced a hand on her shoulder and pushed down gently. \u201cStay. I haven\u2019t said no.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze skittered away. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t say yes. I haven\u2019t earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You gave me a great deal of effort tonight. You fought through fears and surrendered a part of yourself to me. I appreciate how hard that was for you.\u201d</p><p>Holding his breath, he reached for the snap of his trousers. He was crossing a dangerous line, but he silenced the concerns screaming inside him and focused on Callie. On growing his bond with her and giving her what she needed. Right now, he suspected she ached to feel wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His zipper went down in a nearly silent hiss. Her gaze fell between his legs as he reached in to shove cotton out of his way and take his cock in hand. Fucking hell, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been this hard or desired a woman so much. Something about Callie had tugged at him from day one. Sean wished he could say it was the sheer challenge of conquering her. He\u2019d always enjoyed using his wits or brawn to overcome obstacles. Who didn\u2019t like winning?</p><p>But Callie had become far more than a conquest.</p><p>Slowly stroking his erection, blood rushed south to engorge him even more as her wide gaze fell on him, imploring. He tingled just from her longing stare.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to touch me, lovely?\u201d</p><p>She tore her gaze away and zeroed in on his face, then she nodded.</p><p>God, this could make everything go sideways\u2014fast. Any time he resisted Callie, it was something of a miracle. He should have known his willpower wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>Slowly, he eased his hand away. Within moments, she wrapped her own around his length, and he sucked in a hissing breath at the contact. Her skin was so warm, her touch soft yet deft. It was a tease. Seeing her silken fingers on him, her stare taking him in . . . Fuck, it was beyond heady. Nearly seven months without a woman, and he was so ready to blow. But he had a deep suspicion that if any other perched between his feet, he wouldn\u2019t be half so moved.</p><p>With her elbow braced on his thigh, Callie glided her fingers up and down his cock, that gaze of hers boiling his balls. But it was the yearning wonder on her face that truly seared him.</p><p>On her knees now, she leaned in. She didn\u2019t ask first, just opened her mouth to him and swallowed the head of his cock past her lips. Sean choked back a groan.</p><p>He\u2019d found heaven. Callie didn\u2019t just enclose him in her mouth or lick him. She worshipped the flesh she drew onto her tongue. She cradled it, laved and loved it, savored it, drawing it in deeper and deeper.</p><p>Sean gripped the edge of the bench, his body tensing with the pleasure. Electricity buzzed through his bloodstream. He clenched his thighs. And there was no stopping his hand as it curled into her hair, caressing her reverently as she showered him with attention, rapidly undoing his restraint.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>Callie took his encouragement to heart and sank his cock even deeper into her mouth until he bumped the back of her throat. She swallowed on him. He groaned out a sound of shock and fisted her inky tresses in his hands, the nearly black strands gliding softly over his fingers, as he lifted his hips and fucked her mouth in agonizing strokes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t exactly an expert. But Callie definitely presented a dichotomy. A girl who\u2019d lived in a BDSM club for four years had managed to retain a sweet sort of innocence. He wanted that for his own.</p><p>Damn it, he was so far gone for her. And it would be so easy to thrust into her willing mouth and let her overwhelm him with mind-bending pleasure.</p><p>Sean tugged on her hair and growled at her. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>As she sucked up his length again, she cast her gaze at him through her lashes. With the few brain cells focused on something other than her luscious mouth, he could still see finality in her eyes. This was her last act with him if he didn\u2019t change course. She needed to be wanted, and he ached for her\u2014not only in a carnal sense. He had to bind Callie to him.</p><p>God, this was going to send trouble clawing up his ass. But she was worth it.</p><p>Swallowing a curse, he shoved his hands under her arms and tugged her onto his lap once more.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d she whispered, both anxious and breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou say my name when I fuck you, lovely. You scream it.\u201d</p><p>As he positioned her legs on either side of his hips, she gripped his shoulders. \u201cBut you said we weren\u2019t ready, that you weren\u2019t going to rush what we had simply because your cock was aching.\u201d</p><p>The clever minx had an inexhaustible memory.</p> <p>\u201cAre you teasing me now, Callie? Or questioning me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d She gyrated her pussy against him, and only the soft lace of whatever she wore under her skirt separated them. Her body undulated until her breasts flattened on his chest and her lips skimmed his neck. She plucked at his shirt, doing her best to remove it. Sean lost patience and ripped it away.</p><p>Almost instantly, her hot stare and curious fingers spread across his chest, tugging at his self-control. He fought to rein it back in.</p><p>Fuck, she was taking a hundred liberties without his permission, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care now. The lover in her was something Callie hadn\u2019t given to anyone in the four years she\u2019d been at Dominion . . . except maybe Thorpe. There was some story between those two, but no one knew what. He\u2019d asked. If the aloof bastard had fucked her, it hadn\u2019t been recently. Whatever the case, he\u2019d handle the situation accordingly.</p><p>And hell, it was getting hard for him to think with her all over his throbbing shaft. Everything inside him shouted to claim her in every way a man could. Then pray to fuck it would be enough to make her stay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make us stronger,\u201d he vowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve thought all this time that I didn\u2019t want you or had someone else hidden away. I mean to show you that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She pulled back enough to look into his eyes. \u201cAt least this once.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cThe first time of many, lovely. I swear that to you.\u201d</p><p>He flipped up her skirt and ripped away the black lace separating him from her pussy. After a satisfying tear, he tossed it to the concrete floor. Finally, Sean dug into his pocket, grateful for old habits, and yanked out a condom. With shaking hands, he shredded the foil square open and rolled it down his inflamed length, feeling her hot stare eat him up.</p><p>When he had himself sheathed, he wrapped his arms around her and tugged her closer, poising her over his cock. He slid his fingers along her hip, feeling the nick along her left side. What would it take to persuade her to tell him about that? Maybe after tonight . . .</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been for you, lovely?\u201d</p><p>Callie looked away and gave him a particular frown he\u2019d come to know well. It flitted across her face when he asked a painful question she wanted to avoid. \u201cA long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go any further until you give me a precise answer.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed in his grip, trying to lower herself onto him. Fuck if he didn\u2019t want to let her. His body urged him to slide through her wet folds and lose his mind as her cunt gripped him. But in his current mood\u2014one that demanded he pound her into next week\u2014he might hurt her.</p><p>And if she admitted that she\u2019d ever warmed Thorpe\u2019s bed, he\u2019d do whatever it took to eliminate the man as competition. It was obvious unspoken feelings lay between Callie and her boss.</p><p>For now, Sean waited, holding her waist tightly, preventing her from sinking onto him.</p><p>\u201cSean . . .\u201d She wriggled impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking you yet. What do you call me?\u201d he ground out, sweating.</p><p>Damn it to hell, resisting the minx was teeth-grittingly tough, and he had no doubt she would tax every bit of his restraint before it was over.</p><p>Callie pleaded with him with wide blue eyes. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>Her little entreaty made him even harder.</p><p>\u201cHow long since you\u2019ve had a lover, Callie? I won\u2019t ask again. I\u2019ll just stop.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut as if hating to look at an ugly reality. \u201cNo one you know here at Dominion.\u201d</p><p>He worked to hold in his elation. \u201cNo one? Not in the last four years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried once, but . . . it felt wrong. I stopped it. I think he was relieved.\u201d That fact embarrassed her, but the torment on her face also said something about her loneliness. She looked so fragile in his arms. \u201cHe\u2019s married now.\u201d</p><p>All Sean could feel was a thrill that she would soon be his. The relief that Thorpe had never fucked her was undeniable. He had no doubt the bastard wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI just needed to know how gentle to be, lovely. Thank you for your honesty. I know that wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must think I\u2019m broken or something.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t think; he knew. But not in the way she meant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019re much wanted among the Doms here. I feel fortunate that you chose me.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she opened her eyes, and he saw tears shimmering there. That yearning on her face made her soul look so naked. Something he was saying or doing was reaching her, and a cautious joy rolled through him.</p><p>Callie threw herself onto him, arms around him, her face pressed into his neck. She inhaled him, clinging. God, how sweet she could be. Under all that sassy attitude, she hid a fragile heart. And he was finally seeing the real her. The woman inside was every bit as stunning and soft as he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>When she would have pulled back with an apology, Sean stopped her with a kiss\u2014and slowly began pressing her down onto his cock.</p><p>She gasped into his mouth. Her body tensed. Her pussy closed around him, so small and tight. How the fuck was he going to survive the incendiary grip of her for long?</p><p>Beneath her, he flexed his hips, desperate to bury himself as deep as he could and accustom her to the feel of him filling her completely. After only a handful of seconds, he knew she was going to become his drug of choice. After this addicting sweetness, there was no way he could do without her again.</p><p>No doubt, he would eventually get his ass handed to him for this . . .</p><p>Callie gave a little shriek and tried to lift off his cock. Sean held her in place. \u201cEasy. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled, and he thought he might lose his damn mind with the way her flesh rubbed and clutched the head of his cock. Then she exhaled and slowly let the tension slip from her body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he praised. \u201cLean on me and let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She met his stare, her gaze tangled with his. Something about the way she silently surrendered turned him on. The man in him responded to her wordless begging for him to take everything she had. Her offering surprised the hell out of him, but he didn\u2019t dwell on that. Filling her with both his cock and affection was far more important now.</p><p>Sean lifted her up a fraction, then lowered her an inch at a time, experimenting with her clenching walls, searching her face for any discomfort. This time, he submerged deeper, his head swimming with sensations until he swore he might drown in her. Callie was everything he\u2019d imagined and so far beyond it boggled his mind.</p><p>With his fingers biting into her hips, Sean desperately fought to hold on to his control as he lowered her even more, stopping when she inhaled sharply and her body tensed again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Almost there.\u201d</p><p>She writhed on him. \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated. I want you so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you. But I refuse to hurt you, lovely, when a little patience will do. It\u2019s been a long time. I didn\u2019t expect this to go easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted it to.\u201d</p><p>Sean couldn\u2019t hold in a smile at her impatience, that part of her that seemed to think or believe the world should go her way. \u201cI did, too. Next time, it will. Now, I want you to look right into my eyes.\u201d</p><p>Callie blinked, focusing on him through the shadows. He blocked out everything and everyone except her. The sounds of whips and moans, the scents of sweat and sex, the slight chill in the air\u2014all gone. Only she filled his senses.</p><p>Without another word, he lifted her to the tip of his cock again, then pressed down, down, down . . . This time, she helped him, folding her knees under her and tilting her hips to take all of him. He met her halfway, thrusting up into her fist-like grasp. She felt so good, his eyes nearly crossed.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t fucking Callie. He was making love to her. He was claiming her.</p><p>This changed everything.</p><p>A shudder worked up his spine, spreading through his body. With a groan, he threw his head back and let pleasure fill his veins. Jesus, this woman was potent.</p><p>Callie went wild, frantically lifting and thrusting above him. She ran her fingers through his hair, holding on as if he were her anchor to this world. Her soft pants and moans in his ear were driving him out of his fucking mind. So soft everywhere, and her scent . . . something clean and musky at once. The citrus of her shampoo blended with the feminine tang from her pussy for an olfactory high that sent his senses into a drunken daze. He could wax poetic about her for days, but he really just wanted to brand her as his own. Forgetting Callie would be impossible. Sean was damned determined to make sure she couldn\u2019t wipe him from her memory bank, either.</p><p>Grabbing her hips tighter, he took control. \u201cSlow down.\u201d</p><p>She reared back to look at him. Her face was flushed. Perspiration dotted her forehead and her upper lip. Her dark hair rained over her shoulders, curling down her slender arms and emphasizing the milky-soft skin he loved stroking.</p><p>The more she surrendered to the raw passion between them, the more she tore away at his armor. The deeper he needed to be inside her.</p><p>\u201cI ache.\u201d She sounded like a wounded girl who needed him to fix her problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In many ways, she was.</p><p>\u201cLet it build, lovely. We\u2019ve waited so long already. No need to rush it now.\u201d</p><p>Callie opened her mouth to protest. No doubt, he would have to remind her about the meaning of submission again, even if he did find her willful insistence adorable at times.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t remind her of anything if he didn\u2019t first persuade her to stay.</p> <p>Sean stilled her hips and sent her a stern glance of warning. Then he brought her down on his cock again, like a knife through melting butter. Slowly. So damn slowly a shudder wracked him again. Her keening cry zipped to his balls and straight up his stiff length. Damn it, she was going to dismantle his self-control if he didn\u2019t get a grip.</p><p>Her delicate fingers bit into his shoulders. She moved with him, graceful, sensual. Their breathing aligned. Sean watched her close her eyes and finally let him dictate their rhythm. He witnessed her slow, intoxicating loss of control.</p><p>As she undulated, the delicate collar he\u2019d clipped around her neck twinkled above her breasts, which bounced gently in his face. He took one nipple in his mouth, melting inside as the candy-hard tip tightened on his tongue. Then he took the other tight pink bud between his lips and laved her before sucking deep. Her pussy clamped down on him. Callie was so utterly responsive, and he didn\u2019t think for an instant that she simply needed sex after her long abstinence. He wasn\u2019t going to be done here until he knew that she needed him.</p><p>\u201cSean . . .\u201d Her little cry told him that pleasure was driving her to the peak.</p><p>He lifted one hand from her hip, tucking it under her little skirt, then dragged his thumb over her clit.</p> <p>Her response was instant and gratifying. She shrieked and began fluttering around his cock, seconds from orgasm.</p><p>\u201cCome, Callie,\u201d he growled.</p><p>As if those words held magic for her, she tossed her head back and let out a wail of pleasure. Her back arched, her breasts thrust high, and her cunt held him in a velvet vise. He gritted his teeth, clenching his fists and sweating like a bitch to hold it together.</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d</p><p>Loving the sound of his name on her lips, he rode the wave of her climax, from the short pulses through the endless clutches, to the sweet little aftershocks. Then she dissolved against him, struggling to catch her breath. The urge to explode inside her and mark her with his seed nearly overwhelmed him. Miraculously, willpower and logic prevailed. He needed more of this woman who tripped every sexual trigger in his body.</p><p>Brushing her hair away from her damp face, he forced her to look at him. Her eyes were dazed and dilated, her cheeks rosy-hot. That turned him on even more.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling, lovely?\u201d</p><p>With a tired, loopy grin that did his heart good, she sighed and melted against his chest. \u201cFabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d Unfortunately, he was in hell.</p><p>She stretched and wriggled. Then she paused.</p><p>Callie blinked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re still . . . You didn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am and I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes danced as she leveled him with that vixenish stare he\u2019d come to adore. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll just have to take more of you. What a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bloody shame for sure.\u201d He managed to tease back.</p> <p>When he urged her up and down his cock again, however, the smile slid from her face. A gasp fell from her lips, then she seemed to stop breathing for a long minute.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . yes,\u201d she panted above him. Feminine. A goddess.</p><p>The sight aroused him so deeply, Sean knew he couldn\u2019t hold on much longer.</p><p>Trailing his thumb back to her clit, he slowly rotated until she sucked in a sharp breath, until her body jolted, and she started looking to him for permission.</p><p>God, that shit turned him on, even more so with her.</p><p>\u201cLean against me. Put your chest to mine and . . . yes,\u201d he praised as she complied.</p><p>Then Sean gripped her hips tightly and pistoned inside her, probing deep and quickly learning her body. Her entire front wall was sensitive, so he dragged the head of his cock along it with every thrust. But she also had a spot deep and high. She loved having her cervix nudged. He worked her, paying close attention to every reaction. Callie held her breath, closed her eyes, tensed up, then came the high-pitched pants that rang in his head like an erotic chant. Her fingernails dug into his shoulders. Her pussy clutched him.</p><p>He gripped her hair in his fist and tugged. \u201cLook at me. That\u2019s it . . . Come for me now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean!\u201d Her body jerked and her cunt clamped down on him. \u201cSean!\u201d</p><p>As soon as she screamed his name, pleasure sizzled through his blood, igniting everything inside him. Climax rocketed his system, launching him into a realm of thick, tangled ecstasy he\u2019d never known existed. The explosion blasted through his body, deep in his chest, marking his soul. In his head, she might be his, but he knew damn well that he was now hers. Tonight had complicated the fuck out of everything. But as he surged to the peak, he didn\u2019t care at all.</p><p>\u201cCallie . . .\u201d he panted. \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>STANDING in the shadows of Dominion\u2019s dungeon, Mitchell Thorpe couldn\u2019t miss the orgasm that wracked Callie\u2019s body, the fact that she screamed another man\u2019s name, or the unabashed way in which she shared herself with that fucking suspicious Scot. As much as he wanted to deny it, the sight and sounds damn near felled Thorpe like a hatchet to the chest.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped that insisting on so many restrictions when he\u2019d allowed Sean Kirkpatrick to collar Callie would frustrate the man. That the asshole would leave. Thorpe didn\u2019t trust Kirkpatrick. Something was off about the guy . . . But no matter what he\u2019d done, Sean had proven goddamn single-minded when it came to the girl.</p><p>Damn it! Thorpe hated the sight of the other man surging deep inside Callie, where he ached to be himself. Clutching the little silk robe he\u2019d retrieved from her room the second he\u2019d realized she meant to let Sean fuck her, he closed his eyes, refusing to watch the bastard come inside her.</p><p>The reasons Thorpe could never have Callie were carved into his brain. And even though he\u2019d beaten the dead horse mentally enough to recite the rationale in his sleep, he clenched his jaw and reminded himself again. There would always be fourteen years, two months, and three days\u2019 difference in their ages. Besides, he knew Callie wasn\u2019t likely to stay with him much longer. Forever was out of the question. More important, he could never give her the kind of love she craved and deserved.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, he dared to open his eyes and stare at the wild tangle of Callie\u2019s black hair brushing the fair, flushed skin of her back. Desire gnawed at him, biting deep. He\u2019d always believed that by walking away from her that December night two years ago, he could prevent her from breaking his heart. Thorpe didn\u2019t find it comforting to be proven so wrong.</p><p>Kirkpatrick shouting out his love for her gouged him in the gut. Hearing the Scot admit his feelings for Callie aloud not only made him jealous as hell, but it proved the man had balls. Thorpe was almost in awe. But Sean obviously didn\u2019t understand her at all. Thorpe had no doubt what Callie\u2019s response to the man\u2019s unexpected declaration would be.</p><p>Right on cue, she stiffened and shook her head, then scrambled off his lap. Kirkpatrick stood and tore off his condom, trying to zip up while reaching for her with an expression meant to be gentle and calm.</p><p>Thorpe snorted. Wrong approach again.</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise him at all when Callie whirled around, eyes squeezed shut tightly, arms over her breasts, and ran\u2014straight into him.</p><p>When she would have stumbled back from their collision, he gripped her shoulders. Thorpe tried not to look at her breasts again. Why tempt himself with what he couldn\u2019t have? She blinked up at him, fear and anguish mixed on her face. Guilt followed.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Those words alone told Thorpe how raw Kirkpatrick had scraped Callie. Normally, she\u2019d try all kinds of foot stomping, demanding, and plain ol\u2019 manipulation before she resorted to showing her soft, submissive side to anyone. Whatever the man\u2019s game, Thorpe had to give Sean credit for opening her emotions far wider than expected.</p><p>Over her shoulders, he eased the robe he\u2019d retrieved in case her second thoughts about having sex with the Scot set in. Nice to see that he still knew her so well.</p><p>He sent her a sharp shake of his head. \u201cNot yet, pet.\u201d</p><p>Callie shoved her arms through the holes and belted the robe tight, sending him a defiant glare. But tears still lurked under it. The fucking Scot playing with her heart had rattled her. Thorpe hated the asshole for it even more. His need to protect her growled, chomping at the bit to tear the collar from her neck and free her. He couldn\u2019t do that, but he had every intention of having a \u201cchat\u201d with Kirkpatrick.</p><p>\u201cWhy are your hands on Callie?\u201d Sean demanded. \u201cShe\u2019s my sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re under my roof, and she\u2019s obviously upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I need to talk to her. She and I should be sorting this out. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Normally, he would agree. But he wouldn\u2019t risk Callie by leaving her vulnerable with a man he swore had some hidden agenda. A fraud. Besides, Kirkpatrick didn\u2019t know her like he did and never would. \u201cAt Dominion, my word is law. Play by my rules or you\u2019re welcome to leave. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Sean clenched his fists and ignored him, focusing on Callie. \u201cTalk to me, lovely. If I upset you, help me understand why.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe felt her stiffen in his grip, then she looked up at him, her gaze imploring. He understood instantly. She\u2019d developed feelings for this man and hated to hurt him. But he also knew that she didn\u2019t dare let him close.</p><p>\u201cCallie, go to your room. I\u2019ll be in to see you in a minute.\u201d Thorpe motioned for Zeb, one of the dungeon monitors.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t send her from me. I didn\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Kirkpatrick protested.</p><p>With a shrug, Thorpe blew Sean off and addressed the approaching DM. \u201cTake Callie to her room. No one enters until I say otherwise. And she doesn\u2019t leave.\u201d When Callie gasped, he sent her a knowing look. \u201cDo you have something to say, pet?\u201d</p><p>Since she wasn\u2019t about to admit that she\u2019d plotted to flee the club, she remained silent. But he knew it as sure as he knew himself. Kilpatrick hadn\u2019t just plumbed her physically. He\u2019d pried her heart open, and she was preparing to react to that in the only way she knew\u2014by running. Already, she\u2019d mentally packed her bags. Thorpe forced down his panic and reminded himself that as long as she was still here, he could fix the situation. The easiest solution would be to toss the damn Scot out on his ear.</p><p>Callie looked ready to grind her teeth as she stomped off. Zeb followed with a grin and a wink.</p><p>Thorpe vowed to deal with her little fit of pique as soon as he\u2019d unmasked this fraud and rid him from her life. \u201cMy office. Now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to see if Kirkpatrick followed. He\u2019d rather the fucker find the exit and save him the breath. But when he reached his personal domain and rounded his desk, the Scot stood in the portal, all but foaming at the mouth.</p><p>Sean slammed the door, enclosing them in a privacy steeped in thick air. \u201cYou have no right to separate me from Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m responsible for the welfare of all the subs under this roof. Until I know why she was running away from you in tears, then yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a piss-poor excuse. You\u2019re jealous because you want her for your own.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe took his time answering, sitting in his leather chair and staring the charlatan down. Idly, he wondered when and how he\u2019d been stupid enough to tip Sean off. Xander had pointed it out, too, a few months ago. Maybe he was getting sloppy.</p><p>\u201cI have not laid a single finger on the girl for any reason in nearly two years. So what you believe I want is irrelevant. Let\u2019s talk about what actually happened.\u201d</p><p>Sean sat, poised on the edge of his chair as if he\u2019d rather fight. \u201cI restrained and blindfolded her, then I flogged her. She reached a peaceful subspace. Then when she came out, I made love to her. It\u2019s been an emotional night. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Is that what the idiot thought? \u201cThat\u2019s not how Callie works. Have you been too busy fucking her to get to know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve watched me like you\u2019re her bloody keeper, so I suspect you know that\u2019s not true.\u201d Kirkpatrick raised a brow at him. \u201cJust like I suspect you\u2019ve been too busy getting to know her to fuck her. Your knickers are in a twist now that you\u2019ve lost your chance. Be warned. I mean to make her mine in every way.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe wanted to rip the guy\u2019s face off, but managed to keep his composure. \u201cShe\u2019s wearing your collar already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more, and you\u2019re standing in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing in the way because her teary dash away from you didn\u2019t indicate happiness. I\u2019ll confess that Callie is special to me. I\u2019ve protected her since she came to Dominion. I know her inside and out. She\u2019s not a girl prone to crying jags. So her behavior tonight has to be a direct reflection of something you\u2019ve done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean pounded his fist on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I finally reached her. I broke through that mile-thick armor of hers and saw the woman inside. Every minute you keep me from her is another minute she has to rebuild her walls. And to escape. I think she\u2019s planning to run.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe drew in a steadying breath, then forced himself to look at Kirkpatrick with a calm he didn\u2019t feel. The man didn\u2019t understand all the bits of Callie . . . but he was catching on fast. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games. If you know the girl, then you know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe neither confirmed nor denied. But Kirkpatrick\u2019s uncanny perception troubled him. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Her surrender was so sudden, as if she meant it as a good-bye.\u201d</p><p>If Callie cared for the Scot, she would absolutely give a huge chunk of her soul to him as a parting gift.</p><p>Thorpe wondered what she\u2019d planned on giving him. A note? An empty room where her scent would linger and haunt him? A hole in his heart?</p><p>Damn it, he sounded whiny and maudlin. He would not let Callie leave without cause. As far as he was concerned, no one here but him knew she was a fugitive. And Sean Kirkpatrick was nothing more than a blip on his radar.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t know if you\u2019re right until I talk to her.\u201d</p> <p>The other Dom snorted. \u201cAnd what good will that do? She\u2019s lived under your roof for four years. The girl is broken, and you haven\u2019t lifted a finger to heal her. Why start now?\u201d</p><p>It took everything Thorpe had not to snarl and surge across the desk. God, he\u2019d love to wrap his hands around the Scot\u2019s neck. Instead, he tapped his fingers on the desktop, staring down Kirkpatrick as if he were lint from his underwear.</p><p>\u201cSince you didn\u2019t know her when she first arrived here, allow me to call bullshit.\u201d But Thorpe understood well that while she\u2019d made strides under his protection, she was nowhere near whole.</p><p>In order to take Callie\u2019s hand and heal her, he\u2019d have to share too much of himself with her\u2014his heart, his truth, his secrets. He\u2019d have to be a better man, the sort who could love her openly with every cell in his body. She wouldn\u2019t accept less, nor should she.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care enough about Callie to try to conquer his demons. They were simply too big. And with her past . . . she\u2019d only leave him. If his wife of three years could walk away so easily, how badly would a girl on the run who lit the flame in his heart burn him?</p><p>Hell, she had no idea that he\u2019d figured out her identity. But she would run the moment she did. From what he could grasp, she did that any time she felt threatened or exposed. Exactly like Kirkpatrick was doing to her now.</p> <p>A little digging proved that she\u2019d abruptly left her last two hiding places, one after only a handful of weeks. The trail before that was stone cold, and he didn\u2019t imagine that she\u2019d stayed anywhere else for very long. If she had, she\u2019d have left an indelible impression. She had on him almost instantly.</p><p>Sean shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t know what she was like four years ago. But if you call her \u2018healed\u2019 now, you need to pull your head from your arse. She needs someone to care about her, give her tender guidance.\u201d</p><p>She did, and that was part of Thorpe\u2019s rub. But he also knew something else about Callie with absolute certainty that Sean didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe requires a firm hand.\u201d</p><p>The Scot shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re daft, man. That just fuels her defiance. It\u2019s love she needs.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. \u201cI won\u2019t disagree. Show me a woman who doesn\u2019t need love. It\u2019s the foundation Callie will build her life on\u2014with the right man. But she needs boundaries, too. Craves them. They\u2019ll make her feel safe. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve given her for the last four years.\u201d</p><p>Kirkpatrick glared incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, man. She needs what I can give her. I intend to make her whole, and I won\u2019t let you take her from me.\u201d</p><p>At least some of that was bullshit, and Thorpe resisted the urge to spit his anger. Apparently, Sean didn\u2019t understand that if he wanted to claim Callie, she\u2019d already be in his bed with his collar around her neck.</p> <p>\u201cI have no intention of coming between you two, and I\u2019d like to see her happy. I merely want to sort out this situation to my satisfaction before I decide whether to return her to your care.\u201d In case Sean\u2019s designs on Callie weren\u2019t purely Dominant, as Thorpe suspected. \u201cSo this is how it\u2019s going to go . . .\u201d He stood and paced, happily taking the psychological advantage of standing over Kirkpatrick. Time to test the son of a bitch. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me fifteen minutes with Callie, alone. Gloves off.\u201d</p><p>Sean jumped to his feet, fists clenched. \u201cThe hell I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you refusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right.\u201d The Scot turned red with anger.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d Thorpe smiled tightly. \u201cLet\u2019s review. By our agreement, you\u2019re not allowed to see the girl off the premises without my permission. I haven\u2019t granted that. You won\u2019t be seeing Callie here, either, unless I deem it in her best interest. So if you\u2019d like to continue taking her down the submissive path, then I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou controlling wanker. You have her so tightly under your thumb\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep her protected. I\u2019ll find out why she\u2019s upset, if she\u2019s truly planning to leave, and whether she wants to wear your collar anymore. I\u2019m a safe authority figure for her. She\u2019ll tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>Kirkpatrick looked like he was torn between violent disagreement and a desire to commit murder. \u201cI want to observe, then. Certainly you have a room or two here that allows for voyeurs.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe worked hard not to roll his eyes. \u201cI do. Callie has lived and worked here for four years. She knows each and every one of those rooms. She knows where our conversations won\u2019t be overheard. The girl is cautious and clever, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware. She\u2019s not going to compromise her privacy. That I can tell you unequivocally.\u201d</p><p>After a long sigh, Sean looked around the room like it held the answers to his burning questions. Or like he\u2019d rather look anywhere but at his rival. Thorpe smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pushy bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that part of being a Dom?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDo we have a deal, or can I escort you to the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like that,\u201d Sean accused.</p><p>Very much. But Thorpe held his tongue. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me at all. It isn\u2019t about you, either. If you care for Callie\u2019s welfare, then you won\u2019t mind me checking in with her to make sure she\u2019s all right and ready to see you again.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s blue eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you were anyone else, I wouldn\u2019t. But what do you mean \u2018gloves off\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, you\u2019ve noticed that Callie has . . . let\u2019s call it a strong will.\u201d</p><p>Sean snorted. \u201cStubborn as a mule, that one.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe tried not to smile. \u201cPrecisely. Given that obvious fact, for my conversation to have any effect on her, I need to have a full array of options available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking my permission to discipline her?\u201d The other man raised a dark brow.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not asking permission. I\u2019m telling you I\u2019ll need to keep that as a possibility.\u201d He shrugged with mock regret. \u201cMight as well be honest. With Callie, it\u2019s a probability.\u201d</p><p>And Thorpe wasn\u2019t lying to himself. He would thoroughly enjoy it. Anytime he got to touch the girl was a sublime thrill.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d Sean crossed his arms over his chest in challenge.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase. You don\u2019t like me. Likewise,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cBut we\u2019re both motivated by Callie and her well-being. So let\u2019s stay on task, shall we? You want to know if she\u2019s planning to leave. I want to ensure that she\u2019s in a good mental and emotional place before I allow her to scene with you again. These don\u2019t have to be mutually incompatible goals. Give me fifteen minutes. I\u2019ll give you answers.\u201d</p><p>Everything about Sean\u2019s body language said that he used all his restraint not to throw a punch. Pity. Knocking the asshole into next week would significantly improve Thorpe\u2019s mood. The man knew the feel of Callie\u2019s body intimately. He\u2019d had the opportunity to experience her surrender. He\u2019d had the luxury of telling the beautiful girl how he felt.</p><p>So yes, Thorpe felt every bit of his jealousy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being backed in a corner, but you haven\u2019t given me much choice. If you don\u2019t have answers in fifteen minutes, you give her back to me. I\u2019ll soothe her and set her right.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe headed for the door. \u201cMr. Kirkpatrick, the first rule of negotiation is that you must have some bargaining power. At the moment, you don\u2019t. Wait for my return.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let the Scot get a word in before he strode out of his office and grabbed his phone from his pocket. His first text was to Axel, probably holed up in the security booth with a few of his compadres. He told the other Dom to get to his office ASAP and that he was free to fuck with Sean\u2019s head if he could get any answers about why the Scot had come to Dominion.</p><p>After an enthusiastic yes in reply, he tapped a message to Zeb asking what Callie was doing. The reply came quickly. Sounds like she\u2019s in the shower.</p><p>Bullshit. Thorpe knew Callie\u2019s habits well. She\u2019d showered just before Sean\u2019s arrival. She wouldn\u2019t want to undo all that makeup when there was a chance she might see the man again. If there was one thing Callie didn\u2019t allow, it was for anyone to see her with a bare face.</p><p>Find out if she\u2019s packing a suitcase, he replied. The door will be locked. Do what you have to do.</p><p>This time, the pause seemed to last forever. While he waited, Thorpe grabbed a few things he might need from around the dungeon to make his point with Callie and slipped them into his pocket. Then he let his long legs eat up the distance between the main part of the club and Callie\u2019s room. Just before he reached her door, Zeb\u2019s answer came. Picked the lock. She\u2019s shoved most of her bathroom and closet into two bags.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Thorpe cursed roundly. Sean had scared the hell out of her. He wished now that he had punched the asshole.</p><p>I\u2019ll take it from here, he texted back, then pocketed his phone again.</p><p>The door to Callie\u2019s room opened, and Zeb stepped out. With a passing nod, Thorpe greeted him, then strode inside, shutting and locking the door behind him. He shoved her desk chair against it for good measure.</p><p>The air was humid from her recent \u201cshower.\u201d She\u2019d flung on every light. Her two hastily packed bags sat in the corner near the door.</p><p>Callie paced in her little red robe, her manic gait taking her from one side of the room to the other. Goddamn it, she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. He\u2019d bet she hadn\u2019t bothered with panties, either.</p><p>Most notably, she\u2019d stripped off her collar and was clutching it in a tight grasp. His heart stuttered. Was she removing it for good?</p><p>As Thorpe cleared his throat, he tamped down encroaching relief and told himself to take things one step at a time.</p><p>She turned to spear him with a resolute stare. \u201cYou said you wanted to know when I\u2019m leaving. It\u2019s now. I quit.\u201d</p><p>CALLIE stared at Thorpe. He had almost no reaction to her words. Gee, it would have been nice if you\u2019d given a shit. Then she squashed the thought. It wasn\u2019t his fault that she cared far more about him than he did for her. She\u2019d known for years that Thorpe had the power to yank her heart out of her chest and crush it beneath his very expensive Salvatore Ferragamo loafers. It sucked that she\u2019d been stupid enough to let him.</p><p>Even though she cared deeply for Sean and\u2014if she could believe his passionate declaration\u2014he loved her, that didn\u2019t mitigate her attachment to Dominion\u2019s owner. She\u2019d always been a little screwed up. This just proved it.</p><p>Thorpe wandered farther into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cI appreciate the notice, but I need a bit longer than ten minutes to replace you, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She tossed her hair over her shoulder and stared out the dark window. He was far too beautiful to look at. \u201cYou\u2019ll find someone else soon. You won\u2019t miss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how I\u2019ll feel. Sit down, Callie.\u201d</p><p>His tone told her that no wasn\u2019t an acceptable answer. Damn it, he intended to interrogate her about Sean. Callie couldn\u2019t take it now. Leaving them both was hard enough . . .</p><p>She fought down panic and turned back to him. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He pointed to a spot on the bed right beside him and didn\u2019t say a word until she flopped down. \u201cGood. Sean knows I\u2019ve come and that I intend to understand what happened tonight. Tell me everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Thorpe was here with Sean\u2019s blessing, she wasn\u2019t going to worm out of this conversation, damn it.</p><p>As she set Sean\u2019s collar down on her nightstand, Callie mentally sorted through everything she could tell him. He must know that she had feelings for her Sir. More feelings than she was comfortable with. Thorpe missed very little, so he was no doubt aware that Sean had never taken her past her limits, ignored her safe word, or acted in any way out of line. Besides, if she was going to skip out on Thorpe after he\u2019d kept a roof over her and ensured her safety for four years, she owed him more than a flat-out lie.</p><p>Wringing her hands, she forced herself to meet his intent gray gaze and confessed something else that had been niggling in the back of her brain. \u201cSomething is . . . off about him.\u201d</p><p>That clearly piqued Thorpe\u2019s interest. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p> <p>Callie tapped her toes. She had to express her concerns about Sean without giving her past away. Putting Thorpe in the terrible position of harboring a known fugitive wasn\u2019t how she wanted to repay his kindness.</p><p>\u201cHe asks a lot of questions. I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sent her a wry smile. \u201cIf it\u2019s about your limits, that\u2019s to be expected. Pet, he\u2019s a Dom. It\u2019s his job to get in your head. Frankly, you need some untangling. You might find it uncomfortable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to know how many brothers and sisters I have, the name of my first pet, if I ever took special trips as a child . . . He seems really focused on things that shouldn\u2019t matter if all he wants is a sub in a club.\u201d</p><p>It was nothing Thorpe did or any change in his expression, but Callie had the distinct impression that he was enraged. \u201cHas he always behaved this way with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me the first time,\u201d Thorpe scolded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem.\u201d</p><p>That only made him more forbidding. \u201cYou\u2019re always my concern, Callie.\u201d</p><p>The possession in his voice excited her more than she wanted to admit. \u201cWell, I\u2019m telling you now. What he wants to know seems weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like it\u2019s weird that he walked into Dominion and immediately had some sort of hard-on for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not weird. That makes him a man.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThere are plenty of other subs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them are you.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, sometimes Thorpe could\u2014after weeks of being a giant pain in her ass\u2014say the nicest things. She teared up. Gawd, she was really going to miss him.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d he went on. \u201cI don\u2019t like the questions he\u2019s asking you, either. I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re relevant to helping you down your submissive path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. The other thing is . . . In almost every other way, he\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe regarded her intently. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s a player?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d But something wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to make of him, though.\u201d</p><p>Because if Sean was a cop, a bounty hunter, or an assassin, wouldn\u2019t he have either dragged her in or done her in by now?</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say to you tonight that made you want to run away from him?\u201d</p><p>Oh. Ouch. Yeah, she needed to remember that Thorpe never hesitated to go for the jugular.</p><p>\u201cNothing he meant to be threatening or scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. Be more specific.\u201d Thorpe\u2019s tone sharpened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDodging my question isn\u2019t an option, pet.\u201d That warning note in his voice made her shiver. \u201cI\u2019d rather not see you leave over whatever drivel he spewed. Tell me. Maybe I can fix the situation.\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing enough that he\u2019d probably seen her and Sean having sex. He\u2019d been so close, he couldn\u2019t have missed their climatic finish. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, I\u2019m not getting through to you, so let me be plain. You will tell me now or I will paddle your pretty little ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>His smile contradicted her. \u201cI\u2019ve informed Sean that it\u2019s a distinct possibility. Besides, you\u2019ve taken off his collar. If you think he\u2019s being less than honest, you don\u2019t intend to put it back on, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? I already told you, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I know why.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to her feet, gaping at him. \u201cYou\u2019d keep me here against my will?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe crossed an ankle over his knee and brushed an imaginary thread from his trousers. \u201cYour tone suggests I should be uncomfortable with that idea. Until you\u2019re honest with me, I assure you I\u2019m not. Furthermore, if Kirkpatrick is troubling you, he\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>Callie blinked at him, processing everything he\u2019d delivered in that low, almost relaxed voice. She wasn\u2019t fooled. Under his urbane, oh so cultured fa\u00e7ade beat the heart of a predator. She\u2019d seen him take rivals apart both mentally and physically. Thorpe wasn\u2019t someone a sane person crossed.</p><p>Callie weighed her words carefully. \u201cSean made me realize I\u2019m not cut out for a Dom/sub relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, pet?\u201d</p><p>She sidestepped his question. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a little bored with Dallas. Los Angeles is calling my name. Every time Xander comes by and talks about his trips to the city, it sounds fabulous. It\u2019s just time to move on.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe said nothing for a long moment. He simply stood and towered over her, that charcoal stare boring into her. \u201cThere will be consequences for anything less than totally honesty, so think carefully, Callie. Would you like to recant or amend your statement in any way?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Thorpe knew something. Or everything. Had he heard Sean\u2019s declaration of love?</p><p>She tossed her head back and thrust her hands on her hips. This was going to be ugly no matter what. Might as well go for broke. \u201cButt out and stop acting like you\u2019re my father.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cThat\u2019s one role I will never fill, but I have no problem putting you in your place.\u201d</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t even have a moment to wonder what his silky vow meant before he hauled her into his arms and dragged her, kicking and screaming, back to her bed. He sat, wrangling her with embarrassing ease, then spread his long legs and laid her over his lap, face down.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to spank me!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t hesitate for an instant. \u201cI am. I told you there would be consequences. You should know I always keep up my end of a bargain.\u201d</p><p>He planted his huge palm in the small of her back, silently telling her how futile her struggles were. With his free hand, he slid the silk of her robe up and over her bare ass. Her entire body tensed. What was he seeing? Thinking? And why was the thought of his discipline so damn arousing?</p><p>There was definitely something wrong with her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get a safe word?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not strapping you to a cross and unleashing a single tail on you, so don\u2019t insult me. I know you. I\u2019ve spanked you before.\u201d</p><p>For demonstration purposes, yes. In fact, the first time, she\u2019d giggled\u2014until he landed a single smack on her ass. Then it hadn\u2019t been funny anymore. By the fifth swat, she\u2019d been uncomfortably wet. By the tenth, she\u2019d had to bite back a plea to come. Thorpe had some mysterious effect on her that she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Last time you did this, you couldn\u2019t get my clothes off fast enough. When you did, you couldn\u2019t wait to run away. You\u2019re not going to do anything to me now.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s grip on her tightened.</p><p>Crap, she was taking a huge chance by throwing that night in his face. No doubt, she was pissing him off. She suspected she was also arousing him, because as she wriggled on his lap, Callie couldn\u2019t miss the fact that he was hard as hell.</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he quipped in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to spank you until you answer my question and apologize for your disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am a Dom, and this behavior is unbecoming. Start counting, pet. Don\u2019t stop until I do.\u201d</p><p>Callie tried again to squirm away. She rubbed against his cock, and he hissed. Then his palm landed on her ass in a blistering blow.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d she protested, resisting the urge to rub her right cheek.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Sean\u2019s right, not yours.\u201d She grasped at straws.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019ve rescinded his collar. Since you said you had, I\u2019ll remind you that you live here, you work for me, and you\u2019re being very bratty. That\u2019s three strikes, pet.\u201d</p><p>She had no chance to scrape together a reply before he hit her again. Her left cheek stung, but not as much as her pride. And it didn\u2019t take long for tingles to dance across her skin. Her blood heated, and her body melted under his touch.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t counted yet,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cShall we start over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understand a Dom\u2019s fascination with a sub counting. You\u2019re educated. You can get to ten without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m stopping at ten?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Callie drew in a breath and tried to calm herself. \u201cThorpe, please . . . Can\u2019t I have a little privacy? Isn\u2019t it enough for you to know that Sean didn\u2019t mean to upset me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. As long as you\u2019re at Dominion, that\u2019s my call. I\u2019ve protected you for years and I don\u2019t plan on stopping.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt pleases me to know you\u2019re safe, but I find all this defiance when I\u2019m trying to help you deeply disappointing.\u201d</p><p>The fight went out of her. Callie hated to let Thorpe down. Most everyone else could blow it out their ass for all she cared. But the big Dom mattered too much to her\u2014and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being manipulative,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cOne. And two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always manipulative when you\u2019re being both mouthy and dishonest. If Mr. Kirkpatrick didn\u2019t show you the error of your ways, I will.\u201d He punctuated the statement with another swat to her right cheek.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d She knew she sounded pouty.</p><p>Thorpe always got the best of her. Half the time she couldn\u2019t decide if she resented that as much as the way their verbal fencing made her ache endlessly for him. It didn\u2019t matter that she inevitably lost their battles of will. The power radiating off Thorpe aroused her like nothing else. It always had.</p><p>But Sean had a huge chunk of her heart. What sucked more was that caring about either\u2014much less both\u2014of them was not only futile, it could be deadly.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>THORPE couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Callie\u2019s reddening ass . . . just like he\u2019d never been able to in the past. He took a particular pride in knowing she wore his mark, even temporarily.</p><p>God, he was a sick fuck. But that wasn\u2019t going to stop him.</p><p>He had to discipline her. More important, he had to give her a reason to stay.</p><p>Her body perched over his lap, her every muscle tense. She panted. Her skin flushed. Callie might be angry as hell with him, but one thing was clear and sent a jolt of electric desire to his cock: She hadn\u2019t stopped wanting him in the last two years any more than he\u2019d stopped craving her. And if she was going to rescind Kirkpatrick\u2019s collar, now might be his only chance to touch her. If she still ran, it would hurt like hell\u2014but he couldn\u2019t let this chance slip by.</p><p>Dragging in a ragged breath, he brought his hand up and smacked her ass again, repeating the gesture the second the count left her lips. Slowly, her body thawed until she sank into him, her responses turning breathy.</p><p>Ten, eleven, twelve . . . He slipped into a rhythm, slow and meaningful, deliberate, measured, strong. Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen . . . Why was it so fucking easy to get into his Dom space with Callie? He never had to try. The moment he touched her, it was there, a boundless pool of it. He felt her needs as if they were his own. With her sprawled across his lap, he could read her utterly, each and every nuance.</p><p>She wanted him. Yes, she\u2019d been thinking about that goddamn Scot earlier. She was likely also wondering how she could have feelings for two men at once. As much as he disliked Kirkpatrick, Thorpe wondered that, too. But that bastard was no longer important. This tempo, his punishment, her peace\u2014they both needed it. Then he\u2019d bring her against his chest and care for her, cuddle and shower her with worship, find out what she needed to stay.</p><p>Callie might not be his, but he\u2019d do whatever it took to keep her here.</p><p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d she whispered, absolutely limp against his thighs.</p><p>Thorpe had no doubt her head was floating. Her defiance was gone. Her ass throbbed a fiery red. Her cunt seeped a sweet musk. His hand tingled. His mouth watered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just like the last time he\u2019d spanked her, he was dying to fuck her. Like the last two years of avoiding every opportunity to touch her had never existed.</p><p>Letting out a harsh breath, Thorpe dragged his stinging palm over her burning backside, slowly soothing out the ache.</p><p>\u201cTime to apologize, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d Her voice was slurred.</p> <p>Callie sounded mostly sincere. He smiled, despite the shitty mess he found himself in.</p><p>How long could he keep this girl believing that he didn\u2019t want her with every breath he drew?</p><p>On the other hand, what else could he do? Melissa had upended his world after she\u2019d promised to love him until death parted them, then suddenly served him with divorce papers. And that just topped the stinking pile of shit. As much as he adored Callie, he couldn\u2019t risk his heart, especially for a woman with one foot out the door.</p><p>Minus any easy answers, Thorpe gathered the pliant beauty into his lap. She rested her head on his shoulder. With his chest tight and aching, he wrapped his arms around her and kissed the top of her head, savoring her nearness.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Sean say to upset you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat he loves me.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe winced. He\u2019d known that, but hearing her admit it still jabbed him. He forced himself to smooth his features and lifted her chin with one hand. \u201cWhy did that make you cry?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she blinked, opening her eyes, and focusing that dazed blue stare on him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t love anyone.\u201d Callie lifted her hand and cupped his jaw, smoothing her thumb over his cheek. \u201cBut it\u2019s too late. It has been for a long time.\u201d</p><p>His heart lurched. Jesus, her feelings weren\u2019t a surprise, not really. The unspoken emotions between them had been the neon billboard in the room for years.</p><p>He wrapped her hand in his and drew it away from his face. \u201cYou have feelings for Kirkpatrick, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes clouded over. Tears leaked out. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d</p> <p>Of course she was. She didn\u2019t have the life experience to deal with this shit. Hell, he was significantly older and he didn\u2019t feel equipped to handle it, either.</p><p>Sean\u2019s words haunted him. She needs tender guidance. Thorpe had guided her, all right. But he\u2019d never been able to do it tenderly. Boundaries and protection he could give her without compromising his heart, but seeing the love in her eyes now as she pressed her fragile body against him . . . Everything about her was killing his resolve to remain aloof.</p><p>\u201cCallie, pet. You can\u2019t leave me.\u201d His voice croaked, and an unfamiliar sting prickled his eyes.</p><p>He slammed his lids down. Damn it, he could not afford this weakness.</p><p>\u201cBetter for you if I do.\u201d She sounded so damn sad.</p><p>Thorpe shook his head, holding her closer. \u201cYou\u2019d ruin me, pet. In fact, I think you already have.\u201d</p><p>Callie threw her arms around him, her breath warm against his neck. He gripped her tighter. Normally, he\u2019d wish he hadn\u2019t spilled his guts . . . but he would try if any bit of the truth kept her with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be my biggest regret,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Goddamn it, that hurt.</p><p>Maybe he should simply admit that he knew she was a fugitive. Almost as quickly, Thorpe dismissed the idea. If she was insistent on running now, he suspected that divulging what he knew would only make Callie more determined to flee.</p><p>He held her tighter, taking in everything that made her uniquely Callie. The firm little curves of her body, those long lashes against her fair cheeks, her fingers digging into his shirtfront as if seeking reassurance. This close, he smelled her citrus shampoo and the remnants of the hair color he knew she used as a disguise. Her signature pink polish colored her petite toes, spritzed with glitter. And the soft little shudders of her body as she cried ripped out his heart.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give you a chance to regret me, pet. I sure as hell refuse to wish I\u2019d done something different while I had you with me.\u201d He was already going to regret the last four years. \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>She gasped softly, her gaze shooting up to his. She swallowed. Desire mingled with despair and wracked her face. \u201cThorpe . . . I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cBecause of Kirkpatrick?\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said you\u2019re rescinding his collar. If you\u2019re leaving here, you\u2019re obviously leaving him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d More tears clouded her eyes.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t just about misguided loyalty to the Scot, what else was she hesitating about? The hurt from his desertion two Decembers ago? Christ, that had to be it. Remorse wracked him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t walk away from you this time without giving you pleasure. I give you my word.\u201d</p><p>Callie stared, breath held, the moment frozen. Thorpe watched her face as a thousand thoughts zipped through her head. And he saw the second she decided that if she was severing her bond with Kirkpatrick and fleeing, then she\u2019d rather have him once than never at all.</p><p>With a sad smile, she climbed out of his lap and onto her bed, lying across it. Thorpe turned to watch her as she held out her arms to him, a silent siren call he had no idea how or if he could resist.</p><p>On the other hand, he had his answer about her parting gift to him. Tonight, she intended to give all of herself. Her body. Her heart. Her soul.</p><p>Her response both touched and infuriated him to the core. The girl was often so damn unpredictable. Right now, he\u2019d have to be the same.</p><p>Standing, Thorpe shucked his suit coat. Then he doffed his cuff links, setting them on her nightstand. He draped his shirt over his coat at the head of the bed. Then he checked the pockets of his trousers. What he needed still rested inside. With a bracing breath, he turned to Callie.</p><p>\u201cRobe off, pet. Spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers trembled as she worked the knot around her waist free. With a little lift and an arch of her graceful spine, she pulled it away from her body, gathering the silk in one hand, then letting it puddle on the floor. He would never get over how beautiful she was and the visceral reaction she elicited in him every damn time he came near her.</p><p>Callie slowly parted her thighs. His heart chugged. Technically, he should walk away and leave her untouched until she formally severed her relationship with Sean. Putting his hands on another Dom\u2019s sub wasn\u2019t ethical. The fact that he suspected Kirkpatrick of being a deceitful douche bag wasn\u2019t relevant. Thorpe realized it was possible he\u2019d convinced himself that these were extenuating circumstances because he wanted Callie so badly. But he couldn\u2019t make himself care. This was likely his last chance to persuade her to stay. If he had to risk his reputation in the BDSM community to keep her safe from a man who might be trying to snuff her out or lock her in prison, so be it.</p><p>Her bare pussy splayed out in front of him, pink and swollen and tantalizing. Even if she remained at Dominion, this opportunity would probably never come again. If she wasn\u2019t with Kirkpatrick, she\u2019d be with someone else. Callie wasn\u2019t cut out to spend her life alone, and he shouldn\u2019t punish her because he\u2019d resigned himself to solitude.</p><p>Thorpe refused to take from her now, but he would gladly give.</p><p>He lowered himself to the bed between her legs. Her stare never wavered from him, but he heard her indrawn breath. As he engulfed her hip with his hand, she shivered. Then, settling himself on his chest, Thorpe took her other hip in hand and dragged her closer, until her pussy was a breath away from his lips.</p><p>\u201cThorpe, you said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assumed.\u201d He corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re not dictating the terms, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She thrashed beneath him.</p><p>\u201cProblem, pet?\u201d</p><p>Callie bent her knees, writhed, lifted her hips restlessly. \u201cYou make me ache.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cYou do the same to me. Relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways topping from the bottom,\u201d he chided. But that was part of her charm.</p><p>Before she could reply, he set his mouth over her pussy and began consuming as much of Callie as he could. He\u2019d dreamed of her. Her scent had driven him to obsess about her flavor day after day, seemingly forever. But the moment she hit his tongue, it was like tasting a delicacy he constantly craved. Like Callie herself, her pussy was sweet and tart and soft . . . with just a hint of something he hadn\u2019t encountered in any other woman. And doubted he ever would again.</p><p>Her soft gasp went straight to his cock, and he raised up on his elbows, his thumbs parting the swollen lips of her sex. He lashed her hardening clit with gentle, rhythmic strokes, concentrating on growing her need. Her skin turned a rosy pink. She grabbed at the sheets with restless fingers. Her hips moved in time with his mouth. Her gasps became moans.</p><p>Lifting his lips for a moment, he nipped at her thigh and tended to her engorged bundle of nerves with sure fingers. \u201cDoes that feel good, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Callie thrashed under him. \u201cPlease . . . More.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe smiled, eager to indulge her. He bent to her again, raking his tongue through her sultry sex. This time, he didn\u2019t bother with a slow courting of her flesh. He seized her, sucking at her clit, drawing her deeper into pleasure, wordlessly demanding her orgasm. If he had one chance to taste her, he planned to shove her to the brink, take her power, then drive it back into her so she never forgot this night.</p><p>Her moans shortened, went up an octave. Under his hands, her thighs clenched. The rest of her body tensed. Her fingers found their way into his hair and pulled. A shudder slammed down his spine. She\u2019d be a hellcat to fuck, an active, clawing, screaming lover he\u2019d want again and again.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t stop thinking that, he would rip his pants off and find out for himself. Staying on course and making her feel treasured was more important than getting off.</p><p>Thorpe slid two fingers inside her. Oh, fuck, was she ever tight. He gave grudging credit to Kirkpatrick for lasting as long as he had. Being inside Callie\u2019s little sweltering cunt was one of his favorite fantasies. When he was alone and tired of all the women who joined Dominion because they\u2019d read some fucking book and had no clue what submission actually meant, he escaped to his shower, stroked himself, and imagined her.</p><p>Probing Callie gently, it didn\u2019t take him long to learn where she was sensitive. Her bucking body and imploring whimpers gave her away.</p><p>He went after her in earnest, eating at her like a juicy piece of fruit, fucking her thoroughly with his fingers and tongue\u2014and wishing to hell he could mount and claim her.</p><p>\u201cThorpe!\u201d</p><p>She was begging for his permission. It was in her voice. In her swollen pussy. In her clutching fingers. In her heels as they dug into the mattress beside him.</p><p>Fuck, yes. He was going to make Callie splinter into little pieces before him. And he was going to enjoy the hell out of seeing her shatter\u2014this time for him and him alone.</p><p>Keeping his fingers tucked tightly inside her, Thorpe worked his way up her body, kissing and nipping her stomach, the underside of her breasts, her nipples, her neck, then her lush bow of a mouth. God, he hadn\u2019t kissed her in forever and he\u2019d missed it so damn much. He wanted to crawl inside her, take her, thrill her, please her.</p><p>He wanted to own her.</p><p>Imfuckingpossible.</p><p>They had here and now. Tomorrow . . . he had no idea what would happen. He was used to controlling most everything around him. But he couldn\u2019t control Callie or the future. That fact chafed him like nothing else.</p><p>Thorpe sank deeper into her mouth, prowling past her plump lips to curl his tongue around hers and capture every bit of her sweet response he could. He moaned, fitting his body against hers and slowly withdrawing his fingers from her pussy, letting them hover just over her clit, where she needed him to touch her most.</p><p>\u201cHands over your head, pet.\u201d</p><p>Callie complied without pausing for even a heartbeat. \u201cPlease. I need you . . .\u201d</p><p>She did, but not in the way she begged for. She needed the limits he\u2019d once given her. He\u2019d stopped because she\u2019d turned to Kirkpatrick. And he hadn\u2019t fought for her. Now she sought to leave him altogether.</p><p>You\u2019re only getting what you deserve.</p><p>Shoving aside the mocking voice, he reached into his pocket and withdrew the cuffs he\u2019d secreted there. Before she knew what he was about, he flicked one around her left wrist, poised above her head. The other cuff he tethered to the metal frame of her platform bed with a jangle.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, tugging and frowning when the cuffs clattered.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He demanded, setting his fingers back over her clit. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice trembled. Her body shook. Her eyes pleaded.</p><p>With his cock as hard as iron, Thorpe hissed in a breath and delved deep into her eyes. \u201cTake the pleasure I\u2019m giving you as a vow, pet. If you leave me, I will hunt you to the ends of the earth. There won\u2019t be a place you hide where I can\u2019t find you. I will never stop looking. I will never give up. I will never let you go when I can save you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThorpe, don\u2019t . . . You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off by working her clit expertly with two fingers devastating either side of the little bud, then alternately rubbing extra friction on top.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. I told you to look at me. Now,\u201d he demanded. \u201cCome!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned a dizzying blue, widening with every breath she hitched in, emphasized by the red flush of her cheeks. He didn\u2019t give Callie permission, but she screamed anyway. The sound rang in his ears, echoed off the walls, and no doubt drifted down the hall. It went on and on as her body convulsed and her clit turned to stone under his touch, then pulsed brilliantly again and again.</p> <p>Callie tumbled into his eyes as the world fell away. Only she existed.</p><p>God, she was stunning. When she surrendered, she did it absolutely.</p><p>And the knowledge that he had to leave her now because he couldn\u2019t trust himself not to strip off and fuck her was killing him.</p><p>Closing his eyes, gathering his will, he kissed Callie on each hot cheek, brushed his lips over her damp forehead, then took her mouth in one last lingering press. He stayed there, struggling to drag in air. A moment, then another. He cherished each precious, irreplaceable second. Callie sobbed, and his chest shattered.</p><p>Thorpe broke the kiss and pressed his forehead to hers, nuzzling her.</p> <p>\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t walk away,\u201d she said through tears.</p><p>\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t before I gave you pleasure. You\u2019re not getting away from me, pet. Don\u2019t make me show you my ruthless side.\u201d He thumbed the wells of her eyes dry with a soft touch. Then he draped the comforter over her, found her purse, and rifled through it until he located her car keys. Pocketing them, he shrugged on his shirt, attached his cuff links, then grabbed his coat and her packed bags.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Thorpe. You can\u2019t undo me like that, then get up and leave.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>THE second Thorpe let himself out, Kirkpatrick came stomping down the hall, barreling toward him like a man ready for a fight. How the hell had he gotten past Axel?</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell are you doing to Callie? I can hear her screaming all over the club.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I hurt her?\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s face turned red. \u201cI think you put your fucking hands all over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing, ding, ding. Someone get the man a prize.\u201d He edged away from Sean, intent on reaching his office.</p><p>Kirkpatrick jabbed him in the jaw, then followed up with a mean left hook to the gut. Thorpe hadn\u2019t seen it coming . . . but he should have.</p><p>He doubled over, and Sean took the opportunity to slam him against the wall. \u201cHow dare you touch my collared submissive? I\u2019m bloody in love with Callie. I know you overheard me tell her. I made certain of it.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe stared at his unwanted rival, trying to shove him off. Kirkpatrick wasn\u2019t budging. Well, the guy had some game. Interesting note for future reference . . . But he wasn\u2019t going to tell Sean that Callie might not be his collared submissive for long. Saying so was her place\u2014even if he\u2019d love to shove it in the bastard\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cFor some reason I can\u2019t comprehend, she has feelings for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Sean snorted. \u201cNot too many, I guess, if she decided to go straight from fucking me to you.\u201d</p> <p>As much as Thorpe would love to let Kirkpatrick believe the worst, he refused to give Sean a reason to punish Callie for his own actions. \u201cI didn\u2019t fuck her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to,\u201d Sean accused.</p><p>\u201cThat goes without saying. Callie is a beautiful woman. As you\u2019ve previously noted, I care for her. Why are we covering this well trampled ground again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s my right to know exactly what you did with her.\u201d He bounced Thorpe against the wall again.</p><p>The fucker had punched him so hard, he almost felt queasy. But he refused to show weakness.</p><p>\u201cGet off me or I\u2019ll have you arrested for assault.\u201d To make his point, Thorpe bent and shoved his shoulder into the Scot\u2019s and, using the wall as leverage, heaved the other man off him. Then he whipped out his phone to text Axel and tapped out their code for \u201cproblem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for you,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that Callie has feelings for us both, and she offered us the same good-bye. I got her attention, made a few things clear, and left her cuffed to her bed alone, all safe and sound. I even swiped her car keys.\u201d He withdrew them from his pocket and dangled them in front of Sean\u2019s face.</p><p>The Scot\u2019s expression turned somewhere between sour and disbelieving. \u201cI want to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m still not convinced that you\u2019re in her best interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Kirkpatrick scoffed.</p><p>\u201cNo. Which is the only reason she wasn\u2019t wearing a collar when you came sniffing around. If and when I decide you can see her, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>On cue, Axel charged down the hall with a couple of his staff in tow. Sean came out swinging, but the guards each grabbed one of his arms.</p><p>Axel just shoved a hand in Kirkpatrick\u2019s hair and yanked. \u201cYou had to pee, huh? Let\u2019s go, motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe smiled. No one had ever accused Axel of playing nice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me; I\u2019ll call you.\u201d Thorpe shouted as the men forcibly carried Sean, shouting and belligerent, from the club.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Sean yelled over his shoulder, still fighting them. \u201cShe\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d he muttered under his breath, then extracted his phone again, making strides to his office.</p><p>Once inside, he paused, then chose a course of action. Lance had been in the dungeon earlier. Perfect. Callie needed care, and she\u2019d do her best to outsmart or wheedle another sub to get away right now. Thorpe had hoped that merely kindling the sexual fire between them might persuade her to stay, but . . . wishful thinking. It would have been smarter if he\u2019d just fucked her since that had likely been his only opportunity. Damn it. Now he had to tear his thoughts from her pussy and act strategically. Lance wouldn\u2019t take a lick of crap from her. He was a strong, clever Dom\u2014and didn\u2019t have a heterosexual bone in his body. Even better.</p><p>Axel returned a few minutes later, winded and looking like he might have a shiner tomorrow. \u201cCan I press assault charges?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe slanted the other Dom a glare. \u201cWe don\u2019t need trouble here. Wouldn\u2019t you rather meet him in a dark alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah. Is that option on the table, boss?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHave fun. Don\u2019t get caught. But before you go, would you ask Lance if he\u2019d take care of Callie?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Axel left. Minutes later, he escorted Lance down the hallway.</p><p>Lance paused at Thorpe\u2019s door. \u201cExpecting trouble from our little vixen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust constantly.\u201d Thorpe smiled faintly. \u201cI have an urgent phone call to make, so I appreciate your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways happy to help.\u201d</p><p>When Lance disappeared, and Axel headed back to the dungeon, Thorpe indulged in one thing he never did during the club\u2019s business hours. But in this case, he figured he was entitled. He poured himself a stiff scotch, plopped into his chair, and downed it. Then he broke his own rules again and called a client to beg.</p><p>Logan Edgington answered his phone on the third ring, the noise from a television cluttering the background until he killed it. \u201cThorpe. \u2019Sup, man? It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a situation. I need some information. I\u2019d like to speak with your wife, if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>The former SEAL hesitated for a moment. \u201cYeah. We were just watching a movie. Tara\u2019s due in about two months and is having some problems with insomnia. If I don\u2019t keep her occupied, she\u2019ll be up \u2018nesting\u2019 half the night, which is code for moving furniture without consulting me or asking for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he heard Tara protest in the background. \u201cThe twins are active at night. I can\u2019t sleep when I\u2019m being constantly kicked. I said I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, after I added another infraction to your quickly growing list for after these babies are born. You\u2019re racking them up, Cherry.\u201d When his wife sighed noisily, Logan just laughed. \u201cMy brother\u2019s wife, Kata, is five months behind her and still in the tired-all-the-time phase, so she conked out for the night. If you can occupy Tara\u2019s brain right now, you\u2019ll be my hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve definitely got a winner,\u201d Thorpe promised. \u201cAre you sure she\u2019s up to it?\u201d</p><p>Logan scoffed. \u201cHer ankles may be swollen, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with her mind. Here you go.\u201d</p><p>After a quick scuffle, Tara\u2019s voice sounded over the line. \u201cHi, Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, sweet girl. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so late, but I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have contacts at the FBI from your analyst days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She shuffled in bed again. \u201cCan\u2019t find a comfortable position. Sorry. One second . . . There. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBackground on someone new here at Dominion. He\u2019s a potential problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you looking for his arrest record, criminal background . . . that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Thorpe confirmed. \u201cAnything you can find out, really. I\u2019ve thought for some weeks that there\u2019s something about him that seems off. His story checks out on the surface, but it feels awfully pat. I suspect he\u2019s not who he claims.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s fixated on Callie.\u201d</p><p>Tara grunted. \u201cYou\u2019re calling me about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she isn\u2019t your favorite person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, not exactly. She wanted my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to divulge Callie\u2019s secrets, but he needed to set Tara at ease so she\u2019d provide answers. \u201cActually, I believe she was trying to get my attention with her brattiness and misbehavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like she got it.\u201d</p><p>And then some. \u201cShe used Logan to reach me because she knew he wouldn\u2019t be quiet about her antics. He was a big target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still is.\u201d Tara sighed. \u201cAll right, who is this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe uses the name Sean Kirkpatrick. I\u2019ll send you a picture when we hang up. It\u2019s not fabulous since it\u2019s security footage. I don\u2019t know much about him. Early thirties, says he\u2019s from Scotland. Supposedly, he\u2019s a freelance project manager who travels for a living.\u201d But he sure as hell had a mean left hook for a desk jockey.</p><p>\u201cKnow where he went to school? When he came to the U.S.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend over the picture. I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Call me with anything, day or night. My time is short. I don\u2019t trust this asshole.\u201d</p><p>Tara hesitated. \u201cDo you think he\u2019d hurt her?\u201d</p><p>His gut said no. For all of Kirkpatrick\u2019s faults, he seemed as fiercely protective of Callie as Thorpe himself. But would Sean separate her from him and steal her away from Dominion? Absolutely.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m not taking any possibility off the table yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Give me a few hours. I\u2019ll see what I can dig up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Thorpe smiled into the phone. Taking action felt good.</p><p>Facts would help him decide how to proceed with Kirkpatrick. Personally, Thorpe hoped the Scot had something dirty and blackmail-worthy in his past so he could hang it over Sean\u2019s head to make him disappear from Callie\u2019s life.</p><p>Then . . . he\u2019d set about figuring what to do once he had her all to himself again.</p><p>SEAN paced the sterile corporate apartment he\u2019d been forced to hang his hat in for the last eight months. The bland beige walls were closing in like a trash compactor about to squeeze the life out of him. He had unreturned messages and a boss who wanted to know what the fuck was going on.</p><p>Getting screwed by the competition. How\u2019s that for a goddamn update?</p><p>Sighing, he stared at his phone, willing Callie to call him. He had a million questions for her, needed to hear what was in her head. Mostly, he wanted to know if she was all right. And what that son of a bitch, Mitchell Thorpe, had done to her.</p><p>After stalking to the little desk that sat beside his bed, he sorted through a pile of file folders and came to the one he sought. Pulling it open, he scanned the information he already knew backward and forward. His nemesis was thirty-nine. His wife had divorced him and was now remarried with two kids. He came from a thoroughly upper-middle-class background. Good schools in Connecticut. Yacht club parents. Yale University graduate, then a stint as a stockbroker in New York City in his early twenties. Owner of Dominion for the last dozen years, with an interest in BDSM for even longer. But Sean read nothing in the paperwork that would tell him how to get the upper hand again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d miscalculated tonight, ranking his desire for Callie above everything else. He had a feeling that by fucking her, he\u2019d roused the competitor in Thorpe. The man didn\u2019t intend to lose.</p><p>\u201cToo bad, asshole. That goes double for me,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Tossing the folder back on the desk, he paced to the front door and back again. It only took eight steps.</p><p>Shoving his hand into his pocket, he yanked his phone out and dialed Callie. Immediately, her voicemail greeting chimed in his ear. Sean cursed. Either his lovely hadn\u2019t remembered to charge her phone again . . . or she wasn\u2019t speaking to him.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, he couldn\u2019t afford to let this silence between them fester or grow. But he also couldn\u2019t go back to Dominion tonight. After the right cross to Axel\u2019s eye, he figured that not only was he off the club\u2019s membership roster for a while, but he\u2019d better watch his back. Normally, Sean would break into the club. Though challenging, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible. But if he got caught, Thorpe would throw him out for good and everything he\u2019d worked eight months to build would swirl down the toilet. Things weren\u2019t dire enough to risk that yet.</p><p>Still, he had to find some way to reassure himself that Callie was all right.</p><p>The one silver lining was that Thorpe had prevented her from fleeing Dominion\u2014at least so far. She intended to. Of that, Sean had no doubt. He really hated to give Thorpe any credit, but he had to since the man had cuffed her to her own bed and taken her car keys. Sean knew he would probably have opted to reason with her and shower her with affection first.</p><p>He wondered now if that tactic would have backfired.</p><p>She requires a firm hand.</p> <p>Thorpe\u2019s assertion echoed through his head. Damn, but the sly bastard might be onto something.</p><p>Now that Sean had taken note, he wouldn\u2019t let Thorpe undermine him again. He was here for Callie. He intended to stay for her. And no man, not even the Dungeon Master himself, was going to get in his way.</p><p>Armed with an idea to outfox the fox, he scooped up his car keys and headed out the door. In less than an hour, he\u2019d have Callie all to himself once more.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>AS Thorpe waltzed out the door, Callie fumed. He\u2019d walked away from her, after he\u2019d promised not to. He\u2019d utterly humiliated her\u2014again. All that pleasure he\u2019d poured on her, all those shiver-worthy words about never letting her get away . . . Then poof! He\u2019d gotten up and left.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t have so much of her heart, she\u2019d gleefully smack him upside the head. As it was, she didn\u2019t know how she was going to look Thorpe in the eye again without being completely mortified that she\u2019d thrown herself at him. Seeing that it hadn\u2019t been at all difficult for him to leave her naked and ready only hurt worse. She was tired of the constant pain of his rejection.</p> <p>And then there was Sean. He\u2019d said he loved her\u2014without hesitation, out loud, resounding with total conviction. But he wasn\u2019t going to rest until he knew every one of her secrets.</p><p>It was definitely time for her to leave Dominion ASAP.</p><p>The feelings blooming in her heart for her sexy Dom were too big, too much, too overwhelming. Was that how Thorpe felt? Callie sighed. Was Sean even speaking to her anymore? The thought that he might not tore everything out of her chest.</p><p>How the hell could she be foolish enough to fall for two men, especially when they couldn\u2019t stand one another?</p><p>Crap, her head hurt from all the circles her thoughts were turning.</p><p>When she\u2019d asked earlier, Lance told her that Sean had been forcibly and indefinitely removed from the premises. Callie winced. She\u2019d bet that had gone over well. And she could only imagine what he was thinking. Did he know that Thorpe had given her more than a spanking? It wasn\u2019t a stretch to imagine that her helpful boss had volunteered the information.</p><p>Somehow\u2014and soon\u2014she had to talk to Sean. If she intended to rescind his collar, she should have the moxie to do it to his face. She owed him that much before she slipped out of his life for good. No idea how to start that conversation. I\u2019m so sorry I almost boinked my boss after having sex with you. She snorted. Brilliant idea.</p><p>The comforter Thorpe had thrown over her earlier shielded her from Lance\u2014not that he cared. Nope, he stood over her, all leather and gloating smiles. He was enjoying being Thorpe\u2019s right hand. He\u2019d always said she lacked discipline. Since he was a big believer in corporal punishment, she could just imagine what he had in mind.</p> <p>Been there, done that already tonight. Her backside still throbbed. She didn\u2019t need more from a guy whose palm itched because he hadn\u2019t yet had the chance to spank his boy\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stand over me, you know,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>With a shrug of his shoulders, his leather vest skimmed his leanly muscled torso. \u201cI enjoy pissing you off.\u201d</p><p>He always had. A practical jokester and a big tease, Lance\u2019s laughter was infectious. It would be funny someday that he was poking fun at her. Just not today.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. I assume I\u2019m allowed to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Lance gestured her toward the door. \u201cFeel free. You know where the kitchen is.\u201d</p><p>Callie tugged at the cuffs holding her to the bed frame and sent him an expectant expression.</p><p>\u201cPicky, picky. I\u2019ll get the key from Thorpe.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLance, I swear I\u2019m going to throw something at you.\u201d She heaved a big sigh.</p><p>\u201cTry it. Want to guess what will happen?\u201d</p><p>Someone would paddle her good, probably Lance himself. Pass . . .</p><p>\u201cHurry. Please. I\u2019m really hungry,\u201d she lied.</p><p>He took pity on her and stopped teasing. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be right back, little vixen.\u201d</p><p>As the door closed behind Lance, she waited impatiently. Thorpe seemed determined to separate her from Sean . . . but she didn\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t as if he really wanted her. Why be so hell-bent on keeping her at Dominion if he had no intention of making her his own? Probably because he enjoyed giving her the ultimate mindfuck. All the more reason to leave.</p><p>Moments later, Lance appeared with the key and uncuffed her.</p><p>\u201cThorpe says you\u2019re free to roam the premises. No leaving and no socializing. You get something to eat, see if there\u2019s anything pressing that needs your attention, then you come back here. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Callie resisted the urge to roll her eyes. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching you on the floor.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt Lance meant that, especially when he wandered out of her room, pointing a pair of fingers to his eyes, then to her own.</p><p>\u201cI got it!\u201d She sighed impatiently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s almost insolent,\u201d he cautioned.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Long fucking day. \u201cHunger doesn\u2019t bring out the best in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you slide this time. Don\u2019t do it again . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she murmured to placate him, throwing in a bat of her lashes. He would probably miss the finer points of that gesture, but just in case.</p><p>Lance burst out laughing as he left the room. \u201cOh, Thorpe has his hands full with you.\u201d</p><p>Once she was alone, Callie reached onto the floor, fishing in her purse to find her phone. Then she hesitated. What was she going to do, just call Sean and apologize? Maybe it would be better done face to face. As she was severing their bond? Very classy . . . What if he didn\u2019t want to see her again? Or even talk to her? Soon, it wouldn\u2019t even matter. She\u2019d get another phone in a new town\u2014a different number with a blank slate of contacts. Start over once more in a place where she knew no one. Winter was coming. Phoenix might be good . . .</p><p>She was still trying to decide how to proceed when she glanced at the little device. Dead. Crap, she really needed to remember to charge it once in a blue moon.</p><p>Depressed as hell, she plugged in her phone, then tossed on her robe and marched down to Thorpe\u2019s office. She tried the handle. Locked. And he didn\u2019t answer a single one of her banging knocks or demands to be let in. True, he might not be inside, but it was also possible Thorpe was completely avoiding her. Callie\u2019s money was on the latter.</p><p>She still planned to be gone from Dominion no later than tomorrow, but the bastard had her car keys and suitcases. And a chunk of her heart. She had to retrieve at least the first two and move on.</p><p>With an agitated shake of her head, she wandered out to the dungeon floor and cleaned up after a few customers, wiping down after some others. She gathered dirty towels and put them in the laundry room, then distributed fresh bottles of water to the coolers. She stocked bins all around with fresh blankets for Doms to wrap their subs in when it was time for aftercare. A hopping Friday night . . .</p><p>Axel had glared at her from across the concrete floor, scowling around what looked like a developing black eye. She didn\u2019t have to ask how he got it. His growl about her \u201casshole Dom\u201d when he passed by said it all.</p><p>Suddenly, Lance strode toward her with a disparaging glance. \u201cYour pizza is here, vixen. Or should I say your highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d She hadn\u2019t ordered one. In fact, she hadn\u2019t thought about food at all once Lance had let her go.</p><p>Who the hell would imagine that she\u2019d want food when her entire life was in turmoil? Not Thorpe. He knew better. Had someone pulled a practical joke on her? The first person she\u2019d suspect, Lance, wore an expression of disapproval, not mirth.</p><p>\u201cYes, and the delivery guy is at the back door, insisting that he give it to you personally.\u201d</p><p>This could be a trick. What if it was some police ploy? But why a pizza delivery man when they could come in with badges flashing and guns blazing, then just arrest her? Yeah, that was a more likely scenario. Which meant the pizza had probably been sent by someone who couldn\u2019t readily talk to her.</p><p>Sean?</p><p>\u201cSure. Let me get my wallet.\u201d</p><p>Lance sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s paid for. I tried, but he said you\u2019d given him a credit card over the phone.\u201d</p><p>Probably Sean.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she agreed readily. \u201cI\u2019m so hungry that I totally forgot. Food. Let me get that.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Lance walked away.</p><p>Callie ran to the back door. Sure enough, a gangly, pimple-faced teenager stood there with a pizza box in hand. The smells of basil and oregano wafted from the cardboard as he shot her a smile.</p><p>\u201cCallie Ward?\u201d He looked her up and down with a leer.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said cautiously, self-consciously drawing the edges of her robe closer together, making damn sure everything was covered.</p><p>\u201cFor you. From a \u2018friend.\u2019\u201d He winked.</p><p>Definitely Sean.</p><p>With a stupid grin, she took the box from the boy, noting that one side was a bit heavier than the other. He turned away without another word, so she shut the back door, then headed to her room.</p><p>Locking herself inside her private domain, she lifted the lid. Inside, half a warm pizza lay, brimming with cheese, pepperoni, pineapple, and mushrooms. Her favorite. Sean had remembered. Despite the dim day, that made her smile.</p><p>The other half of the box was another story. Partitioned away from the pizza by a piece of cardboard lay a white rectangle shrink-wrapped in plastic. She stared at it, blinking a few times. A yellow sticky note on top had almost blended in with its background, but as soon as she flipped on a light, she saw that the left half said Eat Me with an arrow pointing to the pizza. The other half said Open Me.</p><p>What was this, Alice in Wonderland?</p><p>Callie lifted a piece of the pie to her mouth and took a bite, surprised to find that she was hungrier than she\u2019d imagined. She moaned as the flavor burst on her tongue. So good . . .</p><p>But curiosity was killing her.</p><p>She plucked the plastic-wrapped bundle out of the other half of the pizza box. Immediately, the size and weight told her it was a computer. Why would he send her one? She owned a laptop. It was old, but it worked.</p><p>She pulled the device from the industrial plastic protecting it. A brand-new shiny silver unit with a familiar piece of half-eaten fruit on the front. Over that was another note that read Turn Me On.</p><p>Was this his roundabout way of sending her a message, despite Thorpe throwing him out of the club?</p><p>With a careful nudge of the unit\u2019s top lid, she opened it, taking just a moment to revel in how gorgeous it was. This had to have cost him a small fortune.</p><p>Peering intently at the machine, she hit the button to power it on. Someone had already gone through the setup and registration process for her. It came up with a desktop picture of a flower. The profile name matched her own.</p><p>Another sticky note across the keyboard read Three Guesses . . .</p><p>She\u2019d never seen Sean\u2019s playful side and she liked it.</p><p>With a smile, she bit her lip and pondered. What would Sean have used as a password. She tried his name. The operating system didn\u2019t recognize that. Then another idea came to mind, and she typed it in.</p><p>L-O-V-E-L-Y.</p><p>That did it. Seconds later, she was in. A familiar Internet video chat program tried to load. Quickly, she tapped in the club\u2019s Wi-Fi password. A second later, the software began calling Sean. He answered immediately, looking wrung out and worried, his tie loose, his hair messy as if he\u2019d dragged his fingers through it a million times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCallie, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed down her nervousness. \u201cYes. Of course. I . . .\u201d Have no idea what to say.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten the pizza? I know you, and I\u2019m betting you haven\u2019t taken the time tonight to fill your belly.\u201d</p><p>Even when she\u2019d handled everything wrong and hurt his feelings, Sean still put her needs first. Tears pricked at her eyes. What was she ever going to do without him?</p> <p>\u201cNot much, but I will. It smells heavenly. I\u2019ve just been . . . worried about you. I saw Axel\u2019s black eye and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sean laughed, his grainy image grinning on the screen. \u201cHe looks far worse than me, lovely. Of that, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>His assertion surprised her. No one ever got the best of Thorpe\u2019s security director. He\u2019d been bouncing heads for years. How had one man who wasn\u2019t as big as Mount Axel managed to damage him and come out without a scratch? Luck, maybe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so relieved to hear it. I\u2019ve seen Axel really mess guys up before.\u201d She drew in a deep breath, her mind racing. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Thorpe threw you out. If anyone is at fault, it\u2019s me. You said something beautiful, and I panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must know exactly how jealous Thorpe is.\u201d</p> <p>Sean had the situation so wrong. \u201cNo, he\u2019s just concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he wants you. But I don\u2019t care about Thorpe now. He can\u2019t keep us apart for long. I\u2019ll find a way to you, lovely. I always will.\u201d He paused, looking at her intently. \u201cI wish I could touch you now and show you how much I meant those words I said earlier.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s heart stuttered. Sean actually loved her. He hadn\u2019t simply blurted it in the heat of passion. After nearly seven months, most of them as his submissive, it still stunned her. But hadn\u2019t she worried that she was falling in love with him herself just a few hours ago?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I ran,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou startled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you care for me even a bit?\u201d He frowned, that furrow between his blue eyes deep and troubled.</p><p>Even if she couldn\u2019t stay and fulfill the promise of the burgeoning love between them, she wouldn\u2019t be dishonest with Sean. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of hurting him more than she was already going to. \u201cI care about you very much. So much that it scares me sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, lovely. I won\u2019t hurt you. You can let go and fall into my arms. I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>How wonderful that sounded. Callie pressed a hand over her trembling lips. She wished she could stay and do exactly what he wanted. But that was a stupid fantasy. The reality was that she\u2019d already way overstayed her time at Dominion.</p><p>Her heart railed, and she wanted to scream at the uselessness of her feelings. What would Sean do if she stayed and the law caught up to her? Or, heaven forbid, if he ever figured out who she was?</p><p>So she had to remain strong and do what was best for both Sean and Thorpe. If they knew the danger that lurked around her every corner, they\u2019d want to help. They might even insist on protecting her. Callie refused to let them risk themselves. It was her problem, her cross to bear. Her shit to deal with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d she told him.</p><p>But after today, it had to stop. By tomorrow, she had to slip out of his life, away from Dominion, Thorpe, and Dallas\u2014everything meaningful to her. Maybe she\u2019d go to Seattle, instead. The frequent rain would match her mood.</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d He sent her a reassuring smile. \u201cTell me, what did the bastard do when he had you alone in your room.\u201d</p><p>Callie froze, sure that her face looked awfully deer-in-the-headlights. If she told him the truth, there\u2019d be trouble. \u201cN-nothing much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me, lovely. I\u2019ll paddle you but good. I heard your cries of passion wailing down the halls.\u201d</p><p>Damn it! She wished the video feature wasn\u2019t on. He could probably see the guilt crawling all over her face. How was she going to get out of this without riling Sean to the point of wanting to kill Thorpe?</p><p>\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s blue eyes narrowed. \u201cI expect an answer from you. The truth, mind you. I might be able to forgive you being confused. But if he forced you into anything, I\u2019ll take his bloody head off.\u201d</p><p>Blurting that excuse, then running away would only leave the two men behind without her as a buffer. Not a good idea when tempers were running high. \u201cHe kissed me. He . . . touched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you liked it.\u201d He ground his teeth, jaw tight. \u201cPull off your robe. Now.\u201d</p><p>She started to refuse, but she\u2019d rather take Sean\u2019s anger herself than have him unleash it on Thorpe.</p><p>She stood and let the silk skim down her arms until it puddled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cStand closer to the camera so I can look at you. And bend so I can see your breasts.\u201d</p><p>Callie stepped forward and did as he commanded, letting him look his fill.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your collar?\u201d</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to explain that even if she\u2019d been wearing it, the bit of bling wouldn\u2019t be a symbol of their relationship much longer. She\u2019d explain tomorrow. And once she\u2019d assumed a new identity, Sean would be nothing but a sweet memory. He would forget her, surely.</p><p>\u201cI was getting ready to take a shower,\u201d she lied gently.</p><p>His mouth thinned into an even firmer line. \u201cAll right, then. Show me your belly and your cunt. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body flushing, she adjusted the laptop lid until the webcam took in the lower half of her body as she stood frozen still for him.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, as always. Sit back and spread your legs.\u201d As soon as she reclined on the bed and parted her thighs, he moaned in appreciation. \u201cIs that where Thorpe touched you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cShow me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to touch myself?\u201d The thought of displaying her self-pleasure was both uncomfortable and arousing.</p><p>\u201cI do. I want to see you come and I want you to be thinking about me this time.\u201d</p><p>Between his possessive words and his narrow-eyed demand, she shivered. \u201cA-all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve spent months touching myself and thinking of you, lovely. I want to see you do the same for me. I want to be the only one on your mind as you feel pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Those words shouldn\u2019t excite her so much, but an image of Sean, eyes closed, body tense with need, his big hand roughing up and down his cock, made her ache.</p><p>Suddenly, touching herself wasn\u2019t a hardship. Tonight, she\u2019d felt more pleasure than she had in the last five years put together. No way she should be ready to orgasm again. But after Sean\u2019s gruff voice grinding out such a wicked suggestion, need bubbled right under her clit.</p><p>\u201cNow, Callie,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>She eased back on her elbows and bent her knees, craning her neck to make sure that Sean still had a view of her pussy in the camera.</p><p>\u201cI see you, lovely. Go on.\u201d</p><p>His hard voice had deepened, his Scottish accent thickening. She swallowed against lust, then slid her fingers down her belly, right between her legs.</p><p>Sean\u2019s demand didn\u2019t exactly have the effect he desired. The second her fingers caressed her hard, burning clit, Thorpe slipped into her thoughts. The memory of his mouth on her, eating her voraciously, then sliding up her body to demand that she come for him wouldn\u2019t be banished. But in her head, Sean watched, making the demand as Thorpe slid his fingers and tongue all over her. Her skin sizzled. Her desire flared. In a perfect world, she could admit to wanting them both\u2014and wishing desperately that they desired her.</p><p>The fantasy was totally unrealistic, but she couldn\u2019t stop it from barreling past her good sense to make her spin out of control.</p><p>With her free hand, she tweaked her nipples, imagining that Sean\u2019s fingers plucked the sensitive buds, his hot breath falling in her ear as he told her that she looked seductive while Thorpe ate her into a frenzy and swallowed her down. Then they would both fuck her, Sean filling her sensitive pussy and Thorpe driving into her ass, until . . .</p><p>Callie cried out as the peak crashed into her. She jolted, her back arching, her fingers rubbing frantic circles on the pulsing bud between her legs.</p><p>\u201cLovely . . .\u201d Sean\u2019s voice sounded gruff before he groaned long and loud in pleasure.</p><p>The sound brought her back to herself. Callie blinked and sat up, then reached for her robe, drawing it over her breasts as she panted. She felt like a terrible human being. Sean loved her. She loved him\u2014but she couldn\u2019t manage to banish Thorpe from her heart.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that you could move, much less cover yourself. I\u2019m not done with you yet.\u201d He looked more relaxed, but she wouldn\u2019t call him happy.</p><p>Still struggling to catch her breath, she bared herself again. Sean had seen it all. What was there to peep at now?</p><p>\u201cGet back in position and don\u2019t move until I tell you,\u201d he commanded gruffly.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Callie gave herself over to Sean. It would be the last time she\u2019d ever experience submission, most likely. Even if she sometimes fought it, she craved it. She intended to savor these precious moments.</p><p>Rocking back on her elbows, she spread her legs again for him.</p><p>\u201cScoot closer.\u201d</p><p>The entire camera had to be one big close-up of her cooch. But she didn\u2019t argue, just complied. Then she waited.</p><p>\u201cLike that, yes.\u201d</p><p>Sean remained silent for a long minute, and she could all but feel his eyes on her. In her fantasy, he climbed his way up her body with nips and kisses, then impaled her with that thick cock of his, making her breath rush and her back arch. She pictured Thorpe hovering over her, too, watching, tipping her head over the edge of the bed to feed his erection between her lips and deep in her mouth, muttering in the filthiest, most intimate whisper how much he was looking forward to impaling her backside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any bruises on you.\u201d Sean\u2019s voice pulled her from her sensual daydream.</p><p>Callie eased up a fraction and looked at Sean from between her legs. \u201cThere are none, Sir. Thorpe didn\u2019t force me.\u201d</p><p>A fact that made her feel even more guilty, but she didn\u2019t try to hide from the truth.</p><p>\u201cSit up and look at me.\u201d He stayed silent until she did as he\u2019d bid. \u201cLeave the robe off. I like you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a reassuring nod, telling her that she\u2019d pleased him. \u201cCallie, he may not have forced you, but you were upset, and he took advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cSean, I have to be honest. I have feelings for him, too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one-sided.\u201d</p><p>Damn, why couldn\u2019t she just keep her mouth shut? Or break up with him and be done?</p><p>Sean\u2019s face closed up. \u201cHe had four years to give you what you needed. And he did nothing. He\u2019s not the man for you. I am. Don\u2019t let your gratitude lead your heart in the wrong direction.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like that at all. Yes, she was grateful to Thorpe for many things, but she would have fallen for him regardless. Some invisible string tethered her to him, tugging her in his direction . . . even as another string seemed to bind and yank her toward Sean, too.</p><p>It was best that she was leaving. She could never choose between them. And if she tried, she would inevitably lose the other for good.</p><p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d she answered obliquely. After tomorrow, it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to do my best to reason with Thorpe so I can see you. We have a lot to talk about, lovely.\u201d</p><p>He was dead wrong. It was all but over, even if that fact was breaking her heart in a million pieces. If she told him that now, it would only start an argument that neither of them would win. Next time she saw him would simply be good-bye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do on my end, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he praised. \u201cNow charge your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already am.\u201d She smiled. Sometimes he knew her too well.</p><p>Sean sent her an approving nod, his blue eyes caressing her face through the screen. \u201cEat your pizza and get some sleep. I plan to come for you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>And by then, she\u2019d be ready to release him and go. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>THORPE was slumped over his desk at quarter \u2019til three when his phone rang. The club members were gone. Axel had swept the place clean. No sign of Kirkpatrick, but Thorpe knew better than to assume he\u2019d seen the last of the asshole. Callie had helped with cleaning and closing, then taken herself off to bed. She was too quiet and hadn\u2019t met his gaze when he\u2019d given her back the contents of her suitcases, sans bags.</p><p>He planned to keep a very close watch on her. Lack of luggage alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep her here if she was determined to go.</p><p>At the first shrill chime, Thorpe started, then all but pounced on the phone. He looked at the display, smiling at the familiar number.</p><p>\u201cTara?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fast.\u201d The smart girl had always impressed him, but even more so tonight. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. I\u2019ve got some information for you. It\u2019s only preliminary, but . . . I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s gut tightened. He\u2019d wanted to be wrong. Son of a bitch. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to. Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSean Kirkpatrick\u2019s story survives a cursory glance, like you said. But once I started digging, it seems that he doesn\u2019t appear anywhere, at least under that name, until eight months ago. I also can\u2019t find a record of anyone with that name and face becoming a U.S. citizen in the last decade. The first appearance of him I have is the supposed creation of an LLC in the state of Florida earlier this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Callie that he lives there now. He claims to belong to a club outside of Miami. His references checked out, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he paid someone for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Thorpe agreed.</p><p>\u201cAlmost immediately after he started the company, a major Fortune 100 corporation supposedly hired his services. Do you know how tough a gig that is to get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExceedingly. You usually have to know someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr be sucking their di\u2014 um, be intimate with them.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe managed a smile at her slipup, despite the grim situation.</p><p>Tara smoothed over the moment by continuing on. \u201cHe rented a corporate apartment in Dallas under the name of his LLC back in April.\u201d She rattled off the address, and he jotted it down. A newer part of town with lots of corporate presence and no nightlife. \u201cHe signed a six-month lease. When October rolled around, he started extending it month by month. Other than that, Sean Kirkpatrick has one relatively new credit card, no bank account, no immigration visa, no mortgage, no car loan, no record of marriages or divorces, no court dates, no arrest record, no school records . . . nothing. He\u2019s a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back in his chair, Thorpe sucked in a breath. \u201cThe way he set up his identity, do you think he\u2019s a con artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Callie have that he\u2019d want to steal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d On the surface. But over the last decade, the bounty on Callie\u2019s head had grown to two million dollars. What if Sean Kirkpatrick had somehow pieced together her identity and managed to trail her here?</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s blood ran cold. He swore that he\u2019d take care of Kirkpatrick once and for all.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you were going to say that.\u201d Tara sighed. \u201cSeven months seems awfully patient for a stalker, but at this point, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d rule that out. I honestly don\u2019t know what else to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some ideas. If you come across anything else, let me know, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Something is definitely off with this man.\u201d</p><p>As Thorpe had suspected for some time. \u201cI appreciate everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. You know Callie isn\u2019t ever going to be my best friend . . . but I\u2019m worried for her.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the phone tightly. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p> <p>They rang off, and Thorpe didn\u2019t waste a minute. He left his office and crept down the hall to Callie\u2019s room, letting himself in with the key. He spied her sleeping in the moonlight, all curled up in a sea of downy quilts and soft pillows. One naked leg peeked out, from her supple hip to her little pink toes. No way he could forget having his face between her sleek thighs, but somehow he had to.</p><p>Thorpe turned and found a partially eaten pizza sitting in a box on her dresser. When the hell had she ordered that? No idea, but nothing else looked out of place. Her phone sat charging on the nightstand, and he swiped it, then dashed back into his office.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to figure out that her password was his birthday. And didn\u2019t that just add a kicker of guilt to this torment cocktail? He browsed her recent calls and found one she\u2019d missed from Sean earlier tonight. Gotcha!</p><p>He touched the screen, and the image changed to Sean\u2019s annoying mug as the call connected.</p><p>\u201cCallie?\u201d the man didn\u2019t sound groggy or disoriented in the least.</p><p>\u201cNot quite. Guess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want, Thorpe? I\u2019ve had it up to my eyeballs with your antics. You can\u2019t separate me from Callie. You\u2019ve no right, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he had every right, and he intended to exercise each of them to the fullest extent. He might not be her father, her husband, or her Dom, but he was her protector. And probably the only person in her life she could trust without question.</p><p>But Sean\u2019s grating lecture gave him an idea. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some thinking. I know that I\u2019ve overstepped my bounds as the owner of the club. So I\u2019m going to allow you to see her tomorrow. Here at Dominion. Nine p.m. You\u2019re not going to get another offer. I suggest you take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. And don\u2019t you be trying any trickery. You won\u2019t like what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d Thorpe all but licked his lips, hoping the Scot would give him something he could sink his teeth into.</p><p>\u201cNo. But if you\u2019re less than straight and narrow, I don\u2019t think Callie will be too happy with you. And you can\u2019t stand the thought that she might not look to you for all her needs, can you?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe squeezed the phone tightly. Fucker. \u201cBe here at nine.\u201d</p><p>Without allowing Sean to respond, he ended the call. That Scot got under his skin, and he had to resist the urge to throw Callie\u2019s phone across the room. Instead, he forced out a deep breath, then stood, walking with deliberate steps back to her room and put the phone where he\u2019d found it.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t look at the girl, but she\u2019d rolled over in her sleep and now lay on her back, her ridiculously long lashes caressing her cheeks, her head angled slightly to expose the graceful line of her throat. Pale shoulders moved softly with each breath. The quilt barely covered her breasts, and the hint of cleavage was enough to make him sweat.</p><p>Damn it, he had to get out of here. He had to stop obsessing. Keep her safe. Give her a place to live her life in peace. That was the most he could ever offer her.</p><p>The moment he closed her door behind him again and locked it once more, he charged down the hall to see if Axel had left yet. A quick turn of the knob to the security room, and Thorpe slid inside. Axel wore a baseball cap. The man was a large, blunt instrument of violence when he chose. Currently, his eyes were glued to a security feed. His fists were clenched.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie got a pizza tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the box in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe frowned. \u201cAnd Callie doesn\u2019t have any credit cards to have paid for it in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kirkpatrick.\u201d Thorpe cursed. God, would this fucker just not go away?</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t imagine who else it would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a plan. How do you feel about searching his apartment at, say, nine tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything. Everything. He\u2019s up to no good where Callie is concerned. I want to know what.\u201d</p><p>Axel\u2019s massive shoulders slumped. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to let me trash his pad, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but depending on what you find, you and I together may be trashing his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re talking.\u201d Axel smiled wide.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes, then?\u201d</p><p>Axel\u2019s expression brightened again. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe felt the same. One way or another, by tomorrow night, he\u2019d have figured out exactly who Sean Kirkpatrick was and how to permanently erase him from Callie\u2019s life. He didn\u2019t care much how he had to do it.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>THORPE did his best to act like he didn\u2019t want to murder Sean Kirkpatrick\u2014or whatever his name truly was\u2014when the imposter walked into Dominion. The man shoved something in the pocket of his trousers and adjusted his stark white dress shirt. Decent suit and loafers, but not designer. His watch wasn\u2019t Gucci . . . but it wasn\u2019t Timex, either. Which reinforced Thorpe\u2019s opinion that this man wasn\u2019t after Callie\u2019s money because he knew she didn\u2019t have any.</p><p>He hoped like hell the address Tara had dug up was real and that Axel worked quickly. Thorpe needed to eliminate the man, then find the strength to take a step back from Callie so her life could resume its status quo.</p><p>Sean caught sight of him in the foyer, standing beside Sweet Pea\u2019s empty desk. He\u2019d sent his little receptionist on a meaningless errand because didn\u2019t want her anywhere near potential danger.</p><p>The Scot glared. \u201cWhere is Callie? You said she\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her room, waiting for you. But you and I are going to get a few rules straight first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore bloody rules? I\u2019m done playing by yours, Thorpe. You\u2019re determined to believe the worst of my intentions because you\u2019ve got your dick in a twist with jealousy, and she shed a few tears last night. If you truly care about the girl, you\u2019ll back away and let me make her happy. She looks up to you. For her sake, you and I need to stop this arguing.\u201d</p><p>The whole speech set Thorpe\u2019s teeth on edge, but the name of tonight\u2019s game was to lie low, not do anything to rouse the bastard\u2019s suspicion. So he just smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not fight with you, either. It distresses Callie, but I won\u2019t be less than honest. I don\u2019t like you. However, if you fulfill her and have her best interest at heart, I\u2019m willing to try accepting you. Therefore, I\u2019m allowing you to have time alone with her in her room. I won\u2019t interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind closed doors?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe dug his fingers into his thighs so he didn\u2019t throttle Sean and nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret my show of trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I came tonight intending to suggest a truce in Callie\u2019s honor, so I\u2019m glad you agree. She\u2019s a stunning, bighearted lass. If you\u2019ll let her make her own choices and keep your distance, I\u2019ll give her all she needs. You\u2019ve got my word on that.\u201d Sean held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to seeing her smile again.\u201d Thorpe was loath to shake Sean\u2019s hand, but he had no choice.</p><p>If not for the information Tara had dug up on Kirkpatrick, Thorpe was sorely aware that he might really have been willing to take the lying asswipe at face value and try to behave civilly\u2014at least when Callie was around.</p><p>But now, that option was off the table.</p><p>An awkward silence fell between them. Thorpe ignored it, turning his back on the man and drawing him down the private hall. With a series of card keys and pass codes, he finally reached the residential section of the club and headed to the end of the hall.</p><p>He gestured to Callie\u2019s door. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>And Sean was in for a treat. Callie wore a bloodred dress that showed a healthy hint of cleavage, accentuated her small waist and petite stature, while revealing a lot of thigh. Matching lipstick and dark curls offset her fair face. When he\u2019d seen her ten minutes ago, all Thorpe had wanted to do was strap her to his bed until she screamed out in pleasure for him\u2014until he\u2019d realized she was wearing that asshole\u2019s collar again. When he\u2019d questioned her about it, she\u2019d been vague. Had she changed her mind about leaving?</p><p>Kirkpatrick knocked on her door. \u201cLovely?\u201d</p><p>The second Callie pulled it open, Thorpe\u2019s stare tangled in hers. He saw something in her eyes that set him on edge. Sadness? Before Thorpe could decipher her expression, she peeked over at the other man.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sean,\u201d Callie murmured, lowering her gaze in a sweetly submissive gesture that made his cock stand tall. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d The Scot stepped inside and closed the door behind them.</p><p>Thorpe heard it lock. He wanted to rip the fucker\u2019s guts out.</p><p>Instead, he leaned against the wall in the hallway and dragged in a breath, trying to calm his rage. Hopefully, in two hours or less, this shit would be over and this imposter would be gone for good. Then he could figure out what was troubling the girl and fix it.</p><p>The only reason he\u2019d let Sean in Callie\u2019s room was the knowledge that he could unlock her door himself in seconds. If needed, Axel\u2019s musclemen could bust it down in two minutes flat. Her windows had bars on the outside to keep creeps out . . . or in. Zeb and Lance were stationed at either end of the hall, listening and watching, just in case. The whole plan was a giant calculated risk. Yes, he was assuming that Sean wouldn\u2019t hurt Callie, since the prick had already had months if that\u2019s what he wanted. Why would he do it now, when he was cornered with no escape route? Nor could he sneak her out with him past all these watchful eyes. She\u2019d be safe; he had to believe that.</p><p>Before Thorpe gave in to the urge to punch the wall, he whirled on his heel and marched down the hall, texting Axel. Work fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Thorpe passed Lance, he pocketed his phone and frowned. \u201cWatch over the girl for me.\u201d</p><p>Lance shot him a shrewd glance. \u201cI\u2019ll watch over your girl. Admit that\u2019s what she is.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed at his forehead where a bitch of a headache was forming. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on keeping her safe tonight and getting rid of the Scottish stallion. If we manage that, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>When hell froze over.</p> <p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t make Callie yours, why not let her be happy with someone who adores her?\u201d Lance challenged. \u201cYou might not like Sean Kirkpatrick, but he\u2019s in love with that little vixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Thorpe chafed, but the less he told the others about Callie and her secrets, the better.</p><p>\u201cThat you won\u2019t claim her, but don\u2019t want anyone else to have her? Sure, I do. It\u2019s a damn shame that you prefer her being alone and unhappy to pairing up.\u201d</p><p>Why did the other Dom have to bring up the point that pinpricked Thorpe with the most guilt?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her unhappy.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t hate the idea of Callie being alone if he couldn\u2019t have her. And yes, he knew that was selfish as hell. \u201cBut she deserves the best.\u201d</p> <p>Lance shrugged. \u201cNot arguing that. Just not sure he\u2019s any worse than you encouraging her adoration when you have no intention of claiming her.\u201d Thorpe opened his mouth to rebut, but the other man wagged a finger in his face. \u201cMelissa, the ex-bitch, walked out on you, and it\u2019s not an exercise you want to repeat. Got it. But use your fucking brain. If Callie stayed even after all the times you rebuffed her, I doubt she\u2019s going to run out on you.\u201d</p><p>Lance couldn\u2019t be more wrong, but Thorpe didn\u2019t dare say more. \u201cYou might be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer heart is yours,\u201d Lance insisted, scoffing.</p><p>\u201cNot exclusively.\u201d</p><p>And that bitter pill made Thorpe choke.</p><p>He\u2019d had enough of this conversation. Forcing himself away, he tore into his office and tried to bury himself in paperwork. Nothing held his attention. Half-answered e-mails and discarded forms couldn\u2019t make him forget that, right now, Callie would be pressed up against a man she didn\u2019t really know. Sean might be ordering her to strip. She might be baring her body and soul for a stranger with sinister motives.</p> <p>Damn it! Logically, having Callie occupy the asshole to flush him out made sense. But Thorpe hated this plan. It was wearing his nerves awfully fucking thin, as was Lance\u2019s confrontation.</p><p>He stared at the clock, watching every drag of its hands. Thirty minutes took three days. Finally, his cell phone chimed. Yanking the device from his pocket, he saw Axel\u2019s number on the display and stabbed the button to answer. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in. It\u2019s his place, all right. I had to turn the place upside down to find anything, but . . . \u201d Axel paused. \u201cYou better be sitting. I\u2019ve got bad news, boss. Really fucking bad.\u201d</p><p>CALLIE trembled as Sean approached. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough Thorpe all but summoned me, I wasn\u2019t going to say no, lovely. Any opportunity to see you is one I\u2019ll take.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the corners of her lips and hoped it looked like a smile. Knowing these were the last moments she\u2019d have with Sean, that she\u2019d already laid eyes on Thorpe for the final time, that tomorrow she\u2019d be in another city and never see Dallas or the people who\u2019d become her family again . . . Callie sniffled. She couldn\u2019t afford these tears and her maudlin whinefest had to stop.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Sean asked, curling a solicitous hand around her elbow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just allergies.\u201d She forced herself to smile brighter, but it didn\u2019t seem to be working. The concern in Sean\u2019s frown deepened.</p> <p>If he looked at her too hard, he would see that something troubled her. She didn\u2019t want her last memories of him to be of anger or rebuke as he futilely tried to pry the reasons for her mood from her. She had a plan; she needed to stick to it. Everything was ready, including the spare key to her car since Thorpe had never given back the ones he\u2019d swiped from her purse. The emergency pack she\u2019d left Chicago with all those years ago, along with a few other things to aid her disguise, was stowed in the trunk of her car. The money she\u2019d scraped together over the years was inside as well. She\u2019d take nothing else with her, not even her phone, filled with pictures of everything and everyone she loved. As much as she wanted to, there was no way she could risk carrying around the memories.</p><p>Shortly after Thorpe had the burglar bars installed over the club\u2019s windows, she\u2019d loosened them just enough to wiggle through . . . in case she ever needed to leave. Earlier today, she\u2019d tested them. She could twist through, but just barely. So even if she could take her memories with her, they would simply have to stay behind.</p><p>Besides, a clean break was always better. She\u2019d been through this enough to know.</p><p>Callie turned to the glasses of wine she\u2019d procured earlier from Dominion\u2019s bar and handed him the one she\u2019d doctored in advance with two Ambien. They wouldn\u2019t hurt him, but they should knock him out and give her time to slip away. She should be at least an hour or more down the road before Thorpe discovered she was gone.</p><p>Ditching her little sedan and buying another would be her first priority. It sucked that tomorrow was Sunday. Most car dealerships in Texas were closed. She\u2019d have to find a used lot somewhere and hope for the best. But that was later. She wanted to enjoy her last minutes with Sean. The yawning chasm of all her empty tomorrows stretched out in front of her, and she\u2019d have to face it soon enough.</p><p>Handing his glass of wine to him, she grabbed her own.</p><p>He raised his. \u201cA toast, lovely. To new beginnings.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to cry at that irony. \u201cTo new beginnings.\u201d</p><p>Hers would simply be far, far away.</p><p>Sean caressed her with more than kindness. Devotion and hunger lay in his smile, and she let herself bask in his gaze for a few precious seconds. If she\u2019d been a normal girl with a normal past, she would give her heart to this man and be so grateful to have him in her life. As it was, she\u2019d probably die alone in some big city she wasn\u2019t familiar with. Whoever found her body would never know that she was Callindra Howe. They\u2019d never really know the woman underneath whatever fake name she\u2019d assumed. She\u2019d be given a pauper\u2019s burial. No one would come to her funeral because no one would care.</p><p>Gawd, she\u2019d gotten good at depressing herself. None of that mattered. Pick up. Move on. Don\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cBottoms up.\u201d She clinked their glasses together and took a sip, watching as Sean swallowed some of the red wine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mite dry, just how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Great news. Hers was super sweet, but the drugs had a bitter aftertaste, and she\u2019d known that crushing two pills into the liquid would alter the vino\u2019s flavor.</p><p>\u201cI want to toast new beginnings because on my way in, Thorpe and I reached a bit of a truce,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>If they weren\u2019t at one another\u2019s throats once she\u2019d fled, then maybe no one would be going to prison for murder. Thorpe would discover her gone, and it should be obvious that Sean had not helped her escape. He might be angry that Sean had been unable to stop her, but no way Thorpe could blame him. They might each look for her for a time. Separately, of course. They didn\u2019t like one another well enough to do that together. But eventually, they\u2019d give up. Their lives would move on. Hers would be forever marked by a few distinct events: her mother\u2019s death shortly after she\u2019d turned six, her family\u2019s murder ten years later, and the day she\u2019d left the two wonderful men she loved.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start, anyway.\u201d Sean shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I like the fact that you work for him and live under his roof. I know you have feelings for him, just like I know he wants you between his sheets.\u201d He looked at her so intently. \u201cI love you, Callie. You say you have feelings for me, too. But for us to work, you\u2019ve got to choose.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d chosen. Now she just had to muster up the will to go through with her plan. And never lose her resolve about not looking back.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve been giving this a lot of thought.\u201d Callie downed her wine for some liquid courage, hoping it would encourage Sean to do the same.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked, then took another healthy swig of wine before setting his stem on the dresser and focusing on her.</p><p>No! He needed to drink more\u2014all of it. But when he grabbed her shoulders and tugged her closer, she knew that wine was the last thing on his mind. Now, she could only pray that he\u2019d imbibed enough of the drug.</p><p>Callie set her own glass beside his, then looked up into his strong, familiar face, doing her best to remember every detail. Soon, she\u2019d have nothing left of him or Thorpe but memories.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>That was the last truth she could ever give him. Now she had to release him.</p><p>Falling apart inside, she threw herself against Sean\u2019s broad chest, feeling the stalwart beat of his heart, and pressed her lips to his.</p><p>Sean ate at her mouth for a moment, his tongue ravenous, his lips possessive. Then he pulled back, panting and staring, seeming to pierce her soul. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve waited half my life to hear you say that. Come away with me.\u201d</p><p>His soft demand shocked the hell out of her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. We\u2019ve never even seen one another outside this club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a new place, room enough for two.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cI-I work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need this job, lovely. I\u2019ll support you.\u201d</p><p>Dumbfounded, she stared mutely. He cared for her that much? It broke her heart to shake her head.</p><p>\u201cCallie, hear me out. We can\u2019t truly grow together if Thorpe is always in our way. We need time alone, just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d The offer was tempting, in a way. Maybe she could start over with Sean. Maybe he would agree to move somewhere else and . . . Harbor a woman wanted for murder? Hide her when his whole life would come crashing down for it? He already asked too many questions. Sean wasn\u2019t dumb; it wouldn\u2019t take him much longer to figure her out. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Just like she couldn\u2019t stand to break his heart now. If his feelings were genuine, he would hurt enough once he woke to find her gone.</p><p>Frustration flashed across his face. He clenched his fists. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? As long as he\u2019s dictating the terms, we can\u2019t really be together. We can\u2019t grow.\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t running for her life or also in love with the man Sean was trying to wrest her from, she might agree. She didn\u2019t have that luxury now. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it. I just need time. This is really sudden.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ve been pondering it for weeks now and I\u2019m ready to have you all to myself, but . . . I\u2019ll try to be patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She batted her lashes at him. That was false, but she caressed her way up his shoulder and wrapped her fingers around his nape. Under her hands, he felt so very real.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, you know,\u201d he declared, his tone strong and gruff and insistent. \u201cI won\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t, but his declaration made her heart flutter.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019ve got to have you, lovely. Mark you as mine somehow. Strip for me.\u201d</p><p>Callie tried not to lose her cool. If she gave more of herself to Sean now, the hurt would only be deeper later. Already, she felt so damn close to crumbling that she could barely hold herself together. But she couldn\u2019t deny that she wanted to touch him one last time.</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t give him the truth, then she could give him a part of herself. Besides, she had to distract him\u2014fast.</p><p>Pulling off her dress, she laid it across the bed. Her champagne lace lingerie followed, and the low moan that came from Sean\u2019s throat echoed with appreciation. She kicked her shoes off next and rolled down her stockings, teasing him with every movement. Callie stared at him over her shoulder, gently wiggling her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a right heady siren.\u201d He palmed her hip. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m near you, I forget everything I should be doing. I can only think about making you mine.\u201d</p><p>Callie knew exactly what he meant because he often derailed her better intentions.</p><p>Sending a shaky smile his way, she forced herself to stay on track. So she pressed one last kiss to his lips, then sank gracefully to her knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, looking down at her, his eyes heating.</p><p>Her stare rocketed up his thighs and lingered at the healthy bulge behind his zipper. She bit her lip, then forced herself to stare straight into his eyes. \u201cLet me serve you.\u201d</p><p>Sean sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cCallie . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to refuse or command her to change course. She unbuttoned his trousers, then lowered his zipper with a hiss that throbbed in the silence. Without a word, he shed his jacket and shirt, casting them onto the floor, never taking his stare from her.</p><p>After she eased the charcoal trousers off his hips, they fell down his thighs. He kicked his shoes away and stepped out of the pants.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be letting you control this,\u201d he said thickly. But that wasn\u2019t stopping him. \u201cI might paddle you for it later.\u201d</p><p>Usually, she\u2019d have a saucy answer for him. Today, she just couldn\u2019t scrape one together, not when she was so close to falling apart.</p> <p>Instead, she peered up at him with her heart in her eyes. \u201cI need to please you right now.\u201d</p><p>The hint of disapproval left his face, and he caressed the crown of her head. \u201cI find I\u2019m not very good at saying no to you, lovely.\u201d</p><p>The answering smile she sent him perched softly on her lips. \u201cI\u2019m more grateful than you know.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say anything more, Callie lowered his dark boxer-briefs down his legs, revealing the thick, long stalk of his cock. At the recollection of it between her lips, inside her hungry sex, her womb clenched. One final time . . . At least it was a small comfort to know that his last memories of her would be of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSuck me, then,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she murmured and leaned forward to take him between her lips.</p><p>With a long swipe of her tongue, she laved him up the long shaft, over the bulbous head that looked somewhere between blue and purple, then swirled all around until he slid desperate fingers into her hair and moaned low.</p><p>Callie closed her eyes and sank into the moment, taking him even deeper inside. She sucked hard, putting all her love and determination into every pass of her lips and curl of her tongue over his hard flesh.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He rocked a bit on his feet. \u201cFeels so good. You\u2019re making me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must be doing something right.\u201d And so must the Ambien.</p><p>She redoubled her effort, whimpering at the taste of him so hot and potent, growing harder and thicker. Longer. He gripped her hair tight, pulling. The slight sting of pain roused her, as did the musky scent of his skin, pooling with masculine tang in the dips and crooks between his legs. Cupping his heavy testicles, feeling them draw up bit by bit in her palm, she gave herself totally to his pleasure and let his trembling fingers guide her up and down his length until his breath sawed out of his chest. His pants became grunts, each growing louder until he moaned aloud.</p> <p>\u201cCallie . . .\u201d</p><p>Whimpering at his urgency, desperate to feel him explode on her tongue and taste the flavor of his satisfaction, she sucked harder, bathing him with her tongue one last time. Her heart stuttered as his cock pulsed. He grabbed her hair, then gave a hoarse shout of fulfillment.</p><p>His hot seed erupted on her tongue, salty and thick. Callie drank him down, digging her nails in his hair-dusted thighs and clinging with every bit of her need.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t this moment go on forever? Why couldn\u2019t she curl up with him on the bed, watching him sleep in sated contentment, and think about what they\u2019d do tomorrow?</p><p>Because she could never be Callindra Howe again. She couldn\u2019t even be a woman with a real life.</p><p>Slowly, she worked her lips up Sean\u2019s length, looking through her lashes at his flushed face. His chest heaved. His eyes slid closed. Gratification spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely . . .\u201d His voice sounded low and faint. He stumbled on his feet.</p><p>Callie jumped to steady him, then eased him onto the bed. He tumbled back, head on her pillow, his breath evening out.</p> <p>Her time with him was almost over.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed out.</p><p>She leaned over him, drinking in his strong, relaxed features, firm lips, hard jaw. She cupped his face. Such a beautiful man . . .</p><p>And he\u2019d never really know how much she loved him in return. Since he was moments from sleep, Sean wouldn\u2019t remember anything she said now.</p><p>He\u2019d be hurt by her abrupt departure. Callie caressed his face, tears forming and falling. She should be leaving right now, throwing on her dark clothes and shimmying outside, but the thought of tearing herself away voluntarily from this bed\u2014from him\u2014was ripping her chest wide open and splintering her heart.</p><p>\u201cSo tired . . .\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Callie wished she could leave behind a piece of herself for him. Maybe then, she could find the will to move on, knowing she\u2019d done what she could to ease his hurt.</p><p>An idea flashed across her brain, and she leapt up, digging frantically in Sean\u2019s pants until she found his phone. Then she shook him awake.</p><p>\u201cWha . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Callie thrust his phone into his hands. \u201cUnlock this for me. I need to make a call. My cell is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you. Charge it.\u201d He fought to peer at the screen and tap out the code.</p><p>On the third try, he finally managed. The phone clicked. His arm dropped to his side as deep slumber overtook him.</p><p>And that was it. Her last waking words to him were a fib. Leaving him a recording on his phone was the only way she could think to leave him the truth in her heart.</p><p>As she flipped through his apps, looking for a place to leave him a video message, she frowned when she stumbled over a picture of herself. But not a current one. It was the yearbook photo she\u2019d taken her sophomore year, just before her family\u2019s murder had forced her to flee Chicago and all she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Sean knew her identity. The thought beat through her brain. He knew. Her fingers went numb. She dropped the phone.</p><p>Every word he\u2019d ever uttered to her was a lie.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>Sucking in a terrified breath, Callie leapt away from him and fell to the floor. She fumbled through his pants. Was he a cop? An assassin? A private investigator? His trousers revealed nothing\u2014no driver\u2019s license, no wallet, no badge. She crawled over the carpet until she reached his coat. After patting it twice, she encountered a hard, cold lump. Folding back the fabric, she found the inside pocket and peeked down. A gun.</p><p>Callie bit back a shriek. Her heart beat a fast, staccato rhythm. Terror laced her veins with icy fire.</p><p>He knew who she was and he carried a gun. His plea for her to come away with him? He\u2019d probably meant to kill her once he\u2019d lured her away from Thorpe and Dominion. Whoever had shot her father and sister had come after her more than once to finish the job, but they\u2019d never gotten close to her. This time, they\u2019d found her weakness\u2014her fucking foolish heart.</p><p>Sean Kirkpatrick, the beautiful Scot she\u2019d stupidly fallen for, was trying to kill her. She bit back tears of betrayal and ran.</p><p>THORPE ended the call with Axel, stunned and blinking. A chill worked through his body.</p><p>Callie . . .</p><p>She was locked in her room with that son of a bitch.</p><p>Tearing down the hall, he rounded the corner, calling security as he ran and grabbing Lance, who still stood sentry in the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the other Dom asked.</p><p>As soon as Axel\u2019s muscle picked up the phone in the booth, Thorpe growled, \u201cCallie\u2019s room. Now. She\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><p>On the off chance this turned out to be a misunderstanding or a mistake, he\u2019d worry about the repercussions of bursting in on them later.</p><p>Lance cursed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe had a terrible feeling. God, why hadn\u2019t he seen this coming? \u201cSean Kirkpatrick is a lying motherfucker. Nothing he\u2019s told us about himself is true. And he\u2019s here to take Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d Lance ran faster.</p><p>They reached her door at the same time as the security guards. Panic making his heart drum loudly in his ears, Thorpe pounded on the door. \u201cCallie?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>No, no, no . . . He couldn\u2019t handle it. Please let her be asleep or in the shower or even busy with Kirkpatrick\u2019s dick in her mouth. He couldn\u2019t deal with her being gone.</p><p>Fucking fabulous time to admit how much he loved her.</p><p>Thorpe extracted her key from his pocket. His hands shook as he slammed it in, then turned the lock. Frantically, he twisted the knob. He couldn\u2019t move fast enough, get to her quickly enough.</p><p>The moment he did, he took in the disheveled bed, a naked Kirkpatrick sprawled across it. Callie\u2019s lingerie littered the floor. Her dress had been flung nearby. Her purse and phone sat on the dresser. But the window hung open . . . and the woman he loved was nowhere in sight.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>TWO hours later, Thorpe had no doubt whatsoever that Callie was long gone. In addition to her car, she\u2019d taken her laughter, her expressive blue eyes . . . and the other half of his heart with her.</p><p>Plowing his hands through his hair, he thought acidly that if he\u2019d been going gray before, worrying about Callie would accelerate that process. Now, Kirkpatrick was his only hope for answers. So far, he\u2019d been unable to shake the bastard awake. In the interim, Thorpe had rifled through every inch of her closet and each one of her drawers. He hadn\u2019t come up with much.</p><p>The bottle of Ambien he\u2019d gotten the doctor to prescribe her this summer had never been touched. He\u2019d railed at her to take them and put a stop to her insomnia. The stubborn girl had refused. Suddenly, two of the tablets were gone. Between the wine on her dresser and Kirkpatrick still sacked out in her bed, Thorpe didn\u2019t have to guess what had happened to them. Goddamn it.</p><p>Axel returned, and by the grim look on his face, his search of Callie\u2019s few favorite haunts had turned up empty. He couldn\u2019t call her cell phone or track it. She\u2019d left it here. Ironically enough, with a full charge. She\u2019d shed her siren red dress. It still smelled like her. In her wake, she\u2019d abandoned every other stitch of clothing she owned, except the ones on her back. Also left behind were the cards and gifts she\u2019d painstakingly packed away for the last four years, as if each one was a treasured memento. And she\u2019d removed Sean\u2019s collar, placing it in the center of the nightstand beside him, where he would certainly see it once he woke.</p><p>Thorpe knew exactly who was responsible for Callie\u2019s abrupt departure. She\u2019d been . . . well, maybe not perfectly happy, but content for the last four years. Kirkpatrick had entered the scene, turned her fairly ordered world upside down, and ultimately frightened her away. Then like a wild wind, she\u2019d swept out the door. Only Callie and God knew where the hell she was.</p><p>Would she think she was all alone now that he wasn\u2019t beside her to hold her hand?</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d he asked Axel.</p><p>\u201cNada. I\u2019ve looked everywhere. The guys have swept every inch of this place. The little minx crawled out the window\u2014somehow\u2014then she managed to avoid every one of the security cameras in the parking lot on her way to her car. The only images captured indicate that she wore black and drove out of the parking lot nearly three hours ago.\u201d</p><p>How the fuck had his careful planning gone down the drain? What, exactly, had Kirkpatrick done to spook her and make Callie flee so suddenly? Thorpe intended to get answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll try like hell.\u201d Axel crossed his beefy arms over his massive chest. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where to go with the search from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to come up with some ideas. In the meantime, can you get me fake passports? When I find Callie, I\u2019m going to move her out of the country. And I\u2019m going to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Axel whistled. \u201cThe documents alone will cost you a small fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Can you arrange it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you have a business to run. How the hell are you going to do that from . . . El Salvador or wherever you wind up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said once that you wanted to buy me out. Here\u2019s your chance.\u201d</p><p>His head of security held up massive hands in a placating gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about throwing away everything you\u2019ve worked for over damn near the last decade for a girl you haven\u2019t ever fuc\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Finish. That. Sentence. She\u2019s had no one to truly rely on for too long. I\u2019m going to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re caught, you\u2019ll go to prison with her.\u201d</p><p>Shock pinged through him. Axel had figured out Callie\u2019s identity.</p><p>Thorpe narrowed his eyes and gave the big guy his most menacing snarl. \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey . . . whoa. Nothing, man. Reading Kirkpatrick\u2019s documents tonight made it obvious who Callie really is. Blew the fuck out of my mind. But I figured you knew, too.\u201d At Thorpe\u2019s sharp nod, Axel went on. \u201cHer behavior all this time makes sense now. How long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost two years.\u201d Since that fateful December night when he\u2019d finally put his hands and his eyes on the bullet wound that had carved a little nick out of her left hip\u2014and confirmed all his worst fears. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be counting that big bounty on her head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Axel looked almost hurt. \u201cThe idea of Callie shooting anyone, much less her own family, especially for money, is preposterous. I\u2019d never stab either of you in the back for a buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not fucking with me. I\u2019d hate to have to end you and dispose of your corpse at the bottom of a lake in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Axel snorted. \u201cI won\u2019t give you a reason to plot my murder. Is that what you have in mind for his fate?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe followed the other man\u2019s stare down to Sean, still all but passed out. \u201cI\u2019m considering my options, but I\u2019m not ruling anything out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t do something with him, he\u2019s going to blab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And I\u2019ve got to remove him from Callie\u2019s path for good. She needs to know that she\u2019s safe, no matter where we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with her?\u201d</p><p>He figured that Axel was about the only one who hadn\u2019t guessed before now. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Lance didn\u2019t let you in on that. He\u2019s apparently amused. And Xander just feels sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>Being in Callie\u2019s room when it felt so utterly devoid of the woman herself was killing him. Her touch was here and her scent lingered. Thorpe paced, but pain seeped into his chest. Every moment felt like torture, and it was fucking hard just to breathe. How would he close his eyes and sleep without knowing where she\u2019d gone? How would he be able to face tomorrow without any idea if she was safe?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing funny about love when it goes to shit.\u201d Axel sighed heavily.</p><p>Thorpe knew the guy had a story, but he had to focus on Callie now. \u201cWill you help me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You\u2019ve squeezed me out of more binds than I can count. If you need me, I\u2019m solid. Just give me a few days to get all the paperwork in order. Focus on finding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Question is, where do we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like we can file a missing person\u2019s report . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And someone else was the last to see her before she bolted,\u201d Thorpe pointed out.</p> <p>They both looked down at Sean.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make coffee. Good luck waking Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Axel drawled.</p><p>With a nod, Thorpe sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, check in with your guys again . . . just in case they have anything new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Axel sauntered to the door, then paused. \u201cI won\u2019t give up, either. We\u2019ll do everything we can.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be easy. Callie had vanished into thin air many times over the years. She\u2019d learned how to evade law enforcement, how to disguise herself well, how to connect herself with people who weren\u2019t all that friendly with the authorities.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know how to escape a man willing to fight dirty and give anything to have her back. She\u2019d soon learn that he\u2019d never give up.</p><p>With a sour curl to his lips, he gave Sean a hearty shove. The man grunted, smacked his tongue in his mouth, then rolled away and resumed snoring.</p><p>Thorpe eyed him with annoyance. This shit had been going on entirely too long. He should have listened to his gut as soon as Kirkpatrick walked in the club and threw the bastard out.</p> <p>Sighing, he dragged Sean to the edge of the bed and slung the man over his shoulder, fireman style. The fucker groaned and jerked, half awake and flailing.</p><p>Trudging to Callie\u2019s small bathroom, Thorpe heaved the man into her empty tub. Sean\u2019s head hit the porcelain with a little thump.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to leave a mark.\u201d Axel stood in the doorway with a considering stare.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Thorpe smiled tightly and reached for the faucet. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done. I rushed back. This is more entertaining.\u201d With a bark of laughter, Axel considered Sean again. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to splash cold water on him, be careful. I was a medic in the military. He could go into shock. I\u2019ve seen it happen once after a few idiots drank too much tequila on leave, then tried to wake one another up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I only need this one alive for about two minutes. Then . . .\u201d Thorpe shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou have a really ruthless side, boss.\u201d Axel smiled. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d Thorpe flipped the faucet on in Callie\u2019s shower, blasting ridiculously cold water all over Sean, soaking his skin.</p><p>He came up sputtering, wiping water from his eyes and glaring. \u201cWhat the fuck! Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>Well, well. Isn\u2019t that interesting? No Scottish accent . . . The leopard was finally showing his true spots.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Thorpe growled, then grabbed the back of Sean\u2019s head by his wet hair.</p><p>\u201cGet your bloody hands off me.\u201d</p><p>And the accent is back. Thorpe rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDrop the act. I know you\u2019re not Scottish. And I know you\u2019re not a traveling businessman.\u201d</p><p>Sean reared back. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about. I\u2019m from Edinburgh. I moved to Florida a few years back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do what he says, if I were you,\u201d Axel suggested. \u201cHe\u2019s in a really bad mood.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s blue stare zipped around the room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I want to ask you since you were the last person to see her before she fled.\u201d</p><p>WITH a ripe curse, Sean jerked away from Thorpe\u2019s brutal hold and stood, turning off the freezing shower. He shook off the excess water like a dog, snickering when Thorpe and Axel both protested. Then they just looked angrier.</p><p>Well, fuck. Two against one, and I\u2019m buck naked. The odds weren\u2019t good. How did Thorpe know he wasn\u2019t a Scottish businessman? And what else did he know?</p><p>Later. His sluggish brain was just now processing what Thorpe had declared.</p><p>His heart froze, then began pounding like a damn jackhammer.</p><p>\u201cFled?\u201d He added the lilt, refusing to break cover, even if panic grated his insides. \u201cHow did you let her slip past you?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll explain the meaning of \u2018the jig is up\u2019 when Callie is back home safely. I\u2019m asking how she slipped past you. After all, you were in the same room with her.\u201d</p><p>Sean weighed his words carefully, trying to reconstruct the evening in his head, then he played the part of Kirkpatrick, as he had for months. \u201cThe lass must have drugged the wine she gave me. I don\u2019t recall much. Then she . . .\u201d</p><p>He let out a ragged breath. The part where Callie had swallowed down his cock and sucked him dry, all with such a sad look in her eyes, was crystal clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s between Callie and me, a private matter between a Master and his sub.\u201d</p><p>Axel leaned out the door, then came back dangling Callie\u2019s collar on one finger. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s your sub anymore. She took this off before she shimmied out the window.\u201d</p><p>The sight of Callie\u2019s collar glinting in Axel\u2019s hand staggered him like he\u2019d fallen under the weight of a giant redwood. He stumbled back. Son of a bitch, he should have listened to his instinct and pushed Callie for answers. He\u2019d known something was troubling her.</p><p>Sean grabbed the collar from Axel and clutched it in his hand, then glared Thorpe\u2019s way. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I hate worse than a fake accent,\u201d the club owner muttered to the security beefcake. \u201cI admit it had me fooled for a long time, but now it just makes me grit my teeth.\u201d Finally, the man regarded him again. \u201cWhat the fuck kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind where you explain to me what you did to distress my wee lovely. She\u2019s been upset since last night, when you saw us together in the dungeon. She seemed more than a mite on edge tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that I\u2019m the one who ran her off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I am. I\u2019ve no idea what she likes about you, but she does by her own admission. You pushing your attentions on her last night confused the poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blurting that you love her didn\u2019t? Are you going to tell me her tears then were fake?\u201d</p><p>Axel stepped between them. \u201cGuys, this isn\u2019t helping us find Callie.\u201d</p><p>True, and he had to keep it together. He\u2019d invested nearly a year\u2019s worth of work on her . . . and without meaning to, his heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check in with the rest of the staff, question some of the members who were in the parking lot earlier, and make a few phone calls. Be-fucking-have, you two,\u201d Axel demanded, then strode out the door, shaking his head.</p><p>As the other man disappeared, Sean got back to the matter at hand. \u201cCallie didn\u2019t say a word to me about leaving. We drank some wine, talked a bit, then made our way to the bed. That\u2019s the last thing I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea if she figured out you\u2019re a fed?\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cA fed? You\u2019re arse end up. I\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birdie told me there are lots of files from the FBI about me and everyone else who frequents this club in your apartment. And of course every known fact about \u2018wee\u2019 Callie.\u201d</p><p>Shit, Thorpe knew exactly who he was. And who she was, too. The good news was Thorpe was protective of the girl. The bad news was that might change now that he realized he\u2019d been having feelings for and harboring a fugitive all this time.</p><p>If Thorpe hurt her, Sean vowed to kill him.</p><p>Hurdling the rim of the tub, he jumped in Thorpe\u2019s face and, despite his nudity, shoved the annoying asshole against the wall. \u201cI should have you fucking arrested.\u201d</p><p>No sense in faking the accent now. Thorpe had crossed the line, invading a federal agent\u2019s turf. But Sean knew he should kick his own ass, too. He should carry information in a more discreet way. He should use some high-tech way to lock it up. But he\u2019d been raised by his grandparents. High tech wasn\u2019t his thing. Certain in the belief that no one at Dominion had seen through his cover, he\u2019d allowed himself to slack. And now he was going to pay.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Thorpe spit. \u201cThat accent was driving me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my grandfather\u2019s, and it\u2019s spot on. I\u2019ve tested it in Scotland, in his hometown. Fuck off.\u201d He stomped on the wet tile, sloshing around, before he grabbed Callie\u2019s towel off the rack. It was still damp. And damn if it didn\u2019t smell like her. Sean nearly went weak in the knees. He had to believe that he\u2019d smell her skin again soon. She couldn\u2019t be gone forever in an instant.</p><p>\u201cWill the real Sean step forward?\u201d Thorpe drawled \u201cOr is that even your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d Sean wrapped the towel around his waist, still clutching the delicate weight of her collar.</p><p>\u201cI think you do, unless you have no interest in finding Callie.\u201d Thorpe crossed his arms, and the seams of his coat struggled to contain the bulk of his shoulders. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to tell you what I know until you do.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d learned quickly from observation around the club that Mitchell Thorpe hid behind a veneer of civility, but under it all, he could be unflinchingly ruthless when something or someone he valued was threatened.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Sean Mackenzie. I have every interest in finding Callie. She\u2019s not just the subject of an investigation to me.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I believe you.\u201d Thorpe paused. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got about a million questions, but not until we have some idea where Callie has gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she give you any indication where she might be headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, she didn\u2019t indicate that she was going at all. I suspected, but . . . Can we head back to the bedroom so I can have my clothes? Unless you like me naked or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d Thorpe moved out of the doorway.</p><p>Sean ambled into Callie\u2019s room, looking at the window with a frown. \u201cShe crawled out that window with the bars?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded, seeming both vexed and oddly proud of Callie. \u201cI took a flashlight and examined the area where she\u2019d loosened the bars in one corner. It appears that she did it some time ago to make sure she had an escape route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s always had a plan, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she always does. How else could she manage to elude you guys for so long?\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded and located his clothes in the mess Thorpe had made searching the room. Setting Callie\u2019s collar on her nightstand, he swore he\u2019d have it around her neck again, someday, somehow\u2014for real. Then he slipped on his pants. \u201cI\u2019ve studied her patterns. From what I can tell, she came most recently from Oklahoma City. I don\u2019t see her going back there. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at the security footage. Did she leave in her car?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe hesitated. \u201cShe did, but I don\u2019t expect her to keep it long.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgreed. It\u2019s a liability. She wouldn\u2019t want to run the risk of us putting an APB out on her or being arrested by the first overzealous cop who runs her license plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The club owner didn\u2019t add a single other word to the conversation. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t going to lift a finger to help.</p><p>\u201cI wished I\u2019d listened to my gut and put a GPS tracker on her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any other way to track her?\u201d When Sean shook his head, Thorpe sighed in frustration. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? You knew she was a flight risk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had devices in both her collar and her purse. She conveniently removed the first and left the second behind. If I was going to play the pointless blame game, I\u2019d ask why you didn\u2019t check the bars on her windows to make sure they were secure. After all, you knew she was a flight risk, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have Axel to referee for us now. Are we going to narrow down where we might find Callie or just fight?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe clenched his fists, looking ready to spit nails. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve got some theories. She wouldn\u2019t head anywhere north or northeast with winter coming,\u201d Sean mused aloud.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m stupid.\u201d He bristled. \u201cCallie dislikes the cold. And over the last nine years, we\u2019ve tracked her through eight states. We\u2019ve often missed her by days, sometimes even hours.\u201d Sean couldn\u2019t help but admire her guts as he slipped on his shirt. \u201cBut she always chases the warmth. You know, we\u2019ve been aware for some time that she was in Texas. We even suspected Dallas, but couldn\u2019t pin her down.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe swallowed thickly. \u201cHow did you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got a hit on facial recognition software when you sent her to your bank to make a deposit at the end of January. It took a few weeks for the bureau to positively identify her, then another six weeks for me to watch this place, you, the others here, and her, so we could decide how to proceed.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe closed his eyes, and Sean could guess that he was kicking his own ass. \u201cI never imagined that a simple errand would put her at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. It could have just as easily been a traffic or sidewalk cam.\u201d</p> <p>But Thorpe\u2019s face said that he absolutely felt responsible and that if he ever found Callie, he wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again. Sean would bet every dime in his bank account that the man was already planning to secret her out of the country, someplace far warmer and south of the U.S., out of the bureau\u2019s reach.</p><p>He regarded his nemesis, hoping like hell he wouldn\u2019t have to detain or hurt Thorpe. It would just be a waste of time and the loss of a temporary ally.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have any ideas where Callie might have gone?\u201d Sean challenged, wanting to know if Thorpe was going to play nice. Obviously, the man had ideas. Time to see how much he\u2019d be willing to share.</p><p>\u201cNot really. The only thing I\u2019ve ever been able to count on with Callie was the unpredictable. Maybe Florida. If she wanted to get out of the country, doing it from the Keys would be easier.\u201d</p><p>Sean pounded his fist on the wall beside Thorpe\u2019s head. \u201cBullshit! The longer you play this stupid fucking game with me, the longer she has to get away. She won\u2019t go to Florida because she thinks my home and business are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn. I guess I can\u2019t accuse you of being stupid after all.\u201d</p><p>Sean just snorted.</p><p>\u201cAre you based in Florida?\u201d Thorpe sounded almost hopeful.</p> <p>\u201cRight here in Dallas.\u201d He smiled acidly.</p><p>\u201cWell, hunky fucking dory. Isn\u2019t it my lucky day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to like me any better than I like you. But right now, we have to work together to find her. Every minute that ticks by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs another minute she slips farther away. I know that, asshole.\u201d Thorpe gave an agitated huff and raked a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cLook, whether you believe me or not, my feelings for Callie are real. I have a very vested interest in making sure she doesn\u2019t go to jail, especially for a crime there\u2019s no way she committed.\u201d</p><p>That set Thorpe on his ear. \u201cYou know she\u2019s innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But is that really the important question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does the bureau want her? Murder isn\u2019t really their jurisdiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re thinking. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve asked myself over and over. I don\u2019t have an answer, and before you say a word, that\u2019s not a load of crap. I don\u2019t have the time or energy to lie to you, man. They keep giving me a line about identity fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie wouldn\u2019t steal anyone\u2019s identity.\u201d Thorpe frowned.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s created personas and gotten fake IDs, sometimes crossing state lines before shedding them and her car, then starting over.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cAnd that\u2019s cause for the bureau to send in an undercover agent for months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. None of this adds up for me, either. And they\u2019re treating the case like it\u2019s vital to national security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes even less sense is that my directive is just to keep tabs on her and search for anything she may have taken of her father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to arrest her?\u201d Thorpe looked tense, poised on a knife\u2019s edge waiting for the answer.</p><p>A part of Sean wanted to let the club owner squirm in discomfort, but they just didn\u2019t have time. \u201cAt least for now. If they really believed she had violated laws, they\u2019d want her behind bars pronto. Two and two isn\u2019t adding up. Something\u2019s rotten in Denmark. Use whatever clich\u00e9 you like, but it\u2019s messed up. And I\u2019m going to do everything I can to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d Crossing his arms, Thorpe swallowed. \u201cAll right. She mentioned something about L.A. to me last night.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s whole body tightened. \u201cDoes she know anyone there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. Xander moved to Louisiana. And they aren\u2019t close.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug of his shoulders, Sean considered the suggestion. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. They have fairly warm winters. It\u2019s far from here. It\u2019s a big city, so she can get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked like that notion scared the hell out of him. It worried Sean, too. What if he couldn\u2019t find her there? Or anywhere?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll definitely head west. Where\u2019s my damn phone?\u201d Sean patted his pockets, then looked around the floor, then the bed. Finally, he spotted the device and nearly pounced on it. The second he tapped in his code, the picture that appeared made him swear a blue streak. \u201cI know why Callie ran. Damn it, she fucking tricked me and figured out that I know who she is.\u201d</p><p>He flashed Thorpe the picture of her teenage self, chipper smile, dark blond hair, and those same blue eyes he could drown in.</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s sibilant curse filled the air. \u201cThat would do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scared her.\u201d Sean\u2019s face filled with regret.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. If you think she\u2019s going west, I\u2019m going to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Sean shook his head. \u201cThis is my job. You need to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening. I\u2019m going with you to find Callie and make sure you don\u2019t drag her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay here and act like everything is normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Thorpe demanded, looking at Sean as if he never had any mind to actually lose. \u201cMy world is upside down. Anyone who knows me knows damn well that I wouldn\u2019t let that girl go without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you\u2019re crazy if you think the bureau isn\u2019t watching you, too. They don\u2019t get eyes on Callie too often outside Dominion. But you . . . every time you\u2019ve hopped on a commercial flight or even taken a taxi since we identified her has been tracked and noted, just in case you leaving is a sign that she\u2019s darting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone inside the club snitched that we\u2019re close?\u201d</p><p>Sean quickly assured him with a shake of his head. \u201cBefore I joined, I couldn\u2019t get anyone to talk, but the bureau surmised it. She\u2019s never stayed in one place for even half this long, so we had to assume that she was attached to someone here. You seemed like the most logical choice. The second I got in the door, I knew she\u2019d remained here all these years for you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell Thorpe that he knew Callie had largely accepted his collar to see if Thorpe would care. If the bastard hadn\u2019t figured out that she was in love with him, too, Sean didn\u2019t feel the need to enlighten him. In his book, if Thorpe hadn\u2019t claimed her by now, he\u2019d missed his chance.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thought,\u201d Thorpe tossed out. \u201cYou stay here and look \u2018normal.\u2019 I\u2019ll borrow someone else\u2019s car and head west, in case they\u2019re looking for mine. I\u2019ll find Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you will. While you\u2019re working out some scheme in your head where you intend to clear the country with her, never to be seen again. I promise I won\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019ll throw obstruction, tampering, harboring a fugitive\u2014whatever I can make stick\u2014at you. I\u2019ll also prosecute the hell out of Axel for breaking into my apartment and tampering with federal evidence. You\u2019ll both go to jail. And before you tell me Axel had nothing to do with it, shut up and spare me the lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re at a crossroads. You want to find her. I want to find her. You give me the \u2018two heads are better than one\u2019 speech, then think you\u2019re going to leave me here while you find Callie alone?\u201d Thorpe shook his head. \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t give a fuck if you try to arrest me. I only care about bringing her back safe. I don\u2019t doubt that she\u2019s dodged some unscrupulous men in the past who have looked at her and seen nothing but that two-million-dollar bounty.\u201d Thorpe frowned at him. \u201cIf she\u2019s not actually wanted for a crime, why the big price on her head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t have any other family to put up money, so that\u2019s another mystery that makes no sense to me. But if Uncle Sam is willing to pony up that much cash, she\u2019s somehow valuable. Someone else knows that\u2014and knows why. People far more dangerous than bounty hunters.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe went absolutely still. \u201cWhoever killed her family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. After all, they also shot her the night she escaped. If they wanted her dead then, why stop trying now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Jesus . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the files I have access to, she\u2019s eluded some well-paid assassins over the last nine years. Someone wants to silence her. I just wish I knew why. I\u2019d love to hunt down these assholes so I can keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stand here and fuck around. This is bigger than I imagined.\u201d Thorpe didn\u2019t look like a man who ever begged, but he came pretty close now. \u201cTwo heads are better than one. You might know more about her background, but I know her. I know who she is now. I have a better idea where she\u2019d go, what she\u2019d do, and why.\u201d</p><p>Sean paused and reluctantly nodded. \u201cAll right. But you can\u2019t take her out of the country once we find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work that out later. Let\u2019s find her first.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t like it, but Thorpe had a valid point. \u201cMy rules, though. Leave your phone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Thorpe looked at him like he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cIf she calls me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t. She left her phone here with all her contact numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie memorizes numbers. She knows how to call me.\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cThe bureau is monitoring the location of your phone. Leave it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it! How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade secret. Get a burner phone and tell Axel how to find you in case Callie calls you or returns. We need a car, not yours or mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxel will be happy to drive my Jag while I\u2019m gone,\u201d Thorpe drawled.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Sean clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We both need to grab as much cash as we can. Once we do, we\u2019ll get on the road. Hopefully, we can be out of Dallas before dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, just head west?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Sean\u2019s face turned grim. \u201cWe\u2019ll hope for a break in the information as we\u2019re traveling.\u201d</p><p>After a quick chat with Axel, they exchanged keys, and his head of security was grinning from ear to ear, promising to take care of the business and car, as Thorpe made his way to his office. Just as he set his phone in a drawer of his desk to lock it up, it chimed with a text. Sean glanced at the screen. Logan Edgington. 911. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does he want at this late hour?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNot sure. Might have something to do with a phone call I made earlier.\u201d He snatched his phone up again and quickly hit a few buttons, then jammed the device against his ear.</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t believe him for a second. \u201cPut it on speaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr you stay here\u2014behind bars. I can arrange that.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe grumbled, then hit the speaker button as the call connected. The second the other man answered, Thorpe skipped the small talk. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara just found out through her contacts at the bureau that Kirkpatrick is really a fed named Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that already. And he\u2019s standing right beside me.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe slanted him a stare, and Sean had to admit that he was impressed that the club owner had the forethought to look into his background. The guy might make a better partner in the search for Callie than expected.</p> <p>\u201cWell . . . I didn\u2019t know that until just now. So don\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really my priority at the moment, Logan. I have to go. Callie is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She came to me, terrified out of her mind. She didn\u2019t know who or what this Sean guy was.\u201d Logan sighed. \u201cShe thought he was trying to kill her, so I helped her disappear.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cWHY the fuck didn\u2019t you call me before now?\u201d Thorpe demanded. \u201cHell, why didn\u2019t she come to me? I\u2019m going to paddle her ass when I catch up with her . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in line \u0327\u201d Sean groused beside him. \u201cThe little minx tricked me, drugged me, lied to me. I\u2019m sure I can add to that list if I think about it for a few seconds more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCallie was scared, guys. She panicked. Based on what she told me, I understood,\u201d Logan said, trying to be the voice of reason.</p><p>There were a hundred reasons that was funny, but Thorpe wasn\u2019t in the mood to laugh just now. \u201cAnd what did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here as a law enforcement officer or her Dom?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cMy priority is Callie\u2019s safety,\u201d Sean clarified. \u201cNothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>Logan snorted. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying, Thorpe will probably make sure that someone finds you months from now at the bottom of a lake with hundred-pound weights attached to your ankles.\u201d</p><p>Damn, Logan knew him well.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Spit it out.\u201d Sean rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe told me everything,\u201d Logan admitted.</p> <p>Callie trusts a man she hasn\u2019t seen in two years more than she trusts me? The thought stung Thorpe like an icy rain. It fucking hurt, to be so disregarded after four years of . . . what was their relationship exactly?</p><p>If he thought about it, Callie had been his sub in so many ways. Not sexually, of course. But she\u2019d deferred to him at work. She\u2019d begun to come to him with her problems\u2014not this one, granted. She\u2019d leaned on him, sometimes letting him hold her when she\u2019d looked forlorn or melancholy. And sweetest of all, she often tried to please him in little ways. He\u2019d done his best to give her all the security, support, boundaries, and caring she required.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been enough. With one sentence, Logan had stripped away his blinders and proven that he wasn\u2019t Callie\u2019s go-to confidante. It would be easy to imagine that she didn\u2019t care for him, but those teary blue eyes hadn\u2019t lied when he\u2019d held her, and she\u2019d cupped his cheek as she\u2019d poured out her feelings. She did love him . . . in her way. As much as she let herself love anyone.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s my Callie now?\u201d Sean asked into the phone.</p><p>\u201cYour Callie?\u201d Thorpe asked sharply. \u201cRemind me where her collar is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and let Edgington answer,\u201d Sean snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her way to Vegas,\u201d Logan supplied. \u201cI called ahead to one of my old SEAL team buddies. Elijah is a good guy and a hell of an operative. Tomorrow, I promised to get some paperwork together for her so she could leave the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Sean muttered, echoing Thorpe\u2019s own sentiment. Then the fed looked at him. \u201cSo I guess we\u2019re heading to Vegas. How is she getting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found her a last-minute charter with a bunch of vacationers. It\u2019s a direct flight, leaving from New Orleans about . . . now. The plane is a big one. She\u2019s in the back. Hopefully, no one will remember her, especially after she bought a floppy hat at Walmart that covers half her face. Elijah will pick her up when the flight lands. He\u2019ll put her up with him. He\u2019s vacating his wife and kids from the house, just in case there\u2019s trouble. As soon as all her paperwork came together, I was going to overnight it to her.\u201d</p><p>And that would have been that. She would have disappeared from his life forever. And Thorpe realized, if that had happened, she would have been his biggest regret, too. He already had so many of them. Was he prepared to add her to the list?</p><p>\u201cThe second Callie called you to meet her, you should have let me know. You should have told me where she was, what was going on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe begged me. I promised not to call you until we met and I heard her out. Once I had, I understood why she was adamant about not risking you, so I promised not to say anything. And she was right; everyone who knew her would assume she\u2019d come to you with her problems. She usually does.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe still didn\u2019t like it. \u201cHow would you feel if Tara came to me wanting to escape danger, and refused to involve you even for your own good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different. She\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not different. If Xander knew how I felt about her, I guarantee you did.\u201d He cursed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk more about this later. Where can we find Elijah?\u201d</p><p>Logan rattled off the address, then sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. In your shoes, I\u2019d be pissed, too. I did what I thought was best with the information I had. I\u2019ll stall her paperwork and tell Elijah to hang on to her until you can get there. Then you can decide the best course of action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sean said into the phone. \u201cWe\u2019ll call you again from the road with disposable numbers. Neither of us are taking our phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe ended the call, barely resisting the urge to throw his cell across the room and smash it into pieces. Instead, he locked the device into one of his desk drawers so only Axel could access it, then looked at his rival for Callie\u2019s affection and his new partner in her retrieval. \u201cI want to get to Callie as quickly as we can. I won\u2019t rest again until I see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>DAWN had inched up over the horizon a few hours ago, and they were in the armpit of Texas, somewhere between Dallas and Amarillo. Mile after mile of boring highway rolled by with nothing but small Texas towns to see, and the drive seemed interminable. He and Sean had passed the hours with a fast-food breakfast sandwich, several cups of coffee, and absolute silence. Yesterday\u2019s clothes felt gritty and stiff. But none of that mattered now. Thorpe could only pray that no one had recognized Callie and that she remained out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>Beside him, Sean\u2019s eyes drooped like he still had a tinge of an Ambien hangover. But he continued to stare at the road as if it would somehow bring Callie back to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to sleep, go ahead. I got it,\u201d Thorpe said, breaking the tense hush.</p><p>Sean shook his dark head. \u201cI\u2019ve been on stakeouts in the past and had to go two or three days without much sleep, so I\u2019ve been more tired.\u201d</p><p>He should probably just shut up, but they\u2019d lost all radio reception some time ago, unless one counted the classic country twang station, which he didn\u2019t. To say the drive was stressful and boring was as obvious as calling the sky blue.</p><p>\u201cYour sleep deprivation isn\u2019t going to help us find her any faster,\u201d Thorpe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m not sure I could nod off for any reason. We\u2019ve got hours, maybe days, before we catch up to Callie. If I closed my eyes now, I\u2019d just dwell on how disturbed I am that she believes I\u2019m out to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you expect her to think after she realized you lied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand logically. How many dirtbags have hunted her in the past, right? Her wariness has probably saved her more than once.\u201d A pained frown consumed the other man\u2019s face, full of deep lines and silent restraint. Callie\u2019s belief that Sean was capable of hurting her was clearly shredding his guts. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t tell Callie that I loved her if I\u2019d just planned on ending her.\u201d</p><p>Mackenzie\u2019s tone asked why the girl couldn\u2019t see that. The man might have spewed a lot of crap in the past, but unfortunately Thorpe had no doubt his feelings were genuine.</p><p>\u201cOr turning her in for the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she become more than a case to you?\u201d Thorpe wasn\u2019t interested in having a touchy-feely conversation, but it would both fill the long drive and tell him how much he could trust the guy.</p><p>Sean shrugged. \u201cI think before I even met her. Callie was never a name in a file for me. From the moment this case came my way, I wanted to understand what made her tick. I kept thinking how damn hard it would be to lose your mother as a little girl, then so violently lose everyone else you loved before really growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then have to run for your life and be forced to leave everyone you came to care about again and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sean stewed for a minute. \u201cHer circumstances hit me hard. I didn\u2019t know my parents too well, but my grandparents raised me. When they died . . .\u201d He let out a long breath. \u201cThat was damn hard. They taught me how to love and the value of family. Anyway, I felt for Callie. But the moment I met her . . . fuck, I knew I was toast.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe gripped the steering wheel tighter, stunned by Sean\u2019s simple honesty. He understood closeness and love. Thorpe had been avoiding those for so many years, he\u2019d forgotten what it was like to truly let anyone inside his heart\u2014until Callie had bulldozed his protective walls and dug her way in without even knowing it. She\u2019d quickly taken root, a weed he couldn\u2019t bring himself to pull. If he managed to find her, could he open enough to be the man, the lover, she needed?</p><p>According to most people in his past, he didn\u2019t have a prayer in hell.</p><p>\u201cRight away, I could see that she\u2019d been alone for too long. She isn\u2019t meant to be,\u201d Sean pointed out, his tone almost a challenge, as if he was willing to fight until Thorpe agreed.</p><p>But there was nothing to argue about. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Sean relaxed. \u201cCallie yearns for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does. She\u2019s afraid to connect with anyone, but her heart is too big not to share. Despite that bratty attitude she flashes, she\u2019s most content when she\u2019s making others happy.\u201d</p><p>If they could help Callie understand that they both simply wanted her safe, maybe she would come home. But that wouldn\u2019t make her whole. The girl needed the firm hand of a tender master to guide her through life and love. She was probably better off without him, but Thorpe knew that if he didn\u2019t get over his shit and try to assume that role, Sean certainly would. If the man succeeded, Callie could be lost to him forever.</p><p>The sun beat down through the back window. The remnants of the coffee tasted like cold sawdust. His stomach coiled into tight knots. Since he doubted he could be what she needed but he didn\u2019t want to live without her, where did that leave him? Fucked.</p><p>\u201cI see her desire to please others,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cBut to survive, the clever little kitten has developed some sharp claws.\u201d The fond smile on Sean\u2019s face made Thorpe both appreciate the man more and want to rip his entrails out with jealousy. \u201cCallie will fight when she thinks it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time. But in the last four years, I\u2019ve watched her blossom. When she first came to me, she didn\u2019t smile, wouldn\u2019t talk, lied about everything. The fucking sadness on her face . . . I knew she was in some sort of trouble. It was damn hard, but I didn\u2019t push or pry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you figure out who Callie really was?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sent him a skeptical glare. \u201cAnd admit to knowingly harboring a fugitive so you have a reason to arrest me? Not happening.\u201d</p><p>Sean tossed his hands in the air. \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted to arrest you for that, I could have done it back in Dallas. And if I trumped up a charge and threw you in jail, Callie would never forgive me. As much as I hate to say it, I need your help to find her.\u201d</p><p>Pretty speech, but that didn\u2019t mean Thorpe trusted the fed. \u201cWhat happens when we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean who gets the girl? That\u2019s up to Callie.\u201d Sean sighed. \u201cShe loves us both.\u201d</p><p>Another truth. The even uglier truth was that he\u2019d never fought for her. For years, Thorpe had denied how much he cared, pretended that he knew nothing about her feelings. Why would the girl ever choose a divorced man fifteen years her senior who\u2019d only ever rebuffed her over the hot, young agent who couldn\u2019t wait to tell her that he loved her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t your superiors frown on you for getting involved with a \u2018person of interest\u2019?\u201d Thorpe asked. It was a weak argument, but the best he had.</p><p>The truth was, if Callie loved and trusted a man, she would always stand beside him. Funny how clearly Thorpe could see that if he\u2019d acknowledged the feelings they shared and proven that she could trust him with her identity, Callie would still be at Dominion. She would never have run off before talking through the issues or intentionally leave him broken.</p><p>He might be too jaded to give Callie the devotion she deserved, but that didn\u2019t make Mackenzie good for her, either. He was just another brand of wrong, as far as Thorpe could tell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it, but I won\u2019t let anything happen to her,\u201d the fed vowed, sending him a challenging stare. \u201cI\u2019ve answered your question. You answer mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right. I figured out who she was a couple of years back. Ultimately, it\u2019s her eyes.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re so blue, you can\u2019t miss them. It\u2019s one reason she\u2019s worn colored contacts more often than not for years. So why did you let her stay once you realized who she was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should have tossed her out when she needed someone to protect her? Fuck, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your shoes, I would have made the same choice. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s got someone else in her corner,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHow long have you been in love with her?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe tried hard not to grit his teeth. \u201cCan we skip this chat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou started it,\u201d Sean reminded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you turned it around to interrogate me quickly enough.\u201d</p><p>Sean sat back with a grin. \u201cOccupational hazard.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe grunted, but he felt a ghost of a smile bend his lips. He didn\u2019t like Mackenzie, exactly, but now that the guy wasn\u2019t pretending to be someone else, he didn\u2019t hate the fed quite so much. \u201cWhat does Callie\u2019s file say about her that I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to this game? All right, when you want to ask me something about the woman today, you\u2019ll be barking up the wrong tree.\u201d</p> <p>Sean sighed. \u201cThis mission would have been so much easier without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie would still be at Dominion if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>Exasperation crossed his face. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not authorized to tell you anything outright . . . but I can\u2019t stop you from guessing. As soon as you tell me how long you\u2019ve been in love with her.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sent Mackenzie a speculative glance. He\u2019d guessed that Sean wasn\u2019t above bending the rules, but found having that confirmed helpful. And even if he was no good for Callie, Thorpe ached to fill in some of the gaps in his knowledge about the girl. \u201cEasily over three years.\u201d Not that it\u2019s ever going to matter. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long time to have a stiff dick, old man.\u201d</p><p>That jibe hit a bit too close to home. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s good for me. Your loss is my gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Thorpe threatened, sadly aware that it most likely was.</p> <p>Sean shrugged. \u201cOnly Callie can settle this argument. In the meantime, you want to know something in her file or not.\u201d</p><p>Prick. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve often wondered how Callie supported herself in other cities before she came to me. Your file say anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s fallen back on the same occupation several times in several cities. Always with different names, of course. Any guesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides waitressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s done that more than once, so I\u2019ll give you a point for that answer. But I\u2019m thinking of something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying holding this over my head,\u201d Thorpe accused.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d With a grin, Sean shrugged. \u201cSue me.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Thorpe focused on the empty road and the sign that told him it was forty miles to the nearest town. \u201cCallie\u2019s great at a lot of things. She speaks fluent French, but there\u2019s not a big calling for that here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an organizational dynamo, and I\u2019m sure she could do that professionally, but opening her own business would put down too many roots for her, so I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s not it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve searched Callie\u2019s room more than once,\u201d Sean admitted. \u201cShe\u2019s extremely organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made my sty of an office the neatest it\u2019s ever been. She has a good head for math, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to her grades, she was good in most of her classes.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe smiled. \u201cExcept science, I\u2019ll bet. I enjoy some of the shows on the Science Channel, and she occasionally curls up with me during off-hours to watch. She seems lost half the time.\u201d</p><p>That made Mackenzie laugh. \u201cI can picture that. Ever seen the program narrated by Morgan Freeman? I like that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the Wormhole? Me, too.\u201d Thorpe turned a stare on him, shocked that they agreed on anything. In fact, they were almost getting along.</p><p>Sean cleared his throat. \u201cKeep guessing. Another way Callie made ends meet?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, moving on . . . Thorpe was uncomfortable with the concept of the two of them being chummy. \u201cShe\u2019s a disaster in the kitchen. Cereal might be too tough for her, so I\u2019m guessing she didn\u2019t cook as a kid. And how would she have learned? I\u2019m sure her father employed a full staff, nannies\u2014chefs, gardeners, a personal valet\u2014the works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to her files, yes,\u201d Sean confirmed.</p><p>Which made one of his most precious memories of Callie all the sweeter. Thorpe smiled. \u201cShe knows how much I like Italian cream cake and tried to make it, along with a lovely dinner for my last birthday. The meal was horrific, and we both laughed. But the cake was actually pretty good.\u201d</p><p>His words seemed to hit Sean between the eyes like a bullet. The fact that she\u2019d tried so hard to please Thorpe clearly left him feeling out in the cold. Oddly, Thorpe understood. Every time he\u2019d see her dress up for Sean or kneel for the fucker, it felt like a two-by-four to his gut.</p><p>\u201cSince she never made any money cooking, I suspect Callie could earn her living either singing or dancing. She\u2019s exceptional at both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, you do know her.\u201d Sean looked somewhere between awed and annoyed. \u201cSinging. That\u2019s how she paid her bills more than once. In fact, during her brief stint in Nashville, an executive for a major label saw her at a bar and offered her a record deal. She made an appointment to visit his office the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd never showed?\u201d Thorpe guessed.</p><p>\u201cExactly. She skipped town overnight. I didn\u2019t know she could dance. Her files indicate that she had dance classes, but so did my cousins. That didn\u2019t help them.\u201d Sean snorted.</p><p>Thorpe laughed and found himself relaxing a bit. \u201cThe last time I saw her dance was just before you came. I hosted a charity auction for wounded soldiers and their families back in March. Slave-for-a-day kind of thing. She danced onstage and worked up enthusiasm for the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie has great legs, so I\u2019m not surprised it worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho bought her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Thorpe had been unable to watch anyone else touch her, so he\u2019d given her the night off if she promised to spend it alone in her room. He\u2019d spent it with someone else . . . thinking of her.</p><p>Sean\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI don\u2019t like the thought that I may never see her dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like thinking that I\u2019ll never hear about Callie\u2019s childhood from her. The few times I tried to probe about her past\u2014before I knew who she was, of course\u2014she was either closemouthed or sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>Sean shot him a speculative look. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t beat her ass for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was tempted.\u201d</p><p>The fed grunted. \u201cSo, Callie was twenty-one when she came to Dominion? What was she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a chip on her shoulder that warned everyone away for months. The girl only spoke to me because she had to. I\u2019ll never forget . . . I found her crying on the back patio after she\u2019d been there a few weeks. Callie judiciously avoided anything remotely personal with everyone. But those tears . . .\u201d Thorpe shook his head. \u201cI watched her for a few minutes, then I couldn\u2019t stand it. I tried to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe rebuffed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstantly,\u201d Thorpe confirmed. \u201cIf I wanted to talk about BDSM or work, she was all ears. The second I asked anything personal, she clammed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she finally let you close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found the first chink in her armor at Christmas. God, Callie loves it. Decorates everything in sight. I praised her wildly, and she started softening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything in her file about that.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shrugged. \u201cI only have sketchy details about a sliver of her time before she came to Dominion, but it was obvious to me that Callie enjoys Christmas because it\u2019s a holiday for family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that since she doesn\u2019t have any, she adopted everyone at the club as her own.\u201d Sean closed his eyes. \u201cSee, this is why I could never picture her as a hardened criminal. Even if she planned to run off with that Holden prick, Callie wanted a sense of belonging. A woman like that would never kill her loved ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. I was shocked that first holiday season with Callie. She fancied the place up, organized a party, made everything run like a well-oiled machine . . . then stood in the corner and watched like a little girl with her nose pressed to the glass.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Sean shook his head. \u201cThen she has come a long way. Callie teases most everyone at Dominion now. I guess I have you to thank for the change. I hate to admit it, but you\u2019ve taken good care of her.\u201d</p><p>With the sun glaring through the back window, Thorpe flipped his wrist up to stare at his watch, uncomfortable with the man\u2019s praise. How much more could he have healed Callie if he was capable of actually fucking trying?</p><p>\u201cHow long does it take to fly from New Orleans to Vegas?\u201d Thorpe spit out. \u201cThree hours? Four? Shouldn\u2019t she be there by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask the bureau to track the flight, but . . .\u201d He looked vaguely uneasy.</p><p>The truth hit Thorpe. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this under the radar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re not best pals, but we both have a vested interest in finding Callie. We\u2019ve got hours of driving ahead of us and we\u2019re in this shit together. So you better be honest with me or I\u2019ll leave you on the side of this damn road and find her without you.\u201d</p><p>Spreading his knees and staring out the window, Sean sighed. \u201cAs my grandfather would have said, some of the higher-ups are a dodgy lot. They\u2019ve always acted a bit evasive about this case, but over the past few weeks, something\u2019s changed. I can\u2019t put my finger on it. I just have this gut feeling that if I gave them any indication Callie has fled, it would open up a can of worms I might not be able to close. I think they\u2019d start a full-fledged manhunt. They might even insist that I arrest her. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>And if Sean couldn\u2019t arrest her, Thorpe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d turn her in, even for a two-million-dollar bounty. He might be wrong . . . but he didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Thorpe didn\u2019t like the sound of that at all. \u201cCan you lean on them, find out anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried. Often, agents are at the bottom of the information totem pole. Politics are always on a need-to-know basis, and they think I don\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t have the energy. I just want Callie back, a decent meal, and a good night\u2019s sleep\u2014in that order.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe wanted that, too, along with a passionate, grinding slide into Callie\u2019s undoubtedly tight pussy so he could hear her cry out in his ear while she dug her little nails into his back, just as she\u2019d done to Sean. He didn\u2019t like another man fucking her, but he liked the fact that he\u2019d never had the pleasure of feeling her himself even less.</p><p>Listen to him whine . . . He wasn\u2019t in her best interest. Whatever Mackenzie\u2019s flaws or agenda, the fed loved her\u2014enough to risk his job for her. Thorpe couldn\u2019t fault Sean for that.</p><p>\u201cSo, about the ex-wife, Melissa . . .\u201d Mackenzie began.</p><p>Thorpe choked, then took a swig of cold coffee to recover. \u201cNothing to say about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left, so you\u2019re bitter? Or gun shy?\u201d Sean probed.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck do you get off questioning me? We\u2019re talking about Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand you. Your bad experience with the lousy ex is the reason you kept Callie at arm\u2019s length all these years, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, but he wasn\u2019t spilling all his demons for Sean. \u201cThere\u2019s a significant age gap, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is more your hang-up than hers, I\u2019d bet. What else?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe glanced at his crappy burner phone, wondering where Logan\u2019s call was that Callie had reached Vegas all right. If Logan didn\u2019t call in five, he\u2019d ring the former SEAL. But whatever he did, he wasn\u2019t replying to Sean.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s mostly your own fear.\u201d The fed supplied his own answer. \u201cI guess that makes sense in a chicken shit sort of way. But one thing has me stumped. Why decide to get possessive after I entered the picture? You\u2019re off relationships because of the ex, so you tell yourself that you don\u2019t want Callie. But you don\u2019t want anyone else to have her, either. You\u2019ve got your head up your ass, Thorpe. It\u2019s not fair to her.\u201d</p> <p>Sean\u2019s words echoed Lance\u2019s and rang a little too true. Damn it if he didn\u2019t want to punch the man. \u201cNone of this is any of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is if you want to know anything else in Callie\u2019s file.\u201d Sean gave him an expectant smile.</p><p>Thorpe rubbed his broad forehead, wishing he could massage away the beginnings of his headache. He really wanted to toss Mackenzie from the vehicle, but that wasn\u2019t in Callie\u2019s best interest. She had to be priority number one. \u201cAt first, she\u2019d barely talk to me. After she\u2019d been at Dominion a few months, I used her for a teaching demo. Of course I was attracted to her from the beginning, but Callie was a pure novice. I didn\u2019t know if she was truly submissive or was pretending because she needed a job. I found out quickly that she was. Our chemistry was . . . not like anything I\u2019d ever experienced. It shocked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you backed away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I should have, but Callie was far more submissive than I\u2019d dared to hope, not to mention addicting. It wasn\u2019t long before I used her for every demo. It was the only excuse I would give myself to touch her. She still kept her distance more often than not, but damn, the way she responded to me . . . I was very seriously considering breaking my own rule about never taking an exclusive sub.</p> <p>\u201cThen I was watching some silly news program one day. They showed a picture of Callie at sixteen, the same one you have on your phone. It all clicked. I hoped I was wrong, so I invented a new excuse to touch her and see if she had a scar on her hip where that bullet got her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you found it, you cut off all but the most professional contact.\u201d Sean didn\u2019t phrase it like a question. He knew the answer.</p><p>Though Thorpe didn\u2019t like being transparent, he supposed his motives weren\u2019t that hard to deduce.</p><p>\u201cYes. She was always going to leave me. It was just a matter of when.\u201d As soon as he\u2019d had to stop touching Callie, Thorpe realized just how attached to her he\u2019d become. And it had scared the hell out of him. He\u2019d punished her by being an absolute bastard.</p><p>God, didn\u2019t he sound like a pussy, afraid of his own emotions?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to endure heartache again after your divorce.\u201d</p> <p>Sean didn\u2019t know the half of it.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. But seeing you with her . . .\u201d Thorpe let out a deep breath. \u201cI realized then that all my attempts to deny my feelings had been a fucking waste. Happy now? Can we change the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d Sean cut a stare over at him. \u201cIf we find her, are you going to be willing to risk your heart for her? Because if you\u2019re not, you shouldn\u2019t bother fighting me for her. We both agreed that she\u2019s not meant to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe wasn\u2019t sure what the hell he was going to do. He wanted to fight for her . . . but what was best for Callie? \u201cYou\u2019re not entirely prepared to handle her.\u201d</p><p>Sean crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re really a Dom, you haven\u2019t been one for long. You\u2019re a bit too lenient with the girl. Sometimes, she\u2019s a handful because she wants your attention. You give it to her and let her top from the bottom.\u201d Thorpe tsked at him. \u201cI\u2019ve also noticed that you\u2019re not comfortable with all the equipment in the dungeon. If we find her, are you going to be willing to expand your boundaries to be what she needs? If not, you should leave her to me.\u201d</p><p>That made Sean indignant. \u201cFuck you. I may not have been an acknowledged pervert for two decades, but I\u2019m more than willing to \u2018expand my boundaries\u2019 to hang on to Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfft.\u201d Thorpe rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at this . . . what? Less than a year?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I got interested a couple of years back, went to a few clubs in Florida with some friends. But long-term undercover assignments didn\u2019t exactly leave me a lot of time to get my kink on.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe opened his mouth to drop Mackenzie with a scathing remark about wannabe Doms, but his phone rang. They both pounced for it, but he was closer and pressed the button to answer the call. \u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on speaker,\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cCan you both hear me?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Feeling a supreme irritation that damn near choked him, Thorpe hit the speaker button and laid the phone on the console between them. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Sean advised. \u201cIs Callie with your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put her on the plane. One of the flight attendants says she remembers seeing Callie napping at the very back. There was no way she could have gotten off that bird in midair. But Elijah said she never met him in baggage claim, like I instructed her to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where she is?\u201d Sean growled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s missing?\u201d Thorpe echoed his incredulous tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Logan sounded somber. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t the worst news. Elijah spotted some dude in a uniform he\u2019d never seen flashing Callie\u2019s picture to the passengers just as they cleared the secure area of the terminal. The guy asked a lot of questions.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s veins ran icy with foreboding, then he snapped his gaze to Sean. \u201cUniform? Like military?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the impression he gave me, yeah,\u201d Logan confirmed. \u201cBut not one he\u2019d ever seen. That, along with everything else, sends up a big red flag for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. How is this possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Logan sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell a single other soul besides Elijah and you two that I\u2019d put her on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorpe and I haven\u2019t been out of one another\u2019s sight since.\u201d The fed\u2019s expression said he didn\u2019t like any of this.</p><p>\u201cAnd Elijah wouldn\u2019t talk. He\u2019s tight. Besides, I didn\u2019t even tell him who she really was,\u201d Logan explained. \u201cCallie didn\u2019t mention anything about being hunted by anyone else when she told me why she wanted to leave Dallas. Could the feds be after her, Mackenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were, I should be the first to know. Even if I was out of the loop, they wouldn\u2019t come after her in some uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Logan agreed. \u201cEveryone Elijah talked to from the flight seemed wary or shaken after the uniformed dude left. Whatever mess that girl has gotten herself into, she\u2019s in way over her head. You\u2019ve got to get to Vegas and find her before this asshole does.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>SEAN thanked God that Thorpe had rich friends when they landed in Las Vegas a few hours later. After Logan\u2019s pronouncement that Callie was at large somewhere in Sin City, he and Thorpe had both been ready to crawl out of their skins. Two minutes later, Thorpe had placed a call to Xander Santiago. Sean remembered him, his brother, and the pretty blonde sub they shared from their visit to Dominion over the previous summer\u2014mostly because Callie had left the club with the other woman and disappeared for damn near twelve hours.</p><p>That turned out to be a bonus. Because Callie had taken such good care of Xander and Javier\u2019s wife, London, the billionaires had been more than willing to lend him and Thorpe their plane. It had been fueled up and jetting to Amarillo, Texas, in no time. They hadn\u2019t waited long at all before the small luxury plane arrived to spirit them away to Vegas.</p><p>After a fitful catnap in midair, they touched down around noon. As he tossed his carry-on over one shoulder, Sean raced Thorpe to the exit and down the airstairs. Thorpe had shoved some necessities of his own in a briefcase and now clutched it in his fist as he sprinted for the parking lot. Anything they needed and hadn\u2019t packed they could buy\u2014except time. And every moment that ticked by they spent away from Callie made it less likely they would find her at all, much less before some uniform who already seemed half a step ahead of them did. At the twenty-four-hour mark, it was likely the trail would grow cold, and they\u2019d already eaten up half their time on fucking travel.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got our plan,\u201d he reminded Thorpe, tamping down his anxiety. \u201cLet\u2019s stick to it.\u201d</p><p>The club owner nodded absently, running for the stranger waiting in the distance. Logan\u2019s friend Elijah was big, bald, and menacing. The former SEAL didn\u2019t look like someone he\u2019d want for an enemy. Nor was he much for small talk, which suited Sean just fine.</p><p>Within seconds, they\u2019d taken the keys to the man\u2019s truck and paid him to rent a car. The idea wasn\u2019t perfect, but it wouldn\u2019t leave a completely obvious trail for anyone to follow. Since someone in a uniform had known to follow Callie to Vegas, the guy might also be keeping an eye on him and Thorpe, too. They\u2019d have to lie really fucking low in order to both find her and figure out who followed her.</p><p>The moment they reached Elijah\u2019s Jeep, Sean slipped behind the wheel. He\u2019d done an undercover stint in Vegas about two years ago and knew his way around the city reasonably well. The second Thorpe\u2019s ass hit the passenger seat, the man had his burner phone open and was calling folks in the local fet community. Sean doubted that Callie would fall back into a kink environment. She might find it comfortable, but he suspected she would choose to be as unpredictable as possible. It had kept her alive and free this long.</p><p>In the meantime, Sean pulled out his own phone as he tore away from the airport and started calling some less-than-legal guys he\u2019d met here previously. He asked questions delicately because he wasn\u2019t about to tip off known criminals about a woman with a two-million-dollar bounty on her head. No one had seen a new girl in town working the seedier side of life who matched Callie\u2019s description, but Sean didn\u2019t think it would be long. She hadn\u2019t had time to plan her escape to the last detail. She\u2019d have to fall back on existing skills for fast cash until she could come up with a better plan.</p><p>Thorpe slammed his phone on the console with a curse.</p><p>\u201cI take it that means you came up empty-handed?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it. I know a club owner named Talon who\u2019s connected to nearly everyone in the life here in Vegas. But he hasn\u2019t seen or heard about anyone new who fits Callie\u2019s description in the last day or so. Then again, she\u2019ll already have some sort of disguise.\u201d</p><p>Undoubtedly. He and Thorpe would have to factor that in. \u201cWe\u2019ve made our initial contacts. Now we\u2019re going to have to split up. You hit the fet joints and kink bars, make the rounds there in case she\u2019s hiding out. I\u2019ll hit dive bars, nightclubs, restaurants\u2014anyplace that might have filled the need for quick help in the last day or so. We both just need to look past any disguise for that familiar face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. She won\u2019t get away from me again.</p><p>\u201cCallie won\u2019t be working on the Strip,\u201d Sean warned. \u201cShe\u2019ll have found somewhere just off, maybe downtown, somewhere with a bit less sophisticated security, where she could make money without drawing too much attention to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check into a few bars I know. If I come up empty, we\u2019ll keep trying until something works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you find her, you better not skip the fucking country. You got that?\u201d Sean threatened. \u201cIt\u2019s likely going to take more than one person to protect her, and if someone in a secret branch of the military wants her, then you bet your ass they can reach you down in South America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Thorpe said, obviously resigned. \u201cI\u2019ve already thought of that.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded grimly and drove straight for the downtown area that had seen its glory days early in Vegas\u2019s history, sixty years ago. Overall, the hotels were a little seedier, as were the people. Callie could easily get lost in this sea of humanity. A wig, a few new clothes, some colored contacts . . . No one would know her\u2014or care. She wouldn\u2019t stay long in this city. Callie must know that he and Thorpe would come looking for her. And if she knew someone official sought her and had shaken Logan\u2019s protection, then she would want out of this city even faster. They had a few days. A week, tops. As soon as she saved a little money, she would slip out of town. Or out of the country. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered to himself and stepped on the gas, lurching the car into heavy traffic.</p><p>TWO hours later, Thorpe had indigestion from a lousy piece of pizza he\u2019d eaten while pounding the sidewalks. The two kink-oriented bars he knew were both half empty during the afternoon. It had taken forever to search the cavernous places. He\u2019d seen some pretty girls with Callie\u2019s height and build . . . but not the woman herself. Talon had greeted him at the Slip Knot with a drink in hand. Thorpe had declined the scotch and asked his friend to keep a lookout.</p><p>Finally making his way outside, he pulled out his phone and called Sean. Voicemail picked up after a couple of rings, and he took a taxi back to the parking lot of the hotel where Sean had left Elijah\u2019s vehicle. When he got there, the Jeep was empty. No Sean. No keys. Great. Now he either had to stand here and wait or pound the pavement more.</p><p>As he pushed away from Elijah\u2019s silver SUV, a realization hit him. Picking up his stride, he dialed Sean again, who picked up on the first ring.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, I just finished listening to your voicemail. A little patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got an idea. Where are you now?\u201d Thorpe had no more than asked the question when he looked up to see Sean striding through the parking lot.</p><p>They both hung up, and the fed looked at him with an expectant brow. Thorpe tried not to bristle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not being smart,\u201d he told Sean.</p><p>\u201cThen enlighten me. What are we not doing right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink about it. Callie drove to Logan for help, but he put her on a plane. She doesn\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d Sean\u2019s eyes lit up with possibilities. \u201cShe won\u2019t waste money taking a taxi to and from whatever job she\u2019s managed to scrape together. And she would have had to lay her head someplace last night.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked around the area with a look of horror. \u201cWhere the hell would she stay in this neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at a casino hotel. They\u2019re too public and probably a bit expensive. She likes extended-stay hotels, especially ones that aren\u2019t part of a chain,\u201d Sean reminded him. \u201cI know this area. I can think of a few off the top of my head. I\u2019ve got an idea. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>God, wherever she was, it was likely a dive, some motel that doubled as a rent-by-the-hour haven for local pimps. Thorpe gritted his teeth and followed after Sean. They walked the pavement until they came to the first place.</p><p>The exterior was a faded pink. The sign advertised color TVs and air-conditioning as its big selling features. The tarred parking lot had long ago cracked and buckled under the heat of punishing Vegas summers. Iron railings overlooking droopy balconies were covered in rust. The swimming pool was an off-putting shade of blue-green.</p> <p>The old man behind the counter looked half asleep, and he couldn\u2019t have cared less that he had customers. He barely lifted one eye away from the little TV. His jowls hung over his wrinkled hand as he glanced their way.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a missing person who might have checked in yesterday. She\u2019s twenty-five and petite, with a fair complexion. Very pretty. May or may not have black hair and blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I rent rooms, not girls. Back in my day, I would have liked a broad like that, too, but I haven\u2019t rented a room to anyone under fifty in at least two months. And I definitely haven\u2019t had a dreamboat want to stay here. Can I get back to my show now? I\u2019m missing Final Jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your time. If she comes by, can you please call this number?\u201d Sean jotted his digits down on a sticky note that lay on the cluttered counter, then slid it toward the old man. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d But he didn\u2019t look away from his show, listening instead to Alex Trebek.</p><p>Thorpe gritted his teeth as he and Sean exited. \u201cThat was a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. Callie might skip around for a while to confuse everyone on her trail. We\u2019ll visit this old fart again in a few days if we haven\u2019t found her.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to be disheartened or give into exhaustion, he nodded. \u201cWhere to next?\u201d</p> <p>Sean led the way to a handful of motels that advertised weekly or monthly rates. All dives he didn\u2019t ever want to call home. All looked as if they\u2019d had their heyday during the golden age of the Rat Pack. Both gave them similar speeches. No one new renting here who fit that description, yadda, yadda, yadda.</p><p>\u201cWe need a plan C,\u201d he told Sean.</p><p>The other man sighed heavily and raked a hand through his dark waves. \u201cWe\u2019re both exhausted. I\u2019m famished. Let\u2019s take a load off and talk this through.\u201d</p><p>Food didn\u2019t hold much appeal for Thorpe now, but he could use a cup of strong coffee.</p><p>They made their way to a little greasy spoon. As long as they were there, they inquired about Callie. Of course, they came up empty-handed.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t figure out why someone military might be looking for her,\u201d Sean said quietly once seated at a table in the corner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as lost there as you,\u201d Thorpe vowed. \u201cIt barely makes sense to me that the FBI wants to keep tabs on her. I guess the fact that her father was a multibillionaire is noteworthy, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does the bureau care? Like I said, I don\u2019t have any answers. And anyone in the military hunting her down seems way out in left field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t see how she could have gotten mixed up with anything or anyone under my roof. Before you came, I watched Callie just about every moment of every day. And if I didn\u2019t have eyes on her, Axel or one of his guys did. I did my best to protect her and keep her out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Sean sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s assume this pursuit has something to do with her family\u2019s murders. They were carried out by professionals. You could almost say with military precision.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t make Thorpe feel better. \u201cAny chance they\u2019re trying to protect her from something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait nine years to even try?\u201d</p><p>Good question, one without a logical answer. \u201cWhen you put it like that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s assume they\u2019re after her and that they\u2019re dangerous. I\u2019m guessing they just now got a lead on her. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t they have come after her at Dominion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how the hell did they find her in Vegas before she\u2019d even arrived?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wondered that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how Logan got her onto the plane, but he\u2019s a clever bastard. He could have somehow managed to bypass the security screening. Or maybe she used ID from a previous alias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that something at the airport alerted whoever is hunting Callie. But there\u2019s another scenario. Tell me, how much can we really trust Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImplicitly. I\u2019d vouch for him all day long.\u201d When Sean still didn\u2019t look convinced, Thorpe tried another tactic. \u201cWhy would he set Callie up with a safe haven and volunteer all the information to us if he just wanted to collect the bounty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Hell, I feel like I\u2019m grasping at straws. Nothing makes sense.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, Thorpe leaned across the table, pausing when the waitress came by to pour more coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s come back to how they found her later. The other big question is, why are they after her? Did her father have anything to do with the armed forces? Did he have any money in defense contracting? Have any sway with senators on the Armed Services Committee? Rub elbows with generals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to go back and double-check her file, but none of that rings a bell.\u201d Sean sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want it, but I need some fucking sleep.\u201d</p><p>As much as Thorpe would rather keep searching for her, he needed some shut-eye, too. He would be no good to anyone until he got it, and neither would Sean.</p><p>He looked at his watch. Late afternoon. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that wherever Callie is now, she\u2019s lying low and resting. If she\u2019s singing, she\u2019ll likely be doing it at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Since that will be her first choice of jobs, rather than serving food on her feet all the time, let\u2019s go with the idea that she\u2019s not working right now. After a nap, you and I will meet up again. Six sound good?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t want to pause, but they both needed to be sharp. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>In silence, they walked to a cheap hotel nearby and secured a couple of rooms. The place was decent but older, took cash, and didn\u2019t ask many questions since they\u2019d paid for a week in advance. It was hardly the Ritz, and he couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>Once inside, Thorpe made a few more phone calls, one to Xander, who hooked him up with Javier. Carefully, he asked questions about Daniel Howe without mentioning Callie herself. The elder Santiago brother had been in the defense contracting business for over a decade, but he\u2019d never heard anything about Callie\u2019s father dipping his toe in that water, financing such a venture, or hobnobbing with influential senators or military officials. Another dead fucking end.</p><p>Next door, he could hear Sean talking as well. Fuck, this place was musty and old. Normally, he\u2019d never stay here, and it broke his heart to think of Callie curled up someplace even dumpier than this.</p><p>Why had she run without talking to him at all? Had she truly believed that he didn\u2019t care enough to keep her safe?</p><p>With a tired sigh, he wedged himself into the small shower and tried to wash his funk away. No such luck. His mood was still crashing. He felt every single second that ticked by and started to picture the rest of his life without Callie. God, even the thought made him insane. No way he could do without her in his life. He\u2019d move mountains, part oceans, rip his own damn heart out of his chest to have her back.</p><p>But even if he did, he still wouldn\u2019t be the right man for her.</p><p>Stepping out of the shower, he wrapped a threadbare white towel around his waist and plodded over to his bed. Just as he sat in exhaustion to call himself every kind of dumbshit for letting her slip through his fingers, his phone rang. The number looked like Logan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHi. You got something for me?\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cYou sound fucking miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, Logan. I\u2019m in a rattrap with a splitting headache. I need sleep, and all I can think about is Callie out there, believing that she\u2019s totally alone. What if the military brass looking for her found her before we did? I don\u2019t even want to think it, but I don\u2019t know why they want her, where they would have taken her, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a breath, man,\u201d Logan cut in. \u201cCallie made it out of the airport in one piece. I just got off the phone with Elijah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Hope sprang inside him for a sweet moment.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Logan assured. \u201cHe found someone in airport security who was willing to let him view the footage of the terminal just after her flight landed. She came off the plane in different clothing, complete with a fake belly and somehow smaller boobs. No idea how she managed that. She\u2019d ditched the hat, donned a blond wig, put on a crap-ton of makeup and sunglasses. Elijah said it took him a few passes through the footage to spot her, but he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie managed to prepare for this trip, at least a little. Her resourcefulness shouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d But it sure relieved the fuck out of him. She\u2019d gotten away from her potentially dangerous enemy\u2014at least for now.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised, either. The Callie I knew only excelled at wanting her way and throwing a hissy until she got it. But I only saw the same bratty act she peddled to everyone else. You know the real woman.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe closed his eyes. He did, but it had taken a long while to learn her. After she\u2019d gotten a bit comfortable with him and Dominion, she\u2019d slowly let her guard down. She\u2019d let him in a bit more when she\u2019d laughed at his jokes, passed time with him on the sofa, or chatted with him when she couldn\u2019t sleep. Then again when she\u2019d had the flu, disagreed with him about her sometimes disrespectful behavior, or teased him about his \u201cstodgy\u201d music. And still more when he\u2019d bound her for demos, held her, kissed her . . . barely stopped himself from claiming her when she wasn\u2019t his. He had seen her heart and that\u2019s when he\u2019d fallen in love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she got away,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cClean,\u201d Logan confirmed. \u201cAfter stopping off at the first bathroom inside the terminal, she walked out no longer carrying her backpack. She\u2019d gotten a red duffel from somewhere. According to Elijah, she dragged it behind her and made her way toward the meet point in baggage claim. She intended to follow through with my plan. I can only guess that she took precautions on the plane just to be safe, then realized the man in uniform just outside the terminal was looking for her. She changed course and walked right past my buddy, then out the door. In the last frame of footage she\u2019s viewable, she\u2019s walking down the long line of taxis. No idea which one she eventually got in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So they couldn\u2019t track the vehicle.</p><p>Every word felt like a death knell to Thorpe\u2019s hopes of finding her again. \u201cGoddamn it, Logan. She\u2019s got to be terrified out of her mind. And I can\u2019t even fucking find her to help her. She\u2019s alone and worried, maybe even running out of money. Does she even know where she\u2019s going to sleep tonight? She might even be making plans to get out of Vegas now. And I\u2019m too clueless to help her. What kind of protector am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut yourself some slack. You\u2019ve done everything you can to find her. I\u2019m going to look for this military asswipe. Elijah is checking the airport security footage for a picture of him, so we can piece together who he is and why he wants Callie. If we get something, I\u2019ll send it your way. Elijah is local if you need more assistance in your search.\u201d Logan tried to sound both calm and reassuring. \u201cCallie is smart and she knows how to stay alive. We\u2019ll find her and bring her home.\u201d</p><p>As Thorpe hung up, he hoped that was true. The alternative was too horrific to contemplate.</p> <p>SEAN dragged his ass out of bed. He could have slept more. His body screamed for it, but Callie\u2019s face haunted him. The feel of her in his arms, the sounds of her saucy laughter in his ear, the haunting beauty of her expressive eyes locked with his as he filled her body . . . Shit, how had he gone on a simple baby-sitting mission and ended up in love?</p><p>For over a decade, he\u2019d been married to his job. He\u2019d lost a fianc\u00e9e once upon a time to his badge. He\u2019d lost touch with all his old pals, his cousins, and anyone who had once occupied his \u201cnormal\u201d life.</p><p>But in barely more than a handful of months, Callie had rewired his priorities. She mattered. She filled the half of him he hadn\u2019t even known was empty. She\u2019d resurrected him just by being her sweet, bratty, kind, unpredictable self. Damn it, he had to find her\u2014before someone with intentions between nebulous and nefarious did.</p><p>All through his blistering-hot shower, he groaned under the spray and tried to think of places he might look for his lovely. After he and Thorpe had caught a nap yesterday afternoon, they\u2019d resumed their search that evening, pounding the pavement and opening the door to nearly every casino, dive bar, and twenty-four-hour diner they could find within walking distance. At four a.m., they\u2019d finally agreed to pause again. He\u2019d told Thorpe he would work on a new plan, but the truth was, he was running out of ideas.</p><p>Where the hell could she be? Worry knotted his guts and pinged in his head like a pinball bouncing between bumpers, setting off one alarm bell after another.</p> <p>Thirty minutes later, Thorpe scooted into a booth across from him in the hotel\u2019s diner. Though dressed immaculately, the man didn\u2019t look any better rested than he felt.</p><p>\u201cAnything new from Logan or Elijah?\u201d Sean asked hopefully.</p><p>Thorpe answered with a grim shake of his head. \u201cNothing new since yesterday. Maybe Callie is on the Strip.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been over this mentally a thousand times in the last twenty-four hours. \u201cHighly unlikely. Anyone who\u2019d employ her down there would insist on having proper identification. Since Callie left her fake driver\u2019s license back in Dallas knowing we\u2019d track that name, she\u2019d have no use for it now. It\u2019s possible she has another alias, but she wouldn\u2019t keep it for long and she wouldn\u2019t have asked Logan for help if she felt secure in the identity. Besides, the video surveillance on the Strip will be far sharper and more sophisticated than anything in the older section of town. The security presence in joints up there is palpable. Callie wouldn\u2019t go there voluntarily. She\u2019s too smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Thorpe sighed tiredly, then absently thanked the waitress who took their orders and filled their coffee cups. \u201cSeems like we\u2019ve combed every inch of these streets. I don\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>The only places downtown left to search were the really unsavory and unpalatable. The dangerous haunts for the depraved and criminal element. But he kept that to himself. Thorpe already looked ready to lose it. The strain of being unable to locate Callie was wearing on him, too. If Sean had ever had any illusions about Thorpe\u2019s feelings, he didn\u2019t now. As much as he hated to admit it, the man genuinely loved her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a few more possibilities.\u201d Sean tried to shrug casually. \u201cYou get any sleep? It\u2019s going to be another long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI crashed for three hours. After that . . . off and on.\u201d He took a swig of coffee, wincing as the steaming brew hit his tongue. \u201cI kept having dreams about Callie needing help, being alone, crying. I couldn\u2019t take it. I know she\u2019s a very capable woman, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Sean shot him a rueful smile. \u201cI\u2019m in the same camp, man. I woke up wondering if I\u2019m crazy. How well do I know this girl? I know the person she showed me. I loved that woman. But is she the real Callie?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe paused for so long, Sean wasn\u2019t sure he intended to answer. \u201cI want like hell to lie to you and tell you that everything you saw was BS. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s best for her.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYeah, you saw the real Callie, especially that last night on the dungeon floor. She lowered her walls for you. With anyone else, she\u2019d gnaw her own arm off before trembling or showing vulnerability. She\u2019d avoid that kind of eye contact, and run screaming from that much . . . intimacy. She cared what you thought, how you felt. Her taking off probably doesn\u2019t say that to you, but I know Callie better than anyone else. Believe me, you saw her.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Sean understood one of the many things that ripped at Thorpe\u2019s guts. \u201cYou\u2019re not used to sharing that soft, secret side of her. You wanted it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>The big man across the table paused, froze, then crushed the empty plastic creamer container in his fist. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t have any other part of her, I was willing to accept that. Seeing her wanting to please someone else felt like a never-ending kick in the balls. But you\u2019re better for her, so . . .\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he should probably let that go. It was in his best interest to let Thorpe think he\u2019d ruin Callie or whatever bullshit trolled through his head. But the man had been brutally honest with him today, and they\u2019d been through too much in the last thirty-six hours for that crap. They weren\u2019t friends, but they shared a new respect forged in fire. Both of them knew bone deep that the other would do anything\u2014everything\u2014to keep Callie safe.</p><p>Sean swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad for Callie. She looks to you for so much\u2014comfort, security.\u201d He had to force out the next truth. \u201cEven love. She wants you in her life. I\u2019m probably the interloper here.\u201d</p> <p>With a tight squeeze of his eyes, Thorpe blocked him out, looking as if he worked hard to hold himself together. \u201cI love her more than I believed myself capable of loving any woman. You have no idea how difficult it is for me to say that, but I feel compelled to confess since you called me a coward and rubbed my nose in my feelings like dog shit. I\u2019m painfully aware that Callie needs the tenderness you\u2019ve given her. I\u2019m not capable of it.\u201d He rubbed at his forehead. \u201cAsk my ex-wife, for starters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTenderness isn\u2019t all she needs.\u201d Sean prayed he had everything inside him she required to be whole. Nights at Dominion when he\u2019d wondered exactly how to give her boundaries that would both bind her to him and let her fly free . . . That\u2019s when he\u2019d felt unsure. That\u2019s when he\u2019d wondered if Thorpe was the better man for her.</p><p>\u201cOh, she needs a lot more.\u201d Thorpe snorted. \u201cStarting with a thorough paddling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d He picked up his coffee cup, and clinked it against Thorpe\u2019s, who still clutched his in hand.</p><p>They each took a sip and resorted to silence, as if this much getting along was unnerving.</p><p>Their food arrived, and Sean wasn\u2019t terribly hungry. By the way Thorpe pushed his eggs around his plate, it looked like the other man couldn\u2019t find his appetite, either. Still, they forced the meal down, knowing they\u2019d need the energy. Nothing was said about how long they would stay here and what they would do if Callie was still missing in a week, in a month . . . or longer. Sean wasn\u2019t about to give up, and he\u2019d bet his badge that Thorpe wasn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if it\u2019s good or bad that we haven\u2019t run into anyone in a uniform looking for Callie,\u201d Thorpe said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the same question, but I have to think it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she managed to leave the airport without a hitch, but how do we know someone hasn\u2019t already found Callie and . . .\u201d</p><p>Captured her? Killed her? Sean swallowed. Fuck, Thorpe was all but reading his mind. But he didn\u2019t want to voice any of those fears. \u201cWe just need to keep looking. Stay strong and be persistent. We have one thing going for us that no one else does.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe lifted miserable gray eyes to him, looking like the gloomiest day. \u201cWhat? Give me anything to feel good about.\u201d</p><p>Sean was no cheerleader, but in this case, he refused to believe anything except they\u2019d gotten a jump on the asshole hunting her down for one reason alone. \u201cCallie isn\u2019t just a case to either of us. She means something. Hell, everything. We know her desires, her habits, her secret yearnings. She can\u2019t bury all those parts of herself forever. When she needs . . .\u201d Sean nodded, willing Thorpe not to lose faith. \u201cWhen she comes up looking for a sense of home or connection or affection\u2014whatever\u2014we\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>But twelve hours later, he was losing hope. They\u2019d hit even the worst of the worst places downtown. Terrible, seedy, dirty, filled with the dregs of humanity. He couldn\u2019t picture Callie here. She\u2019d shine too bright, be too beautiful. No way she could hide here for long.</p><p>As they continued pounding the pavement, they stumbled across a motel with a blinking turquoise neon sign that proclaimed it Summer Wind. Given the fact that this was Vegas, it had to be a nod to one of Sinatra\u2019s classic tunes, but its faded fa\u00e7ade made Thorpe stop in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cCallie\u2019s favorite season,\u201d Thorpe murmured.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Summer\u2019 was her safe word, too.\u201d Sean swallowed, hope brimming.</p><p>Thorpe zipped a sharp stare in his direction. The knowledge looked like it hit the big Dom right in the gut. \u201cIt fits. We have to look here.\u201d</p><p>It was a crapshoot, but Sean totally agreed.</p><p>The place looked beyond run-down. It had to be cheap. But it seemed like the first place in over twenty-four hours that made sense for Callie to have come.</p><p>He and Thorpe pushed their way inside. Wow, it was easily one of the crappiest motels he\u2019d ever seen. The windows hadn\u2019t been washed in the last two decades. In the lobby, the carpet beneath his feet was sticky. The air reeked of cigarettes, vomit, urine, and cheap disinfectant. Rent by the week or the hour\u2014apparently the management wasn\u2019t picky about how long anyone stayed as long as they paid.</p><p>Inside stood a woman who was probably in her late thirties but had lived so damn hard she\u2019d easily be mistaken for fifty. She lounged against a scarred white Formica countertop permanently stained yellow, wearing a thrift store castoff of a tank top that showed cleavage wrinkled from too much sun. The woman\u2019s lined lips wrapped around a slim smoke and she sucked in hard before blowing the smoke his way with a bored stare.</p><p>\u201cYou two looking for a room?\u201d Her voice rattled from her lungs. \u201cIf you need more than an hour for your \u2018business,\u2019 you might have to come back. We\u2019re pretty full up.\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Thorpe choked, looking ready to throttle the woman. He sliced her his most displeased Dom face. In seconds, the woman lowered her cigarette and stared at him warily.</p><p>Sean stepped between them, shooting Thorpe a glare that told him to be fucking reasonable. \u201cNo. We don\u2019t need a room to share. Or any room at all.\u201d He reached into the pocket of his trousers and pulled out his badge. \u201cFBI. I\u2019m looking for someone.\u201d</p><p>The bleach blonde with the gray roots looked ready to piss her pants. \u201cI swear I told Johnny to be careful who the hell he hired. Who is it, the new repairman? I suspected he might be a con man, but I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus, woman,\u201d Thorpe snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the questions. You will answer us precisely and honestly. You will not speak unless spoken to. If you\u2019re dishonest, we\u2019ll have problems, you and I. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>The woman gave a rattled bob of her head. \u201cUm . . . yeah.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe turned to him with a grim smile. \u201cProceed.\u201d</p><p>The situation wasn\u2019t funny, but Sean repressed the urge to grin. Thorpe had gotten the woman\u2019s attention, that was for sure. After a handful of words, she couldn\u2019t wait to give him a healthy dose of respect. He supposed Thorpe\u2019s commanding presence was one reason so many subs sought him as a Dominant. And it was probably one of the reasons Callie had latched on to him. Deep down, she needed to believe that someone watched over her, looked out for her, and would rein her in if she\u2019d gone too far. She ached to know that someone could save her if push came to shove. But Callie was so damn headstrong that whomever she turned to would have to truly exert his control before she\u2019d heed it. Thorpe would have no problem doing that. He\u2019d relish it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought niggled at his brain as he withdrew a recent picture he\u2019d printed of Callie, one he\u2019d clandestinely snapped on his phone at Dominion. She wore a little Mona Lisa smile, her full, rosy lips somehow taunting and affectionate at once, tempting him. Her eyes glittered with life and vitality. Her glossy black hair shone against her pale cheek. Inch after inch of the most unspoiled skin he\u2019d ever touched drew his stare all the way down to the hint of her cleavage. His memory supplied the rest\u2014sweet pink-berry nipples, flat belly, slender hips, sleek thighs, snug pussy. Sexual power in a petite dynamo of a female.</p><p>Thorpe nudged him. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>Pulled out of his musings, Sean nodded, then sat the image down on the counter in front of the desk clerk. He held his breath.</p><p>Her eyes flared with recognition, and she looked at him, suddenly in a hurry to be forthcoming. The apprehensive glance she slid Thorpe\u2019s way explained why. \u201cYeah, I know her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd? Go on. When did she check in?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago. Middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Bingo! \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was dragging a red duffel. I think she\u2019s a blonde now.\u201d</p><p>He and Thorpe exchanged a glance. She\u2019d disguised herself, as they\u2019d suspected. But his excitement was reflected in the other man\u2019s gray eyes. They were finally getting a lead on Callie. Sean\u2019s heart pumped. His skin tingled. Hell, even his cock engorged. Instinct told him they were close.</p> <p>Thorpe braced his hands on the counter with deceptive calm. He stood tall and imposing. His mood stretched tighter than wire suspending a bridge. The woman\u2019s jaw went slack as she stared up at him, blinking so rapidly, Sean was surprised her false eyelashes didn\u2019t take flight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell us everything you remember,\u201d Thorpe commanded. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The woman bobbed her head again. \u201cSh-she asked for a corner room near the stairs. I happened to have it. She asked about a place to eat and somewhere to find work. I sent her across the street to the diner.\u201d</p><p>The one that had seen better days decades ago and had a collection of homeless drunks littering the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s waitressing there?\u201d Thorpe barked.</p><p>\u201cN-no. My cousin Marty runs a club about two blocks down and he\u2019s always looking for pretty girls, so I sent her there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she go?\u201d The Dom\u2019s voice dripped ice.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s working until two a.m. Marty . . . um, called me to thank me about an hour ago. After less than three shifts, she\u2019s already a customer favorite. He called her a gold mine.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe gritted his teeth, and Sean could only imagine what was running through the man\u2019s head. Probably the same what-the-fuck thoughts dashing through his own.</p><p>\u201cThe name of the club?\u201d Thorpe wasn\u2019t sounding any warmer.</p><p>The brassy blonde swallowed and stared up, almost pleading silently for Thorpe\u2019s leniency. \u201cG-glitter Girls. Go out the door, take a right and head\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck kind of place is that?\u201d Thorpe cut in with a growl.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly where it is.\u201d Sean discreetly elbowed the Dom as he smiled at the clerk. \u201cWhat\u2019s her room number?\u201d</p><p>She focused on him and softened. Sean shoved down his fury to send her a gently encouraging expression. If good cop-bad cop worked, he was all for it.</p> <p>\u201cTwo-seventeen,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOut the door, to the left, then up the stairs. It\u2019s right at the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKey.\u201d Sean held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m really not supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thorpe raised a menacing brow, promising retribution if she continued to protest. The woman jumped to action, reaching under the desk with trembling fingers to extract a key. She dropped it in Sean\u2019s hand, then cut her gaze to Thorpe, her eyes pleading for approval.</p><p>\u201cIs her room paid?\u201d the Dom demanded.</p><p>\u201cThrough tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Damn, had Callie intended to skip town in another twenty-four hours or less?</p><p>\u201cVery good. You can consider her room vacant in the next hour.\u201d The smile Thorpe bestowed on her then was brilliant, praising as he tapped her chin gently. \u201cThank you for your help . . . Your name?\u201d</p><p>She lapped up that smile like a kitten with fresh milk. \u201cDoreen. Sir.\u201d</p><p>If anything, Thorpe\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very helpful, sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d she breathed with a wobbly smile.</p><p>Sean tried to hold in his astonishment. Instead, he leaned across the counter to the clerk and slapped a hundred-dollar bill on the counter between them. \u201cAnd you never saw us, Doreen.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him blankly, then back over to Thorpe. All the man did was send her an expectant stare, and she nodded vigorously. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Sean palmed the key and turned to Thorpe, still holding the woman all but hypnotized. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>THORPE turned to him as they made their way out of the motel\u2019s disgusting lobby and headed for the Jeep. \u201cSo where\u2019s this club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. We\u2019ve got to clear her room first.\u201d Sean inclined his head toward the stairs to the upper level of the joint.</p><p>\u201cFuck whatever\u2019s in her room. We need to get to Glitter Girls now, before she gets away again.\u201d</p><p>Sean glanced at his watch. \u201cI want to reach her, too. You know that. It\u2019s not quite one, and she\u2019s working until two, so we\u2019ve got some time. But we can\u2019t leave behind any trace of Callie that anyone looking for her could find. If there\u2019s no trail, there are fewer followers.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe gritted his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either, but what are our other choices?\u201d</p><p>It annoyed him, but Sean had a point. Thorpe conceded with a sigh. \u201cAll right. The good news is, it will probably take five minutes or less since Callie won\u2019t have spread her stuff out. Hell, she was with me nearly three months before she put anything in a drawer.\u201d</p><p>Sean stared at the upper story of the motel as the chilly desert wind whipped through his light jacket. \u201cLet\u2019s make this quick.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Thorpe followed Sean and darted for the stairs, taking them two at a time until he reached the cracked cement level. The rusted railing had once been painted a bright blue, but had faded and chipped over time. The blue drapes with their blackout backing in each of the room\u2019s filthy windows looked dirty enough to be a breeding ground for bacteria and insect eggs. A few doors down, a man and a woman were arguing at the top of their lungs. In the distance, a gunshot sounded, then tires screeched.</p><p>Thorpe knew why Callie had chosen this place, but he still wondered what the hell she was doing here. There had to be someplace else out of the way that wasn\u2019t quite so ghetto-gutter.</p><p>In the moonlight, he approached the first door at the top of the stairs and barely made out the tarnished brass numbers.</p><p>\u201cCallie chose the corner room, the one with stairs in either direction,\u201d Sean commented.</p><p>\u201cObviously, she\u2019d scoped the place out in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever, clever girl.\u201d</p><p>As they charged toward the room in question, Thorpe tossed him a nod. \u201cYou know she is. Don\u2019t underestimate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sean shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve made that mistake for the last time.\u201d</p><p>They hit the door, and Sean shoved the key into the lock, then pushed it open. As soon as he did, Thorpe squeezed past him and flipped on the light. He wished he hadn\u2019t. The carpet looked some indiscriminate color that might have been beige once. The walls were covered in faded oak paneling. The ceiling showed signs of water damage. A dilapidated swamp cooler controlled the room\u2019s temperature\u2014sort of. The drapes were a faded blue floral that would make even a great-grandmother cringe. The bedspread was a cheap polyester imitation of polka-dotted and zigzagged stripes. The light fixture in the bathroom was minus its decorative cover. A roach crawled across the wall above the mussed, unmade bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat a fucking dump.\u201d Sean stared around the room in stupefied horror.</p><p>\u201cThis is the way she lived before she came to me,\u201d Thorpe said with a hollow voice.</p><p>\u201cI knew that on paper, but holy shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she go back to this after everything . . .\u201d Thorpe pressed his lips together, refusing to lose control of his anger\u2014or feel too hurt. \u201cWhen I get my hands on her, she won\u2019t sit for a week. And that\u2019s the beginning of what I\u2019ve got planned for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter make that two weeks. I have some ideas of my own.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shoved aside the fact that Sean hadn\u2019t objected to him spanking Callie. Yes, she\u2019d taken off her collar, but she hadn\u2019t discussed it with Sean, who probably didn\u2019t see their relationship as over. Thorpe knew that the girl would never belong to him, but he refused to let this behavior slide without putting in his two cents\u2014and then some.</p><p>Quickly, they searched the room. He found her backpack in the closet and grabbed it. There was no sign of the red duffel she\u2019d mysteriously acquired in the airport bathroom. She had nothing else personal anywhere in the room. Even her toothbrush had been stowed back in the appropriate plastic holder in a zippered pouch. The used bar of soap told him that she\u2019d taken a shower. Over the odor of mildew and stale cigarettes pervading the motel, he smelled a light trace of her.</p><p>As Callie\u2019s scent registered in his brain, boiling blood filled his cock. A caveman urge to grab her, bind her, and fuck her until she understood all the reasons she could never run away from him again seized Thorpe.</p><p>\u201cShe was here,\u201d Sean confirmed, sniffing the sheets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her stuff.\u201d He indicated to the pack slung over his shoulder.</p><p>Sean gave him a thumbs-up, then headed for the door. Thorpe followed, hot on his heels. Back in the lobby, he tossed the key to Doreen with a stern warning glance. The woman looked somewhere between breathless and ready to shit her pants when he left. She wouldn\u2019t talk without substantial incentive. Not a perfect solution for keeping Callie safe, but the best he could do now.</p><p>Back in the Jeep, Sean had started the engine and turned on the lights. Thorpe tossed Callie\u2019s backpack in and shut the passenger door as the other man threw the vehicle into reverse and peeled out of the parking lot.</p><p>The journey to Glitter Girls seemed like the longest two blocks of his life. When they reached the seedy dive bar, his worst fears were confirmed. The windows were covered up and painted the same color as the exterior walls. A big neon sign over the building advertised TOPLESS GIRLS! Thorpe swore.</p><p>It was a fucking strip joint. Callie better hope for her sake that she was merely waitressing.</p><p>The lowlife clientele slinking in seemed like a mixture of locals and tourists. They all looked as if they\u2019d served time. None of them appeared to take bathing too seriously.</p><p>As they reached the front door, a big bouncer stood grunting out a \u201crequest\u201d for the cover charge over the raucous music. Ten bucks with a two-drink minimum. The guys in front of them pulled out a big wad of cash he\u2019d bet they had obtained in less-than-legal ways.</p><p>As he and Sean each pulled out a bill and ran in the door, the smoke, stale beer, sweat, and glitter assailed him. Goddamn it, this place was the worst sort of dive.</p><p>On the sagging stage, someone named Whipped Cream, who wore two little pasties designed to look like her namesake, was taking her final bows. Her mother definitely hadn\u2019t given her that name\u2014or that shade of ruby-red hair. She didn\u2019t look like she had all her teeth.</p><p>The deejay sounded bored as he told the audience to give it up for the woman. The smattering of applause broke into chatter. A few bills littered the stage as Thorpe studied the girls serving drinks, hoping . . . But he didn\u2019t see any waitress who had Callie\u2019s face, build, or innate grace.</p><p>Fucking son of a bitch.</p><p>Sean looked around, too, obviously worried. \u201cWhere the hell did she get off to now?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t think Doreen would have been dumb enough to call her cousin and tell him to warn Callie. \u201cI\u2019m hoping she\u2019s in the restroom. Or getting someone a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s already become a customer favorite, I doubt she\u2019s serving drinks,\u201d Sean managed to growl out with his teeth grinding. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, she\u2019ll probably go on when the night\u2019s in full swing, toward the end of her shift.\u201d</p><p>In twenty minutes or less.</p><p>Damn it to hell, he was right. \u201cWe don\u2019t know her stage name, so we have no idea who to ask for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I barge into the back with my badge and drag her out of here.\u201d</p><p>The idea had merit. Thorpe looked around, trying to gauge what the management\u2019s reaction to having an FBI agent in their midst would be when a waitress came by for their drink orders. Truth told, he didn\u2019t want anything, but ordered a bourbon and water, knowing he wouldn\u2019t drink it. Sean asked for a vodka tonic, then motioned her down to him in a moment between the music. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering, pretty lass, if you\u2019d mind to give me a wee bit of information.\u201d Sean slipped into his Scottish accent and smiled at the acne-prone waitress, who looked barely legal and totally dazzled. The fed flashing a bit of cash sealed the deal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything. My bra size is a thirty-six D. They\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t, but Thorpe wasn\u2019t going to bother debating the girl\u2019s assets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right fetching, that\u2019s for sure. But I\u2019m inquiring about the new bit of fluff. For my friend here.\u201d Sean gestured to him.</p> <p>The waitress made a sour face and rolled her eyes. \u201cAll the customers are, like, totally insane over Juicy. It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s got a magical pussy.\u201d</p><p>Juicy?</p><p>Thorpe cast a glance over to Sean, who looked ready to disagree with the waitress, but he managed to force another smile onto his face. \u201cJuicy, you say? Tell me more. My friend is quite interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one is antisocial. She\u2019s pissed all the girls off. Whipped Cream and Sparkle Swallows both can\u2019t stand her. Two days here, and she\u2019s already got more fans than everyone else. Now if you two want nice . . .\u201d She smiled, showing off slightly bucked teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d Sean asked.</p> <p>\u201cBlond, blue-eyed, stacked.\u201d The girl sighed. \u201cBut she\u2019s not special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does she come on?\u201d</p><p>The waitress opened her mouth to answer, but the deejay\u2019s voice over the speakers drowned her out. \u201cShe\u2019s new. She\u2019s exciting. She\u2019s your wettest dream. Give it up for Juicy!\u201d</p><p>Sean stiffened, looking like his fury had climbed ten notches. Since Thorpe felt like strangling the deejay and killing everyone who stood between them and the stage, that suited him just fine.</p><p>And if Juicy and Callie were one and the same, slipping away unseen with the girl in tow had just become impossible.</p><p>The music cued, and Britney came on with some damn suggestive lyrics. Then the curtain parted, and out strutted the next act. Despite the bright lights glaring, all the makeup, and the skimpy costume, Thorpe knew instantly it was Callie.</p> <p>She definitely wasn\u2019t waitressing.</p><p>Tingles zipped down his spine. He itched to wrap his fingers in her silky hair. Even being in the same room with her made him titanium hard, so if he hadn\u2019t known in every other way that he\u2019d found Callie, his reaction made it damn obvious.</p><p>As he watched her onstage, the waitress stomped her foot and huffed off. He barely glanced at the other girl. Callie held him rapt as she gyrated for the crowd wearing a schoolgirl uniform, complete with a plaid skirt. Her blond wig hung in long pigtails. The whistling and catcalls ramped up, and she pasted on a come-hither smile. But her eyes . . . they didn\u2019t invite. Because he knew Callie, he could read that expression. She looked both unnerved and scared out of her mind.</p><p>Beside him, Sean cursed a blue streak and leaned forward, gaze drilling into her. Thorpe felt the man\u2019s displeasure. It mirrored his own. Rage bubbled and turned, and he knew that Callie would feel every inch of their disapproval the second they got their hands on her.</p><p>\u201cHer file doesn\u2019t indicate that she\u2019s ever stooped this low,\u201d Sean snarled.</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t take his eyes off her. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever been this desperate.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded grimly, and they watched her slowly reach for the top button of her blouse.</p><p>Tensing before she even had it undone, Thorpe wondered if he\u2019d survive the next three minutes. He fidgeted in his seat, eager to storm the stage, take her down, and let her feel the full measure of her consequences. \u201cWhat\u2019s the fucking plan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be better if we didn\u2019t make a scene,\u201d Sean bit out, gritting his teeth. \u201cBut the minute this music is over . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to grab her ass and haul her out of here. I\u2019m all over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was counting on it.\u201d</p><p>Callie slipped the top button free, then another, and a third. The seconds ticked by, one after the other, in a horrific show that slowly revealed her milky flesh and had all the men in the room shouting that they wanted something \u201cJuicy.\u201d Every muscle in Thorpe\u2019s body screamed at him to stop this travesty, even as his head silenced his inner Neanderthal and told him to keep his ass in his seat. They couldn\u2019t make a scene.</p><p>With a sexy little spin, Callie whirled away and let the white shirt slip off her shoulders. She looked back at the audience with an exaggerated wink. Even terrified, there was something unmistakably special about her. She had a sweet quality and a goodness that her difficult life hadn\u2019t killed. But the girl still exuded sex from the sparkle of her eyes and the pout of her glossy lips, all the way down to her swaying hips and pink-tipped toes peeking out from black patent stilettos. Denying just how much he wanted her wasn\u2019t possible anymore. He\u2019d never met a woman he couldn\u2019t resist\u2014until Callie. Thorpe feared that walking away from her again would be like trying to swim against a raging tidal wave.</p><p>To the beat of the music, Callie flipped up her illegally short skirt and flashed the audience her sinfully small thong\u2014and her ass cheeks\u2014before the plaid fell softly over her backside again. The whooping and whistles revved up. A bouncer nearby stood mutely and watched.</p><p>\u201cShow us your tits!\u201d someone near the stage shouted.</p><p>\u201cGimme a piece of that luscious ass,\u201d another demanded.</p><p>The idea that these dregs now had Callie in their spank bank made him feel somewhere between nauseated and homicidal.</p><p>\u201cDamn it all.\u201d Sean gripped the table, looking ready to combust. \u201cThis three minutes is taking for fucking ever.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cIt will end.\u201d It had to.</p><p>But would it before they lost their minds? He wasn\u2019t sure about that, especially when the shirt slipped from the crooks of her elbows and onto the buckled stage, leaving her top half clad in nothing but a nearly sheer lace bra. When she turned back to the audience, there was no mistaking the pinkish cast of her plump nipples.</p><p>Callie arched her back, running her palms down her breasts, over her flat belly, then pressed her fingers toward her pussy. The audience started whooping at decibels near frat-party levels. Thorpe began to sweat. Jesus, he knew what her sweet pussy tasted like, and his mouth watered for another chance to make a meal out of her. Of course, every man in this room wanted that opportunity. One started pounding on the stage. Others joined in, slamming the wooden surface to the beat of the music, demanding more of her.</p><p>Fuck, this was getting out of control, and it took everything Thorpe had to stay in his seat.</p><p>A man in a cheap suit with a pimp moustache and a shaved head crowded closer. He thought he was the shit, clearly. With a confident leer, he leaned across the corner of the stage, holding up a hundred-dollar bill. He said something to Callie that Thorpe couldn\u2019t hear over the music. Her eyes widened. More disquiet filled her face, but she danced in the dude\u2019s direction.</p><p>With a shimmy, she lifted her skirt in front of him and circled her hips, spinning around until she backed up to him. Then she crouched, wiggling her ass seductively in his face. Her eyes slid shut. To anyone who didn\u2019t know her, she might look as if she were in the midst of passion, but Thorpe saw differently. He had no doubt her skin was crawling and she was barely resisting the urge to run like hell.</p><p>Just because she wasn\u2019t enjoying herself, however, didn\u2019t mean she was going to escape punishment. She had a protector and a Dom, both of whom would do anything to help her. Had she trusted either of them? No. She\u2019d just left. Sean, he sort of understood. Hell, Thorpe hadn\u2019t trusted the man himself until . . . what? Maybe yesterday. Or the day before. His days were running together. But Callie had known him for four fucking years. In all that time, she hadn\u2019t learned that he cared, that he would do anything to help her?</p><p>She was damn well going to learn now.</p><p>Obviously, she had panicked. He understood that\u2014to a point. But he refused to accept excuses from Callie. She was going to learn to rely on the men who loved her. Whatever happened next, whether he never got to lay another hand on her after her punishment tonight, he would teach her once and for all to look to him if she ever found herself in trouble again.</p><p>The slime ball with the skinny black tie and the C-note in his hand shoved the bill into the back of her thong\u2014then copped a long caress of her ass. With the other hand, he brushed his way up her thigh, looking at her like she was a particularly prime cut of filet.</p><p>Thorpe felt steam coming from his ears and fucking lost it.</p><p>As he jumped to his feet, Sean was right beside him, fists clenched. Thorpe kicked his chair out of the way and prowled toward Callie, shoulder to shoulder with the other man.</p><p>Callie leaned away from the letch feeling her up, cringing back. Trying to cover her reaction, she sent the man a little smile over her shoulder, then danced away. Thorpe felt his fists tighten with the need to beat the fucker to death.</p><p>Sean was faster, grabbing the son of a bitch by the back of the neck and snarling something in his ear. The thug tried to fight back, but the fed proved himself all kind of badass, blocking the guy\u2019s every move, then slamming the creep face-first onto a nearby post. Thorpe raced over, more than happy to help. He was gratified when Sean yanked the skunk back to reveal a broken, bleeding nose. In fact, he hoped Sean had done permanent damage to the asshole for daring to touch Callie.</p><p>Frantically Thorpe looked for her again. And he found her, damn it. Her trim back and undulating spine told him she now courted the men on the other side of the room, still holding her skirt up and wriggling her hips until a few more men shoved more bills in the string of her thong. They howled as she enticed them, and more guys approached the stage with money in fists, just wanting the chance to get close to Callie.</p><p>While Thorpe had been distracted by her, Sean and the letch got into a scuffle. Apparently, the fed had been busier watching Callie than the greaseball\u2019s elbow to his gut. As Sean grunted and dodged the guy\u2019s flailing fists, Thorpe approached. So did the bouncer.</p><p>\u201cNo fighting,\u201d he shouted over the music. \u201cTake it outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, get your fucking hands off me, prick!\u201d said cheap suit. \u201cI gave the pretty slut some money. So what?\u201d</p><p>Oh, that was it. Doms sometimes called their submissives \u201cslut,\u201d but as a form of endearment, however odd that seemed to others. Not everyone understood, but that was true of the whole lifestyle. Even if he would never call Callie his slut, no other random dick was going to malign the girl when he didn\u2019t know her at all and had no idea how far from the truth that was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her again.\u201d Sean looked ready to kill.</p><p>\u201cGet over it,\u201d the lowlife ranted on. \u201cYou don\u2019t own her.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Sean tossed back, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe threw a punch, hitting the fuckwad square in the jaw and sending him reeling to the ground with the force of the blow, out cold. The bouncer turned to him with a menacing glare and reached to throw him out the door.</p><p>Fuck, he should have held his temper. He couldn\u2019t afford to get tossed out.</p><p>Thorpe turned back to Callie. She whipped her gaze in his direction to decipher the commotion. Their gazes connected, and electricity fired his veins. Shock widened her eyes and bleached the color from her cheeks. Then her gaze zipped over to Sean. She gasped as if she\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><p>Despite the fact that she hadn\u2019t finished her number and the music still played, she turned and darted for the curtain and the back of the club.</p><p>The bouncer rightly put keeping the talent working above restraining a few guys from fighting, so he ran after Callie, catching her in his beefy grip just before she could slip backstage.</p><p>She struggled and cursed, demanding to be let free as the crowd collectively booed her retreat.</p><p>\u201cShow us your tits!\u201d repeated a man in the front row with a one-track mind.</p><p>The bouncer dragged Callie back toward mid-stage, then stood between her and the curtain. \u201cFinish your damn number or Marty is gonna fire your ass.\u201d</p><p>Predictably, the moment the big beefcake released her, she made another run for it, this time darting for the stairs that led to the club floor. She valued her freedom way more than this piss-ass job.</p><p>But Thorpe was one step ahead of her. He stood at the bottom of the stairs, blocking her exit off the stage. And in those shoes, jumping down five feet to the ground would be impossible.</p><p>They had her surrounded.</p><p>Sean quickly assessed the situation, then leapt onto the stage and reached into his pocket to flash his badge to the hunk of beefcake. \u201cFBI. Unless you want trouble, give the girl to me.\u201d</p><p>The big guy stiffened as the music screeched to a stop, his eyes narrowing as he took in Sean, then his badge. He stepped back and tossed his hands in the air. \u201cWe just hired her, man. We don\u2019t want any trouble. Take her.\u201d</p><p>Callie tossed Sean a defiant glower and over the din of the crowd, she warned, \u201cYou stay away from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot going to happen, lovely.\u201d The words were a vow, spoken as Sean prowled closer, but his expression was pure warning. He meant to assert his will.</p><p>She froze, then her gaze darted around the room. Thorpe\u2019s gut knotted. Goddamn it, she was going to make a run for it.</p><p>He opened his mouth to warn Sean, but she was quicker, taking off one of her wicked shoes and tossing it in Sean\u2019s direction. Callie\u2019s makeshift weapon smacked him in the shoulder, then she planted her hand on his chest and shoved him off balance. While Sean scrambled to right himself, she tore off the other stiletto and raised it menacingly at the bouncer. He charged her and grabbed her wrist, clamping down harshly to stop her from pelting him. So she kicked him in the balls.</p><p>As the incredibly stupid hulk dropped to his knees, he clutched his genitals and groaned. Callie sprinted past him and through the curtain, disappearing backstage.</p> <p>Thorpe darted up the stairs after her, tearing past the drape in time to see her shove the weathered industrial back door open and race into the alley behind the building. He swore and took off after her.</p><p>The metal door was swinging shut, and Thorpe pushed it open, then hit the alley. Under the spotlight of a bug-infested bulb, he looked left, then right before he caught sight of Callie dashing away on her bare feet in a fevered panic, artificial blond pigtails swinging against her pale back only saved from bareness by the strap of that tiny, sexy bra. Damn it, she was either begging to step on glass or be raped by some criminal in the shadows. Of course, she was in full flight mode and not using all her logic, but what the hell was she thinking?</p><p>One thing became immediately clear: Callie was younger and surprisingly fast. But if he let her through his grasp again, he\u2019d be fucked seven ways from Sunday.</p><p>He charged after her as fast as his stride would take him, rapidly gaining ground on the barefoot girl. She was about to reach the end of the alley, which didn\u2019t worry him . . . until a taxi rolled by. Of all the rotten fucking luck.</p><p>Somehow, he had to stop Callie. On feet, he wouldn\u2019t catch her in time. Neither would Sean, whom he could hear chugging down the pavement behind him. Once Callie made it inside that taxi, Thorpe knew she\u2019d be gone forever. She\u2019d definitely be taking his heart with her. And Sean\u2019s. Motherfucker.</p> <p>Between the lights of other businesses and the moon, he could see that the alley was blessedly empty. So he did the one thing he thought might stop the panicked girl in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cCallindra Alexis Howe, stop and look at me this instant.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>WHEN Callie heard Thorpe shout her real name, her heart screeched to a stop. He knew? She turned, still backing away, tangled up in his gray eyes. How? When? What had given her away?</p><p>Damn it, his life had just become twenty times more complicated\u2014and dangerous. She didn\u2019t want that for him.</p><p>Stricken, she shook her head, struggling to take in air. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s not me.\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe approached her in long, determined steps, his face granite, his hand outstretched. Behind him, Sean, that deceitful snake, charged toward her like a train with a headful of steam. She spun around and darted away again. What the hell was he doing here? With Thorpe? She couldn\u2019t allow either of them to get their hands on her.</p><p>Callie raced for the cab fifty feet away, still idling at the corner and waiting for the light to turn green. Dressed only in a bra and a little short skirt, she could probably get his attention. Maybe. In this neighborhood, maybe not. Good thing she had money in her thong. She\u2019d have to pick up her \u201cgo\u201d bag at the motel, lay low for a while, then find a bus station . . .</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me,\u201d Thorpe shouted out to her. \u201cAnd don\u2019t run!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe Sean,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat nick on your left hip came from a bullet, delivered when your family\u2019s killer shot at you. I felt it with my own fucking fingers.\u201d</p><p>Two Decembers ago, when he\u2019d touched her intimately. That explained so much, like why after so many passionate kisses, each an exquisite promise, he\u2019d walked away without a word and left her aching. And why he\u2019d cut off nearly all romantic or sexual contact since.</p><p>For the past two years, Thorpe had never even hinted that he knew the truth. And despite the stupidly huge bounty on her head, he had never turned her in, either.</p><p>Sean would the moment she stood still. She\u2019d seen his badge at Glitter Girls. Obviously, she\u2019d been wrong about him. He might not be an assassin trying to kill her or a bounty hunter out for a quick payday, but he\u2019d damn sure arrest her the first chance he got.</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d Thorpe thundered.</p><p>His footsteps drew closer and closer, but she didn\u2019t dare heed his words. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>At the iron resolve in his tone, Callie\u2019s heart roared harder. She glanced over her shoulder. Sure enough, he was closing in\u2014fast. And now, Sean was nowhere in sight. It didn\u2019t matter. She was nearly to the taxi . . .</p><p>With maybe ten steps to go, she landed on a rock. It gouged her heel, slicing the skin open. The sting screamed up her leg. She tried not to let the pain stop her, but when she slammed that foot down on the asphalt again, the pebble embedded deeper in her skin. The sharp ache nearly made her crumple to the ground. She slowed, hobbled, until Thorpe was nearly on top of her.</p><p>Panicked, Callie opened her mouth to scream to the taxi driver\u2014to anyone who would listen. Sean jumped out from behind a Dumpster and clamped one arm around her waist like a vise. The other he bracketed over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he panted.</p><p>His breath was warm on her face, his body like a furnace against her chilled skin, now sheened with perspiration. Her senses registered succor and safety. They wanted to melt into him. They yearned for his gentle touch, his fiery kiss . . .</p><p>Every one of which had been a lie.</p><p>Her brain screeched that she should pry herself away and run. Callie bucked wildly so she could free her mouth and tell Sean to go to hell. But he held tight. Thorpe blanketed her back, bracing his hands on her hips. She tried to stand strong and defiant, but he wrapped his suit coat around her shoulders both to warm and immobilize her. Immediately, the garment steeped her in his body heat. Their hot breaths caressed her skin. Their heady masculine scents swirled together as their taut bodies surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Thorpe growled. \u201cYou\u2019re in enough trouble as it is.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at those words. Then, mere feet in front of her, the taxi dashed away, taking with it her only avenue of escape.</p><p>Finally, Sean slowly drew his hand away from her lips, staring down at her with blue eyes, piercing her despite the crappy lighting and shadows. She steeled her heart against his once beloved face. She\u2019d always associated him with patience and gentle care. Now she knew he was a con artist with a badge, callous enough to steal her heart just to bring her in.</p><p>\u201cTake your fucking hands off me.\u201d</p><p>Face tightening with displeasure, Sean narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cLooking to add to your punishment, lovely? I don\u2019t recommend it. Your ass is already going to be sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your former fake accent can go eat shit. I took my collar off, so you have no business touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not precisely how it works, Callie, and you know it,\u201d Thorpe murmured in her ear.</p><p>She turned her head to the man she\u2019d once trusted and loved above all others. \u201cYou\u2019re on his side now? I never imagined that you\u2019d be gullible enough to fall for his lines, too.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Thorpe leaned around to look at Sean. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any reasoning with her in the next ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sean grunted. \u201cOr in the next millennium, I imagine. This isn\u2019t a smart place to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with her. I\u2019ll bring the car.\u201d</p><p>She could all but feel Thorpe smile. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she doesn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s jaw dropped. When the hell had they gotten so chummy? And why did Thorpe trust the liar?</p><p>With her head still reeling, Sean jogged off. She struggled against Thorpe\u2019s grip, holding out hope that another taxi would zoom by. But even if she was lucky enough for that, she didn\u2019t think she could outrun him with her foot smarting.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you helping that rat?\u201d She\u2019d always believed that Thorpe would be on her side, and knowing otherwise felt as if someone had pried her heart from her chest with a crowbar. \u201cHe wants to see me in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean wants to protect you, pet. Just like I do. Don\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask any questions before you jumped to conclusions. You just ran away. And you were dead wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fooled you like he fooled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d wanted to arrest you, he could have done it anytime over the last seven months,\u201d Thorpe reasoned. \u201cHe could have brought in a small army of agents and let them haul you out. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop them. If you think he\u2019s in an all-fired hurry to lock you up and throw away the key, ask yourself why he hasn\u2019t already done it.\u201d</p><p>Callie tried. There was logic in what Thorpe was saying, but she\u2019d been running for so long. Her flight response was so ingrained. Panic still pumped through her system. The thought niggled in the back of her head . . . What if Thorpe was wrong?</p><p>\u201cPet.\u201d His low voice soothed. \u201cThink about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he tell me he was some sort of agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you would have run immediately if you\u2019d discovered he was FBI. We all know that, especially Sean. You don\u2019t trust well, Callie, and we understand the reasons. But things are going to change now. Neither of us will ever risk you. If we haven\u2019t turned you in for two million dollars yet, we\u2019re not likely to.\u201d</p><p>Headlights bobbed up the worn alley before a silver Jeep she didn\u2019t recognize stopped beside them. Sean stuck his head out the window. \u201cSomeone already called the police. They\u2019re two blocks over. Get in.\u201d</p><p>As Callie\u2019s blood ran cold, Thorpe cursed and shoved her toward the vehicle. She dug in her heels.</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d Thorpe growled. \u201cGet in the fucking car.\u201d</p><p>She probably stood a better chance of eluding the local police than the FBI. She might be able to convince the Vegas PD that she was the victim of some random attack in this alley. It was possible they\u2019d release her before they figured out who she was, and she\u2019d be long gone before the truth hit them.</p><p>But that would leave Thorpe . . . where? In jail? And what about Sean? If he really wasn\u2019t trying to turn her in for the cash or a pat on the back at work . . . The implications were staggering. Would the police think the guys had kidnapped her or something? What if they couldn\u2019t get away? What if she couldn\u2019t? A million thoughts raced through her head, and she couldn\u2019t quite grasp any of them. On the one hand, she\u2019d relied on herself for so long, she didn\u2019t really know how to relinquish her control. On the other hand, as Thorpe had pointed out, they hadn\u2019t given her up or let anyone haul her away, so why would they start now?</p><p>Crap, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Callie,\u201d Sean stared at her through the driver\u2019s side window. He held out one hand to her, his earnest expression willing her to believe him. \u201cWhatever you think, I swear that I\u2019m not here now because of my job. I would do anything to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>His words made her melt a little more than they should. Gawd, she wanted to believe him so badly. If she was wrong and she climbed into that SUV, it could mean the end of her freedom. She hadn\u2019t managed to elude capture for this long because she made decisions with her heart.</p><p>A shout from Glitter Girls\u2019 parking lot had her head zipping around and her gaze trying to penetrate the dark and distance. Thorpe, however, just lost his patience.</p><p>With a grunt, he picked her up, yanked open the door to the backseat, and tossed her in. She braced herself on the leather bench, scrambling to the far side of the SUV as Thorpe jumped in and slammed the door.</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t like any of this\u2014too sudden, no time to think. She didn\u2019t run off with other people. She\u2019d managed to escape the fateful night her family had been killed and she was still alive today because she\u2019d stayed one step ahead of the cops and killers after her. She wasn\u2019t about to drag Thorpe through the mud. And she was still on the fence about whether to believe Sean.</p><p>Lunging for the passenger door on the far side of the car, Callie grabbed the handle, preparing to tumble out into the chilly November evening again and dash the distance to . . . somewhere. Wherever Thorpe and Sean weren\u2019t.</p><p>Sean merely locked the doors to the car, killed the headlights, then rocketed into the night. At the first corner, he flipped on the headlights again and merged into traffic, blending in with every other car chasing Lady Luck on the Vegas streets.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d she shrieked at Thorpe. \u201cDo you understand what will happen if the authorities find out that you\u2019re knowingly aiding a fugitive\u2019s escape? It was one thing when you could say I lied to you. Then you could have been the victim. Then you wouldn\u2019t have gone to jail.\u201d She glared at Sean in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not going to arrest me, do you realize that you could lose your job? What the hell are you two doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to take this one?\u201d Sean looked at his new \u201cpal\u201d in the rearview mirror. \u201cI need to make sure we\u2019re not being followed and try to decide where we can go from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I have a feeling our time is short. Did you already pack up everything in your room and put your belongings in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat makes two of us. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded at him, then turned to her with a Dom glower so menacing she found herself inching back until the car door ensured that she had nowhere else to go.</p><p>Callie gulped. \u201cWhat? I-I took care of myself. I couldn\u2019t very well expect the two of you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe reasonably concerned human beings who wanted to keep you happy and safe? Talk to the two men who will always put your welfare above everything else?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he was determined to make her feel somewhere between stupid and irresponsible. \u201cSean was a liar. How was I supposed to know he wouldn\u2019t turn me in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the subterfuge, lovely. But I had to create a cover to get into the club and keep everyone from getting suspicious, especially you.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t she feel like an idiot for falling for it\u2014and him? \u201cGreat job, Mr. Kirkpatrick. You had me fooled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackenzie,\u201d he corrected. \u201cSean Mackenzie is my real name. Here.\u201d He passed her a little leather case. She flipped it over as he turned on the interior light.</p><p>Callie clutched the document in her hand and read it with a sense of something between OMG and holy shit. It was true. Sean Mackenzie truly was a Special Agent for the FBI. She passed his credentials back with numb fingers. He grabbed it and killed the interior light.</p><p>Then darkness settled around her, leaving her to battle her thoughts again. Holy shit finally beat out OMG as her final reaction. And anger that she\u2019d been duped. Apparently he\u2019d done it without much difficulty and probably even less regret.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s why you were able to give Axel a black eye.\u201d What else was there to say?</p> <p>\u201cI taught hand-to-hand combat for the bureau for two years.\u201d</p><p>Which meant that he was damn good at it. And here she\u2019d thought he didn\u2019t have a violent bone in his body. Callie snorted. That proved she had almost no clue about him. In fact, there were probably a thousand other facts about Sean Kirkpatrick\u2014or Mackenzie, rather\u2014that she didn\u2019t know. \u201cWho are you? Obviously, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d His voice was so soft, compelling her to believe him. \u201cEverything except my name and occupation was the real me. I never lied about how I felt.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe him. But the truth was, she\u2019d fallen for a charming smile, a fake brogue, and a whole lot of smooth lines. If his tenderness and caring had seemed like more, well . . . wasn\u2019t that the point of winning her trust and breaking her barriers down? \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than \u2018whatever,\u2019 Callie. I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if finding out that Sean wasn\u2019t who he claimed, that doesn\u2019t excuse you for running off without talking to me, pet,\u201d Thorpe jumped in. \u201cWhat\u2019s your justification there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you knew who I was, so I tried to keep you from this mess. Was I supposed to guess that you cared about me?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought it possible, but his face became even more forbidding. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever say that to me again. I sheltered you for four years, Callie. I tried to teach you, help you, comfort you. What part of that indicated to you that I didn\u2019t give a shit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew you cared as a friend, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2014\u201d She tried to untangle her thoughts as he leaned across the seat toward her. \u201cThe night you . . . that it seemed like we were going to . . . you know.\u201d She still hated thinking about that humiliating event. \u201cThen you just walked away and never explained, never touched me again, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t fuck you, you imagined that I didn\u2019t care anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much, yeah.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI might have believed that a lover would go out on a limb for me, but not merely a boss or a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many things wrong with that statement.\u201d Thorpe cursed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cBeing your lover clearly didn\u2019t give me any extra perks in the trust department,\u201d Sean piped up from the front seat. \u201cIn fact, I think you gave me even less than Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Callie defended hotly. \u201cEverything between us was pretense and bullshit. Don\u2019t try to convince me that I\u2019ve wronged you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not telling his superiors that you\u2019ve run or that his cover is blown because he\u2019s trying to minimize the chances that the FBI will suddenly want you brought in.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that was true. Even if it was, she wasn\u2019t ready to be less angry. No, hurt. Damn it. \u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to thank you for your kind lies? Was it difficult to get hard on command? Was fucking me a chore?\u201d</p><p>Sean slapped his palm against the steering wheel. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019ve had enough. Thorpe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d he assured the other man. \u201cWe\u2019re done with your lack of trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your bratty mouth,\u201d Sean added. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Thorpe agreed. \u201cYou will apologize this instant to both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell! You two don\u2019t like the way I communicate. Guess what? Your style sucks, too. You lie.\u201d She pointed at Sean, then turned her stare on Thorpe. \u201cAnd you clam up.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe grabbed her by the arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve refused to rely on the men determined to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for help,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve refused to apologize, and you\u2019ve insulted us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou insulted me, too. Because I\u2019m going to defend myself, I\u2019m bratty?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one slinging words around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have lied, lovely, but I didn\u2019t drug you,\u201d Sean reminded darkly.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us stripped for a room full of scum. And it was your third shift in two days?\u201d Thorpe raised an intimidating brow at her.</p><p>A gong of foreboding resounded in her gut. Shit, they\u2019d done their legwork. Sometimes, she lost her temper and forgot important details . . . like being at the mercy of two pissed off Doms. Of course, Thorpe probably wouldn\u2019t punish her. In fact, he\u2019d probably never touch her again. But he\u2019d sure give Sean lots of craptastic ideas about how to do it effectively.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t enjoying myself. I was making money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo skip town, right?\u201d Thorpe\u2019s question was sharp as a blade.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong with driving us out of our fucking minds,\u201d Sean growled.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t intended to be a personal affront!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cSo we were supposed to shrug that you\u2019d left and move on with our lives. Do you know how worried we\u2019ve been?\u201d her former boss asked.</p><p>\u201cOh my gawd, you both sound like overprotective hens.\u201d</p><p>Callie braced for Thorpe\u2019s explosion. Instead, he drew in a bracing breath, nostrils flaring, then with a taut profile and rigidly controlled body, he directed his gaze to the front seat. \u201cSean, reasoning with her isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Go ahead. I need to focus here, but I\u2019ve had more than enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Minus the gloves?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI doubt anything less will register.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. It\u2019s bound to get noisy.\u201d</p><p>Sean smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019ll enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her in the mirror at the same time Thorpe regarded her with a frightening smile. Callie felt like an actress who\u2019d forgotten her lines, pinned by a spotlight.</p><p>\u201cApologize, pet.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a suggestion. But there was no way she was going to say \u201csorry\u201d for doing what she thought necessary. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if whatever I did upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Thorpe\u2019s grip on her arm tightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I misinterpreted your actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d His voice dropped to a silky baritone that served as its own warning. \u201cAnything you\u2019d like to say to Sean?\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s belly tightened, but she refused to lie. \u201cNo, I think that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s obvious we need to lay down a few rules and expectations.\u201d Thorpe settled against the backseat, legs braced wide, then grabbed her shoulders and gave a mighty jerk until she tumbled face down across his lap.</p><p>\u201cOh hell, no!\u201d She writhed, trying to twist upright again.</p><p>Like that was going to help. He\u2019d dealt with a thousand squirming submissives. There would be no escape. She already knew that from experience.</p><p>Expertly, he splayed a hand in the middle of her back, pinning her to his lap. \u201cHell, yes. It\u2019s past due, pet. You\u2019ve more than earned it. Your attitude needs serious adjusting.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe punctuated his assertion by lifting her little skirt, yanking the bills out of her thong and throwing them on the floorboard, then giving her right cheek a quick, blistering swat. Before she\u2019d even finished gasping, he spanked the left. Ouch! Her ass stung. Heat flared. And not for one second did she think that he was done.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on,\u201d he began, \u201cyou will keep uppermost in your mind that anything that affects you concerns us. We care. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Even if she was a little thrilled at the conviction in his words and more than a bit excited at the way he restrained and handled her, Callie wanted to tell him to jump off a bridge. She was about to say something satisfyingly dismissive when he smacked the flat of his hand against each of her cheeks again. A yelp slipped from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d A smirk resonated in his voice</p><p>Damn him!</p><p>\u201cYou will never leave our sight without proper permission. If you ever run away again without doing the courtesy of talking to us both, your ass will be a glowing shade of red for a month, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? \u201cI don\u2019t need babysitters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you could have gotten yourself molested in that terrible club or in the fucking alley behind it, if not for us, I\u2019m going to disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to speak.\u201d Thorpe\u2019s voice dropped another octave.</p><p>Another few swats to her backside had her flesh stinging again . . . and her pussy weeping. Why did Thorpe\u2019s discipline always turn her on? Why couldn\u2019t she hate him for it and tell him to go to hell?</p><p>\u201cAnd lovely? There will be no drugging anyone, no taking your clothes off for strangers, and absolutely no lying,\u201d Sean insisted from the front seat. His voice held a harsh, authoritarian edge she\u2019d never heard from him before.</p><p>\u201cIf you remove so much as a shoe in front of another man without our permission, you will feel my wrath.\u201d</p><p>And to prove his point, Thorpe rained a series of short, sharp blows down on her backside, one after the other. Callie couldn\u2019t stop the gasps, the moans. Her blood felt like it had caught fire. Her skin burned. Still, Thorpe kept at her ass, pounding one wallop after another on her vulnerable backside until she thought she would melt all over him. She barely reined in the urge to cry out in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Sean vowed. \u201cYou\u2019re likely to feel it as soon as I don\u2019t need to focus on the road, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t that something to look forward to?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give either of you permission to touch me,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cLousy attempt, pet,\u201d he tsked at her. \u201cYou just keep digging a deeper hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave him permission,\u201d Sean clarified. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if you think you removed your collar. We didn\u2019t talk about it. You decided without consulting me. Last time I checked, you weren\u2019t the Dominant in this relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous. I\u2019m not a possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re a submissive in need of a great deal of discipline. I have no problem giving it to you, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no problem either, Callie. I was too easy on you before. That\u2019s going to change,\u201d Sean promised.</p><p>Her heart lurched. They absolutely meant business, and a bit of her really wanted to let them take her under their wing and rely on them for her safety. If she wasn\u2019t Callindra Howe, she might dip her toe in the water. Okay, so she\u2019d probably dive in. But that wasn\u2019t her reality.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is! I only managed to stay free for nine years because I never got sentimental. I leave everything and everyone behind and sever all ties once I\u2019m gone. Thorpe, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d do everything possible to keep me safe. But I can\u2019t let you ruin your life. I left because I\u2019m trying to do the right thing so you can get back to normalcy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask you to throw yourself on the sword, lovely.\u201d Sean\u2019s voice softened before it hardened again. \u201cNeither did I. We won\u2019t let you cast either of us aside because you think it\u2019s \u2018safer.\u2019 What you\u2019re really doing is being stingy with your trust and protecting your heart. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor will I,\u201d Thorpe added. \u201cI might have been your boss and your friend, but you\u2019re lying to me and yourself if you think we weren\u2019t more.\u201d</p><p>Was he finally admitting there was something between them? Callie closed her eyes. What crappy timing . . .</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she tossed back. \u201cYou ignored it yourself for years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Her heated ass throbbed in the cool night, and she felt Thorpe\u2019s stare on her bare skin. The yearning nearly choked her, but this wasn\u2019t just about her. She couldn\u2019t stand to see them get sucked into the morass her life had become.</p><p>Callie figured she could play this one of two ways: either keep fighting tooth and nail and get her ass beat more for her defiance or give in until they let their guard down. Then she\u2019d run again. Sean hadn\u2019t asked her to throw herself on the sword, and well . . . she hadn\u2019t asked him for that either. If he really had been protecting her and was here against his orders, she couldn\u2019t let him jeopardize his job any more than she could risk being involved with an FBI agent. And she refused to gamble her heart on Thorpe, one of the most emotionally unavailable men she\u2019d ever met. No good would come from that.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>Above her, Thorpe stilled. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to praise your breakthrough or wail on your ass again for lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I know,\u201d Sean quipped.</p><p>\u201cI think I do, too. But time will tell. Just for good measure . . .\u201d Thorpe palmed the burning flesh of her backside, then spanked her again with unyielding discipline before jerking her skirt down and sitting her on the long seat beside him. \u201cBehave, pet.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted from the stinging burn making her skin tingle and couldn\u2019t sit still.</p><p>\u201cThorpe, is the naughty girl\u2019s pussy wet?\u201d</p><p>He zipped his gaze up toward Sean, who met it in the rearview mirror. No words were exchanged, but Thorpe must have seen what he wanted because he nodded and sat back with a little smile playing at the corners of his lips before he turned to her.</p><p>Callie\u2019s eyes widened. In what alternate universe was Sean going to let her former boss even think about her girl parts? Punishment was one thing, especially while he was driving, but . . . The thought of Thorpe\u2019s hand right where she ached for him most made her clit swell and sizzle. He turned and pinned her with a feral stare.</p> <p>She shook her head, knowing she looked more than a tad panicked. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>If he got near her, he\u2019d know she had just lied to him again. There would be more punishment. But the truth was too embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs and let me feel for myself, pet.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. She flipped her stare up to the rearview mirror, hoping to catch\u2019s Sean\u2019s disapproving scowl. Despite the spanking and his question, he wouldn\u2019t really let Thorpe touch her there, would he?</p><p>She did snag Sean\u2019s gaze, but he merely looked at her expectantly. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not patiently,\u201d Thorpe drawled.</p><p>Callie\u2019s heart started beating harder. Her silky thong was already beyond damp and wasn\u2019t going to absorb any of the excess moisture. Even in the darkened backseat, Thorpe would see if she tried to use her skirt to wipe away the evidence.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and frowned. \u201cAll right, I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you lied?\u201d Damn, that Dom voice of his went straight to her clit. The ache coiled up.</p><p>A few possible responses ran through her head, but she\u2019d seen Thorpe operate enough to know that excuses wouldn\u2019t work. Compounding things with another lie would only make her eventual punishment\u2014and there would be one\u2014worse. So she settled on the only thing that might persuade him to show a little bit of mercy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m confused. I was . . . ashamed.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her chin. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t it be obvious? \u201cYou haven\u2019t touched me in two years, except the night after Sean and I, um . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade love,\u201d he supplied from the front seat oh so helpfully.</p><p>\u201cThat was the night you came under my tongue and fingers.\u201d Thorpe stared into her eyes, forcing her to remember the way she\u2019d writhed for him and screamed his name.</p><p>Mortification froze Callie. Would Sean be mad? Or would this weird alternate universe where he and Thorpe were having some bizarre bromance continue and lead Sean to do something once incomprehensible, like high-five the Dungeon Master?</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cOther than that, you\u2019ve shown almost no sexual interest in me for so long. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing that your spanking, um . . . aroused me.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked like he wanted to say something, but he didn\u2019t. After a long pause, he simply glanced at her thighs. \u201cSpread them. I won\u2019t ask again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to check?\u201d She blinked at him, then back up at Sean in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI asked him to, lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo yes,\u201d Thorpe provided, then looked at her impatiently.</p><p>Her heart chugged like a herd of wild horses. It had been one thing to spread her legs for Thorpe when she thought it had been good-bye, when she thought she\u2019d never have to see the knowing gleam in his eyes again or worry that he thought her a silly, inexperienced girl for being so easily excited by him. Now . . . she got the feeling that he intended to plow his fingers through her feminine folds and enjoy the hell out of her response. For her hesitation, he\u2019d only want to arouse her more, bask in her helpless reaction to him.</p><p>Would she rather have more punishment or more embarrassment? The former would only lead to more of the latter, so she might as well get this shit over with. It wasn\u2019t like she had any way of preventing him from tying her down and doing whatever he wanted to her pussy the minute they made it out of this car and found a flat surface.</p><p>Slowly, Callie parted her thighs until her knees were as wide as her hips. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to look at him, and realized that every hang-up about sex she\u2019d ever had was coming back to haunt her.</p><p>Her father had never talked about the taboo subject. Holden may have been her first, but the fumbling in his backyard that early fall evening hadn\u2019t taught her a lot except that losing her virginity hurt. She\u2019d tried casual sex once over the years with Xander. She\u2019d wanted Thorpe so badly and hadn\u2019t known how else to get his attention. Thirty seconds and one fake orgasm later, she\u2019d called it off, knowing that she couldn\u2019t bring herself to fuck one man when she wanted another. Xander had been fine with ending it, too, leaving her to wonder if she lacked sex appeal altogether. Then came Sean. He\u2019d given her a pleasure so excruciating, Callie still caught her breath just thinking about it. She hadn\u2019t ever known such ecstasy existed. And she\u2019d craved him since. But Thorpe? Gawd, she was almost afraid to discover all the ways he could turn her body inside out.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d The word slipped out as she stared into his eyes.</p><p>What the hell was she doing, showing her vulnerable side to a man well-known for his ruthless domination?</p><p>\u201cPlease what, pet?\u201d</p><p>Her entire body shook. Thorpe made her nervous; he always had. Such a big, forceful presence. It was hard not to want to please him. The not knowing whether she mattered to him as something more than a responsibility troubled her. One minute he\u2019d wanted her, the next he hadn\u2019t. He had once again when Sean had come on the scene. What did Thorpe really feel for her?</p><p>Exhaustion and hunger tore at her. The pain making her heel throb was nothing compared with the ache in her pussy. It was impossible not to acknowledge how important Thorpe had been to her. For a girl who usually uprooted every few months, four years to feel unrequited love was a damn long time.</p><p>A tear streaked down her cheek, and she wiped it away. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so confused.\u201d</p><p>He let loose a heavy sigh. Then he wrapped an arm around her and tugged her against his tall, hard frame. \u201cOn my lap, pet.\u201d</p><p>Callie was dying to know what he was thinking, feeling, wanting. But he wasn\u2019t going to tell her. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>As she scrambled into his lap, he cupped a gentle hand around the back of her head and guided her onto his shoulder, wrapping his suit coat around her once more. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning up the heater, lovely. All you had to do was say something.\u201d</p><p>That gentle note was back in Sean\u2019s voice, tugging at her. Emotions she didn\u2019t know how to comprehend piled up, right on top of all her confusion. Mentally, she couldn\u2019t hold it all up or in anymore.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She sniffled.</p><p>\u201cGive me your feet.\u201d Thorpe held out one hand where she could snuggle them into his palm.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get blood on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d he questioned sharply.</p><p>\u201cM-my foot. I stepped on a rock. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll add first aid supplies to my mental grocery list,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where we\u2019re going?\u201d Thorpe inquired, curling his arms around her more tightly.</p><p>His embrace was like heaven. It might be stupid, but the only thing that would make her happier would be to have Sean cuddled up to her, too.</p><p>\u201cI have a few thoughts. Callie, do you like to swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her sister had nearly drowned as a toddler in a little koi pond in the backyard of a neighbor\u2019s house. She\u2019d tried like hell to rescue Charlotte\u2014and almost drowned herself. She\u2019d been terrified of the water since.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t swim,\u201d Thorpe supplied. \u201cI managed to drag her to the lake once with some of the regulars from Dominion. She spent the entire time as far away from the railing of the boat as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Sean said with a smile in his voice.</p><p>The words filled her with disquiet. Not because she thought either of them would willingly hurt her, but if they isolated her someplace where she couldn\u2019t escape and put their heads together to collaborate on what came next . . . Callie had a feeling she\u2014and her heart\u2014might be in real trouble.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>FOUR hours later, Sean stared down at Callie\u2019s sleeping figure almost swallowed whole by the surprisingly big bed. She was worn out, and when he bent to remove the terrible blond wig, she didn\u2019t move a muscle. That alone told him how fatigued she was, as did the gray smudges under her eyes. He tossed the synthetic hair in the corner and carefully removed all the pins until her dark tresses spread across the white sheets. She looked so beautiful, it broke his fucking heart.</p><p>Thorpe stood beside him. \u201cIs she still asleep?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s not the only one.\u201d Thorpe twisted his powerful torso, stretching and stifling a yawn. \u201cWe got her back, and that was a feat in itself, but we\u2019ve still got a shitload to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Now that we\u2019ve got distance between us and Vegas, we can sort through the facts and decide what comes next.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Thorpe headed out of the bedroom in grim silence, then out onto the dock, into the night. Sean followed. From the deck of their rented houseboat, moonlight glowed over the dark waters of Lake Mead. Now, just before the dawn, everything was shimmering and quiet, a hush of night before the riot of life that came with day prevailed. It was a welcome change from the last frantic few hours.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we were followed,\u201d Thorpe observed.</p><p>\u201cAs deserted as the road from the highway to this private dock is, we would have seen anyone on our tail. Let\u2019s just hope no one realizes that we\u2019ve left Dallas yet or figures out how to track us down.\u201d</p><p>After snatching Callie from behind Glitter Girls, he\u2019d developed a plan to hole up and began to set it in motion. After her punishment, she\u2019d given into weariness and all but passed out on Thorpe\u2019s lap. She hadn\u2019t awakened when they\u2019d stopped at a twenty-four-hour superstore on the southeast side of Vegas. Once there, Sean had grabbed a ball cap and windbreaker from his bag and emerged thirty minutes later with a cartful of everything they would need for a week of isolation. If they needed more provisions, he\u2019d deal with that later.</p><p>After leaving the vehicle\u2019s keys in a magnetic box in the wheel well, they\u2019d hopped in a taxi. Using the burner phones they\u2019d picked up in Dallas, both he and Thorpe had made a few calls as they traveled southeast. The big Dom dialed Axel to check in. After finding out all was well at Dominion, he rang Logan for updates and gave him the number for a new prepaid cell. The former SEAL jotted down Thorpe\u2019s new digits, swore to call only if it was an emergency, and said he was still looking into the guy searching for Callie at the airport. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meanwhile, Sean reached out to Elijah to explain where they\u2019d left his Jeep and to advise him to call Logan if he learned anything more about the military goon he\u2019d seen flashing Callie\u2019s picture at baggage claim.</p><p>Those tasks completed, he\u2019d used his new phone to put through his final call, this one to a business he\u2019d seen advertised in a brochure at their hotel. He\u2019d awakened the old man in the middle of the night with a bullshit name and promised a wad of cash in exchange for a houseboat for seven days.</p><p>Shortly after that, they\u2019d arrived at the marina with Callie and their bags. They set about casting off from the docks in grim silence. The minute the sun rose, Sean vowed to steer this fifty-foot luxury vessel to a secluded spot so they could get down to work. It wasn\u2019t a perfect solution, but without known phone numbers, Wi-Fi, or other means to trace them, he hoped they could hide until he and Thorpe could figure out how to make Callie safe for good. Sean had no clue how long that would take or what they\u2019d have to do. He was risking everything by disconnecting from his superiors. Not only could he be fired and Thorpe lose his business, but it was possible they\u2019d be hauled off to jail for obstruction and hampering an investigation. Still, Sean didn\u2019t see any alternative if Callie was going to have a future and he wanted to be a part of it.</p><p>But this road trip/search-and-rescue mission had shown him that tomorrow wasn\u2019t simple. Sean knew he would never have gotten this far without Thorpe\u2019s assistance, and he was surprisingly glad to have the man helping him keep her both safe and in line.</p> <p>Over and over in his head, he kept replaying the way the Dom had punished Callie in the Jeep. She had lay sprawled across Thorpe\u2019s lap, her backside all but bare to him, her cries resounding in the dark. Not even a blind man would have missed Thorpe\u2019s peace at having her under his control, being the master of her beautiful vulnerability.</p><p>Callie hadn\u2019t been immune, either. He\u2019d asked if she was wet to establish that fact. The other man hadn\u2019t had the chance to check, but Sean would have bet his job and his life that she\u2019d been turned on by that manhandling. Thorpe had probably known it, too.</p><p>Yes, Sean suspected that Callie would have responded to his own discipline and submitted to him as well, but that quickly and with that much abandon? Sure, she\u2019d complained about Thorpe\u2019s punishment\u2014that was Callie\u2014but far more than sexual desire glued them together. They yearned for one another. Somewhere in her stubborn heart, Sean knew that she loved him, too. After all, she\u2019d blossomed beneath his tender care just days ago, giving her body to him and a tantalizing chunk of her soul.</p><p>He and Thorpe had already acknowledged they both loved her. And if she loved both of them . . . where the hell did they go from here?</p><p>Together, he and Thorpe eased into the galley to put away the groceries, ensuring all the food-related bags had been emptied.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s everything.\u201d Sean glanced around the room. Together, they grabbed most of the other bags\u2014toiletries, clothes, and other necessities\u2014along with the bottle of tequila he\u2019d bought during his middle-of-the-night stop. \u201cWe should talk.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe gave a tight nod. \u201cWhere we can keep an eye on Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Sean\u2019s thoughts raced as he backtracked to the bedroom in which she slept, Thorpe trailing behind him down the narrow passage. Inside, he walked to the far side of the bed, set the bottle on the nightstand, toed off his shoes, then climbed in beside her, trailing his hand across the chilled skin of her back. The other man stood, watching Callie with a hunger so strong, it was visceral.</p><p>In her sleep, she shivered, and Sean gathered her closer, sliding down to plaster his body against hers, wishing he could hoard her. But other than him, who did that benefit?</p><p>\u201cDamn it, she\u2019s freezing,\u201d he told Thorpe. \u201cCan you look at her foot? When you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll find some blankets for the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Thorpe dug through the plastic bag dangling from his fingers until he found some cotton balls and antiseptic. With a wince, he flipped on the overhead light while Sean shielded Callie\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>If the sight of him holding her bothered Thorpe, it didn\u2019t show. Instead, the big Dom simply cleaned her wound. He tended to her need, shelving his own, even when she moaned groggily and tried to squirm away. Sean watched the man\u2019s big hand curl around her ankle to steady her so he could try to heal her. The visual metaphor struck Sean in the gut. Over the years, Thorpe had done that for Callie in nearly every other way. It was one reason she loved him. Sean wondered if his own broken trust with the girl could be repaired. Would she ever see that, even though he\u2019d given her a fake name, his feelings for her had been very real?</p><p>Once Thorpe was done with his first aid, he turned off the light, casting the bedroom in shadow again. Sean flicked the rocker switch for the nightstand light, casting a dim artificial glow over the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not serious,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cHer heel will be tender for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cGood to hear.\u201d</p><p>The other man looked away. Out of discomfort because Thorpe didn\u2019t want to see him cradling Callie\u2019s scantily clad body? Or out of respect because Thorpe believed she wasn\u2019t his? Either way, the other Dom didn\u2019t waste time squabbling or backbiting. Matters now were far too serious for that.</p><p>\u201cUm, the guy who rented us the boat\u2014Werner, wasn\u2019t it?\u2014said there was another bedroom down the hall, right?\u201d Thorpe tugged at the back of his neck. \u201cAnd a shower? If we\u2019re done here, I think I\u2019ll just grab those and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not. Stay.\u201d Sean tempered his demand. \u201cPlease. We really do need to talk.\u201d</p><p>There was no place in the small bedroom for Thorpe to sit except the bed. He stood, arms crossed, until Sean motioned to the mattress on the other side of Callie and passed him the bottle of tequila.</p> <p>With a sigh, Thorpe sat on the edge and wrangled open the bottle, taking a long swallow.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t got any salt and lime.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shrugged. \u201cIt just slows down the drinking.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand for the bottle. \u201cAmen to that.\u201d</p><p>After taking a long swallow, he passed the tequila back to Thorpe. The alcohol was already warming him, but she still trembled with the chill.</p><p>\u201cCallie needs a blanket,\u201d Sean said. \u201cLet me find one.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe made to rise. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>It would have been so easy to let the other man see to the task, but what did Callie need? The answer wasn\u2019t simple . . . but seemed so obvious. Sean swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cYou keep her warm. I\u2019ll find it. I think I remember where Werner said he stashed the rest of the bedding.\u201d</p><p>Sean jumped up and prowled in the room\u2019s little closet. He found a stack of blankets on a shelf, but loitered to see what Thorpe would do. The other man set the bottle aside and sank farther onto the bed. His gaze fell instantly on Callie, but he kept his distance until the girl shivered again. November had turned cold, especially out on the water. The boat had a heater, but Sean hadn\u2019t found it yet. She still wore next to nothing. And judging by the look on Thorpe\u2019s face, he was hard-pressed to forget that.</p><p>When she trembled again, he gathered her in his arms, closing his eyes as she settled against him with a little sigh. The contentment on his face spoke volumes to Sean. Even though everything was up in the air and filled with danger, in that moment, all was right with Thorpe. And Callie. The sight didn\u2019t bother Sean. She was safe and content\u2014and he was surprisingly good with that.</p><p>When the big Dom looked settled, Sean scooped up the blankets and spread a couple over her. She burrowed under them, looking even more relaxed.</p><p>Moments later, he sat beside Callie, who remained nestled against Thorpe, and combed his fingers through her silky hair. \u201cI need to say a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe tensed. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, we have to figure out who\u2019s after Callie and why. My money is still on whoever had her family offed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means we have to dig deeper into Callie\u2019s background. We\u2019ll have to ask her questions when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019ll love that,\u201d Thorpe drawled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. But as painful as she may find the mental jaunt through her past, I think it\u2019s important. There\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t know something. It may just take the right questions for her to remember it. Once we figure everything out, we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think she\u2019s tried this a million times?\u201d Thorpe looked up at him as if he was stating the obvious.</p><p>Maybe he was.</p><p>Sean shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that more heads are better than one. We can\u2019t fail to try just because she hasn\u2019t succeeded on her own. I\u2019ve been studying this case for close to a year. I\u2019ll have a better idea of the questions that need to be asked. Maybe that will make a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Thorpe shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it would be overnight. In fact, I\u2019m betting it won\u2019t be. But however long it takes, I\u2019m in this for the duration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you love her?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Sean held out his hand for the tequila. Without displacing Callie, Thorpe rolled over and plucked up the bottle from the floor, passing it over her supine form.</p><p>\u201cSame as you.\u201d Sean took a long swallow of the clear liquid from the bottle they shared.</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t comment directly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s ready for either of us to feel that way. She doesn\u2019t know how to let herself be loved because she never really has been.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t even have to think about that. \u201cAs a woman? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a piece of that Holden pecker who tried to sell her out for cash as a teenager. I\u2019d wring his fucking neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019d like to get way more creative,\u201d Sean mused. \u201cI\u2019d rip his throat out through his asshole after I\u2019ve carved out his spine with a screwdriver and gouged out his eyes with a spork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to piss you off.\u201d Thorpe looked both horrified and suitably impressed.</p><p>Sean smiled. \u201cAs long as Callie comes first, we won\u2019t have a problem. She needs that. Based on her file, I think the only person, besides us, who openly loved Callie was her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was only six when the woman died.\u201d Dismay spread across Thorpe\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Sean took another long swig of booze. \u201cShe and her sister had more of a mother-daughter relationship. By all accounts, she really loved Charlotte, but when the girl hit twelve, she started rebelling and they\u2019d been having major arguments about her behavior.\u201d He paused. \u201cAccording to the autopsy, Charlotte was nine weeks pregnant when she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt fourteen? I know that happens, but . . .\u201d Shock sent Thorpe\u2019s brows into a frown. \u201cDo you think Callie knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly she can answer that. Lots of speculation about who fathered Charlotte\u2019s baby . . .\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s frown became a scowl. \u201cYou think it was Callie\u2019s prick of a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolden apparently spent a lot of time at their house, and he was obviously an unscrupulous bastard. I\u2019d say anything is possible.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe ruffled a hand through his mussed hair. \u201cSon of a bitch. If that\u2019s the case, it could be another reason she doesn\u2019t trust well. Being betrayed by her boyfriend and her sister at such a young age would be harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as if she could rely on her father, either. My information says that, after her mother died, he left the girls\u2019 care to hired help and began hanging out with people willing to take his money, primarily medical researchers. Seems he became obsessed with discovering the cure for cancer in his late wife\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell.\u201d Thorpe shook his head. \u201cThe girls were so young. They had lost a mother. They needed reassurance, guidance, and love. No wonder Callie wanted to run away from home and believed the first guy with a stiff dick who claimed to love her. She learned her lesson the hard way. How the hell is she supposed to recover from that while running for her damn life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she has. I\u2019ve tried to heal her as much as I could, but as you know, it\u2019s a big fucking job.\u201d Sean sighed. \u201cShe needs constants, people she can count on without fail.\u201d</p><p>That thought seemed to sober Thorpe even more. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you want to head back to Dominion, tell me now. I\u2019ll get you to land after sunrise. As long as you keep your mouth shut, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I haven\u2019t come this far to bail now. I won\u2019t abandon Callie. Axel can manage Dominion without me. Lots of folks there will help. And Sweet Pea might seem like the most submissive creature ever, but she can run that place like a drill instructor when she has to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Relief flooded Sean\u2019s system. They both agreed that Callie had to come first. They might not have a lot in common, but they shared that belief. Now the conversation got tricky . . .</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve been thinking about this. I need your help with Callie. Sometimes you\u2019re the only person who can reach her.\u201d Sean sighed and tried to figure out how to say all the other things crowding his head. He should probably have a bit of sleep and a stiff cup of coffee before he even tried, but time wasn\u2019t on their side. Once Callie woke, they\u2019d have a fight on their hands. The dust between he and Thorpe had to be settled now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for her, whatever she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s both of us?\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe hesitated. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll probably need us both to protect her from whoever is searching for her,\u201d Sean began. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to assume that if they killed her family and took a shot at her, they want her dead, too. The more people she has watching her back, the safer she\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know how secretive she\u2019s always been\u2014for good reason. But if we\u2019re going to pry her open so she\u2019ll tell us about her past, we\u2019re going to have to earn her trust. I\u2019ll need your steady hand.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sat up and peered across the darkness at him. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter months of giving her my cover story, her trust in me is shaky at best right now. We can\u2019t wait to grow it again before we find out what she knows. We need that info now.\u201d Thorpe didn\u2019t answer, but Sean could see the man\u2019s mind turning. \u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Thorpe swallowed.</p><p>\u201cJust like you know where I\u2019m going with this, man. This woman has never had what she needs. As a little girl, she needed a mother, but hers died of cancer. As a teenager, she needed the support of her family, but her father was too distant, while her sister probably stabbed her in the back. She needed to finish growing up in a safe environment . . . and you know how that story goes. Now Callie needs us for more than protection. She needs us to finally make her whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus . . .\u201d Thorpe blew out a breath and raked a hand through his hair.</p><p>Sean pressed on. \u201cYou said yourself that I lacked the knowledge to properly guide her. But you don\u2019t. She trusts you. And she loves you, too.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t say a word at first, just held out his hand for the bottle. Sean passed it back, watching the other man guzzle down more tequila as he, no doubt, turned over all the possibilities in his head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d ask if you\u2019re fucking serious, but you obviously are.\u201d He shook his head of mussed hair. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend inviting me inside your picket fence, Mackenzie. I\u2019m not good for her.\u201d</p><p>That assertion was ridiculous. He and Callie fit together perfectly.</p><p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m just trying to keep her alive,\u201d Sean hedged. \u201cIf you want to go your separate way once the danger is done, I\u2019ll help you find the door.\u201d</p><p>He had mixed feelings about making that offer. Thorpe walking out on Callie would crush her. But if that happened, he\u2019d just have to find some way to help her deal. Regardless, that was another problem for another day. He had enough to juggle now. He just had to trust that once Thorpe got close to her, he wouldn\u2019t be able to walk away.</p><p>\u201cBut I want you to think about this. The only place where your age difference means a thing is in your head. And your worry about giving her enough tenderness? It\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t, Sean would be happy to supply Callie plenty of affection. After all, if he couldn\u2019t give her something, Thorpe might well edge him out of her heart. Or maybe that was his own fear talking because then he closed his eyes and remembered her trembling surrender, her cries that she loved him. He might have started out with Callie as a substitute for the needs Thorpe wasn\u2019t fulfilling, but their relationship had progressed into something far deeper than he\u2019d ever imagined when she\u2019d been just a name on a file folder and a picture of a pretty girl.</p><p>\u201cCut to the chase and tell me what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Thorpe chomped impatiently. \u201cSpell it out. I don\u2019t want any gray between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe share her one hundred percent\u2014at least for as long as she\u2019s in danger. Everything we do for her, we do together. But you can\u2019t half-ass this. You have to give her your all.\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe stilled. \u201cSo . . . you want me to discipline her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she needs it, yes.\u201d</p><p>A deep breath. A pensive stare. A gulp. \u201cAre you me giving a green light to sex?\u201d</p><p>There was the question he\u2019d known would surface sooner or later. How much of Callie was he willing to grant the other man . . .</p><p>Now it was Sean\u2019s turn to hesitate. Honestly, he didn\u2019t know how he was going to feel seeing Thorpe\u2019s hands on her, his cock tunneling inside her. He might feel like slashing the Dom\u2019s throat. But he also might take comfort in doing the right thing for Callie and watching her bloom. Either way, he had to put her first. If they didn\u2019t force pertinent information about the past out of her, she might not live through this ordeal. His jealousy would be awfully moot then.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d Sean finally said. \u201cWould you top another pretty submissive and dismiss the possibility of sex before you\u2019ve even started the relationship? Would Callie believe you were committed to her if you refused to give yourself in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Thorpe took several long drags from the bottle, looking floored. \u201cSo that\u2019s a yes to sex.\u201d</p><p>Despite the gravity of the conversation, Sean was almost amused by the man\u2019s tension. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck no. Not at all.\u201d Thorpe shot him a dirty glare. \u201cBut you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cShe may think she\u2019s taken her collar off, but I respect the fact that she\u2019s still owned.\u201d</p><p>And Thorpe sounded like he\u2019d rather spit nails than admit that.</p><p>\u201cSo what are my limits?\u201d the other man asked.</p><p>With a shrug, Sean rolled through the possibilities. \u201cOnly one: Everything we do with Callie, we do as a team. No Lone Ranger acts.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe paused, frowned for a moment, then nodded. \u201cI\u2019m in. We need to make Callie feel safe enough to open up to us. It\u2019s important that we establish our control and get whatever information she\u2019s got in her head out soon. You\u2019re absolutely right about that. It\u2019s our only chance of her listening to us if danger follows her here. Beyond that . . . I\u2019ve been hungry for her for years.\u201d</p><p>So it was settled. They would share in Callie\u2019s care. They would both Dominate her. They would both partake of her. And they would do it all together.</p><p>\u201cYou ever had a m\u00e9nage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just for fun.\u201d Thorpe tapped his thumb against the bottle. \u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>Sean was glad he saw the distinction. \u201cCompletely. I don\u2019t know how complicated it will be. But we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her, we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. The sun\u2019s coming up.\u201d Sean gestured to the graying sky outside the bedroom window as a mixed cocktail of relief and anxiety flowed through his veins. \u201cFirst, we need some sleep before Hurricane Callie wakes and figures out where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Yeah.\u201d Thorpe braced himself on the mattress and pushed upright. \u201cDo you want me to get out of your way and let you bunk down with your girl?\u201d</p><p>Sean shook his head. Apparently, it was going to take Thorpe more than a few seconds to adjust to the idea of sharing her completely. \u201cWe both take care of her. This is our bed now. You need to stay with Callie in case she wakes up. She\u2019ll be disoriented at best and furious at worst. Get her under the sheets, make sure she\u2019s comfortable. Now that I\u2019ve got some sunlight and I won\u2019t run this boat into the shore, I need to anchor it someplace as secluded as possible.\u201d He grabbed his shoes and thrust them on. \u201cBack in ten.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t wait for Thorpe to reply before he darted out the bedroom door. He picked up anchor and cruised the lake until he found a wide inlet with tall, craggy rocks on either side. He navigated to the middle, still away from shore, then dropped anchor again. It wouldn\u2019t hide them from someone in a helicopter, but anyone else on the lake would be hard-pressed to find them.</p><p>Nearly forty minutes had passed. Exhaustion weighed his every limb, and nothing sounded better than tumbling into the bed with Callie and sleeping for long, uninterrupted hours before waking to make love to her.</p><p>When he hit the bedroom again, he stopped short in the doorway. Thorpe had fallen asleep on the right side of the bed with Callie spooned against his chest. They both looked peaceful, exhaling together in harmony.</p><p>The worry Sean had been trying to restrain jabbed at him. Naturally, he had concerns about letting Thorpe too close to his woman. Would she ultimately choose the other man instead? Or would Callie always need them both? Nearly three sleepless days hadn\u2019t equipped him to answer that question now.</p><p>With a weary sigh, he shut the drapes, then shed everything except his boxer-briefs. He slid under the sheets, rolling over to kiss Callie\u2019s forehead. She moaned quietly, then scooted closer to him as if seeking warmth . . . while Thorpe\u2019s arm remained snug around her, his legs tangled in hers, his breath ruffling her long, loose hair. Sean drifted in the peace and slept.</p><p>COCOONED in warmth, Callie woke and squinted against the filtered light making its way through the curtains. The little bit she could see around her didn\u2019t look at all familiar. It certainly wasn\u2019t Dominion. No, wait. She\u2019d left there and she wouldn\u2019t rehash all the reasons that had been necessary. It damn well wasn\u2019t her skuzzy dump of a Vegas motel either. And why did the ground seem like it was swaying slightly?</p><p>She forced one eye open\u2014and the sights just kept getting weirder. A shirtless Sean slept on one side of her, his hard chest pressed to her own. His powerful torso rose above a soft, faded blanket. He looked damn good for a liar.</p><p>Behind her, hot breath spread unexpectedly across her neck. With a little jerk, she stared over her shoulder. Thorpe. Asleep in a rumpled white dress shirt and dark trousers. The five-o\u2019clock shadow darkened his sharp jaw more than usual.</p><p>The men she loved surrounded her. It was like a fantasy. It had to be a dream. They hated one another . . . or they had back at Dominion. The time since her departure from the club rushed back to her, her memories lingering on the ride in the silver Jeep last night, on Thorpe smacking her ass and Sean approving every gesture with his stare in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Last night, they\u2019d been a team, united by their determination to capture her and bring her back to safety. Or so they claimed. Thorpe, she believed. Sean? She really didn\u2019t know him or have any idea how much of what had passed between them was a lie. It had felt so very real. He\u2019d sworn it was. And she had to admit that if he\u2019d simply wanted to bring her in for the bounty or prestige, he probably would have done it in Dallas. He certainly wouldn\u2019t be letting Thorpe tag along, either.</p><p>But even if he actually loved her, as he claimed, and even if every word Sean and Thorpe said was true, she couldn\u2019t stay. Her life was too dangerous, and she wasn\u2019t going to drag them into her muck. They had some foolish notion in their heads to be noble, heroic. By all appearances, they cared. Whatever their motives, Callie couldn\u2019t let them.</p><p>Carefully, she inched to the end of the bed and crept off the mattress, shivering and steadying herself. Crap, it was cold this morning. She reached for the first garment she encountered, Sean\u2019s shirt. It even smelled like him. Where were her shoes?</p><p>Inhaling his musk as she slipped it on, she glanced at them both, regret nearly bringing her to tears. They\u2019d worked hard to track her down and \u201crescue\u201d her, not really understanding that the job of saving her was bigger than them both, even with their forces combined. Their effort humbled Callie, and the guilt for leaving them again nearly took her to her knees. But she wouldn\u2019t be able to live with herself if she was the reason they found themselves behind bars.</p><p>The floor beneath her dipped again, a gentle rocking that confused her. Where the hell had they brought her? Tiptoeing to the window, she eased the dull white drape aside and peeked out. Water\u2014and a lot of it.</p><p>Callie sucked in a stunned breath and tried to shove down her panic. Shit! Okay, keep it together. If they were on a boat, maybe they were docked. There had to be a way off, right? In her head, though, she heard Sean ask again if she liked to swim . . .</p><p>On silent feet, she dashed out of the room, down the little passageway, then found a door leading out to the expansive deck. Water everywhere, at the front of the boat, either side . . . Callie sprinted to the back of the vessel, heart pounding three times for every step she took. But all she found was more water. The nearest land, formidable rock formations that would be a terrifyingly steep climb, looked a hundred feet away\u2014at least. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart pounded so furiously that her blood vessels felt close to bursting. Her entire body flooded with adrenaline. Memories of nearly drowning as a kid and the brackish water filling her mouth, stinging her eyes, and rendering her lungs useless overwhelmed her.</p><p>If she wanted off this rocking prison, she would have to swim and climb and haul ass through the desert without shoes, water, or sunscreen. Hell, she was doomed.</p><p>Callie couldn\u2019t stop herself. She opened her mouth and screamed. And screamed. And screamed.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt a hand cup over her lips, trapping in the sound. \u201cAre you trying to bring every police officer and bounty hunter within a hundred-mile radius down on our heads?\u201d</p> <p>Sean. He growled the words in her ear as he bracketed her back with his solid warmth.</p><p>On her right, Thorpe stormed up and turned on her, looking disheveled and pissed off. He grabbed the back of her neck in a firm grip. His gray eyes looked thunderous as he pinned her in place with his stare. \u201cCalm down, pet. Not another sound. You\u2019re safe here. We intend to keep you that way.\u201d</p><p>Surrounded. Trapped. Escape had been the only way she\u2019d survived for nearly as long as she could remember. Now, these two seemed determined to keep her here on this floating hell and ruin their lives in the process.</p><p>She twisted away, dislodging Sean\u2019s hand from her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t do this! Let me go before you regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to make a sound,\u201d Thorpe reminded, his voice heavy with disapproval.</p> <p>Behind her, Sean\u2019s disappointment seeped into her, too.</p><p>She hated hurting them. The submissive in her especially hated disappointing them. Logically, it didn\u2019t make sense, but that didn\u2019t make the feeling less real.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her inside.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cJust in case this lake isn\u2019t as deserted as we hoped. The last thing we need is a fellow boater hearing her and calling 911. If they come down on our heads and find her, I may not be able to control what happens next.\u201d</p><p>Without exchanging another word, he wrapped one hand around her back, then bent and slid his other arm behind her knees. He lifted her against his bare chest as if her weight didn\u2019t strain him at all. His shoulders bulged and his jaw tightened as he turned and made his way back inside the living quarters. He stared down at her with reproving blue eyes and gave her a slow shake of his head.</p><p>She would have squirmed and scrambled out of his arms if she thought it would do any good, but Thorpe walked right behind them. No doubt, he\u2019d haul her back if she tried to run\u2014and provide her some sort of extra \u201cmotivation\u201d to stay. And if she did flee, what then? Swimming to shore and walking back to civilization without any protection from the desert sun or a cent to her name just wasn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not hashing this out again, lovely,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe told you last night that you were not to leave again without our permission or there would be consequences. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me being disobedient. It\u2019s about you two losing everything to try to save me when you can\u2019t. No one can. I appreciate you wanting to help, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it if you wound up convicts over something futile.\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed heavily as he lowered her to the bed and looked at Thorpe. \u201cShe\u2019s not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has that nasty habit at times.\u201d Thorpe approached her and took her chin in his hand. \u201cYour situation isn\u2019t futile. Have some faith in us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorpe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sent her a sharp stare and held up a finger to silence her. Damn if it didn\u2019t work. He\u2019d run hot and cold with her for years. Why the hell did she still respond to him so completely?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not open for discussion. When was the last time you ate?\u201d he asked.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Callie mentally retraced the previous day. \u201cBreakfast yesterday. Then I had a handful of almonds about three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>They both looked at her with glaring disapproval before Sean clenched his fists. \u201cDamn it, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t the most important thing on my mind.\u201d Their frowns deepened, and their concern for her made her feel small, as if she\u2019d messed up even more. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but you will be,\u201d Thorpe promised before he turned back to Sean. \u201cHow are your kitchen skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassable. I\u2019ve been feeding myself since college.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI won\u2019t poison her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Mine are terrible. It\u2019s why God invented takeout.\u201d Thorpe smiled wryly.</p><p>\u201cI can feed myself, guys. If it will make you feel better, I\u2019ll grab something and eat it all like a good little girl if you\u2019ll just let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this again.\u201d Sean sounded at the end of his rope.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand . . . yet,\u201d Thorpe drawled. \u201cFirst, she needs food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a shower,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cTrue. God knows how many fucking germs were breeding at Glitter Girls.\u201d Thorpe speared her with a glare. \u201cEventually, we\u2019re going to have a long discussion about why you chose that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you intend to punish me again.\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd then sometimes she catches on so quickly . . .\u201d Thorpe smiled Sean\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sure for a while now that she chooses not to \u2018get it\u2019 at least half the time because she\u2019s just stubborn.\u201d Sean sighed.</p><p>Callie balled her hands into fists. \u201cStop it! You\u2019re not my Dom anymore\u2014if you ever truly were. I took off my collar. And before either of you tells me again it doesn\u2019t work that way, you both know that BDSM is safe, sane, and consensual. I\u2019m not consenting. And you.\u201d She turned to glare at Thorpe. \u201cYes, you\u2019re the big bad Dom or whatever. But damn it, that doesn\u2019t give you any right to keep me against my will. You have to let me go!\u201d</p><p>They both tensed, then Sean shook his head. Instead of persuading them to release her, she\u2019d hurt him. Pain was carved into his expression. By all appearances, he\u2019d sacrificed everything to help her, and she\u2019d thrown it in his face. Thorpe, too. A glance at her boss didn\u2019t show him any less ruffled. He mostly looked pissed off, except his burning eyes . . . Anguish lay there.</p><p>Callie dragged in a tight breath, everything inside her feeling as if she\u2019d screwed up again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Sean vowed softly. \u201cIf you still want to leave once you\u2019re safe, I\u2019ll take you wherever you want to go and leave you with my well wishes.\u201d</p><p>If he wanted to arrest her, would he really make that offer? He\u2019d have to be the worst kind of con artist . . . and foolish or not, Callie just couldn\u2019t believe that about him.</p><p>Thorpe stared, his face closed up tight. \u201cUntil then, you\u2019re staying here with us. We intend to keep you safe and solve this mystery. You can count on that, pet.\u201d</p><p>Their selflessness\u2014along with a hefty dose of guilt\u2014flogged her all over again.</p><p>\u201cGuys, please.\u201d Tears prickled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do something that will destroy your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want you running for the rest of your life. And I don\u2019t want to have this conversation again. Our decision won\u2019t change. If we have to keep you against your will . . .\u201d Thorpe shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that forever. You both have lives.\u201d She sighed tiredly. \u201cMine is screwed, but yours don\u2019t have to be. I can\u2019t prove that I didn\u2019t kill my father and sister. The crime is way cold, and no amount of investigating now is going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI doesn\u2019t want to arrest you,\u201d Sean cut in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She couldn\u2019t have heard that right.</p><p>\u201cIf the bureau took an interest in this case and wanted you behind bars, you\u2019d already be locked up. I was just sent to watch you, look for any clues, nothing more. They wouldn\u2019t give me that directive if they believed you\u2019d committed a terrible crime.\u201d</p><p>The news impacted her like a two-ton bomb, both blowing her away and creating one hell of a crater in her thoughts. \u201cThe Chicago police still have an APB out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to question you, but that\u2019s not my jurisdiction. I only care about my orders. Uncle Sam hasn\u2019t given me any indication that you\u2019re regarded as a criminal.\u201d</p><p>Callie blinked. She wasn\u2019t actually wanted for murder? After nine years, she didn\u2019t even know how to process that possibility. \u201cThen why the huge bounty on my head? Because of that, I almost bit an assassin\u2019s bullet in Birmingham. I literally ran out of Arkansas with a pair of bounty-hunting goons chasing me. I\u2019ve crossed paths with both sorts over the years and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth are definitely after you, pet,\u201d Thorpe cut in.</p><p>\u201cAnd I think someone powerful is behind the bounty or I wouldn\u2019t have been assigned to keep tabs on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me any of this?\u201d she asked, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t at liberty to blow my cover, lovely. I\u2019m still not . . . but I won\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice long chat about everything later,\u201d Thorpe cut in. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re going to talk about many things. For now, believe that you\u2019re not going to jail and that you can trust us with your life. Other than that, we\u2019re not saying another word until you\u2019ve showered and eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell put,\u201d Sean agreed, slapping Thorpe on the back.</p><p>When had they become the Domination Duo, able to command shivering subs with a single glance? Weirdly, they not only seemed able to tolerate one another, they functioned like a team.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>Callie gaped at them. She didn\u2019t have any illusions that she\u2019d find the conversation pleasant. She knew it would be pointless. After all, she was accustomed to living alone, running and hiding for her life. The guys were tough, but not cut out for that life.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to help, then let me have a car and fifty bucks. You go home and try to figure out who wants me dead. Once that threat is stopped, then . . .\u201d What? She\u2019d just look them up? In another ten years, they\u2019d probably both be married with kids and wives who wouldn\u2019t appreciate a Callie blast from the past. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>Sean and Thorpe exchanged a glance. \u201cI appreciate your independence, lovely\u2014to a point. But not when it comes to danger. Until now, you\u2019ve done well keeping yourself safe, but you won\u2019t be doing it alone anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s final. Don\u2019t ever run from us again,\u201d Thorpe added.</p><p>Like she could keep that promise. \u201cA-all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sir? Isn\u2019t that what you meant?\u201d Thorpe raised a demanding brow. \u201cNot only did your response lack conviction, it was also short on respect. Unacceptable, pet.\u201d</p><p>Callie cast her gaze down. A thousand thoughts thundered through her head. They\u2019d spent time and money, encountered violence and put themselves on the line to help her. Yes, it was for nothing. They were being stubborn, bossy, foolish, and pig-headed. And she wanted to throttle them. But she also hadn\u2019t thanked them for all they\u2019d tried to do for her, much less shown respect.</p><p>Both flustered and humbled, she looked from Thorpe\u2019s forbidding countenance to Sean\u2019s questioning stare. Easier to start where she could see a little softness. Then she\u2019d figure out how to proceed from there.</p><p>She rose to her knees on the mattress and scooted closer, lifting her arms to Sean. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve put you through a lot. I know what you\u2019ve risked. I wish you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He crushed her against him. \u201cI told you why, Callie. I love you.\u201d</p><p>So easy-breezy for him to just put it out there. She\u2019d never had the luxury of saying those words openly to anyone. They implied the promise of tomorrows she\u2019d never had.</p><p>Callie could only hope that somehow her life wasn\u2019t doomed to end badly. Even if it was, she had his affection and devotion right now. How many years had she spent utterly alone and aching for someone to give a shit about her? Too many to count.</p><p>Was she really going to throw it away? Couldn\u2019t she have them for a day or two? Couldn\u2019t she give Sean the love filling her heart in return? Thorpe the obedience and devotion he deserved?</p><p>\u201cI fell for you at Dominion.\u201d She cupped Sean\u2019s cheek and met the sincerity of his blue stare, so open. His dashing little smile creased the corners of his eyes and lifted her heart. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Sean caressed a broad hand down her tangled hair, deepening the connection of their stares. Inside, she could feel him, his caring, his understanding. She\u2019d been lucky when the FBI assigned him to watch over her and had a feeling that he always would if she let him.</p><p>Now for the hard part. Callie only hoped that Sean would understand that her feelings for Thorpe didn\u2019t mean that she cared for him less. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She drew in a shaky breath and turned to Thorpe, already searching for the words to tell him how grateful she was for all he\u2019d done and somehow confess everything he meant to her. Before she could unscramble her thoughts, Thorpe zipped around and strode out the door, shutting it with careful quiet behind him.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>CALLIE\u2019S heart dropped in a sickening fall. Guilt flayed her again. Damn it, she hadn\u2019t meant to hurt Thorpe\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201cI need to . . .\u201d What? Apologize to Sean for also being in love with Thorpe? Say she was sorry for moving beyond carrying an unrequited torch for her protector? Sean didn\u2019t want to hear her pour out her feelings for Thorpe any more than her former boss wanted to hear her wax poetic about the fed she\u2019d once called her Dom. Could this get any more complicated? \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make him uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Thorpe is just beating himself up. He wants to tell you that he loves you, too. But he\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>Those words stunned her. Presumably, Sean had spoken in English, but it might as well have been Greek. How would he know anything about Thorpe\u2019s feelings? Why would he care? And how did he have it so wrong?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Callie stepped back, shaking her head. \u201cThorpe doesn\u2019t love me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, exactly as I do. Like a man loves a woman. He\u2019s got a hang-up or two, I gather, but he loves you. Just like you love him.\u201d</p><p>With a little gasp, she blinked up at him, struggling to find words beyond her shock. He\u2019d figured that out and he wasn\u2019t furious? \u201cOh, Sean. I\u2019m so sorry if I\u2019ve hurt you. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t apologize for your heart.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve known that you love us both for a while. So has he. Would I enjoy having you to myself? Of course. But I\u2019ve asked myself long and hard what you need. Thorpe gives you something I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She clung to him, grabbing his arms. \u201cBut you give me things he doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to lose\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, lovely. You won\u2019t. What sort of man would I be if I put my own anxiety and jealousy above your fulfillment?\u201d</p><p>Callie stared up at him in wonder, blinking through a sheen of tears. \u201cYou amaze me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sad smile. \u201cThe world hasn\u2019t shown you a lot of kindness, so you don\u2019t expect it in others. You\u2019ve had so much taken from you. If I have to bend my pride to be the one to finally make you whole, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>A sudden thump sounded just outside their insulated little galley, and they both turned to see Thorpe shaking his hand . . . like he\u2019d just punched the wall and hurt his knuckles.</p> <p>Her heart ached for him, but he\u2019d walled himself off from her. He\u2019d always been an island, never quite letting others close. She couldn\u2019t help him if he wouldn\u2019t let her behind his defenses.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s been worried that you\u2019ll leave him, Callie. You wouldn\u2019t be the first woman to do it. And he seems to believe that he\u2019s a bit too old and rough around the edges for you. He just needs a little reassurance. You\u2019ll have to give it to him.\u201d</p><p>Callie blinked up at Sean, who smiled softly. Was he for real?</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t feel betrayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good would it do me?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHaving two of us to protect you makes sense. If I force you to choose between us, not only could I lose you altogether, but I think you\u2019d only be halfway happy. I never thought it possible for someone to love two people at once, but when I see you with us, I know you sincerely do. Not sure yet how everything will work in the \u2018real\u2019 world, but let\u2019s get you past this danger and we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Her heart nearly burst open. Callie hadn\u2019t thought she could love Sean even more. But she\u2019d been wrong. She tightened her arms around him. \u201cHow do you understand me so well?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and cupped her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying you for a year now. You\u2019ve been my life. And maybe my obsession a wee bit. From the start, I wanted to be jealous of your connection with Thorpe, and maybe I should be. But I\u2019ve seen how, when he and I work together, we balance one another to make your world right. I think that will make us both happier in turn.\u201d</p><p>Callie teared up again. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you for being so wonderful and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can start with a shower.\u201d Sean grimaced. \u201cGet that God-awful inch of makeup off your face. Have Thorpe help you. Tell him to be sure you get nice and clean. Then . . . we\u2019ll see what happens. Just don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d With a wink, he turned her, smacked her ass, and sent her in the other man\u2019s direction. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>THORPE couldn\u2019t stop the jealousy rolling through him like an ugly black cloud. It wasn\u2019t because she loved Sean. He\u2019d known that. And he could actually admit that the fed was not only a decent guy, but good for her.</p><p>What made him resentful as hell was that he couldn\u2019t be that open with her about his feelings. Not once in three years of marriage had he been able to tell Melissa that he loved her. It wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>He sighed. A tenderhearted girl like Callie would need that reassurance. He didn\u2019t have it in him. Sean had given him the green light to fuck her, so Thorpe would damn well take advantage of that golden opportunity whenever possible. But it couldn\u2019t lead anywhere.</p><p>All too soon, he\u2019d be forty, and she\u2019d barely be through her mid-twenties. Sean suited her better from an age perspective. Callie looked happy with the other man. Because she meant everything to him, Thorpe refused to burden her with his bottled-up heart. When they untangled her from the mess that had ripped her world apart for years, he would quietly support Sean and fade into the background.</p><p>But he\u2019d never stop loving her.</p><p>When Callie approached him on deck, the wind whipping her dark hair around her shoulders, he closed his eyes. Looking at her and knowing that he\u2019d already lost her was killing him.</p><p>\u201cMitchell?\u201d She touched a hand to his arm.</p><p>No one ever called him that . . . except her, except when her mood was soft. The sound of his name on her lips was like a siren song. Her sweet caress clutched his heart and sent desire sizzling up his arm, streaking under his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he barked more than he meant to.</p><p>Callie opened her mouth, then snapped it shut. \u201cThank you for helping me. I wish for your sake that you hadn\u2019t, but it means the world that you\u2019d risk so much for me. Now I\u2019ll make you happy and leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>Like hell. He grabbed her wrist before she could get away. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since Bora Bora is out of the question right now, Sean wants me to take a shower. He had some strange notion that you needed to supervise me and make sure I got squeaky clean, but I\u2019ve been bathing myself for a long time. You don\u2019t have to bother. I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Callie tugged free and turned away. She hadn\u2019t spared any words of love or affection for him. No surprise. He hadn\u2019t done anything to engender them. Still, as Callie eased through the door and into the galley again, it fucking hurt to watch her walk away. He should protect her and strictly limit their interaction to punishment and sex. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but better for her. Less terrible when she paired off with Sean for good and shattered his heart.</p><p>But right now, her attitude needed to come down about ten notches. Sean had kept him around for a reason. Might as well start earning his privileges.</p><p>Inside the galley, Callie and Sean exchanged a few words. She gesticulated in agitation. The fed raised a brow, then stared at him out the window. A moment later, the girl rolled her eyes and stomped down the narrow passage toward the bedroom.</p><p>Insolent little brat. Thorpe stooped through the door and marched after her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d he assured Sean. \u201cShe\u2019ll fucking shine by the time she steps out of the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We still owe her a lot of punishment, along with a thorough interrogation . . . which will probably lead to more punishment. I don\u2019t want any trace of Glitter Girls on her or it will just piss me off more.\u201d</p><p>Since he could still picture her onstage, wearing next to nothing and wiggling her ass in the face of a guy who looked like the poster boy for pimpdom, Thorpe couldn\u2019t disagree. \u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. While you take care of that, I\u2019ll finish cooking. Then . . . it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Absofuckinglutely.</p><p>Thorpe strode down the hall, into the first bedroom and its adjoining bath. He found Callie staring in the mirror in the tiny bathroom, peeling off false eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wait for me to bring you to the shower.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him and raised her chin. \u201cI know where it is. And your \u2018fuck off\u2019 demeanor didn\u2019t exactly invite company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got thirty seconds alone to empty your bladder before your shower. After that, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>Callie rolled her eyes. \u201cWhy? I won\u2019t run again. Where would I go?\u201d</p><p>Maybe not, but after her Houdini-like escape from Dominion, followed by his nearly three sleepless days of frantic searching for her, Thorpe wasn\u2019t inclined to let her out of his sight. Besides, Sean had given him this duty, and he wasn\u2019t giving up the chance to look at her naked. \u201cGood to hear. I\u2019m not budging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shower alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cGo. Clock\u2019s ticking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh . . .\u201d She sighed and closed the door in his face. Near the thirty-second mark, he heard the toilet flush and she yanked the little door open. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I seem thrilled, pet? In the past few days, I\u2019ve had almost no sleep or food, and I\u2019m running thin on patience, too. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d</p><p>And his bad mood was exacerbated by how ratcheted up he felt. He\u2019d gone to sleep thinking about the moment he could finally slide his bare skin over hers before plunging his cock into her tempting pink pussy and at least pretend that she belonged to him. He\u2019d awakened thinking exactly the same thing. Unless he wanted to torture the fuck out of himself, he\u2019d better quit that line of thinking.</p><p>Dismissing that from his mind only left him with the nagging worry about the danger lurking around every unseen corner. It all gnawed at his composure.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured, casting her gaze to her toes. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d he barked.</p><p>Callie hesitated. \u201cOne question.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. The last damn thing he wanted was a dialogue. Dangerous ground. But he must have a secret masochistic streak. In his book, some contact with Callie was better than none.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean has made it very clear why he\u2019s gone out on a limb to help me. But you\u2019ve done so much for me for years. You\u2019ve said that you want me, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishing to find out how I feel? After running away from me without a word?\u201d After she\u2019d told Sean that she loved him while he had to listen? \u201cWe\u2019ve always been friends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said last night that we were more.\u201d</p><p>A tactical error on his part. His blood had been rushing at the thought of having her in his grasp again, sprawled across his lap for his discipline. Why hadn\u2019t he kept his damn mouth shut?</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, Callie. Shower before Sean finishes your breakfast and it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she choked, her stare all but imploring. \u201cThat\u2019s hard for me to say.\u201d</p><p>His heart stopped. Joy, hope, love all flooded in\u2014until reality crashed back. He would never be the tender lover she needed and deserved. And Callie was young. She might think that she loved him now, but in a dozen years? He\u2019d be able to join AARP, and she\u2019d still be able to bear children. They would never work. And that was just one of their problems. Someday, she\u2019d realize he wasn\u2019t a good fit for her and leave. If he didn\u2019t stunt things between them now, it would hurt far worse later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had plenty of practice with Sean,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>Her chin trembled as she raised it and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhy do you always make me feel like some urchin tugging after you for your affection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a Dom, Callie. What I feel doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that convenient for you? That way, you don\u2019t have to admit that I mean something to you beyond a friend. But you wouldn\u2019t go this far out on a limb for me unless I meant more, despite what you\u2019ve claimed in the past. Every time you\u2019ve kissed me, it wasn\u2019t like a platonic pal. And that certainly wasn\u2019t how it felt when you spanked me or put your tongue on my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips in a grim line as he struggled to restrain the urge to grab her and snarl out his love while he filled her cunt full of every hard inch he ached to give her. \u201cThis is not open for discussion. Shower. Now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou always avoid me. Oh, discipline me, of course, but don\u2019t talk about your feelings. They\u2019re scary,\u201d she mocked.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d he growled, hating how right she was.</p><p>She shrugged him off. Sean\u2019s shirt, swimming on her petite form and hanging to her knees, slipped off one shoulder. The long sleeves nearly swallowed her hands. Though she\u2019d rolled back the cuffs, the garment was still huge. But as she eased the buttons from their moorings, Callie peeled the cotton open bit by bit, exposing fair, rosy skin. Finally, she shook it off. The white fabric cascaded down her arms and fell to the floor. She stood before him in a nearly transparent bra and a tiny thong.</p><p>Thorpe swallowed. Jesus, Callie killed his self-control. She tested him, pushed him. Did her best to lure him in. Didn\u2019t the girl see that Sean would give her all the tenderness she needed, all the gentle affection he couldn\u2019t?</p> <p>Her little pink tongue peeked out, wetting her lower lip. His cock jerked. With a challenging stare from beneath her dark lashes, still coated with way too much mascara, she turned to start the shower. Soon, steam filled the little bathroom.</p><p>With her back to him, Callie reached behind her to unclasp her lacy, ridiculously sexy bra. It dropped to the floor, and she wriggled out of the thong with an extra sway to her hips. Thorpe\u2019s stare caressed the dark hair that fell in a sleek veil over her fair shoulders, then ended to reveal the exaggerated nip of her waist and flared to the lush curve of her hip. He began to sweat. Her smooth, firm ass\u2014still with a hint of pink from his hand last night\u2014made his cock unbearably hard. He sucked in a harsh breath.</p><p>Callie turned her head, lashes fluttering up. She sent him a hurt stare. So sexy. So tempting him. So fucking wrong because unless Sean was beside him, taking Callie with him, he couldn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>\u201cGo on. There\u2019s only so much water on this boat. I want some, too.\u201d And he thanked fuck that the stall was barely big enough for one. If it had been roomier and she invited him in . . . Yeah, that would only end with his cock buried in some orifice that he had no right to even be contemplating without Sean\u2019s presence.</p><p>Callie stepped in behind the clear Plexiglas and groaned as the hot water cascaded over her soft skin. He watched as she tipped her head back, sluiced water down her throat, her breasts, over her flat abdomen, her thighs. Damn, he needed a distraction.</p> <p>\u201cSoap?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Right. The toiletries Sean had bought earlier. He\u2019d set the bag somewhere . . . In the bedroom, on the floor, he found the plastic sack and carted it into her. He fished out a scented bar, along with a citrus-scented shampoo and conditioner. Sean had even bought a couple of packs of disposable razors and a few cans of shaving cream.</p><p>He started handing items to Callie. She opened the door and took them in silence, then bathed without a word, quickly scrubbing all the makeup from her face and the Glitter Girls grime from her body. She washed her hair, shaved, then basked in the hot water for a minute more. And Thorpe couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. Something about the girl\u2014no, everything about her\u2014was sexy as hell, and fantasies of spreading her across his bed, restraining her, then indulging in every last pleasure he could think of fried his brain.</p><p>The flavor of her slick folds still lingered in his memory, haunting him. Thorpe had discovered in Vegas that when he wanted to make himself unbearably hard and so horny that jacking off eased none of his restless edge, he thought of that. And he thought of how she\u2019d looked as she came for him.</p><p>Suddenly, she groaned, and he yanked his thoughts from his daydream. Thorpe peered closer, visually penetrating the steam to find that she had her hand between her legs, slowly rubbing her clit. Even through the fogged-up shower door, he could see her skin flushing, her nipples peaking. Her breasts rose, then her shoulders fell. She leaned against the white fiberglass of the stall and spread her legs wider with another little moan.</p><p>He nearly fucking lost it.</p> <p>\u201cCallie, you don\u2019t have permission for that.\u201d</p><p>Her sultry eyes fluttered open again, not quite focused. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>Goddamn it, she was goading him. He couldn\u2019t fuck or discipline Callie when he was alone with her. Yes, he had once been willing to cross Sean when he\u2019d thought the fed was a dangerous player. Now? He scrubbed a hand down his face, sweating. But he couldn\u2019t stab Sean in the back. They had an agreement, and he\u2019d live up to his part.</p><p>\u201cNeither of us said you could self-pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean didn\u2019t tell me I couldn\u2019t. And according to you, we\u2019re back to being just friends. I don\u2019t ask my pals for permission to masturbate.\u201d She sent him a sly smile. \u201cOh, I also don\u2019t shower in front of my buddies, but here you are.\u201d</p><p>Fucking son of a bitch. She was right\u2014not about masturbating. That was something every sub understood was a no-no without their Dom\u2019s permission. But he couldn\u2019t claim to be just her friend, then oversee her shower with sick, voyeuristic glee. Or make love to her later, even with Sean, and claim that it didn\u2019t mean a thing.</p><p>Her soft moans lengthened, deepened. Thorpe couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her as she dragged her fingers over her clit in slow, sensual circles. Water poured down her skin. Her breathing roughened. Her nipples beaded even harder. Hell, he was going to lose his ever-loving mind. If he had the right, he\u2019d give Callie the paddling of her life. Then the fucking to match.</p><p>Since he couldn\u2019t, Thorpe absolutely refused to endure this torment a minute more.</p> <p>He yanked open the clear, rigid door between them, grabbed her wrist, and hauled her out. Her drenched form brushed his chest, instantly soaking his clothes and skin. As he dragged her near, he couldn\u2019t miss her dilated blue eyes flaring. Or her rosy cheeks. Her lips were so fucking tempting, parted and red and too damn close to his own.</p><p>Swallowing down his lust, he grabbed her shoulders and shoved her against the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re done teasing me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just relieving tension. It\u2019s been a crappy couple of days.\u201d She arched her hips toward his aching cock. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, friend.\u201d</p><p>Her swollen, saturated cunt brushed against his dick. A half-groan, half-growl tore from his throat.</p><p>When the hell had he ever wanted a woman even half this much?</p><p>Thorpe knew the answer. It wasn\u2019t comforting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been incredibly naughty. Topping from the bottom. Self-pleasuring without permission. Lying to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you lied to me about merely being friends?\u201d she challenged, brow raised. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, Callie was asking for it. Begging. He slammed the bathroom door, enclosing them together in the tiny space. The move was risky, but the only way he could open the cabinet doors. Finally, he reached inside and fished out a bath towel, then wrapped it around her, covering some of her delectable nakedness. Not enough, obviously, because he still wanted to fuck her into next week, but this was the best he could do now.</p><p>Focusing on her freshly scrubbed face, he knotted the white terry cloth just above her breasts, then yanked on it. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She dug in her heels. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking sure you get discipline.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe lifted her and dragged her against his chest. Because Callie was Callie, she resisted him with everything she had, fighting like a hellcat. Against him, she smelled clean and womanly, and as he passed by the bed, he gnashed his teeth to keep from throwing her on the softly rumpled sheets and taking her in every way he knew how.</p><p>Instead, he dragged her toward the galley, fighting off her claws and kicks to the shin.</p><p>He squeezed her tight against his body. \u201cYou have a Dom who loves you and you\u2019re taunting me to take something I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Stop manhandling me.\u201d She gritted her teeth and squirmed for freedom, succeeding mostly in mashing her breasts to his chest.</p><p>Thorpe dug his fingers into her hair and tugged, stilling her. She was going to get the spanking she deserved. Maybe, if the gods looked down on him, Sean would let him dish it out. And if he was more sexually frustrated than indignant on the other man\u2019s behalf, well . . . Callie didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>Once they reached the galley, Thorpe tossed her into the room, trapping her between his body and the small faux wood table attached to the wall. In front of the utilitarian stove, Sean looked up with a spatula in his hand, now wearing trousers, and staring at them with a questioning expression.</p><p>\u201cCallie needs discipline,\u201d Thorpe spit out.</p><p>\u201cDoes she?\u201d</p><p>He shoved down his frustration that he had to explain himself. Couldn\u2019t they just get to the part where Sean tugged the towel off of Callie\u2019s naked body and smacked her lush, damp ass with his hand so he could see her breasts sway and her face flush, watch the shock of the sting become unbearable arousal and . . .</p><p>Thorpe swallowed hard. \u201cShe tried to give herself an orgasm in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Sean slanted his gaze to Callie, then back again. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, knowing full well that I watched her.\u201d He closed in on her, trying not to notice how soft her damp body was or how well she fit against him.</p><p>He hoped to hell that he and Sean would fuck Callie soon. Maybe once would be enough to satisfy this clawing hunger bleeding his self-control dry. Maybe . . . but highly doubtful.</p><p>To his surprise, Sean merely looked down at whatever was in the pan in front of him and began working with his spatula.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d Thorpe questioned indignantly. \u201cSubs are not supposed to touch themselves without explicit permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Sean said calmly, flipping over some egg concoction, not seeming at all ruffled.</p><p>\u201cCallie was topping from the bottom, doing her damn best to entice me when she was supposed to be getting clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d Sean mused, salting the omelet.</p><p>How could the fed not be pissed off at that? He\u2019d never struck Thorpe as stupid, but suddenly he was rethinking Sean\u2019s IQ.</p><p>Thorpe tossed his hands in the air. \u201cShe kept stroking herself even after I told her to stop. She completely disregarded me.\u201d</p><p>Sean smiled faintly. \u201cMinx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? We\u2019ve got to be firm with her. She needs it or she\u2019ll run all over us.\u201d Thorpe felt ready to burst a blood vessel.</p><p>Sean reached for the pepper and shook some on top of the eggs. Thorpe had to restrain the urge to throw the pan against the fucking wall. How could Sean be so damn calm? If he wasn\u2019t going to act, this co-topping crap was never going to work.</p><p>\u201cLovely?\u201d Sean turned her way.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She sounded oddly quiet. In fact, it struck Thorpe as unusual that she hadn\u2019t said a word since he\u2019d dragged her into the galley.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Thorpe, you need discipline quite badly.\u201d</p><p>She bit into her plump lower lip, and Thorpe had to look away. Water dripped from her hair, down her pale, graceful shoulders, disappearing into the cleavage visible above her towel, now slowly unknotting and inching down her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Sean turned to look at him. \u201cI can\u2019t leave these eggs or they\u2019ll burn. Thorpe, we\u2019ve had this discussion. You\u2019re more than equipped to give her whatever she needs while I finish up here. Then we\u2019ll eat.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned away, staring back into the pan. Callie blinked, then turned to look at him.</p><p>A thousand volts of electricity shot straight to Thorpe\u2019s cock. He clenched his fists. \u201cYou want me to spank her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think is proper punishment for her behavior. Once you\u2019re done, I think you should give her that orgasm she sought. She probably needs the release, and I always like to see Callie in pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nearly choked on a thick lump of lust. Hadn\u2019t the son of a bitch seen his erection through his trousers? He must have; it felt the size of Texas. Damn it, if he ripped that towel off Callie and put his hands anywhere on her, much less made her come, Thorpe wasn\u2019t sure he could stop.</p><p>Where the hell was his self-control? His stare roved all over Callie, her damp skin, her dark tresses clinging, breasts half visible, and those blue eyes of hers wide and crushing his ability to think of anything except having her naked under him, clawing at his back, and begging for more.</p><p>\u201cI can definitely do that, but let me be plain,\u201d Thorpe said between gritted teeth, feeling way north of insane. \u201cI want to fuck her.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare meet Callie\u2019s stare or he wouldn\u2019t be responsible for what happened next.</p><p>\u201cYou made that clear last night.\u201d Sean reached to open the microwave and insert a paper plate filled with bacon. \u201cIf you punish her now, we\u2019ll deal with the rest later.\u201d</p><p>Then Sean winked at the girl.</p><p>What the hell kind of Twilight Zone shit had this morning become? Whatever. It didn\u2019t matter. Sean had agreed that her behavior needed correcting, so he\u2019d fucking take care of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorpe sent Callie a hard grin that she would find impossible to interpret as comforting. \u201cFine. I\u2019m all over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. Breakfast should be ready in five.\u201d Sean set a few pieces of bread into the toaster.</p><p>But Thorpe wasn\u2019t listening anymore. He had a few precious minutes to put his hands all over Callie. He didn\u2019t intend to waste even a second.</p><p>\u201cDrop the towel. Every hesitation, bratty remark, or lapse in your manners is only going to make my discipline more unpleasant. Are we clear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her eyes went soft and wide as her fingers loosened the towel.</p><p>The terry cloth unraveled from her body, slithering to the ground. And there Callie stood before him, her petite form shaking and blessedly bare. Need seized his insides. She belonged under his hands, his body, his command. He\u2019d fought it for years. But as her gaze clung to him now, silently pleading for both his hard boundaries and his mercy, he couldn\u2019t deny how badly he wanted the right to touch the girl.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, pet.\u201d He\u2019d dreamed of saying those words to her forever.</p><p>Slowly, gracefully, she knelt before him, her stare unwavering. Without a word, she pleaded. Her desire and anticipation were a punch to his gut.</p><p>Thorpe never took his eyes off her as he yanked a small chair from the little table and sat in it, leaning forward with elbows on his knees to drill her with a hard stare. He steadied himself with a deep breath, finding his balance and center. Knowing he had so few boundaries right now with Callie was immersing him in the most heady Dom space. One wicked idea after another raced through his head.</p> <p>\u201cGood. What I say will be absolute, Callie. No arguments. No questions. No comebacks. This isn\u2019t a demo, and I\u2019m no longer playing. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her voice sounded so breathy and acquiescent. Need seared itself on her face. This passionate Callie was the one he knew\u2014and loved. The one he burned for.</p><p>He sat back in his chair and patted his thigh. \u201cSit on my lap.\u201d</p><p>She rose. It wasn\u2019t quick. Nor was it so slow that he could call it a hesitation, but close. Her lips parted and questions nearly tumbled forth. Callie stifled them. Instead of asking whatever she wanted to know, she merely perched her pretty bare ass on his thigh gingerly, then looked to him for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cYes, like that.\u201d He swallowed back the command to kiss him, to tug down his zipper, to stroke his straining erection before she eased him into the blistering silk of her pussy. But all of that would be what he wanted\u2014not what he\u2019d been granted. Not what she needed. \u201cNow turn to face Sean and put your legs on either side of my knees.\u201d</p><p>Callie responded more quickly this time, rotating on his lap, then settling her back against his chest. Thorpe hissed in her ear as she rested her bare skin against his thin, damp shirt. He gripped her hips, barely restraining the urge to shove his cock against the ripe curves of her ass.</p> <p>He widened the stance of his thighs, parting her legs at the same time. Sean looked up from the eggs, watching raptly. His face told Thorpe that he didn\u2019t really give a shit if the eggs burned.</p><p>Settling his lips against her ear, he whispered, \u201cTilt your head back on my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>Callie shivered, but she obeyed without pause. Her shaky little exhalation left him no doubt that his domination aroused her. Unable to resist anymore, he ground his dick into her pert backside, then caressed his way up her waist, her ribs, until he palmed her breasts and trapped her nipples between his thumb and forefinger, turning and tugging.</p><p>\u201cYou touched yourself to torment me. Didn\u2019t you, Callie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her breathy reply made his gut and his need tighten.</p><p>\u201cWhy, to taunt me with what I shouldn\u2019t take or to seduce me?\u201d</p><p>He felt her draw in a deep breath, then undulate on his lap, sending hot sensation skittering through him again. He tightened his grip on her nipples, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cLovely?\u201d Sean prodded.</p> <p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she admitted with a little cry. \u201cI hated the thought that you wouldn\u2019t show me whether you want me or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you tried to corner me. Very naughty.\u201d One hand left the soft curve of her breast.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word.\u201d His voice reverberated through the little room. \u201cRunning away, stripping in public, staying in hellholes, fighting me, frustrating me . . . You\u2019ve done nothing to earn an orgasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Sean conceded. \u201cScratch that off the list.\u201d</p><p>She moaned in protest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve earned this, pet.\u201d Thorpe spanked the pad of her pussy with his fingers in a stinging blow that awakened and inflamed.</p><p>Callie gasped, arched, thrusting one breast deeper into his grasp. He gritted his teeth. She responded to him even more beautifully than he remembered, way beyond his wildest dreams. Despite her craving for tenderness, she seemed completely capable of taking the edgy side of his nature\u2014and still asking for more. At the thought, what little blood remained in his body rushed to his cock until he felt staggered and dizzy.</p><p>Again, he lightly smacked her pussy enough to sting sweetly. And again. Each time, her folds plumped and slickened a bit more. He couldn\u2019t miss the way her clit swelled and hardened. So he kept on.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Thorpe . . .\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sir to you right now. And I promise, you\u2019re going to beg, little girl. For my mercy and for the pleasure I can grant you . . . if I choose. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, and Thorpe tried to hold it together, fighting the urge to bend her over the little table and work his way into her tight cunt until she\u2019d taken every throbbing inch he had.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d He settled his palm over her swollen folds, gratified to feel her slickness coating the slide of his fingers onto her clit. Gently, he circled her sensitive nub. It hardened to stone. Then he slowed his caress, plying with a swirling, stroking, downright leisurely brush of his fingers. Her breathing grew more labored.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve played with me for the last time, pet. First, you left me without so much as saying good-bye, despite the years I spent sheltering you. Then I found you stripping, of all things, in a place not even clean enough to house rats. I chased you down a fucking alley and told you never to run from me again. What did you do the minute you woke up this morning?\u201d When she hesitated, he barked, \u201cAnswer me, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re in a shitload of trouble, little girl.\u201d</p><p>Callie grabbed his thigh, whimpering as he curled a pair of fingers into the snug depths of her cunt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to speak. I\u2019m not done listing all the reasons I\u2019m displeased with your behavior so you\u2019ll understand exactly why I\u2019m going to make this punishment difficult. Don\u2019t interrupt me again.\u201d</p><p>She writhed and trembled in his arms. \u201cI won\u2019t, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you teased me while you showered, driving me to the brink of sanity. If you\u2019d had any idea just how exasperated I\u2019ve been\u2014worried out of my mind and chasing you all over the damn place, wanting you so fucking much and knowing you were just out of my grasp . . . I\u2019ve reached my limit, Callie. No more.\u201d</p><p>He plunged his fingers deep inside her, rooting around until he found the bit of smooth, sensitive tissue high on the front wall of her passage. He rubbed in mercilessly unhurried circles.</p><p>Toast popped up. Sean plated food. Thorpe gritted his teeth. He wasn\u2019t ready to let Callie go. She hadn\u2019t been punished enough for all her transgressions . . . and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to stop touching her.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast,\u201d Sean said as he set her plate on the table.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to buy clothes pins or chip clips when you went shopping?\u201d Thorpe snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I found some while prowling around in the drawers here,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I need two.\u201d</p><p>Sean turned and rummaged in a drawer as Thorpe shoved Callie\u2019s hair from her neck. As he continued to drag his fingers ruthlessly over her most sensitive spots, he swept his lips up her neck, then nipped at her lobe. On his lap, she gyrated restlessly. Moisture gushed all over his fingers. Her breathing ramped up. She had to be getting close. Now it would get fun . . .</p><p>After a slam of the drawer, Sean turned back. His stare fell on them, his blue eyes turning dark with arousal. \u201cShe looks beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe feels like the most exquisite hell,\u201d Thorpe groaned.</p><p>\u201cCallie always does.\u201d With a little smile, Sean held up the clothes pins. \u201cWhere do you want these?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cON her nipples,\u201d Thorpe instructed Sean. \u201cSuck the buds first. Get them good and hard. Make her feel every pull of your mouth all the way down to her clit.\u201d</p><p>Callie thought she might explode. Thorpe was doing everything in his power to drive her beyond her ability to endure his sensual torture, and now Sean was pitching in to help out. Having both of their hands on her, their bodies crushed to hers, had been a fantasy nearly beyond her wildest imagining for weeks.</p><p>A big smile stretched across Sean\u2019s face. \u201cI like the way you think . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a ton more ideas,\u201d Thorpe assured.</p><p>She\u2019d just bet.</p><p>Callie panted now, every breath a labored cry as he worked her pussy, fondled her clit, and breathed across her neck. He made her suffer, ache. She wanted to cry out, but held in the need. In every way possible, Thorpe was reminding her that he was not only a Dominant, but a Master\u2014the sort of man who would crawl into her head, read her every need, dangle it in front of her until she knelt and pleaded and submitted, then he\u2019d turn her inside out as he fulfilled every dark fantasy.</p><p>Drawing up the other kitchen chair and dropping into it, Sean looked completely on board with that plan.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he murmured as he leaned forward, closer. \u201cGive me your breasts, lovely. Arch to me.\u201d</p><p>With a whimper, she did. She couldn\u2019t help it. Sean grabbed her sides, pulling her closer. He didn\u2019t pounce on her aching nipples right away, though she wished he had. Instead, he hovered over her, palmed back the damp hair that had worked onto her face and plastered to her breasts, then fastened his hand around her nape. He plowed his way past her lips, seizing, taking, wildly devouring her mouth. She melted, gasping into his kiss as Thorpe\u2019s fingers plied her clit with ruthless efficiency. He backed off again when she held her breath. Perspiration sheened her skin, and she keened out with unfulfilled need.</p><p>Sean lifted his head, and he gave her a lopsided smile of triumph. For good measure, he fondled her breasts, pinching her nipples. \u201cNot so eager to run now, are you, lovely?\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it obvious? She couldn\u2019t move now if she wanted to, not when satisfaction was so close and they held the key to her pleasure. To her heart.</p><p>\u201cAnswer him,\u201d Thorpe barked in her ear, then grazed his teeth over her sensitive shoulder.</p><p>Callie shuddered. She thought she\u2019d experienced pleasure before, but this . . . Poems and songs were written about the sort of ecstasy they suspended just out of her grasp. Wars were fought. Kingdoms fell. She had no idea how to do anything but plead and beg for them to put her out of her misery.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir. Please. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>Sean chuckled but didn\u2019t answer her directly. Instead he bent to one of her breasts and took her nipple in his mouth. His suction pulled on the sensitive crest, then zipped a line of fire all the way down to her pussy. Oh, gawd. She only thought she\u2019d been on the knife\u2019s edge of need before. Now?</p><p>Unable to help herself, she filtered her hands through his hair and tugged him closer, wishing desperately that she could make him suck more. Or less. Or whatever would ease this relentless need driving her to madness.</p><p>Instead, Sean backed away and inspected his work. His smile tightened, and he lifted one of the clothes pins to her. Callie\u2019s eyes widened, and a protest sat on the edge of her tongue. The little wooden implement would act like a nipple clamp. She had so little experience, despite living and working at Dominion. She\u2019d never been clamped in any way. No doubt, it would sting at least a little or they wouldn\u2019t bother.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she begged.</p><p>Thorpe stiffened, his voice a dark growl in her ear. \u201cTake your punishment, Callie. You\u2019ve given us no choice for days. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Sean agreed as he cupped her breast and applied the first clothes pin.</p><p>It pressed down on her nipple. Not pain exactly, but a constant, somehow tugging pressure that jolted straight to her clit. Callie gasped.</p><p>With rough fingers, Thorpe pinched her other nipple. The second he released it, Sean sucked it into the burning oven of his mouth and pulled. She dug her fingers into Thorpe\u2019s thighs, trying to take in all the sensations at once. The arousal climbed yet again to something dizzying she\u2019d never imagined possible. Callie groaned, mewled. Neither man heeded the sounds. They seemed intent and eager to keep pushing her. Thorpe set his greedy fingers back over her clit, his circles on her flesh even more torturously slow. Gawd, she couldn\u2019t take much more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSean . . . Thorpe,\u201d she panted. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurn and ache?\u201d Thorpe breathed into her ear. \u201cOh, I know. The way I\u2019ve burned and ached for you for fucking years. I want you to know what it was like every hour of every day I had to be near you, trying to figure out how not to go insane because I couldn\u2019t have more.\u201d</p><p>Sean cut off any possibility of her reply by applying the second clothes pin to her other nipple.</p><p>The pressure times two did more than multiply the pleasure. Somehow, it turned exponential. Her blood flowed like lava. Her pussy throbbed with the pent-up need for release. Her already sensitive nipples ached even more as Sean toyed with the clothes pins, making them gently tug on the hard tips of her breasts, twist and tighten, before he rubbed his fingertip over the top of each.</p><p>Callie dug her nails even deeper into Thorpe\u2019s thighs, writhing and arching.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast time, pet. Sean is going to feed you. You\u2019re going to eat every bite . . . no matter what we do to you. And no coming,\u201d Thorpe said sternly. \u201cIs that understood?\u201d</p><p>Was he out of his mind? Her gaze bounced up to Sean, pleading for respite, mercy\u2014anything. Gently, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do as he says, lovely.\u201d Sean picked up the plate of still steaming eggs. \u201cOpen wide.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, Callie parted her lips. He slid in a strip of bacon. She bit, chewed, swallowed\u2014but didn\u2019t taste anything. Her body felt like a volcano. Her clit burned with the most towering, delicious ache, exacerbated by the pressure on her nipples and Thorpe\u2019s unrelenting fingers driving her up into a sky with no ceiling. When she fell, the crash would be monumental, life altering. She felt on the verge of begging them to allow her to give them anything\u2014or everything\u2014just for ease. Instead, she wriggled on Thorpe\u2019s lap as Sean followed the bacon with an intimate brush of his lips and a stare that made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Callie. I like you all flushed and subdued. And I can\u2019t say that I dislike you being helpless and at our mercy.\u201d Sean chuckled, then fed her a bite of buttery toast.</p><p>She smelled more than tasted it and choked it down, only to encounter a bite of hot eggs on the fork he shoved past her lips moments later.</p><p>\u201cOpen wide,\u201d Thorpe insisted.</p><p>Callie would have called him a bastard son of a bitch asshole if she could have found the words and wasn\u2019t convinced that they\u2019d only heap on more punishment. But Thorpe deserved that and more. Once they\u2019d let her come, she would have to think of something really creatively suitable to repay him for this loathsome torture. If he didn\u2019t stop soon . . . Callie really had no idea what she would do or how she would make it through the next five minutes with her body on fire and ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cAfter she eats, do you want me to cook us something?\u201d Sean asked Thorpe as if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world, fondling her breasts while he spoke.</p><p>Thorpe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll find something quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking. I\u2019m not convinced that we\u2019ll have finished torturing Callie by the time she\u2019s done eating. I think I\u2019ve got just the thing.\u201d</p><p>Barely missing a beat, he reached onto the counter and yanked a box into his lap. Seconds later, they were both munching on protein bars with one hand . . . and stroking her to insanity with the other.</p><p>In the middle of all that, Sean still fed her. Bite after bite passed her lips. She chewed fast and swallowed even faster, hoping that when she finished this meal that maybe there would be an almighty orgasm in her future.</p><p>Lifting her with him, Thorpe rose behind her, withdrawing his hands from her pussy and his lips from her neck before he set her back in his chair. Whimpering, Callie protested. Sean filled her mouth with another bite of egg, then toast. He washed it down with coffee from his cup. Then he took her lips again in a mind-numbing kiss, fingers tumbling into her hair, tongue plunging deep.</p><p>She threw herself against him, and their chests met. Her clamped nipples met his hard flesh, and a fresh riot of sensation ripped through her. She gasped into his kiss.</p><p>Suddenly, Thorpe returned and resumed his position behind her on the chair, his muscled slab of a chest\u2014now bare\u2014pressing into her back. Her skin sizzled at the contact. She hissed. A thousand feelings pelted her\u2014the pressure on her tight nipples, the slight bitterness of Sean\u2019s insistent coffee-flavored kiss, the press of Thorpe\u2019s hair-roughened chest against her back, and the slide of his fingers on her pussy once more.</p><p>The burn of desire decimated her. She couldn\u2019t have fought or refused them anything. All she could do was surrender, hope they would take her, and finally relent\u2014give her the pleasure their every touch promised.</p><p>\u201cYou need us, don\u2019t you, pet? You\u2019re coming apart. I feel your heat. I hear your breathing. I can taste your excitement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make you scream for us, lovely,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d Callie heard the pleading note in her voice and didn\u2019t care. Whatever brought her relief and sanity, whatever urged them to fill and fulfill her, that\u2019s what she needed now.</p><p>\u201cBut not just yet.\u201d Sean swallowed down the last of his protein bar and tossed the wrapper on the table, then looked Thorpe\u2019s way. \u201cYou finished eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Thorpe\u2019s wrapper joined his a minute later, and she heard him swallow in her ear.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We need a bed.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s pulse jumped. A dozen images all leapt to the front of her fantasies as she interpreted what Sean\u2019s words might mean, but the one above all others, dazzling her with want, shimmering hope and promise was the thought of them both giving her all of their desire and making love to her.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she wailed again.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Thorpe swore.</p><p>Gawd, she hoped so.</p><p>His palms heated the insides of her thighs with a possessive caress before his fingers slid back into her drenched folds and he manipulated her clit until she was a breath shy of an orgasm she knew would rob her of all sanity.</p><p>Bucking for more, keening with the need so acute she saw black spots dancing at the edge of her vision, she reached blindly for Sean and fused their lips together in a searing kiss that had her swallowing his lust, feeling his heartbeat against her own, hearing the blood roar in her ears.</p><p>\u201cFuck is right,\u201d Sean muttered as he tore his lips free and lifted her to her feet.</p><p>The second she stood upright, Thorpe grabbed her shoulders and spun her to face him. He clasped her face in his hands and stared down into her eyes. \u201cUnless you stop me, I\u2019m going to fuck you until you can\u2019t stop screaming. Last chance to say no, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I stop you? I need you.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m too old for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what the hell you\u2019re doing,\u201d she argued. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not a tender lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you make me come, I\u2019ll relish every second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re good, lovely,\u201d Sean taunted in her ear.</p><p>Then his fingers found their way to her nipples, toying with the clothes pins clamping them. The pressure there fed the ache below, which he found with his next touch. The caress teased her with just enough sensation to make her knees weak and her blood surge . . . but not enough to send her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u201d Thorpe leaned closer, his lips hovering just over hers. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you so badly . . .\u201d</p><p>Callie melted against him as his gaze and Sean\u2019s hands both caressed her. She felt beautiful. They gave that gift to her just by being here with her. She believed they adored and treasured her. Now she knew they\u2019d do anything to keep her safe. Did they have any idea how desperately and for how long she\u2019d wished to feel like that? In all the times circumstance had forced her to flee whatever rattrap she\u2019d temporarily called home and the strangers who might have become friends in different situations, she\u2019d never really imagined she\u2019d feel like the most precious person in the world to anyone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you, too. Why did you never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually you\u2019ll leave me,\u201d Thorpe choked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to. That\u2019s one reason I stayed at Dominion much longer than I should have.\u201d Callie stood on her tiptoes, inching closer, their stares all but welded together. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll never want to again. If something happens and we\u2019re separated, please believe that I didn\u2019t ever want to be apart from you.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her lips over Thorpe\u2019s. He didn\u2019t need any more encouragement. He met her halfway and claimed her mouth with a possessive sweep of his tongue, drinking her in as if he\u2019d been parched for her. As if she was the elixir that would keep him alive.</p><p>Callie soaked him in, drowned in the heady swamp of the need tugging her under. As she did, Sean caressed his way up her torso to pluck at the makeshift clamps again as his teeth nipped her neck. A shiver shuddered its way through her body. A dizzy fever overcame her. Yet nothing had ever felt so perfect. This was more than a fantasy coming true. She loved them both, and having them with her, wanting her, working together to give her pleasure . . . the rightness clicked into place. She belonged between them.</p><p>If only life or fate or God above would grant her this completeness for the rest of her life, she\u2019d take every opportunity to make them feel this wonderful in return.</p><p>The thought was almost absurd. She had now, this moment. Tomorrow was a crap shoot at best, and the odds were stacked against them. She\u2019d better seize this glorious sliver of time while she could.</p><p>Thorpe lifted his head, breathing hard, his chest sawing up and down. He ripped his stare from her, then glanced over her shoulder to Sean. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Hope suspended her from a tightrope. She didn\u2019t dare say a word or even whimper for fear she would wake up from this lovely dream.</p><p>\u201cYou want Callie, as I do,\u201d Sean pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMore than I want all my tomorrows,\u201d Thorpe vowed, those gray eyes burning down into her.</p><p>She clutched his shoulders a bit harder and felt herself sway toward him. His fingers bit into her hips.</p><p>\u201cLovely?\u201d Sean turned her back to face him.</p><p>Worry lay in his blue eyes. Uncertainty. That expression said he feared that no matter what he did, he would lose her.</p><p>He might not have always been honest with her, but she\u2019d seen the man under the badge when he\u2019d first come to Dominion. It had been evident in the gentle way he\u2019d encouraged her to open up, in the patient way he\u2019d coaxed her until he understood. She\u2019d feared his questions and where they might lead, yes. But she\u2019d feared losing her heart more. In the past few days, he\u2019d risked so much to help her. Maybe she should be more wary, but over the years she\u2019d developed a decent danger meter. Now that she wasn\u2019t freaking out and had started using hers . . . she knew he might be the best man to ever happen to her.</p><p>Callie cupped his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m yours, too, Sean. Always.\u201d At least in my heart.</p><p>Relief spread across his face, and he took her mouth in a slow, searing meeting of lips that made the last few minutes of hesitation evaporate. A well of yearning and desire flowed from her to both of them and back. Callie couldn\u2019t fail to feel it. This was right. It was time.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Sean confirmed, then grinned at Thorpe. \u201cI kept in mind this possibility when I bought provisions.\u201d</p><p>What the heck did that mean? Callie frowned, trying to puzzle out his cryptic statement as Sean reached onto the counter behind him and plucked up a plastic grocery bag, tossing it. Thorpe caught it, parted the plastic handles, and looked inside. Rising on tiptoe, she peeked, too.</p><p>Box after box of condoms lay inside.</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s gaze bounced up to Sean. Then a massive grin broke out. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll be really busy.\u201d</p><p>Sean answered with a smile. \u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>Blood rushed through Callie\u2019s veins as she blinked into the bag. The sight was both thrilling and daunting. \u201cI think that\u2019s enough condoms to glove up a platoon for an entire year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, pet, but we\u2019ll work like hell to keep up. Get ready.\u201d Thorpe tossed the sack back at Sean, then scooped her into his arms and carried her to the bedroom.</p><p>Sean followed them, tearing into the first box and dumping a handful of the foil packets onto the bed beside her head as her back met the mattress. She looked up at the men. Thorpe\u2019s stare penetrated her the way his cock would soon.</p><p>Beside her, Sean half covered her, his lips swooping down for another kiss. Callie met him, giving herself over as she felt the bed on her other side dip under Thorpe\u2019s weight. Through his trousers, his erection pressed against her thigh, big and hard and hot. She moaned, grabbing at Sean\u2019s hair with one hand and Thorpe\u2019s shoulders with the other.</p><p>It should be awkward. She should be nervous. But no. They flowed together, seemingly of like minds and wants from the second they hit the sheets. No bumping, no conflict. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The arousal filling her now was both residual from the guys\u2019 ardent fondling and the deprivation of her orgasm. But more, it stemmed from having their scents combining in her nose, her skin heated by the dual press of their own, the way they began to pass her lips back and forth with devouring kisses. Everything felt right.</p><p>Finally, Thorpe lifted his mouth from hers. He zeroed in on her breasts before sliding a sly stare to Sean, who grinned. Callie stilled. When had they developed this silent guy-speak that\u2014</p><p>The moment they plucked the clothes pins from her nipples and bent at the same time to suck her flesh deep, she screamed. She arched. Blood filled the nubs as their lips surrounded them. Suction tugged, the sensation reaching down like a direct caress to her clit. Oh, hell.</p><p>Then they made that a reality, Sean surging a pair of fingers into her pussy and Thorpe wiggling his way over her clit. Gawd, she was going to combust.</p><p>\u201cGuys . . . please,\u201d she panted. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced you\u2019ve learned your lesson properly, pet. Are you, Sean?\u201d Thorpe growled, making her shudder with need.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tongued his way around her nipple. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet that you understand the full extent of your infractions, lovely. I owe you a red ass for drugging me and running away without talking to me. Or Thorpe, for that matter. I\u2019m also not sure we\u2019ve repaid you properly for taking your clothes off in front of a room full of dregs and losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I swear. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thorpe captured her lips and devoured her mouth in an intoxicating kiss.</p><p>\u201cGood thinking, Thorpe. Callie doesn\u2019t need to be talking just now.\u201d Sean pinched her nipple before he laved it again, then hitched his fingers high inside her pussy, finding the spot designed to send her reeling.</p><p>Callie\u2019s head swam. Blood charged her system, converging between her legs. She twisted, silently begging.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m convinced you\u2019re truly sorry, then we\u2019ll see about your orgasm. Until then . . .\u201d He nipped the side of her breast. \u201cGet on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe slid his fingers over her clit one last time, then sent Sean a frown. But he played along. \u201cThat was a direct order, pet. Move.\u201d</p><p>Her brain struggled to swim through the arousal drowning her body. Finally, the command penetrated her\u2014because their cocks sure weren\u2019t yet\u2014and she rolled over between them, presenting her ass in the air.</p><p>\u201cAh, you look so damn pretty like this.\u201d Sean\u2019s voice had thickened, deepened, as he ran a hand under her body until he palmed her pussy again.</p><p>\u201cYou do, Callie,\u201d Thorpe agreed. \u201cYou look ready to serve and please us. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>As much as her body cried out for orgasm, the opportunity to give them everything they wanted and yearned for made every submissive cell inside her clamor. She could find her own kind of reward in satisfying the men she loved. In fact, her whole body felt as if it glowed at the prospect.</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, Sir. I\u2019m sorry if I worried or upset you by leaving. I meant to protect you both.\u201d</p><p>Sean leaned down into her face, his mien surprisingly stern. \u201cWhat you did was utterly fail to communicate. How can we help you or keep you safe if you don\u2019t let us?\u201d</p><p>Callie opened her mouth to reply, but the sharp crack of his hand on her backside made her yelp instead. Had Sean just spanked her? Yes, and much harder than she would have thought, than even Thorpe had in the past.</p><p>\u201cQuiet now,\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ll take your punishment like a good girl. Spread your knees apart.\u201d Sean waited until she\u2019d complied, then widened them a bit more until her stance was to his liking. \u201cBetter. You can apologize to Thorpe now.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see the two men exchange a glance. Then a look of supreme satisfaction lit up Thorpe\u2019s face. \u201cYes, you can, pet.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his zipper. It fell in the hush. Callie held her breath as he worked the pants down his hips and revealed his thick cock, standing hard as he took it in his fist. The swollen purple head made her lick her lips in hunger.</p> <p>Thorpe shoved his fingers in her tresses and fisted them in his grasp, drawing her down toward the engorged stalk of flesh he palmed slowly up and down. Her stomach clenched. Her pussy wept. For years, she\u2019d had this fantasy of being at Thorpe\u2019s feet, on her knees, completely at his service. Her breath caught as he brushed his cock over her lips, a tease . . . then gone.</p><p>Without thought, she reached up, trying to take his shaft in hand and thrust it into her mouth.</p><p>Thorpe pulled up on her hair, denying her, at the same time Sean slapped her ass again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be greedy and impatient, pet. If you\u2019re apologizing to me, rushing me before I\u2019m ready isn\u2019t the way to convince me you\u2019re sorry.\u201d He released his tight grip on her hair, then clamped his big hand around her face, fingers squeezing the muscles of her jaw. \u201cOpen up. Suck my cock. Make me believe you\u2019re repentant and eager to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to believe it, too, lovely, or there won\u2019t be any fucking in your future,\u201d Sean added. \u201cGo on. And not a sound while I take my pound of flesh.\u201d</p><p>This tag-team discipline probably shouldn\u2019t turn her on so much, but why deny that it made her needy and turned her inside out. Too bad whimpering and begging wouldn\u2019t do her a damn bit of good. Only obedience would.</p><p>Callie hadn\u2019t had many opportunities to really put herself in another\u2019s hands and turn over her will. She wanted to now so, so bad. Yes, they were going to make her wait and ache and beg. But whatever they did would also draw them all closer together . . . for however long it lasted.</p><p>She poured her heart into the pass of her tongue over Thorpe\u2019s cock, licking him lovingly, closing her eyes as if she could preserve the moment forever. Behind her, Sean smoothed his palm over her heated flesh, spreading the warmth. She held in a whimper and restrained the urge to raise her hips to him for more. He slid his fingers down her ass, to her pussy, skimming over her swollen labia, her engorged clit.</p><p>The moment was magical. Callie felt touched all over. She felt adored. And she surrendered completely to the moment. To them.</p><p>Stretching her lips wide, she took Thorpe deep, relishing his hard length filling her mouth. Every corner burst with his scent and taste, so masculine, a bit salty, so very big and musky and perfect. Holding back her moan became impossible as she eased her head back, sucking until her tongue tingled, then dragging her teeth over the sensitive head. Thorpe cursed on a groan.</p><p>Callie sensed more than saw Sean lean around her body to watch. Knowing that his stare fixed on her ignited something in her belly. It was impossible not to want to put on a show and make him remember the moments she\u2019d had her mouth around him, too.</p><p>Soon, Thorpe shuttled his cock from between her lips in a rush, as if he couldn\u2019t feel enough of her. He cursed, his fist tightening in her hair. His excitement ratcheted up her thrill.</p><p>Then Sean kissed his way down her side before resuming his position behind her and settling into a rhythm. Methodically, he swatted her backside until it burned and tingled and lit a fire in her blood.</p><p>Fighting the urge to squirm and plead for mercy was becoming nearly impossible. With their every touch, Callie submerged herself in the most delicious euphoria. She wasn\u2019t sure she could take a deep breath around the bliss. Dizziness swamped her head. Thrill fevered her blood.</p><p>And she loved every minute of it, just like she loved them.</p><p>\u201cPet . . .\u201d Thorpe\u2019s voice deepened, roughened, to something so intimate. She\u2019d listened to the man\u2019s every intonation for four years, but never heard that particular note. She loved the idea that it was something he\u2019d reserved just for her. \u201cCallie, baby. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled around his thick flesh so hard on her tongue and laved him again with all the feeling swirling and pooling inside her. He groaned and tugged on her hair again, vacating her mouth with a pop.</p><p>Callie moaned in protest without thought, blinking up at his big, heaving chest as he worked hard to breathe past the arousal. His jaw was clenched, his nostrils flared. His gray eyes looked stormy and had darkened to something on the verge of a tempest.</p><p>No way she could stop herself from falling helplessly into his gaze. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI damn near came down your throat.\u201d He brushed his thumb over her lower lip. \u201cSomeday, I would love to shudder and climax right inside that pretty mouth. Not today.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and tried to swallow down her disappointment. The idea of Thorpe granting her his pleasure\u2014of pushing him past his restraint\u2014aroused the hell out of her. But she hadn\u2019t earned the right to ask for anything she wanted. This was punishment. Very sexy, amazing punishment, but almost more difficult to bear than anything else she could imagine. They dangled a dear fantasy in her face, then yanked it away. This morning would be full of orgasm deprivation. They would stop her anytime she ached for something too much. She would endure it because she regretted worrying and hurting them, even if it had been for a good cause.</p><p>\u201cI understand, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He caressed the crown of her head, then settled at her nape and urged her up for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cAre you satisfied she\u2019s sorry?\u201d Sean asked, still palming her heated backside and adding a swat every now and then.</p><p>Now that she wasn\u2019t focused on heaping sensation all over Thorpe, the blood and desire throbbed in the cheeks of her ass. A neon billboard would have been more subtle. She gasped, wishing she had the distraction to focus on again. But Sean only ran his hand between her legs once more, settling his fingers over the jewel of her clit.</p><p>\u201cI think I might see a little remorse,\u201d Thorpe drawled. \u201cBut I\u2019m not convinced that she\u2019s sorry enough. I want to be sure that she never intends to run again.\u201d</p><p>Callie swallowed a cry. She didn\u2019t want to flee from them. But if she brought danger or trouble to them and could fix it by leaving . . . she would have no choice.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Sean twirled lazy circles at the top of her mound, right where she needed it most, but never with enough speed or pressure to send her flying. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to work her harder until we\u2019re convinced that she truly understands where she belongs.\u201d A groan tore from his chest. \u201cYour pussy is so slick, lovely. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>Sean lifted her up, resting her back to his chest. He fondled her already sensitive nipples, plucking and pinching. Her head lolled back against his shoulder, and she arched into his touch. She\u2019d barely figured out how to absorb all the hot sensation he forced on her when Callie felt thick fingers nudging her folds in a deceptively insistent touch. Thorpe\u2019s deft, soft stroke against her clit incinerated her ability to hold her tongue.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she panted, then looked at him with dazed, beseeching eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty when you beg, pet.\u201d A little smile played at his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to hearing more of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Sean vowed. \u201cOn your back.\u201d</p><p>Together, they helped her lay supine across the mattress. Thorpe took over the gentle torture of her nipples, flicking the crests, then bending to nuzzle the swells before sucking them into his mouth one at a time. At her feet, Sean gripped her ankles and spread her legs. And she was suffocating in her own need, unable to make her thoughts churn beyond all the ways she craved them.</p><p>When they had her positioned to their liking, she moaned, incoherent sounds of pleading she hoped they understood. Finally, she heard the soft tear of a condom wrapper. Then another. Thorpe climbed off the bed, and she managed to lift her head enough to see him stand at her feet near Sean, who shucked his clothes in record time. Both of them arranged the prophylactic over the strong surging stalks between their legs.</p><p>Thank goodness there\u2019s sex in my future. Without it, Callie was ready to scream or cry or lose her mind. She absolutely knew better than to touch herself. Thorpe had made it entirely clear in the shower that was a big no-no.</p><p>Sean eased onto the bed beside her and propped his head on his hand, his blue eyes glittering with mischief and hot with desire. \u201cSpread wider, lovely. Make me believe that you want us to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even finished the sentence before she bent her knees and parted them as wide as she could.</p><p>Thorpe caressed his way up her thighs and settled between them, the head of his cock nudging her weeping entrance.</p><p>\u201cTake me, pet. Take every inch. Please me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more than to please you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie . . .\u201d he moaned as he impaled her and closed his eyes, grinding. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Finally, after four agonizing years of waiting, Thorpe was inside her.</p><p>She gasped in a huge breath, trying to accommodate him all at once. But with the blood engorging her folds and swells, Thorpe had to fight his way in. A hard thrust, a slow withdrawal. He gnashed his teeth together. His face pulled tight with concentration. He opened his eyes, his stare locking in on hers, penetrating her soul as his cock did the same below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you feel him, lovely?\u201d Sean murmured in her ear, a tantalizing suggestion. \u201cCan you feel how much he wants you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She melted under Thorpe, desperate to take every inch of him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how much I want you, too. I can\u2019t wait to sink into your tight little cunt and feel you close all around me. You know how I\u2019m going to fuck you? I\u2019m going to hammer my way in with a hard stroke that will make you catch your breath. Then I\u2019m going to ease out so slowly, the head rubbing against every sensitive patch. I know what sends you off.\u201d</p><p>He did. God help her, he did. And Thorpe was catching on very quickly, working each inch in with an agonizing plunge and a lip-biting pull until, with every thrust, he managed to settle right against the one spot designed to send her soaring. Then he finally withdrew to the tip and plunged deep in one growling shove and claimed her completely.</p> <p>He settled right against her cervix and awakened another barrage of nerves centered there. Together they fired and tingled. Callie rocked with Thorpe, tilting up to urge him deeper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already discovered that she likes it deep,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I love it that way. Holy hell . . .\u201d Thorpe threw his head back as he inched back and pushed in again. \u201cCallie, pet, I fucking imagined this so many times, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of you, too,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He fitted his hands beneath her hips, grabbed her ass, and shoved inside her, stroke after grinding stroke.</p> <p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Callie,\u201d Sean whispered in her ear between Thorpe\u2019s juggernaut thrusts, then plundered her lips. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it. Your cheeks are so flushed. Your lips are so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to say all the words of need and love bubbling up in her throat.</p><p>Somehow, he knew. He dipped his head again. Her eyes fluttered closed, and he kissed both of her lids. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever wanted you happy. Whatever you need, it\u2019s my pleasure to provide. I will always take care of you.\u201d</p><p>How could she be on the verge of tears and orgasm at the same time? Every tingle and burn, each sensation and ache built in her clenching pussy, her swirling head, and her overflowing heart.</p><p>\u201cI will, too, pet. Anyone who wants to wrest you from me will be in for the fight of their life,\u201d Thorpe vowed as he rode her from one dazzling stroke to the next. As she fluttered around him, her body preparing to soar in the heaven they\u2019d created, he pulled free. \u201cShe\u2019s awfully close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sean chided her.</p> <p>Panting, Thorpe rolled to her right, occupying the space beside her, shoving pillows out of his way and spilling them to the floor.</p><p>Before she could wonder what he was doing, Sean climbed between her legs and surged balls deep in one breath-robbing thrust, crashing against the spot he knew would make her tremble in want. She couldn\u2019t stop her cry of need.</p><p>\u201cYour orgasms are ours, pet,\u201d Thorpe reminded. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t given you permission. He\u2019s in charge of your pussy now. Patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Thorpe nipped at her lobe, and his heavy breath cascaded down her neck, making her shiver and squirm. \u201cDo you think protests are going to induce us to let you come? Who are you here to please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. It pleases us to see you writhe and flush and need.\u201d</p><p>And goodness knew she was doing exactly that, ready to do anything for relief as the feelings surged through her body and the need to come threatened to overtake her. She clamped down on Sean, rising to meet each thrust. She dug her nails into his back, peppered kisses over his cheeks, down his neck. The orgasm was right there, even closer than before. She gave a high-pitched cry.</p> <p>\u201cNow, lovely, didn\u2019t Thorpe just explain? You don\u2019t want to disappoint us, do you?\u201d Sean withdrew and rolled to her left.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cBut it\u2019s so big. Overpowering.\u201d</p><p>Callie couldn\u2019t catch a breath, couldn\u2019t think. She wriggled over to Thorpe, rubbing against him. He pushed her to her back again, then loomed over her, supporting himself on his bulging arms as his knees parted her thighs and he drove in with one savage shove that had her clawing his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She did, anchoring herself to him like a lifeline and trying to hold back the tremendous pressure dammed just under her clit. Frantically, she searched his face for mercy.</p><p>None. He was going to push her up harder and higher. Even as she mourned, she delighted in his control.</p><p>Nor did Callie dare disobey. She really didn\u2019t want to. She\u2019d waited forever to feel Thorpe deep inside her, looking at her like she held his heart. He reached down to cup her hip, the one with the nick in her flesh from that terrible night. He fingered it, soothing it back and forth for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, pet. Stay with me.\u201d He pistoned inside her with ruthless, thorough strokes that had her clawing for more.</p><p>Beside her, Sean tipped her chin in his direction and covered her lips with his. She closed her eyes for a moment and basked in their attention, in the adoration that poured from them both, and let it soak into her.</p><p>As he lifted his lips, he smoothed a kiss to her chin, then pressed it up, giving himself access to her throat. He skated his lips across the sensitive skin there, then worked back to the tight beads of her nipples silently begging for relief . . . for something.</p><p>Thorpe reared back on his knees, never breaking stride, and thumbed her clit. \u201cSo hard. So needy, aren\u2019t you, my sweet pet?\u201d</p><p>Callie honestly couldn\u2019t speak. How did he expect her to hold it together and answer such an obvious question?</p><p>\u201cThe last thing we want now, lovely, is defiance. Answer Thorpe,\u201d Sean breathed against her nipple, then nipped at it with his teeth before soothing the tip with the rub of his tongue.</p><p>The jolt of sensation went straight to her clit, where Thorpe polished it to a lightning thrill with a slow rub that made her insane.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed to gasp out. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The blood and need began converging again, building, building, gathering like a storm. Everywhere she tightened, prepared, breath held. Just one more stroke . . .</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Thorpe heaved as he withdrew from her sweltering flesh and plopped down beside her, panting as if it took everything he had to bring himself under control.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help the protest that slipped free.</p><p>Sean grabbed her chin as he rolled back on top of her and slid home in one devastating stroke. \u201cYes, Callie. Remember your penance? Your punishment?\u201d</p><p>He thrust inside her with strong, deep plunges of his cock that did absolutely nothing but push her ardor higher. Vaguely she remembered why she owed them. But the inferno raging inside her made her yearn for more\u2014for everything.</p><p>Callie forced herself to draw in a breath and center. Above it all, she softened at the notion of being all they needed. Of course she knew that she offered them what they might have gotten elsewhere, but no surrender would ever be given with more heart or love than what she offered.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, lovely. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>Sean gripped her hips and began a unrelenting pace that made her spine twist and her insides melt. She wrapped her hands around his shoulders, then caressed down to his muscled backside to pull him in even deeper, despite the fact that he\u2019d have nowhere to go. The need to feel him deep was pathological, biological.</p><p>Thorpe tunneled his hand into her hair and tugged her face his way until he seized her lips and took control of her mouth, forcing her to open to his kiss, feel the crush of his lips, take the plunge of his tongue, and give him all her soft acceptance and feverish passion in return. He growled into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come, Callie,\u201d Sean insisted.</p><p>That demand was getting harder and harder to meet. Pulling from Thorpe\u2019s lips, she tightened, focused, squeezing her eyes shut and praying she could obey. It wouldn\u2019t be for lack of trying . . .</p><p>Inside her, Sean thickened. He pumped harder. A second later, he cried out in a deep sound of agony as he stiffened and pressed himself as far inside her as he could, rooting around as if he\u2019d found home. His cry of ecstasy echoed in the bedroom. Callie whimpered like a wounded thing to hold back her need to join him, to celebrate this moment that might not ever come again.</p><p>With a groan from the bottom of his chest, he exhaled against the side of her neck, and managed to push himself up enough to press the lightest brush of kiss on her lips. He worshipped her with a starkly blue stare.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Callie,\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p><p>Then he rolled away.</p><p>Callie lay still, her toes curled and her fists clenched to ward off the horrific need roiling inside her. Mind over body. You can do it. She dragged in more breaths, fighting to control the arousal and the throbbing flesh between her legs, insisting on more.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t come close to recovering before Thorpe made his way into the crook of her spread thighs again and hovered above her. With total abandon, he plowed into her. In a lightning-fast barrage of thrusts, he took everything he needed from her, including her sanity.</p><p>Callie curled her arms around him. His back was slick with sweat and effort. He heaved in a breath with every shove inside her. And damn it, he swelled inside her as his strokes became even more insistent.</p><p>Like Sean, he meant to find his orgasm and leave her body needing and her soul bleeding as a lesson. She\u2019d earned it, but gawd it hurt\u2014in a strangely glorious way. Giving them control of her climax was her giving herself. If they needed that power, if they had to have a show of her penitence, she vowed to suffer.</p><p>Sucking in a breath as Thorpe\u2019s strokes shortened, deepened, pounding, pounding, she waited, eyes clenched shut and struggled to give herself over and hold her pleasure back.</p><p>Sean tangled his lips with hers so very gently. \u201cCome, Callie. For us.\u201d</p><p>Had she heard that right? She opened her eyes wide to see the soft smile on his face. Yes. He\u2019d given her a gift because he loved her, not necessarily because she\u2019d earned it. She\u2019d torn off his collar because he\u2019d lied to her\u2014in the name of duty. But he hadn\u2019t lied about what really mattered. He had been true to his heart. While she had run, hidden, and tried to cut him out of her future and her feelings.</p><p>And still he managed to forgive her. No wonder she loved this man.</p><p>\u201cNow, pet!\u201d Thorpe thundered into her pussy. \u201cDamn it, Callie. Yes. Oh, fuck. That\u2019s it. Perfect. Now,\u201d he groaned long and low. \u201cCome!\u201d</p><p>The pressure grew, pleasure surged. It was as if a weight had been lifted from her body. From her soul. She was free to fly, to soar and bask in their adoration. The submission she\u2019d always craved giving but never had the freedom to grant, made her spill into bliss with more abandon than she\u2019d ever experienced or imagined.</p><p>She peaked, then screamed as she hurtled endlessly through the pleasure. She roared out in body-twisting ecstasy. Thorpe was there to catch her, grounding her with a sure embrace and plunging strokes. He prolonged the exquisite sensations by digging against her most sensitive spot. She cried out, shuddered, dizzy, floating, flying again . . .</p><p>Sean kissed her jaw, squeezed her hand, praising her with whispers she barely heard as she tried to catch her breath and find a way to bring her soul back into her body.</p><p>Finally, Thorpe grunted, then collapsed over her and rolled to her side. Together they surrounded her, cuddling her, both trailing their lips across her skin. She turned to each, back and forth, as the floodgates of her heart opened wide for the first time in her life. Tears spilled, joyous, her smile wobbling. She clutched the moment tight, wishing she could bask here forever.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>LATE that afternoon, Sean wandered into the galley in search of Callie. His world righted on its axis when he spotted her near the sink, gulping down water. A smile slid across his face that was probably sappier than hell, but he didn\u2019t even know the right words to describe how beautiful she was to him with the tangled gloss of her hair spilling down her back and her lithe form silhouetted under his once-pristine dress shirt.</p><p>He slipped his arms around her waist and kissed her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough of you, lovely.\u201d</p><p>But he was certainly trying. After their first go-round in the bed, he and Thorpe had rested with her between them. They\u2019d all drifted off, and Sean had awakened to a nose full of Callie and a cock harder than stone. She\u2019d welcomed him with open arms, her kisses so clinging and poignant. It hadn\u2019t taken Thorpe very long to join in, availing himself of her mouth while Sean drowned in her pussy and took for himself an orgasm like the one he\u2019d allowed Thorpe to give her. He\u2019d given her several more for the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>Every touch she\u2019d bestowed on him felt infused with her love. He\u2019d never wanted that devotion from another woman. But like everything else with Callie, she was simply different. She filled some void in him he hadn\u2019t known was missing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She set down the bottle of water, then turned in his arms with a little smile. \u201cWell, you bought a year\u2019s worth of condoms and you did warn me . . . Not that you\u2019ll hear me complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d He gripped her hip and settled a kiss on her swollen lips. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She sent him a saucy grin with blue eyes dancing mischievously. \u201cThe sex isn\u2019t exactly scarring me for life, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know, but no. Let\u2019s start at the beginning. Why did you run from Dominion without talking to me? Or to Thorpe? I hate that you felt that you couldn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lied, Sean.\u201d When he opened his mouth to argue, she cut him off. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. It was your job. You weren\u2019t untruthful about your feelings. I get all that. Just understand that I thought you might be an assassin or something. And if that was the case, I certainly wasn\u2019t going to give you the opportunity to shoot me while I was busy asking why you knew my true identity and had a gun. And I refused to put Thorpe at risk by running to him for help.\u201d</p><p>Arguing with that logic would get him nowhere. She\u2019d kept herself alive by being cautious. And walking away from everyone who\u2019d ever mattered. He was going to have to break that last habit. Maybe when he\u2019d begun having feelings for her, he should have come clean. Or maybe she would have just run sooner. It was all moot now. They were finally getting everything out on the table. He wanted to clear it so they could stop the danger to her and have a future.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I can\u2019t have you running off again. I don\u2019t think my heart can take it, lovely.\u201d</p><p>She cupped his cheek and frowned. \u201cSean, think about what you\u2019re saying. Hell, what you\u2019re doing. By your own admission, you\u2019ve been married to your job for the last decade. I can\u2019t let you give that up for me. It\u2019s your career. Your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you are. Make no mistake. I won\u2019t give you up. If you don\u2019t love me and want to leave, I can\u2019t stop you. But I refuse to walk away from you because my boss might be pissed off. I won\u2019t abandon you when you\u2019ve got danger breathing down your neck. Someone wants you dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t know who or how to stop it. The best thing I can do for you is give you all the time and love possible, then quietly leave. If you\u2019ll say I gave you the slip and let me have a head start\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not love me?\u201d he cut in.</p><p>\u201cI do, Sean. More than I can even tell you.\u201d She gripped his face in her hands, her eyes tearing up. \u201cBut the day my family was murdered and I ran, I gave up my future. I didn\u2019t really understand at the time, but I can\u2019t argue with the facts.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the softest, saddest kiss on his lips\u2014meaning it as the beginning of her good-bye.</p><p>Sean refused to let that stand.</p><p>He jerked back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop fighting for you.\u201d</p> <p>Tears swam in her eyes. \u201cI think you should. You\u2019ve already given me an incredible gift with your love. I don\u2019t get involved with people. It may not seem like much, but it\u2019s very scary for me to tell you that I love you. I\u2019m saying it because it\u2019s true and important to me that you know. I don\u2019t even have the words to tell you how touched I am that you\u2019ve risked so much to help me. Or that you let Thorpe share this time with us. Why? You hated him back in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>The last few days had been a blur, and he\u2019d been so tired sometimes and stressed that he didn\u2019t always know his name. But he was totally clear on this answer. \u201cBecause you love him. His experience and control lets you feel safe. You\u2019ve known him for so long that trust is easy.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBesides, having someone help me watch your back has been beneficial. And having another pair of hands to spank your ass when you get out of line has come in handy, too.\u201d</p><p>Sean tried to pass the last line off as a joke, but Callie wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cI\u2019ve loved him for a long time. Please don\u2019t think that means I love you any less. And I want you to know that no matter what happens with Thorpe or the future, it won\u2019t change how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>Sean smoothed back her hair and met her with a smile. \u201cThank you, lovely. I needed to hear that. I wish it sounded less like you intend to leave me. You have such a big heart to give. Thank you for sharing it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made it impossible not to fall in love with you. I\u2019ve never felt this way, as if you came into my life . . . and supported me so perfectly. Suddenly, the ground under me felt solid. I wasn\u2019t lonely or lost anymore. I was afraid to trust you. I\u2019ve wanted to give you everything I could in return, but I didn\u2019t know how to get past my fear. And now, I don\u2019t ever want to let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. Share your mind and heart with me. Give me your trust and honesty. You\u2019ve been alive, but you haven\u2019t really lived, Callie. I want to help you do that and be with you every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>Callie hesitated for a long moment, looking up at him like he was her everything. \u201cIf you\u2019re really not going to save yourself and let me go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made myself clear.\u201d He shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019m yours.\u201d Callie threw herself into his arms, burying her face in his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll stay as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s heart swelled. He could have never guessed that this case would change not just his workaholic ways, but show him all he\u2019d been missing. Callie had awakened him to love.</p><p>\u201cBe prepared to grow old with me,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll keep you safe so we can have that future together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that more than anything. And I\u2019ll try every day to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Sean caressed her silky hair and her velvet cheek. \u201cAs will I. But I don\u2019t want you to be crushed if Thorpe doesn\u2019t stay with us. He loves you, too, but he\u2019s quite resistant to the \u2018picket fence.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Callie tried to shrug as if it didn\u2019t matter, but Sean knew better. \u201cI never expected him to want me, much less stay. I mean, he probably opened a BDSM club because it was a great way to meet like-minded women and play with a different one every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he opened Dominion. He definitely wants you, but he\u2019s kept his distance because he\u2019s just a man with his own insecurities. And you have the power to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? He\u2019s ignored me for the last two years. When he first cut me off, I missed him so much, it was like physical pain. Then I wondered if subconsciously I wanted his love so badly because my relationship with my father had been so fucked up and now he was dead or something else stupid and Freudian like that. But then it didn\u2019t take long to realize the feelings were totally different. That I just . . . wanted Thorpe. You\u2019re right that he\u2019s always made me feel safe.\u201d Tears spilled down her cheeks, and she swiped them away. \u201cSorry. Crying to you about Thorpe seems insensitive. Trust me, I\u2019m more thrilled to have your love than I can ever express.\u201d</p><p>Sean kissed her forehead. He could feel her pain and uncertainty just standing close to her. Exhaustion played a role, sure. But there was more. \u201cI don\u2019t want your gratitude. I\u2019ll love you, regardless. I want you to know that, if Thorpe doesn\u2019t stay, I\u2019m going to use this time to learn what he gives you and try to provide it. We\u2019ll manage, all right?\u201d</p><p>Even more tears fell. \u201cYou\u2019re the best man I\u2019ve ever met. I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve you, but I\u2019m the luckiest woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>Sean kissed her reverently. She pressed her lips to his in a gesture that worshipped and communed. She clung to him. In that moment, he had no doubt whatsoever that he had her heart and that he\u2019d made the right choices, difficult though they\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cThat question intimates that you think you deserved the last nine years. You didn\u2019t. You\u2019ve had a bad lot, but you\u2019ve still kept a kind heart. Watching you smile, working to earn your trembling trust, always trying to guess what unpredictable mess you\u2019ll get up to next . . . it made me appreciate you. Besides, you\u2019re damn sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto in double for you.\u201d She winked his way, then leaned in, resting her head on his chest.</p><p>Sean wrapped his arms around her and just felt her heart beat against his for a long, silent second. He didn\u2019t expect their near future to be full of peace, but he drank in this moment when most was right with his world.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I should be more put out with you.\u201d She sighed. \u201cA houseboat? Really?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI had to be sure you weren\u2019t going to get away from me, and I can\u2019t watch you twenty-four seven. Since you don\u2019t swim, bringing you out on the lake was the next best thing. In the middle of the week with winter closing in, I think we may be the only boaters out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneaky.\u201d She said it almost like a compliment. \u201cBut I guessed that after the computer in the pizza box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked that myself.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut if you want to talk about sneaky . . . what was in my wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmbien.\u201d</p><p>Callie was the only woman he knew who could wince and flash a smile at the same time and somehow make it look adorable.</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t do it again or I\u2019ll have to paddle your ass but good.\u201d</p><p>The mischief on her face was like a flirtation all its own. By all rights, he should at least need a good shower and a decent meal before he wanted to fuck her again. But no. He was already contemplating whether the kitchen counters were the right height to spread her legs and plow between them.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s supposed to be a deterrent, it\u2019s not working,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Sean laughed out loud. This was something else he loved about Callie\u2014her playful side. He\u2019d been so damn serious for so damn long. Not much to joke about fighting crime on a federal level, but somewhere along the way, he\u2019d forgotten to stop and smell the roses. Callie\u2019s life had been far more dangerous and stressful than his own, but she still found ways to smile. He admired her grit and intelligence. If his grandparents were still with him, they would have loved her.</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019re going to have to talk about everything, don\u2019t you? The night your family was killed, anything you can remember that might be relevant? Who came after you as you moved around\u2014anything that might help us pinpoint who wants you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Thorpe said, entering the kitchen wearing only a pair of trousers and looking freshly showered. \u201cAs much as I\u2019ve enjoyed being distracted by your beautiful body and the incredible sex, now we have to tiptoe through your past.\u201d</p><p>THORPE sidled closer and pressed a kiss to the top of her head. Then he tipped her chin up to him so he could look into her eyes. \u201cI always hoped I\u2019d get to ask you questions so I could truly understand you, pet. But not in circumstances like this.\u201d</p><p>Callie ached to ask why he\u2019d never told her that he knew her true identity. But she couldn\u2019t, not anymore than she could be greedy and demand more from him if he wasn\u2019t prepared to give it. Besides, it was more important to focus on whoever was chasing her. She might not be able to stop them, but finding out who it was would definitely help her evade trouble in the future. Thorpe wasn\u2019t going to suddenly and magically fall in forever love with her. Contrary to what Sean thought, Thorpe wanted her; he worried about her. He cared. And that was it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about that night over and over. Everything seemed normal until I heard the gunshots downstairs. I thought my dad was in bed, so I was just about to sneak out the window and meet Holden.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe actually growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to find out where that prick is now and repay him for what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>He was such a protector, and it was one of the things that drew her. He\u2019d always been ready to tear the head off anyone who hurt her. When he was around, it was so easy to trust that he had everything absolutely under control. Sean reminded her that there was tenderness in the world. He\u2019d made her believe that she mattered to someone. He was her pillar of strength. And her tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think justice is being served.\u201d Sean grinned.</p><p>She sent back a wobbly smile. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d His blue eyes glinted with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to look him up every now and then, when I could make my way to a public computer at a library so that nothing could be traced back to me. I really do think he got his just rewards.\u201d She faced Thorpe. \u201cHis parents moved to Kentucky about six months after he bailed on me. Within a few months, he\u2019d gotten some girl pregnant. She had no money and a really mean father. They got married not too long after that, and I\u2019m pretty sure it was at the business end of her daddy\u2019s rifle. After three kids and seven years, she left him and took everything they had. He was too stupid to hold down a job, so he robbed a convenience store with a handgun. He\u2019s all locked up. He was always pretty, so I\u2019m betting he\u2019s really popular in prison.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorpe seemed to turn that story over in his mind. \u201cI wish I could have gutted him myself, but we have bigger fish to fry now. Let\u2019s go back to the night your father and sister were killed. Is there any way Holden could have been involved?\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head before Thorpe had even finished the sentence. \u201cHe\u2019s far too dumb to be that stealthy. He wasn\u2019t violent, just greedy. I know now that he was more interested in my family\u2019s money than in me. He always wanted whatever he didn\u2019t have to work for. If he had broken into our house with a gun, he wouldn\u2019t have shot my family, taken a swipe at me, then fled. He would have stayed to rip off whatever he could. He got caught at the robbery because the cashier, who looked like a female sumo wrestler, decided that she wasn\u2019t going to take his shit and tackled him. She pinned him down and called the cops. Besides, that night . . . witnesses placed him a few streets over, and there\u2019s no way he could have done all the shooting, then beat me back to his car without being winded or having blood splatters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his friends? Would any of them have helped?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any guy friends anymore. He\u2019d slept with all of their girlfriends or sisters at some point. He was universally regarded as a douche.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you liked him why?\u201d Thorpe looked like he was grinding his teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe was cute and had really pretty eyes. When you\u2019re sixteen, that\u2019s important.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDid he sleep with your sister?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Callie let her eyes slide shut. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She drew in a deep breath and forced herself to face them again. \u201cRight after school started that year, I came home from cheerleading practice early one day and found Holden there with Charlotte, supposedly waiting for me. She looked flushed, and he seemed winded. They told me they\u2019d just come in from outside. The temperature was still hot. I wanted to believe them. Knowing what I know now about Holden, I\u2019m sure he tried to seduce her.\u201d</p><p>The guys exchanged a glance, and a gong of foreboding rang in her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Spit it out. What do you know?\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed. \u201cAccording to Charlotte\u2019s autopsy record, she was nine weeks pregnant when she died.\u201d</p><p>A wave of incredulity overcame Callie. Tears stung her eyes. She had a hard time breathing. In some ways, she was too shocked to be anything but numb. But as if she couldn\u2019t stop the march of time and emotions, a blade of betrayal stabbed her right in the heart.</p><p>\u201cThen it had to be Holden. I knew she had a crush on him. I won\u2019t ask what he was thinking; I know. He must have laughed at taking the virginity of two sisters. But what the hell was Charlotte thinking?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shrugged. \u201cThat she would be important to him, perhaps. Come here, pet.\u201d</p><p>When he tried to pull her into his arms, Callie resisted and twisted away. \u201cDon\u2019t. Not now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not Holden.\u201d Thorpe\u2019s gray eyes looked like thunderclouds under the scowl of his dark brows.</p><p>\u201cShe just needs time,\u201d Sean argued. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot for her to take in.\u201d</p><p>Callie shot him a grateful look as she wrapped her arms around her waist and tried to absorb the fact that she\u2019d been deceived by the sister she\u2019d loved. But Charlotte had always been a difficult child, always lashing out as if punishing the world for taking her mother. She\u2019d always required more love than any one person could give.</p><p>\u201cIn retrospect, I should have realized that she\u2019d be vulnerable to someone with a smooth tongue like Holden. But I didn\u2019t want to imagine that either of them would do that to me.\u201d She sighed raggedly, trying to cycle past the blow that probably shouldn\u2019t have been a blow at all. But the revelation, even all these years later, was still like a bomb going off inside her. \u201cI think I knew about two hours after we ran away from my house that I\u2019d made a huge mistake with him, but I was in shock and terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sean soothed, but he didn\u2019t try to touch her. He only made himself available in case she wanted the support. Bless him.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>\u201cIs there any chance that Holden and your father argued about Charlotte\u2019s pregnancy?\u201d Thorpe asked. \u201cThat Holden shot him, then maybe he and your sister wrestled over the gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There were no voices in the house, just gunshots. My father was a quiet man, and he might not have raised his voice with Holden if he\u2019d known about Charlotte\u2019s pregnancy, but Holden would have yelled. He was rebellious and wanted to be heard. And heaven knows that Charlotte would have put in more than her two cents. Neither one of them could shut up. Besides, he wouldn\u2019t have been smart enough to wipe the gun clean and plant it in my room to frame me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe crime scene reports make the whole event sound methodical. Professional,\u201d Sean said in agreement. \u201cWhoever did this knew exactly what they were about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came to kill. There were no struggles or scenes. As far as I know, they didn\u2019t try to extort money from my dad or rob the place. He had millions worth of art in the house and an underground safe with a lot of cash in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever killed him blasted their way into the safe,\u201d Sean confirmed. \u201cBut the cash was still there, as well as the art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever did this wanted something specific.\u201d Thorpe crossed his arms over his chest, visibly restraining the urge to hit something since he couldn\u2019t find the someone who deserved it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what.\u201d Callie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one else had an ax to grind with your father?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d really tried to figure it out, and of course she didn\u2019t know everything about her father, but . . . \u201cThe only possibility I can think of is a woman. After my mother\u2019s death, Dad didn\u2019t date or really get involved. He kept a mistress in a loft by his office downtown. About twice a week, he\u2019d disappear for a few hours. He\u2019d get cranky when he moved one out and had to find another. That happened about every six months, as soon as one got comfortable enough to want more out of the relationship than baubles and sex. I overheard him once on the phone. He told whoever she was that she wasn\u2019t his first mistress and wouldn\u2019t be the last. The woman moved out the next day. But that was at least three or four months before his murder. He had a new mistress by then, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a crime of passion,\u201d Sean pointed out. \u201cIt was a surgical strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny greedy family members you\u2019re aware of?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>\u201cDad was an only child. Mom was an orphan. So no. I\u2019m not supposed to know that I have an illegitimate older half brother. He\u2019s definitely bitter, but last I heard, he had two kids and sold cars for a living. Why would he wait into his twenties, then decide to come after his father? If he\u2019s pissed about missing out on the money, why resort to murder rather than blackmail? He wasn\u2019t mentioned in my dad\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Pacing, Thorpe speared Sean with a glance. \u201cAnd the bureau has no other suspects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve combed phone records and financial transactions. Nothing suspicious. Your father didn\u2019t keep tight security, much less video surveillance, so that\u2019s a dead end. The staff we interviewed were either gone or asleep when it happened. Their hands were all tested for gunpowder residue and came up clean. They were openly weeping when they realized your father was dead. It\u2019s not impossible one of them was guilty, but again, wouldn\u2019t they have stolen something if they\u2019d gone to the trouble of killing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey loved him.\u201d Callie shook her head. \u201cThey had been with him for decades, in most cases. He didn\u2019t part with our nanny until Charlotte turned thirteen. Most of our classmates didn\u2019t have a nanny much past ten. And the only reason Dad let Frances go was because she had to take care of her elderly mother. One thing about my father, when he loved someone, he was as loyal as the day was long.\u201d</p><p>Sean scrubbed a hand down his face and joined Thorpe, pacing in the small galley. They bumped shoulders and grunted a nonverbal apology at one another. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be missing something. Let\u2019s try looking at this from a different angle. Tell us what made you bypass Logan\u2019s contact at the Vegas airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was really weird. I had my disguise, just in case. I know security in airports can be ridiculously high-tech, so I was all ready. I changed on the plane. Since I was last off, no one noticed. I stopped in the bathroom to check myself and found a red pull-along someone had shoved in the trash can because one of the wheels was stuck. But it disguised my duffel, so I swiped it. I was ready to meet Elijah. Logan had shown me a picture of him before putting me on the plane. I had his number, too.\u201d She shrugged, remembering that day. \u201cWhen I hit baggage claim, the first thing I noticed was some big guy in a uniform. I drifted toward the smoking area and watched him through a window. Imagine my shock when I realized that he was flashing a picture of me\u2014taken in the New Orleans airport just a few hours earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you panicked,\u201d Thorpe guessed.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah! Instead of waiting around, I left. I was worried this guy would figure out the connection between me, Logan, and Elijah, and hunt us down. I didn\u2019t want to make the guy\u2019s life harder since I knew he had a wife and kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went into the city with the idea of getting a job as a stripper?\u201d Thorpe raised a brow at her.</p><p>Boy, for a man who\u2019d seen a lot of nudity at Dominion, he was acting like it was a big freaking deal that she\u2019d taken half her clothes off for a few dollars.</p><p>\u201cMitchell Thorpe . . .\u201d She put her fists on her hips.</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cWatch your tone, pet. I have no problem putting you over my knee again. If your ass isn\u2019t sore enough yet for you to mind your manners, I can fix that.\u201d</p><p>A fact she was beginning to know well. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that I\u2019ve worn bikinis with less material to Dominion pool parties, and you didn\u2019t have a spaz then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just watched you like a hungry dog all afternoon, then went back to my room and jacked off. But I digress.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? Callie blinked at him. She hadn\u2019t guessed that he had more than a fleeting thought about her sexually in the last two years.</p><p>\u201cThe amount of clothing isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the intent. You meant to arouse other men with what I considered mine. I know Sean felt the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, lovely. You could wear a skimpy bathing suit at such a party, and if you meant it for us, I would probably smile. And get into a fight with any asshole who thinks he\u2019s going to lure you away. But a striptease for money for all those strangers . . .\u201d Sean gnashed his teeth.</p><p>Had they gone to the same caveman school? Apparently so. They\u2019d both graduated with honors, too. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so I had to get to the city and find work fast. I had to secure a place to live, buy food, and make enough money for a bus ticket out of town. It wasn\u2019t like I hopped on that stage as a big \u2018fuck off\u2019 to either of you.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a glance. It was clear that neither of them liked the direction of this conversation. Thorpe bristled, crossing his arms over his chest to glare down at her with a gaze that promised hell later.</p><p>Callie melted back in one of the galley\u2019s chairs, biting her lip. She\u2019d pushed the Dom in him too far. Best if she shut up and picked her battles. If she was smart, she\u2019d change the subject now and distract him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to talk about the man in uniform at the airport?\u201d</p><p>Sean rolled his shoulders, as if trying to shrug off tension. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, grateful to him for the return to business. \u201cJust the uniform. It looked military . . . but it didn\u2019t exactly seem standard issue.\u201d She tried to picture what was different in her head, but drew a blank. \u201cSomething was off. The color, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they BDUs?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Callie frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamo,\u201d Thorpe supplied.</p><p>\u201cNo. They were a pale blue.\u201d</p><p>Sean scowled. \u201cLike the Coast Guard? Pale blue shirts with navy pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Both the coat and pants were the same color. More of a pale grayish blue. And they were dressier, for sure. Almost formal. The coat had patches and medals and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean insignia?\u201d He looked amused.</p><p>\u201cYes. Lots of chevron stripes and braided rope and crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize any of it?\u201d</p><p>Callie held up her hands. \u201cWhen would I have had time to study military uniforms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d Sean scowled. \u201cDid he wear a hat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. One of those beret things. It looks funny on a guy built like the side of a mountain. He thought he was a real badass, too. I could tell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you overhear him give his name or rank or branch of service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t say any of that. He told people that he was meeting his girlfriend, but that she hadn\u2019t come off the flight. A few people remembered seeing me get on, so he knew I\u2019d been on the plane. He had old ladies searching the bathroom. When some dude headed for the smoking lounge, I slipped out with my bag and caught a cab. You know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never seen that uniform before?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>Callie paused, scanning her memory. \u201cNo, I think I have. But it seems like it\u2019s been forever ago. I just can\u2019t place it.\u201d</p> <p>Now that she remembered it, she flipped back through memories, years, locations. Not since she\u2019d arrived at Dominion. Not while she\u2019d been running before then. At home. With her father.</p><p>\u201cWait! A man came.\u201d Her heart pounded. \u201cTo our house. Not long before the murders.\u201d The memory sharpened, coming into clear focus. \u201cAn older man\u2014not like the young guy from the airport. But I think they wore the same uniform. My father took him into his office. They argued. I remember it because Dad almost never raised his voice. He did that day. When I asked him about it later, he just said the man was pressing for a political donation and didn\u2019t want to take no for an answer. I let it go.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cDid you ever see the older man in the uniform again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My father was largely a recluse. He met with very few people, especially at the house. When I was a kid, the only person who came over with any regularity was some sort of medical researcher, Doctor . . . Aslanov, I think.\u201d Callie frowned. \u201cBut he stopped coming around when I was ten or so.\u201d</p><p>Sean searched around for a piece of paper and jotted some notes. \u201cYes, I know who he is. Doctor Aslanov researched cancer. I know your father funded quite a bit of his work for about five years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Like he thought it would bring my mother back.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe came closer then and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, pet.\u201d</p><p>About her mother? Yes, she was, too. He seemed very sorry about Holden and Charlotte, as well. They both did. She drew in their sweet empathy.</p><p>Callie softened in his arms, and Sean joined them. They cocooned her in warmth and acceptance. Love. She kissed them each briefly, then backed away. They still had work to do.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that the man who came to your house in uniform didn\u2019t drop in on your dad for a political donation,\u201d Sean said. \u201cAny guesses about why he was really there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. I didn\u2019t get involved in Dad\u2019s stuff. I was a typical teenager, too wrapped up in my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo . . . if we don\u2019t know who visited your house in uniform and we don\u2019t know what he wanted, let\u2019s talk about what the police found at the crime scene after the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said my home was ransacked?\u201d Callie frowned and wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cI remember that big, gorgeous house like it was yesterday. Double grand staircases with white marble, wrought iron railings, and so much natural light. The house always seemed so . . . pristine. It was a reflection of my mother, and Dad never changed it. I can\u2019t imagine it torn apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the pictures,\u201d Sean said softly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a lot of time in the house before the police arrived, but they searched in every nook and cranny, every drawer, closet, and niche.\u201d</p><p>That shocked Callie. \u201cThey had to have worked fast in over sixteen thousand square feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like they knew the layout of the house,\u201d Thorpe surmised.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt was public record. Architectural Digest had done a spread on the house about a year prior. It showed the floor plan.\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed. \u201cI\u2019m looking for logic. Why would anyone come in, kill the occupants of the house, then tear it apart to take one item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything had been stolen. What did they actually take?\u201d She searched her memory for all the treasures her father had in his possession. As a man who\u2019d come from enormous wealth and had a talent for growing it, he\u2019d had some priceless treasures. But if the killers hadn\u2019t taken any of the art or the cash, what had they sought?</p> <p>\u201cAn Imperial Faberg\u00e9 egg. It\u2019s worth about . . . eighteen million dollars, give or take a few pennies. I can\u2019t imagine someone stealing it for profit, but we\u2019ve never seen the egg for sale, even in the most illegal channels. It doesn\u2019t seem likely that hardened criminals would break in and kill simply to decorate their mantel.\u201d</p><p>Callie flushed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take it. I did. It\u2019s in my backpack. My backpack! Where is it? I left it in my hotel room in Vegas and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe brought it with us, lovely. Take a breath. Relax,\u201d Sean advised. \u201cWhy did you take the egg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s. It was all I had of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare and incredibly expensive. You\u2019ve been carting it around for nine years while living in slums?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know. But it\u2019s not like I could have rented a safe-deposit box or anything. My consolation was that if anyone ever thought about swiping it, in those neighborhoods, they probably wouldn\u2019t have had a clue what it was. After all, it\u2019s one of only about six dozen to survive the Bolshevik Revolution.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou had that egg in my club for four years?\u201d</p><p>Callie nodded. \u201cIt was kind of a relief. No one was going to steal it from there. They didn\u2019t dare come in my room or you would remove their heads from their bodies in the most unpleasant way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Thorpe concurred, smiling as if pleased with himself.</p><p>It was . . . cute.</p><p>\u201cI never imagined you took that egg,\u201d Sean admitted. \u201cOne way the bureau tracked you was your pattern of leaving everything behind. You were reported as a missing person about a half a dozen times, so we got to know your MO. You never took personal mementos when you moved from one location to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my father had so many of my mother\u2019s photos locked away, as if he couldn\u2019t look at them without grieving all over again. But Mom told me just before she died that the egg was mine. I probably should have left it behind, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any chance that whoever killed your family wanted that egg?\u201d Sean wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why they would. It\u2019s valuable, but if they didn\u2019t want art or money, why go after a relic? For me, it was just sentimental. That egg was her pride and joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey open up. Could there be something inside it?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to pry it open repeatedly. I even took a screwdriver to it once and got two stitches and a tetanus shot for my trouble. It\u2019s stuck.\u201d</p><p>Sean gripped his chin and let out a breath. \u201cThere are a lot of pieces to this puzzle. We\u2019re onto something. It\u2019s right here. I can\u2019t quite figure it out yet. Why don\u2019t we have some brunch? I\u2019ll grab a shower. After that, we\u2019ll hunker down and think some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call.\u201d Thorpe glanced around the galley. \u201cI hope cereal is okay. You know Callie and I don\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor shit\u2019s sake, I\u2019m sending you two to cooking school when we get out of this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fun. I\u2019ve always wanted to learn.\u201d Callie smiled, then turned to Thorpe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count me in,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m fine just the way I am.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he didn\u2019t want to see her after the danger had passed? She looked away, biting her lip.</p><p>An awkward silence prevailed, and Sean sent her a sympathetic glance. Maybe she should just try to put the brakes on feeling anything for Thorpe, accept that he mostly wanted sex from her, and stop hoping for more. If Thorpe didn\u2019t need her, then she\u2019d do her best not to need him.</p><p>Callie opened her mouth to say she\u2019d try to cook breakfast and invite Thorpe to jump into the lake, but a phone rang. The guys both looked at one another. It could only mean trouble. Their expressions said that.</p><p>Then Thorpe took off running for the bedroom, following the sound of the ring. Sean followed like it was a footrace. Callie trailed after them, hating the icy slide of dread in her veins.</p><p>\u201cAxel?\u201d Thorpe shouted into the cheap plastic phone.</p><p>A pause, followed by a grunted acknowledgment. Then a much longer pause. Then shock transformed Thorpe\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he barked into the phone.</p><p>Axel answered in a way that only made Thorpe more angry. His cheeks flamed red. He clenched his fists and looked like he might grind his teeth into dust. Holy hell, she\u2019d never seen Thorpe that pissed off.</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted.\u201d He stabbed a finger at the keypad to end the call, then looked up at Sean with a bleak stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sean barked as he wrapped an arm around her, already trying to brace her for the news he expected would upset her.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of the night, someone broke into Dominion. They trashed Callie\u2019s room and my office. Axel had a hunch, so he drove by your apartment. Searched and destroyed, too. Whoever has been after you, Callie, knows we\u2019re all gone. They\u2019re looking for something, probably whatever they didn\u2019t find when they killed your family. Now they\u2019re coming for us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>AN hour later, Sean retrieved her backpack from the stash in the bedroom. Gently, he shoved the remnants of cereal and toast to one side, then set her ragged bag on the little table and took a deep breath. Beside him, Callie looked tense and scared.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, lovely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we sitting ducks here on the lake? We should abandon the houseboat and get far away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedieval lords built castles using bodies of water as part of their defense. It would be difficult to mount an attack on the water and even harder to sneak up on us. We\u2019re hidden by boulders and mountains. No one is likely to find us without a helicopter, and even then, we\u2019ll just look like a boat on the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they still might investigate it. In the past, when I\u2019ve had someone breathing down my neck, I would change locations every day or two until I felt sure that I\u2019d lost whoever was chasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything criminal, and I don\u2019t want you running like you are one anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilt or lack thereof has nothing to do with it,\u201d she insisted with a wave of her hand. \u201cWhoever is after us will hunt us down. I think we should get off the boat and leave everyone guessing by going in three separate directions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he and Thorpe both barked together.</p><p>Sean turned his gaze to the other man. Thorpe\u2019s jaw clenched firm and resolute. He might not think he wanted to commit to Callie yet, but he\u2019d fight to keep her safe. He\u2019d even die for that cause. Because he loved her. The big lug was just too stubborn to do anything about it. At least right now. Time would tell . . .</p><p>Sean pushed the thought aside. Not the most important problem at the moment.</p><p>Except that if Thorpe broke Callie\u2019s heart, Sean knew he\u2019d have to work even harder to heal her. She would cry and believe that she wasn\u2019t . . . something enough. Good, smart, pretty\u2014whatever adjective filled in the blank and made no sense. Callie ticked all of those boxes for Sean, and if Thorpe\u2019s pig-headed avoidance made her feel like she lacked any of those qualities, Sean would take pleasure in beating the hell out of him. Kind of a downer, really. He\u2019d started to actually like the guy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe this egg has something to do with your family\u2019s murder.\u201d Sean changed the subject. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on that and not make any other decisions until we inspect it. Maybe there\u2019s something special about it besides the obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Thorpe nodded.</p><p>Callie pursed her lips, then looked away with a sigh. \u201cWe have to pull our heads out of our asses. Let\u2019s examine the egg once we get off this floating dead end. We\u2019re wasting time, guys.\u201d</p><p>He and Thorpe exchanged a glance, then the other man reached across the table to tangle his hand in her dark hair. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have more important tasks at hand, I\u2019d devise a fitting punishment for you, pet.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cFor expressing an opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor expressing it so disrespectfully.\u201d</p><p>Exasperation crossed her face before she stuck out her tongue at him. The gesture was somewhere between playful and impertinent, and Sean bit back a chuckle. No one could ever accuse Callie of being boring or predictable.</p><p>Thorpe tugged harder on her hair. \u201cSo you want to do this right now? I can occupy your tongue if you can\u2019t keep it in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll bet you can.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cReady when you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would I reward you?\u201d He raised a brow at her, then prowled through the little galley. A few moments later, he pulled open a drawer and pulled out more clothes pins. Then with a yank on the little refrigerator door, he produced a bottle of Tabasco. \u201cStick your tongue out at me again, pet, and I\u2019ll put these to good use.\u201d</p><p>Callie gaped at him, indignant. She looked like she had a few choice words, but finally clapped her mouth shut with an angry little huff. Sean bit back another laugh. Even when she was a brat, she was adorable. But if he\u2019d been alone with her, he would have had to nip her defiance in the bud. Thorpe\u2019s tactics were interesting, and Sean made note of them in case he needed them for future reference. In case Thorpe wasn\u2019t here to administer the attitude adjustment she needed.</p><p>With a sigh, she curbed her annoyance and focused on the situation again.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She stared at Thorpe, who merely raised an expectant brow at her. \u201cSir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d He smiled and turned Sean\u2019s way. \u201cProceed.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to smile back. \u201cOn it. What do you know about this egg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot. My mom talked about it, of course. But I was so young. She started getting sick when I turned five. As time went on, she became quieter. Mostly, I remember her holding me and telling me how much she loved me and to never forget that.\u201d Callie teared up, then sniffled. \u201cSorry. I haven\u2019t let myself think about those times in forever.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe stroked a hand down her spine in reassurance, then kissed the top of her head. There was no way he didn\u2019t love her. Dumbass prick. Even when he held himself back, Thorpe\u2019s devotion showed.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t remember anything about the egg specifically?\u201d Sean asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cI think she said this one was from Easter 1912 or 1913\u2014somewhere around that time frame. Dad bought it for her from a collector in Europe shortly after they were married. I guess she\u2019d seen one on their honeymoon and fallen in love. This one came up for sale, and Dad gave it to her as an anniversary gift or something. When I was really little, she had it on a display stand that lit up on the mantel in their bedroom. She redecorated their whole bedroom around it. The room looked very stately. But when she got really sick, Dad had everything redone. He couldn\u2019t stand to see her lying in a bed surrounded by black.\u201d</p><p>Sean understood that. If faced with the prospect of losing Callie, he\u2019d want to throw away everything dark and see her in nothing but sunlight and smiles for as long as he could.</p><p>\u201cAfter she died, Dad moved it to his home office,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt sat on the corner of his desk for years. Charlotte and I weren\u2019t allowed to touch it. Then one day, he brought it to me and said that since Mom had wanted me to have it, I could keep it in my room as long as I was responsible. I\u2019ve been trying to pry it open since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never succeeded?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. I lied about how I gouged my finger bloody. I didn\u2019t dare admit I\u2019d taken a screwdriver to the egg. But I\u2019d dreamed up this fantasy that my mother had written me a long letter or poem\u2014something she intended me to have that she tucked inside her favorite object. It sounds silly, but when you\u2019re doing things like getting your first period and surviving your first crush without a mother\u2019s guidance, it\u2019s rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she was with you in spirit, lovely.\u201d Sean wanted to hold her, wrap his arms around her. Hell, he wanted to carry her to bed and love her tenderly until he somehow convinced her that he meant to fill every void in her heart.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not aware of anything else unusual about the egg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than it being a rarity in general, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how else you\u2019ve tried to open it.\u201d Sean felt her eyes on him as he unzipped her backpack and peeked inside.</p><p>\u201cBesides the screwdriver, I\u2019ve tried soaking it in water and brute force. It\u2019s, like, glued together or stuck. Something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. The eggs were made to open. They often contained some jeweled surprise,\u201d Thorpe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cRight. I remember something inside the egg when I was a kid, but I can\u2019t recall details. It was shiny and pretty. After Mom was gone, I know my dad stashed pictures of her around some of her favorite objects. Once he gave it to me, I wondered if he\u2019d left a picture of her in here, but I never could get the damn thing open to see. That just made her feel more gone to me.\u201d She sniffled again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do better.\u201d Sean reached into Callie\u2019s backpack and pulled out some clothes, a wig, makeup, her toiletries, a box of colored contacts. Then he encountered a wadded-up towel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d she said as she stood on her tiptoes and peeked in.</p> <p>With a nod, Sean reached down to the bottom and braced his hands under the towel, then began lifting it up. It was bulky more than heavy, and he felt himself sweat a bit, knowing that he held millions of dollars and something infinitely precious to Callie in his hands.</p><p>Resting the towel on the table, they all peered over it as Sean unwrapped the bundle. An intricate black and gold design in diamond-shaped sections decorated the top half of the egg. The lower half was a smooth black lacquer with solid gold braiding edging the bottom. As he turned it in his hands, Sean held history. These had been made for the Russian tsars for fifty years. They\u2019d been valuable even a century ago. Now that so few had survived the bloody October revolution that had changed Russia, as well as the upheaval and wars since, the object verged on priceless.</p><p>Maybe her family\u2019s killers had sought this all along?</p><p>Thorpe dropped a comforting hand on her thigh, then looked his way. \u201cHave any other ideas about how we might get this open?\u201d</p><p>Sean winced. \u201cAs much as I hate to use more muscle on an object like this, I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d If there was nothing important about the egg itself or what might be inside, they were at a dead end. And he wouldn\u2019t know how else to give Callie hope. \u201cI\u2019ve got a multi-tool with me. We can start there.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. I\u2019ll see if Werner keeps any tools lying around that might help, too. Callie, clear the table and put the dishes in the sink.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Sean watched Thorpe squeeze her hand before he disappeared from the room, presumably to search for Werner\u2019s Craftsman collection on the boat, likely near the engine. He watched her forlorn face as she stared at the egg and touched it wistfully. He could plainly see how much it reminded her of the parent she\u2019d loved and lost so young.</p><p>Jogging to the bedroom to pull the multi-tool from his bag, he grabbed a few other things and returned to find Callie rooted to the same spot.</p><p>He eased down into the chair beside her. \u201cLovely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if this doesn\u2019t work? What if it\u2019s nothing more than a pricey egg? If it\u2019s empty and of no value to whoever is after me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we examine all the evidence again. We keep trying. I refuse to fail. I will not give up until you\u2019re safe. Do you hear me, Callie?\u201d</p><p>She responded immediately to the sterner note in his voice with a valiant little nod. \u201cThank you, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that who I am to you now?\u201d He pulled her collar from his pocket and dangled the glittering white gold with its petite lock from his finger, directly in her face. Something less delicate was more customary perhaps, but it didn\u2019t suit her. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Hope lit her eyes. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to fasten this around your neck again. You should never have removed it in the first place. Believe me, I never relinquished you from our bond in my mind or heart. So you best not be doing that either, lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to,\u201d she admitted in a soft, broken voice. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t. You\u2019re impossible to stop loving.\u201d</p><p>The words were difficult for her to speak, and he loved her all the more for finding the courage to say them. \u201cIf you want it back, ask me.\u201d</p><p>Callie scooted closer and looked at him with earnest blue eyes in her naked face. Even without all the black eyeliner and glittering shadow, she was stunning. His own eyes were a darker shade than the crystal Caribbean waters hers resembled. He wanted to drown there.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sir, will you return my collar to me?\u201d She ended her plea with a submissive bow of her head.</p><p>Sean drew in a huge gulp of air. As much as Callie had been forced to fend for herself most of her life, she wore her armor of independence with pride. She fought making herself vulnerable\u2014despite how badly she wanted and needed to. He sensed the soft side of her that craved not just a lover, but someone she could rely on day in and day out for the rest of her life.</p><p>He would stand in front of her, never wavering, until she knew he meant to be that man. Then he would marry her and never leave her side.</p><p>But one thing Sean knew for certain: whether she was the fiercely independent Callie Ward or the more vulnerable Callindra Howe, she would never ask to belong to a man unless she not only cared, but trusted him.</p><p>Elation swirled through him as he tipped her chin up to him. \u201cWill you remove the collar again without first talking to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you finally put yourself in my care and believe that I will always see to your needs?\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him solemnly. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sean cupped her face in his hands. The room was heavy with their connection. Gravity weighted each word she spoke. In retrospect, the first time he\u2019d offered Callie a collar, she\u2019d given him a saucy wink and a sway of her hips with her \u201cyes.\u201d Now he saw that it hadn\u2019t been an invitation to touch her, but a way to keep emotional distance between them. She hadn\u2019t taken him seriously then.</p><p>Her reaction now couldn\u2019t be more different. And he was so proud to have earned her heart.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, lovely.\u201d He glanced at the floor. \u201cBow your head.\u201d</p><p>She sent him one last clinging stare with those big eyes, a silent plea that he treat her fragile heart well. Then she slid to the vinyl floor gracefully and dipped her head low.</p><p>Sean unclasped the collar and fixed it around her neck, settling the bit of bling in place. The action was silent, but the importance of the moment shouted through his system. Callie was his again. And she would stay that way.</p><p>As he bent to kiss the crown of her head, Thorpe clambered to the door and stopped short, clutching a little bag of tools. He fixed his stare on Callie, his face stricken. The man swallowed. Pain gathered in the furrow of his down-slashed brows, his eyes darkening with something that looked a lot like anguish.</p><p>Sean frowned. The girl had always been his submissive. Seeing his collar around her neck shouldn\u2019t be new for Thorpe. Since the man had completely refused to claim her in any way for years, why should he begrudge anyone who did? Or expect Callie not to seek happiness? But he understood Thorpe\u2019s fear that the woman he loved was slipping through his fingers. Sean knew he couldn\u2019t change Thorpe\u2019s mind for him, but he could leave the door open as long as Callie needed him.</p><p>\u201cI found a hammer and a chisel.\u201d Thorpe said finally, his voice sounding scratchy, strained. He set the bag on the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll use them as a last resort. I\u2019m sure Callie would rather not break the egg.\u201d</p><p>She whipped her head around and scrambled to her feet. She looked braced for Thorpe\u2019s anger or a fight. The man did his best to give her a gentle smile. The expression was a bit rusty from disuse, but Callie relaxed.</p><p>Sean pulled her beside him. \u201cLet\u2019s start with this little blade.\u201d He held up one of the ends of his multi-tool. \u201cI\u2019ll try to wedge it into the space where the two halves of the egg meet. The piece is obviously well crafted, so I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll actually be able to work anything in there. But it\u2019s worth a try.\u201d</p><p>He focused completely, tuning the other two out to try to shove the thin blade into the nearly nonexistent gap. He only succeeded in bending the little knife. They tried taking some household chemicals to the ridge where the two halves met until the galley smelled like they\u2019d been spring cleaning. They paused, then inspected it again. Nothing.</p><p>With a sigh, Sean accepted the notion that they might actually have to damage the multimillion dollar egg. It was an expensive gamble. \u201cIf this is simply wedged shut, rather than holding something important, you realize that we\u2019ll have ruined a historically significant object that could keep you living plushly for the rest of your life for no reason?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cUnless I can figure out why someone wants me dead, I can\u2019t come out of hiding to sell the object and live off the proceeds. And if I do stop this person or people, then I stand to inherit my father\u2019s estate. And even independent of that, he left money in trust for me.\u201d</p><p>Sean stepped back, a bit stunned. Callie\u2019s words made perfect sense, but he hadn\u2019t really put two and two together to consider her net worth once the smoke cleared. Her father had been a multi-billionaire, all his money carefully and successfully invested at the time of his death. The funds had been frozen since, presumably pending Callie being cleared of wrongdoing . . . or found guilty of murder. Some of her father\u2019s favorite charities and supposed friends had begun legal plays to petition the courts for the Howe funds, but the local police had refused to declare Callie dead with so much evidence to the contrary. They seemed convinced she was the most likely suspect, despite shaky evidence. But Sean also knew they were grasping at straws because they had nothing else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given all that, if the money remained invested as it had been that October, it should still be a very sizeable fortune\u2014somewhere north of five billion dollars a year ago. The market had been fairly stable since then. Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had a billionaire\u2019s daughter kneeling on the floor at his feet\u2014the son of an unwed teenage mother and a philandering soldier with a girl in every military town. Instantly, Sean had a knee-jerk reaction to apologize to Callie, but he checked it. They weren\u2019t defined by their pasts or their bank accounts. They\u2019d chosen one another because they clicked. They stayed together because they were in love. He didn\u2019t give a shit if her bank balance had ten zeroes or none.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Thorpe looked at him as if Callie\u2019s inheritance was obvious. Because it was. For a moment, he felt like an idiot.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I did. It\u2019s not relevant. I guess that means we\u2019ll be doing whatever we have to in order to pry the blasted thing open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHammer and chisel it is,\u201d Thorpe quipped and prowled through the bag on the table until he came up with the right tools.</p><p>\u201cTry not to break it. It really is sentimental for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Thorpe said grimly.</p><p>With that, he set the chisel against the faint line that bisected the egg and tapped on it as gently as he could. The sound filled the little room to overflowing. Sean winced, not wanting to think about what sort of damage they were doing to the artifact. Metal scraped metal in a high-pitched squeak that made him wince.</p> <p>After the next tap of the hammer, Callie hissed. Thorpe swore softly. Sean peered between them and saw a little dent in the gold of the rim\u2014along with a small gap. With another tap, this one gentler, the two halves eased apart a bit.</p><p>His heart jumped, and Callie gripped his hand with such sweet hope. With her free hand, she brushed Thorpe\u2019s shoulder with a gentle touch that was equal parts adoration and thanks.</p><p>Both he and Thorpe had fingers too thick to work into the little wedge. Besides, it was her egg, her life on the line. Sean prodded her forward. \u201cGo on. See if there\u2019s anything inside.\u201d</p><p>A more tentative girl would have perhaps shaken the delicate piece to see if something spilled out or tried to take a closer peek at the innards to see if anything lurked within. Not Callie. She plunged her thumb and finger right into the little open space. There was no way her vision could help with this task, so she closed her eyes as she rooted around.</p><p>Tension gripped the room, so pervasive it was a menacing presence all its own. Whatever they found here could make, break, or crush her. Then again, finding nothing wasn\u2019t a palatable option either.</p><p>A moment later, she gasped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Thorpe barked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something stuck here and it wouldn\u2019t have been made with the egg. It\u2019s thin and plastic. I\u2019m trying to get my fingers on it.\u201d She fumbled a moment more, twisting and turning her wrist for a better grip.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel like anything familiar?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>She shook her head, getting more frustrated by the moment. \u201cI can\u2019t quite get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need to just break the damn thing open?\u201d Thorpe scowled. \u201cBecause I will if it helps you.\u201d</p><p>Callie glanced at him with a face full of confidence. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll manage. You know how determined I can be.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe snorted. \u201cDo I ever . . .\u201d</p><p>Sean gritted his teeth. Damn it, they needed to stop bantering and hurry this along. What she found inside the egg could determine the sort of future he had with Callie. Would they be riding off into the sunset or living underground and on the run for the rest of their lives?</p> <p>\u201cGot it!\u201d she shouted triumphantly, twisting and turning her hand a few more times.</p><p>Finally, she emerged with a flat little plastic square. It was blue and thin, and he hoped like hell they\u2019d hit the jackpot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an SD card.\u201d Sean stated what was probably the obvious, then he blew out a breath. \u201cCould your father have saved data on this, then hidden it in the egg?</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, we didn\u2019t have a computer among the inventory of his possessions at your house. How would he have saved the data?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a laptop. He kept it mostly at his office, but brought it home occasionally. Why would he put data on this card instead of just keeping it on the computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this was a backup?\u201d Thorpe surmised. \u201cWe need to read what\u2019s on this card ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are we going to find a computer that reads SD cards?\u201d Sean tried not to lose his cool.</p><p>\u201cLast night when I thought I\u2019d be crashing in the spare room, I peeked in there. I saw an old desktop machine. Werner said he and his family occasionally take the boat out themselves, right? Maybe this is his floating office when he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Sean took Callie by the hand, making sure she still held the little blue card, and hustled her out of the galley behind Thorpe, falling in after her as the hall narrowed.</p><p>They caravanned together past the bedroom they had all shared last night. Sean wasn\u2019t sure how he was supposed to feel about the sex. He\u2019d never imagined sharing the woman he loved with another man. But he had to admit their romp on that lumpy bed had been one of the most pleasurable of his life. Seeing Callie\u2019s fulfillment only added to the enjoyment. He itched to give that to her again.</p><p>A few steps later, they entered the second bedroom. It was smaller and darker. The head of a double bed, with a faded white comforter covered in little flowers, butted up to the paneled wall. It looked soft and worn and ready for a Dumpster. A window to the left with a desk in the corner made up the rest of the room. An old CRT monitor crowded most of the desk. The tower sat on the faintly musty carpet.</p><p>Thorpe yanked out the spindle-back chair and hunkered over the keyboard in front of the monitor that, from a technological prospective, had come from the Jurassic period. He bent and examined the computer, looking all along the sides and front for an SD card slot.</p><p>\u201cFound it! If everything still works, we\u2019ll know whatever information was hidden in that egg soon. Give me the card, pet.\u201d Thorpe pressed the power button on the computer tower, and it flickered to life.</p><p>Anxiety skittered through Sean\u2019s system.</p><p>As they waited for the old machine to croak its way through the boot-up process, Callie nibbled on her lip and fidgeted. \u201cWhy would my father have put anything on an SD card and hidden it in the egg, then given it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may never know, lovely.\u201d Sean squeezed her hand in reassurance.</p><p>She squeezed back. \u201cDid anyone break into his office and take his computer there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff the record? Yes. The authorities have kept that out of the press. But they ransacked his office\u2014and nothing else in the building. As far as I know, everything else in the suite was destroyed, but nothing more was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible? The security was pretty tight. And if I were guilty of murdering my father, why would I kill him, then run to his office to tear the place apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we think the office was hit first, about eight p.m. that night. When whoever broke in didn\u2019t find what they wanted there or on the laptop, they came to your house a couple of hours later and . . . you know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was having dinner with my family before the murders, so I couldn\u2019t have been breaking into his office.\u201d</p><p>But the only people who could have corroborated that story were dead. She\u2019d arrived at the table after the meal had been served and left before Teresita had come to clear the dishes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what the SD card holds,\u201d Sean said. Because if it held nothing of value, then this whole discussion was pointless.</p><p>A few tense minutes later, the computer finally finished its sequence and the desktop appeared. Thankfully, the operating system hadn\u2019t been set up to require a password. So as soon as Thorpe shoved the card in the slot and navigated to the drive, only one folder appeared, named Aslanov. Inside that were files with purely numeric names that Sean guessed were dates. After fairly consistent entries for months, they stopped abruptly fifteen years ago, then resumed again about six weeks before Daniel Howe\u2019s murder.</p><p>\u201cAslanov. I guess that\u2019s as in Dr. Aslanov.\u201d Callie frowned.</p><p>Deep in his gut, Sean knew where this was going and he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cI suspect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father gave him a huge grant, a new lab . . . the works.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut something happened. I don\u2019t know if they had a falling out or what. Suddenly, he just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Now Sean really didn\u2019t like where this was going. \u201cWhat\u2019s in that folder, Thorpe?\u201d</p><p>He clicked on the little icon, and inside were dozens of documents with the same naming convention, looking as if they were based on dates.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Callie asked beside him. \u201cWith one computer, how do we tackle this? I have to know what this says or I\u2019ll go insane.\u201d</p><p>Sean caught the concern on Thorpe\u2019s face and nodded almost imperceptibly. Whatever was here might upset the hell out of her. It would likely be dangerous, too. Yes, Callie was an adult and had every right to know what they found. He had no intention of keeping facts from her, and her life really couldn\u2019t get much more perilous. He simply wanted a chance to prepare her in the event the card held something shocking.</p><p>\u201cLovely, there\u2019s only one screen and three of us. How about you throw together a little snack for us while Thorpe and I wade through the information. Then we\u2019ll share it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two can\u2019t protect me from what I need to know,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t hide anything from you or delete information,\u201d Thorpe vowed. \u201cJust let us get an idea for what\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t handle whatever this says.\u201d If her tone hadn\u2019t been an accusation, her pursed bow of a mouth definitely was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit to wanting to know what\u2019s here before I spring it on you.\u201d Thorpe turned in his chair to regard her directly. \u201cIs that so terrible?\u201d</p><p>Callie crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIt is if you keep me in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t let him,\u201d Sean promised. \u201cLet us just read it first, all right?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cFine, but I want to know every word on that disc before I go to bed tonight. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure you do as soon as we know something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still trying to shield me,\u201d she said glumly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am, pet.\u201d He gave her a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re helping him.\u201d Callie pointed at Sean.</p><p>\u201cYes, because I agree, and no amount of your pouting is going to change my mind. You\u2019re more likely to earn yourself a punishment if you don\u2019t let up.\u201d He sent her a hard stare.</p><p>Callie looked like she bit back a thousand sarcastic replies. Instead, she managed a long-suffering sigh. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Not the attitude he wanted, but he understood her strain. The balance of her life might hang on that card and, after nearly a decade of mystery, she wanted the chance to solve her family\u2019s murders. If closure was at hand, she had a right to it. It would help her move forward. It might give her\u2014them\u2014a future.</p><p>Sean watched her leave the bedroom and march stiff-backed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like any of this,\u201d Thorpe said to him in hushed tones.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either. But we\u2019ll have to tell her as soon as we\u2019ve figured out what that says.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded reluctantly. \u201cDo you think her father put the card in the egg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd glued it shut, yes. Who else would have done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he wanted this information hidden for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr kept safe. But I\u2019m trying to decide why he would give it to her.\u201d Sean rubbed an absent thumb over his chin. \u201cTo be less conspicuous, maybe, in case someone wanted the information badly enough to break in? But why not put it in his safe or keep it securely at the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel Howe wasn\u2019t a stupid man. Maybe he had some inkling that Callie planned to run off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd planned to take the egg with her?\u201d Sean shook his head. \u201cDaniel Howe was regarded as a bit eccentric, but what man stands by idly and lets his sixteen-year-old daughter run off with a player? That doesn\u2019t add up. But I can imagine him wanting to hide the information in plain sight. He could still access it if he wanted. But since he went to the trouble to conceal the card in the egg, I have to believe that whatever it says, he wanted that information buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way to see it.\u201d Thorpe sighed. \u201cI\u2019m almost afraid of telling Callie what we find. It probably got her family killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t argue, but there\u2019s no way we can keep this from her. If we find something, it will be a bombshell, I have little doubt. It might completely turn her world upside down. We have to be prepared.\u201d She\u2019ll need us both. Sean bit the words back. Thorpe wasn\u2019t ready to hear them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cursing softly, Thorpe opened the first file on the SD card. Sean looked over his shoulder. Together, they began to read.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>AFTERNOON had come and gone when Sean and Thorpe finally stepped into the little galley. Callie had long ago stopped pacing, stopped trying to recall the terrible night of the murders . . . stopped hoping that her men hadn\u2019t found anything.</p><p>As they stepped into the small space, filing in through the doorway and looking at her with a gravity that scared the hell out of her, she stood and felt her stomach drop to her toes. \u201cYou know why someone is after me? Why they killed my family?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe think so, yes,\u201d Sean said heavily.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d No sense in dancing around the truth or letting them BS her. Someone was after her, and she was damn tired of running, of not knowing why her life was in shambles, or not understanding how all her tomorrows had fallen apart at once.</p><p>If she was reading their faces right, anything that might resemble a happy future was nothing but a pipe dream.</p><p>\u201cSit down, lovely,\u201d Sean said softly.</p><p>So whatever they\u2019d discovered was not just bad, but awful.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit down. I\u2019ve been doing that for hours. Damn it, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>Sean glanced at Thorpe. Though Callie wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible, he looked even more grim. Her caretaker for the last four years firmed his jaw as if steeling himself.</p><p>Panic slipped an icy chill through her bloodstream. \u201cI\u2019m already expecting bad, but you two are scaring the hell out of me. What is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Master gave you an order, Callie.\u201d Thorpe pointed to the chair.</p><p>Did they think she was going to faint? She plopped down into the little aluminum chair with the bright blue vinyl seat and glared.</p><p>Before she could demand that they spit it out, Sean dropped to the floor in front of her and took her hands in his. He swallowed. \u201cHow much do you know about the research your father paid for when you were a child? What was Dr. Aslanov supposed to do exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFind a cure for cancer. That\u2019s all Dad ever said. Is this . . . about the research?\u201d</p><p>Sean hesitated, so she looked up at Thorpe. He nodded. \u201cYour father didn\u2019t just want to find a pill or treatment that would make cancer disappear. He told Aslanov to find a way to cure it genetically to ensure that no one ever had to hear again that they or a loved one had a disease that would eat away at them from the inside. Aslanov wasn\u2019t just a researcher; he was a controversial young Russian geneticist. He had theories many of his colleagues eschewed. Turns out he was right. And wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAslanov figured out how to genetically prevent cancer from ever happening?\u201d Callie had to pick up her jaw. Was that even possible?</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Sean hedged. \u201cIf we\u2019re reading your father\u2019s notes right, Aslanov took the principles of genetic engineering used in fields like agriculture and medicine and expanded them with mixed results. Your father later described this sort of genetic research as the \u2018lawless frontier\u2019 of science. But he didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what his money was buying until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Callie gripped Sean\u2019s hands, her stomach tightening in knots. \u201cAslanov killed him?\u201d</p><p>The guys exchanged another cautious look that made her heart stutter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thorpe finally supplied, looking as if he had more to add. But he clammed up.</p><p>\u201cWhen your mother first got the diagnosis, she apparently wasn\u2019t given more than eighteen months to live. Your father searched for someone who believed they were close to a cure or something at least to put her in remission. But he couldn\u2019t find anyone willing to bypass all the safety precautions and government regulations to test their solution on your mother. Knowing that she was going to die if he did nothing, he veered in another direction and found Aslanov. In the previous five years, the Russian had been to some third-world countries that wouldn\u2019t bind him in a lot of red tape. According to Aslanov, he performed his research on others with great success. He told your father that with a little research and funding, he might be able to save your mother. Of course, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer cancer progressed faster than expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Aslanov insisted he was close, so your father continued funding him for another four years.\u201d Sean paused, then glanced at Thorpe again, whose mouth took a grim turn.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re editing this speech in your head, don\u2019t,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not, pet,\u201d Thorpe promised. \u201cIt\u2019s just complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. How did this research lead to the killing of my family?\u201d</p><p>Sean stood, paced, obviously agitated. Thorpe took over the storytelling. \u201cIn researching to cure cases like your mother\u2019s, he stumbled onto additional genetic changes that your father wouldn\u2019t be interested in . . . but others would.\u201d</p><p>Callie frowned. \u201cWhat others? Spit it out. I\u2019ve waited nine years to find out what the hell happened to the family I loved and to stop looking over my shoulder every five minutes because someone wanted to kill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAslanov had a wife and three children\u2014and financial problems. While researching for your mother, he claimed to have found ways to mutate the genetic structure of a person to improve their immunity, stamina, strength, and even their intelligence. No idea if that was true, but he sold that bill of goods to someone else, we think in the military because there were notes about an investigation on a camp somewhere in Latin America, experiments being done to soldiers using some of the initial research. But exactly who was behind that isn\u2019t something your father outlined.\u201d</p><p>None of what Thorpe said computed. \u201cWait. You\u2019re telling me . . . what? That Aslanov sold his research to someone in the military, who later killed my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always said that you\u2019re quick.\u201d Thorpe nodded. \u201cEventually, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father found out what Aslanov had done and ordered him to stop,\u201d Sean continued. \u201cHe pulled the plug on the research and threatened to blow the whistle. Aslanov bowed to the pressure and gave the remaining research his money had paid for back to your father, who burned it, according to his notes. But Aslanov had apparently already sold the information to his military contact, who was expecting delivery. Here\u2019s where we have to guess a bit what happened, but it makes sense. This military contact went to Aslanov for the most recent data he\u2019d purchased. When the scientist no longer had it to give, they killed the man and his whole family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the children?\u201d</p><p>Sean and Thorpe wore identical expressions that didn\u2019t give her a happy feeling, before Sean finally spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s the assumption. The bodies of two of the three children were recovered at the crime scene. The third was a five-year-old girl, but she\u2019s never been found. The Aslanov case is something I\u2019ve been looking into as a possible tie-in to the murder of your family because they shared a professional connection and the execution of the crimes was so similar. I could never prove they were linked, however. What we found on the SD card isn\u2019t a smoking gun, but we\u2019re getting closer.\u201d</p><p>Callie couldn\u2019t sit still. The information pinged around in her head like a pair of dice, rolling and tumbling. She paced, clenched her fists . . . felt Sean\u2019s and Thorpe\u2019s gazes watching her every move.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father tried to do a good thing. He tried to save my mother and end cancer. It was probably Pollyanna and too ambitious, but someone killed him for it? I don\u2019t understand. And why would they kill my sister, too? She didn\u2019t know anything more than I did.\u201d Callie scoffed. \u201cShe probably knew less, even. Dad paying Aslanov for all that research happened when she was just a tyke and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollateral damage,\u201d Sean said softly, rising to embrace her. \u201cThat\u2019s why they killed your sister and Aslanov\u2019s family. They were all witnesses these scumbags didn\u2019t need. Whoever paid for that research had no idea what Charlotte might have known and if they\u2019d asked . . . well, then she could have identified them. I\u2019m sure they saw her death as a precaution.\u201d</p><p>Callie saw the whole thing as senseless\u2014her father\u2019s murder, Charlotte\u2019s slaughter. For DNA research? Logically, she could connect the dots. Emotionally, she just couldn\u2019t understand anyone capable of pulling the trigger. \u201cWhoever killed my family and the Aslanovs . . . what can they do with this research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiecing together the puzzle from what your father wrote? I\u2019d say someone wanted to build a faster, better soldier. Maybe even a whole army.\u201d</p><p>Super-soldiers? The implications of that were astonishing. Possibly world altering. She\u2019d already known they weren\u2019t dealing with amateurs or people likely to give up. But this information terrified her beyond anything she\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Suddenly, Thorpe\u2019s arms were around her, fitting her back against his broad chest. Warmth, comfort, protection.</p><p>Sean cupped her face in his big hands. \u201cYou\u2019re trembling, lovely. Deep breath. You\u2019ll never be alone in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re by your side,\u201d Thorpe promised. \u201cUntil you\u2019re safe, we always will be.\u201d</p><p>Callie wanted to burrow deeper between them and pray that the danger went away. Or shove out of their embrace and rail at the world until something changed. \u201cSafe? There is no safe. We have to start being realistic here. Given who and what I\u2019m up against, it\u2019s a miracle I\u2019ve escaped them for this long. But can I really do this for the rest of my life? Like you said once, I\u2019m alive, but I\u2019m not living. I\u2019ve already done this for nearly a decade. How much longer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this information into the right hands at the FBI.\u201d Sean stared down into her eyes, determination stamped all over his face. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out who we can trust. We\u2019re going to work until we make you safe. I put a collar around your neck. Someday, I\u2019m going to put a ring on your finger. Don\u2019t for one instant think I\u2019m going to let anyone harm you.\u201d</p><p>His vows were staunch and so lovely that they made her heart sing. They were also most likely hopeless.</p><p>Behind her, Thorpe tensed\u2014and remained utterly silent. He made no such promise for the future. He cared, but he didn\u2019t love her. And he\u2019d probably never tell her why.</p><p>Hell, she might not even be alive long enough to miss him.</p><p>\u201cIf whoever this is finds out that you two have been secluded with me, I won\u2019t be the only one they kill,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cStop that speech there,\u201d Thorpe growled. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving you to handle this alone and we\u2019ve already amply covered that point. Don\u2019t bring it up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Sean added. \u201cYou may not see the way to safety now, but there must be one. We\u2019re going to find it, and it starts with getting this information into the right person\u2019s hands. I\u2019ll figure out who that is. But without Internet, we\u2019ll have to deliver it in person.\u201d</p><p>That made sense, though it scared her half to death.</p><p>\u201cI think we start by leaving here at first light. As soon as I can see well enough to dock the boat, we\u2019ll sneak back onto land. I\u2019ll find a secure cell signal then and I\u2019ll start making phone calls. At that point, we\u2019ll arrange something, whether they send reinforcements to us or direct us to a safe house\u2014something. We\u2019ll prove you weren\u2019t involved in the murders. They\u2019ll protect you while we figure out who killed your family and the Aslanovs, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot \u2018ifs\u2019 and \u2018thens.\u2019 How do we know we can trust everyone at the FBI? How do we know that we\u2019ll ever have enough information to figure out who was willing to kill so many innocent people for that research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave all that to me,\u201d Sean insisted.</p><p>Callie stared out the galley window to see the sun setting. She had no idea what the actual time was, but she wished she could stay here forever with these two amazing men who held her heart. She wished she could give them a lifetime of love, kneel and obey . . . and get into trouble now and then just for the fun of it. She wished she could pour out her heart to Sean every day and be the best wife and submissive possible. She yearned to heal Thorpe so that he could be whole again, so he might stay with her and fill that other missing part of her. None of that looked likely now.</p><p>But they were right about one thing; running wasn\u2019t the answer, not anymore. Whether she had eight hours or eight decades left, she wanted to spend as much of them with people she loved. These murderers had taken away her family and her past. By damned, she wasn\u2019t giving them her future, too.</p><p>She nodded at them. \u201cAll right. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>BY that evening, they\u2019d packed up everything they needed to take when they debarked, secured the egg and the SD card, and eaten a light dinner. They sat around the galley\u2019s little table in near silence, drinking a bottle of red wine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorpe couldn\u2019t help but fear that tonight would be their last together.</p><p>He swallowed, his finger rimming the top of the glass. Hearing that Sean intended to save Callie, no matter the personal risk, wasn\u2019t a blow. Thorpe felt the same. But the other man\u2019s declaration to marry her had been like a wrecking ball to his solar plexus. Once they left here and the FBI got involved, Callie wouldn\u2019t need him anymore. Oh, Thorpe knew he might give her more boundaries than Sean, but the fed would catch on. He was a smart guy. He wasn\u2019t going to let her flounder or need for long. Sharing a road trip with Sean had convinced him of that much.</p><p>Downing the rest of his vino, Thorpe thought about fighting for Callie or at least trying to stay with them both. But he knew his limitations. A woman like her deserved to be with someone who could be by her side step for step. As the years went past, he\u2019d become less able. But long before then, she\u2019d want someone who could show her in every way how much he adored her. With his body, yes. Every day, every night, every chance she gave him. With his words? This fucking hang-up of his was so frustrating. He needed to get over his shit. Callie wasn\u2019t Melissa; she wouldn\u2019t leave him over three little words. Even more important, she wasn\u2019t like\u2014damn it, he even hated to think her name.</p><p>Suddenly, Callie stood, her chair scraping the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the elephant in the room. Whatever happens next is going to be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe turned to Sean, who nodded. \u201cLikely. We don\u2019t know if we were followed to the lake. I don\u2019t think so or they\u2019d already be all over us. But they aren\u2019t going to give up. When we step on shore tomorrow . . . anything could happen.\u201d</p><p>Wishing like hell he could refute those words, Thorpe only nodded.</p><p>Callie looked nervous, stricken, scared. But resolute. \u201cThen I need to say a few things.\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook, and she looked like she was trying to hold it together. The belief that she might not live through the end of this was written all over her face.</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s heart lurched in his chest. \u201cPet . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease let me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI need to get this out. I won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Sean took her hand, his thumb making soothing circles across her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cThe two of you stuck with me when sane people wouldn\u2019t. You came for me, despite the hell I put you through. You didn\u2019t sell me out when you could have. After Holden, I didn\u2019t want to trust anyone\u2014ever. But you kept proving yourselves over and over.\u201d Tears flowed and fell down her cheeks, and damn if that didn\u2019t break his heart. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I was difficult and stubborn. But you two reminded me what it was like for someone to care, and I hadn\u2019t had that in so, so long. Thank you. I will always be incredibly grateful. And I will always love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d Sean reached for her.</p><p>She stepped aside. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do tonight, right? No docking in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not expert enough with a boat this size.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo making phone calls now?\u201d</p><p>The fed shook his head. \u201cNot until I can figure a few things out, like exactly who to trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I want tonight to be about the three of us. I want to give you both what I\u2019ve never been able to give anyone.\u201d She drew in another trembling breath, her nervous gaze bouncing between him and Sean. \u201cAll of myself.\u201d</p><p>His cock stood up and partied. The idea of having Callie in ways he\u2019d only fantasized about made his blood rush south, his head swim with dizzy anticipation, and his veins sizzle. It also made him ache. As she\u2019d done before, she was leaving a chunk of her soul with them as good-bye.</p><p>The thought that he might lose her to a bullet tied his guts up into an army of painful knots. The thought that, if the danger passed, he\u2019d have to give her over exclusively to Sean made him want to scream and spit nails and beat himself up for not being the right man for her.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, lovely?\u201d Sean cupped her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYes. I trust you. I want to do one thing right. I want to take one really good memory with me tomorrow in case it\u2019s my last. Please.\u201d</p><p>How the fuck were they supposed to say no to that?</p> <p>Sean cast a concerned glance his way. Thorpe sent it back, then stood. If this was the last time he got to touch Callie, he wanted to experience her in every way she\u2019d let him.</p><p>And to give her all the love he couldn\u2019t with his words.</p><p>\u201cTo the bedroom, then.\u201d Thorpe heard the rough note in his voice. He was trying to hold it together.</p><p>\u201cOff with you, lovely. Once you get there, kneel and wait. We\u2019ll be along.\u201d</p><p>Those big blue eyes of hers looked Sean\u2019s way, her stare a caress, before settling on him. Her expression told him that underneath her determination to experience what might be her final night to the fullest, her heart was breaking.</p><p>Fuck, so was his.</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders and stared hard. If he kissed her now, he\u2019d take her here in the galley. He\u2019d ravish her over the little table and bang away at her like there was no tomorrow. Because there really wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Somehow, Thorpe managed to restrain himself and merely pressed his lips to her forehead. Sean grabbed her hand and nuzzled her neck. Callie held her breath and froze. Eyes closed, she appeared to drink in the moment. He inhaled her scent and did the same.</p><p>Why did this hurt so fucking bad, way beyond the pain of Melissa leaving him? Even more than what the terrible bitch before her had done? Callie had told him once that he would be her biggest regret, but damn it, she would be his.</p><p>The moment passed, and she left the room, head held high. A thousand thoughts crowded his head. Even more emotions crushed his chest. He clenched his fists, wanting to beat the fucking wall. But it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Tomorrow was going to come.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave her alone for long or she\u2019ll fall apart,\u201d Sean murmured softly so Callie couldn\u2019t overhear on the small boat.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>The other man swallowed. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to it, then. She struggled for months before she allowed me to fully restrain her. If she wants to submit everything, we\u2019ll have to push her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we cut off most of her senses. There\u2019s no way she can fully put herself in our hands until we take away her sight and sound. Force her to rely on touch, on what she\u2019s feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll surrender every part of herself, I think.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded. \u201cWe have to give her this one night of freedom, really let her fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asked us for almost nothing else. So if we can save her from whoever\u2019s trying to kill her, I\u2019ll probably never refuse her anything again.\u201d Sean\u2019s smile was self-deprecating.</p><p>\u201cIt will be to your detriment, I promise. She\u2019ll fight you, but she will want to know that you have her firmly in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you stay and make sure she is?\u201d</p><p>The truth was on the tip of his tongue, but even if he blurted it out, it would change nothing. And Sean wasn\u2019t the one to whom he owed this truth. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>The fed looked ready to argue, but didn\u2019t. \u201cI think you\u2019re making a grave mistake by walking away from Callie, a mistake you\u2019ll regret to your dying day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of that. Why aren\u2019t you calling your boss tonight and asking for an armored escort to safety come first light?\u201d</p><p>Sean sighed, clearly not happy with the change of subject. \u201cMy boss hasn\u2019t been forthcoming with information. He\u2019s fed me some lines that set off my bullshit meter. I\u2019m really not sure who we can trust, so I won\u2019t give away our location until we have a plan B and a good escape route. I\u2019d rather walk into the Vegas field office where there will be lots of witnesses. Trying to off Callie will be a lot more difficult then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll good points. Let\u2019s go find her.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, but began digging around in the galley. He picked up a few items that made Thorpe smile faintly. \u201cI need some damn ear buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some in my briefcase, in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d The other man headed out of the galley and toward the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019d like to surround her tonight. Make her feel the safest and most loved she\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p><p>Exactly what he\u2019d been picturing. Thorpe nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe should make love to her together.\u201d Sean stopped in the little hall and turned, his expression sober. \u201cNot like we did before, not taking turns. At the same time. I want to fill her completely.\u201d</p><p>God, he\u2019d love that. But there were complications . . . \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever taken a man anally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Sean pressed his lips together. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked a woman that way before, but not recently. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve had far more experience than me in that department.\u201d</p><p>Lots and lots and lots. During the wild years of his adolescence. Even more during his angry postdivorce phase. And probably more than his fair share in his early thirties when he\u2019d decided to control every damn facet of his life and lost his ability to really give a shit about anything.</p><p>Until Callie had walked through his door and changed everything.</p><p>\u201cNot so much practice in the last few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last four, maybe?\u201d Sean asked knowingly.</p><p>Hell, he really was transparent.</p><p>He just smiled tightly. \u201cShut the fuck up and get to her.\u201d</p><p>With a brittle laugh, Sean closed the distance to the bedroom. When they walked in, Callie knelt by the bed, head bowed, eyes down, dark hair cascading all around her slender body. She looked nervous but strangely at peace.</p><p>Thorpe retrieved his ear buds from his briefcase, along with his iPod. He kept it mostly for his visits to the gym, but he\u2019d equipped it with some alternate playlists, including one for dungeon play. Without a word, he handed them to Sean, who\u2019d already set the items from the galley on the nightstand.</p><p>It chafed to turn over control of Callie\u2019s submission to another\u2014not really because he couldn\u2019t stand Sean touching her. Because he wanted to have her under his control at least once. But he hadn\u2019t earned it. Nor did he deserve to take that much from her if he wasn\u2019t going to stay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still dressed,\u201d Sean pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI debated, Sir. But you didn\u2019t tell me to strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I didn\u2019t. I think tonight we\u2019d prefer to do it ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Thorpe added.</p><p>Sometimes, he and Sean were so thoroughly on the same page, it was scary.</p><p>\u201cStand for us,\u201d the other man ordered softly.</p><p>Callie did so on wobbly legs. Now Thorpe could really see her nerves. It endeared her to him even more, knowing this meant so much to her.</p><p>Sean lifted the plain white shirt up her torso and over her head, exposing her bare breasts and their plump nipples.</p><p>Thorpe brushed his fingers over one peak. \u201cClose your eyes, pet.\u201d</p><p>She did so without hesitation, and Sean stepped up, pulling a handkerchief from his pocket. It wasn\u2019t a perfect solution, but it was clean and useful.</p><p>As he knotted it at the back of her head, he walked a semicircle around her, then tilted her chin up to him. \u201cYour safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Summer,\u2019 Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter your childhood horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew that?\u201d Surprise rang in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI know so much about you on paper. I want to know everything about the real you for myself. Thank you for the beautiful gift of your submission. I know it isn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sean assured. \u201cAnd I need to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Thorpe said thickly, walking behind her and grabbing her wrists. \u201cGive me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Callie took a deep breath, then as she let it out, she released all the tension from her body and gave herself over completely. She\u2019d always been beautiful to him, but watching a woman who had never truly trusted anyone now surrender her all both stunned and humbled him.</p><p>Thorpe took her wrists in one hand. With the other, he reached around and tilted her head back so he could plant a soft kiss on her forehead. \u201cYou move me, pet. I can\u2019t even tell you how much. Please don\u2019t ever think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>A soft smile lifted the corners of her lips. Thorpe bent to press his cheek to hers. So silky, so female. Callie was the woman he\u2019d never dared to dream about.</p><p>As Sean passed him a couple of pillowcases knotted together, he tied off her wrists at the small of her back. Then he caressed her shoulders, lifted the hair from her neck, and kissed her soft nape. Every time he touched her, something swelled in his chest. Fuck, he hated that tonight would be the last time he had her.</p><p>In front of Callie, Sean gripped the ear buds and flipped through the iPod\u2019s playlists. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe chose a classical mix, instrumentals that were both reflective and passionate, that throbbed and swelled before finally crashing to a dazzling end. He used it as drinking music when regret buried him. The words to tell Callie how he felt were stuck in his heart, but some part of him hoped that she would hear his feelings through these songs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean nodded, then directed his attention back to Callie. \u201cYou can\u2019t see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t move your arms?\u201d</p><p>She wriggled her shoulders, attempting to work free. Thorpe smiled. He didn\u2019t know everything, but he damn sure knew how to secure a sub\u2019s wrists so that she\u2019d be comfortable, but immobile, until he was ready to let her go.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cut off your hearing now. You\u2019ll hear music. But you\u2019re not to use it to tune us out. It\u2019s to quiet your head so you can feel what we\u2019re doing to you. And feel how much we care.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cSean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lovely. Try again.\u201d His voice, low and encouraging, was meant to soothe, but it was also full of backbone. \u201cWill Thorpe and I hurt you in any way?\u201d</p><p>Callie didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all we\u2019ve done to keep you from harm, do you think we\u2019ll let anything happen to you?\u201d</p><p>Palming her shoulders, Thorpe gave her a little squeeze. \u201cPet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I just wanted to ask you not to make the music too loud. That usually gives me a headache.\u201d</p><p>Her answer filled him with relief, and he glanced over at Sean, who shook his head ruefully and fitted the ear buds in place as the music started.</p><p>He let it play for a moment, then removed one. \u201cHow\u2019s the volume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she assured. \u201cThe music is beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>After gently fitting the bud back in her ear, Sean affixed the iPod, attached to the armband he also used during his trips to the gym, around her delicate biceps. It looked far too big on her, but it held.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a damn amazing woman,\u201d Sean mused aloud.</p><p>Thorpe had known that almost the instant she walked through Dominion\u2019s door. He wanted to tell Sean how very lucky he\u2019d be to have Callie in his life, if they could just get her past this danger. But he choked and barely managed a nod.</p><p>The moment dissipated as soon as Sean kissed Callie\u2019s rosy lips\u2014a peck, a brush, then a lingering press, before he dove into her mouth with a stroke of tongue. Thorpe left a string of kisses along her neck and shoulder, bracing his hands on her hips and pressing his cock against her lush ass, desperate for the chance to be inside her again, to take something she\u2019d never given another man. Wanting it this much was selfish, but he didn\u2019t bother to deny how desperately she made him ache.</p><p>Sean broke the kiss to caress Callie\u2019s breasts and thumb her nipples. Her breathy gasp heightened Thorpe\u2019s anticipation. And when the other man bent to tongue one of the berry tips, he tilted her head back and captured her next gasp with his kiss. Sweet, sultry, so tempting. She gave to them, the raw surrender so heartfelt, it made his damn knees weak. Women had submitted to him for longer than he wanted to admit. But they\u2019d largely done it for their own reasons, mostly selfish. Now that he felt a submissive truly giving her soul simply to please, Thorpe wondered how he\u2019d ever be satisfied with anything less.</p><p>Or anyone else.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>WHEN Thorpe pulled away, he found Sean on the ground between Callie\u2019s feet, arms thrown around her thighs, pressing his cheek into the flat of her stomach, eyes closed, expression reverent. Thorpe couldn\u2019t help but see how much Sean loved her. It should reassure him to leave Callie in such good hands. Instead, an acid ate away at him that she couldn\u2019t be his. Why couldn\u2019t he be more right for her?</p><p>As Thorpe reached around to bring her closer against his chest, he smoothed a palm up her ribs to her breast. Callie melted into him a little bit more, giving him a soft sigh.</p><p>From her waist, Sean dragged down the overlarge sweatpants she\u2019d swiped from his bag. He removed her panties with them, prompting her with just a touch to step free. She was gloriously bare, naked to them now in all ways. And Sean didn\u2019t waste a second. He kissed his way up her thigh and settled his lips over her pussy, lapping at her, kissing her with not just his mouth, but his whole body, full of gusto and need and promise.</p><p>Callie arched. Her lips parted with a gasp. A gentle pink spread across her milky skin as her nipples drew up tighter.</p><p>\u201cLay her across the bed,\u201d Thorpe demanded.</p><p>Sean looked up like he wanted to object. Then he glanced at the bed. \u201cYeah. It will be more comfortable for what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>He stood, lifting Callie against his body. Instantly, she wrapped her legs around his waist and he walked with her to the mattress, still rumpled from the last time they\u2019d taken her between them. Thorpe was there to untie her wrists and catch her as Sean spread her sideways across the bed. Her hair fanned like black silk against the bleached white sheets, her lips a succulent red. He secured her wrists together over her head again, then tied the pillowcases off to the bed frame, chafing with impatience to possess her.</p><p>As soon as she lay across the mattress, needy and writhing, Sean fell to his knees between her legs and bent to lap at her pussy again. No hesitation. No games. They were beyond that tonight.</p><p>Thorpe watched for a moment, the beauty of her skin shimmering in the low light, the power of her arousal, the way she spread herself wider and gave, all revealing the woman within.</p><p>Suddenly, her fingers dug into his thigh, conveying her sensual distress without a word. Callie couldn\u2019t see him, but she could obviously feel his presence. She must need him, and for that he was damn grateful.</p><p>Thorpe bent over her pleasure-filled face and sucked her nipples into his mouth, rolling them on his tongue, a lap here, a nibble there, alternating, lavishing sensation on them as Sean continued to worship at the altar of her cunt. Soon, she began tensing and crying out, pleading.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to come,\u201d Thorpe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Distract her for a minute. I want her good and ready.\u201d</p><p>He could think of several ways to do that, but one overtook his thoughts and filled his cock with even more blood. Fuck, he couldn\u2019t remember ever being not just eager but frantic for a woman.</p><p>Tearing into his trousers, he released the button and zipper, then shoved the pants down, kicking them out his way with a snarl as he ripped his shirt from his torso, buttons pinging everywhere.</p><p>Fastening his grip around her arms, he tugged a bit and slid her closer. Callie\u2019s head fell over the edge of the bed with a cry, and he fisted her hair, tilting it a bit more. Anticipation wracked him as he stroked his cock and guided himself toward her parted lips.</p><p>As soon as he brushed the head along her softness, she opened fully for him, greedily swallowing him deep in her mouth and moaning.</p><p>\u201cShe likes that,\u201d Sean murmured. \u201cShe just got even wetter.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe couldn\u2019t do more than nod as he leaned forward, braced his hands on the mattress, and slowly began to fuck her mouth. The sensations of Callie all around his length, laving every nerve, coating him completely, and still eager to take more, was short-circuiting his brain.</p><p>Sucking up his shaft to the sensitive head, she laved it with her tongue, moaning and eager, before he plunged into her mouth again. Her lips tight, she took him as far as she could and held him there as if she sought to memorize his flavor. And she did it all so slowly. Her face, her body language, her very movements, they all shined with her love. No way his heart couldn\u2019t beat for hers in return.</p><p>Thorpe wasn\u2019t a man prone to emotion\u2014or he hadn\u2019t been in over twenty years. Now he couldn\u2019t stop feeling. He didn\u2019t like it much. Some part of him wanted to resent her for dragging him from his self-imposed gray. But he\u2019d needed Callie. He\u2019d been suffocating without her. God alone knew how he was going to make it without her after tomorrow.</p><p>And if she kept sucking him like that, he wouldn\u2019t make it two minutes more without coming.</p><p>Suddenly, she gasped around his cock. Her body tensed again. Thorpe couldn\u2019t miss the rosy flush spreading across her chest or the way she lifted her hips to Sean\u2019s mouth.</p><p>With a whimper, she writhed. He almost swore he could hear her say \u201cplease\u201d with a mouthful of his cock.</p><p>Sean pulled away, and she gave another little groan of protest that made Thorpe smile, despite his stinging arousal. She\u2019d rarely been shy about saying how she felt or what she wanted\u2014in her clever way. Lance had once referred to her as a handful. He\u2019d been right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to let her,\u201d Sean said sheepishly. \u201cI don\u2019t have it in me to deprive her tonight.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe brushed Callie\u2019s cheek, encouraging her to slowly release him. With another breathy moan, she did.</p><p>\u201cShe may need it now,\u201d he countered. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the double penetration will be a bit too uncomfortable for her the first time and she won\u2019t come. Besides, if pleasing her pleases you, she\u2019d want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>All of what he\u2019d said was true, but there was a bit of selfishness in there as well. He wanted Callie to remember this night and the ecstasy they gave her over and over. She\u2019d pair off with Sean, and they\u2019d share a lifetime of passion. But Thorpe wanted tonight embedded in her heart forever.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Sean cut into his thoughts, shoving a plastic cup in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something fun and creative to do with these.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked down. Ice. Always a favorite. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe put them in her mouth?\u201d</p><p>And sink his cock back into that velvet heaven after adding more stimulation? \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Sean grinned as he returned to the bed, petting and laving Callie\u2019s swollen pussy, driving her arousal up once more.</p><p>Thorpe stretched across the bed, settling beside her and keeping the cup within reach. As soon as she turned her face in his direction, he took her mouth with his, cementing his lips on hers and nudging her open wider. Then he grabbed one of the cubes from the cup and skimmed it over her nipple.</p><p>Her gasp filled his mouth. As unexpectedly as he\u2019d set the cold cube on her flesh, he took it away. Callie tried to raise off the bed, as if searching for more. Sean held her hips down firmly and affixed his lips to her pussy again until she twisted, her breathing turned uneven, and she mumbled pleas that thrilled both the Dom and the man in him.</p><p>Then Thorpe set the little block of ice on her nipple again. This time, he turned it on end, dragging an uneven edge back and forth across the sensitive bud. She whimpered, then held her breath, her entire body straining toward the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>Sean lifted his face from her slick folds and licked his lips like a man having a really good time. \u201cYeah. Fuck, she\u2019s so juicy. Tell her to come.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded, dragging the ice down her breast, then caressing her nipple with the edge again. Callie wriggled and gasped, both tender peaks as hard as he\u2019d ever seen them.</p><p>With one hand, he switched the ice to her other breast. With the other, he dislodged one of her ear buds. \u201cLet go, pet. Sean wants you to come on his tongue.\u201d</p><p>He barely wedged the little piece back in her ear and sucked on the chilled tip of her breast before she tensed from head to toe and shouted out a low, agonizing climax that seemed to last forever. Sean didn\u2019t stop, didn\u2019t waver. He just loved her clit with a nonstop devotion that soon had her bucking in aftershocks and tears streaming from her eyes.</p><p>Every time they gave their all to Callie\u2019s pleasure, he swore that she couldn\u2019t possibly experience more ecstasy than the time before. Again, she\u2019d proven him wrong. Her capacity to open herself to them just kept growing and astounding him.</p><p>Lost in his musings, Thorpe almost missed the condom Sean threw his way. \u201cPut it on now. I need to be inside her.\u201d</p><p>He hedged. \u201cIt will be easier on Callie if I go first.\u201d</p><p>Sean hesitated, gritting his teeth, then nodded. \u201cThen hurry up.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe scrambled to his feet and had his condom on seconds later, studying the bed all the while. \u201cHow do you want to restrain her now?\u201d</p><p>Doffing his shirt, the fed frowned and took in the situation with a glance. \u201cUntie her hands. I\u2019ve got a solution.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe released Callie\u2019s wrists from the pillowcases and unknotted them from the bedframe.</p><p>\u201cWant to clue me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re going to get this without a word.\u201d Sean grinned. \u201cPick her up for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe did, bringing Callie against his chest and nuzzling her neck as Sean lifted the mattress and settled a length of rope he\u2019d brought from the galley beneath it, leaving a foot or so dangling on either side.</p><p>Just like Sean had promised, he understood. And he grinned back.</p><p>\u201cI think I can help you. I brought a few things with me . . . just in case.\u201d Thorpe passed Callie back to Sean, then rifled in his bag until he came up with two pairs of cuffs. With a quick couple of knots, he affixed the ropes through the O rings of the cuffs, watching the other man kiss Callie with abandon. \u201cNow, she\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean eased her onto the mattress on her hands and knees. He fitted one cuff around her wrist. Thorpe took care of the other. Callie didn\u2019t protest. Instead, she arched restlessly on the bed, a silent invitation neither of them would ever refuse. Like Sean, Thorpe couldn\u2019t wait much longer.</p><p>He settled onto the bed behind her and gripped her hips.</p><p>\u201cGently,\u201d Sean warned.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Thorpe fought with his conscience . . . and it won. \u201cYou want to do this yourself? It\u2019s your right as her Master to fully claim her.\u201d</p><p>Uncertainty slid across Sean\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019d love to and I will someday. But I really don\u2019t want to run the risk of hurting her. You know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated,\u201d Thorpe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know. But she\u2019s not just fragile to me, she\u2019s priceless. You\u2019ll do a better job.\u201d</p><p>Now really wasn\u2019t the time for this conversation, but Thorpe had to know. \u201cHow are you the most selfless bastard on this fucking planet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever lost someone precious to you and realized all the things you should have said and done when they were around? I don\u2019t want to end up with regrets.\u201d</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t, Thorpe realized. Since adolescence, he\u2019d been closed off, never letting anyone matter. Never letting anyone in. He didn\u2019t know what it was like to lose someone because he was not just walled off, but always the first to leave.</p><p>No wonder Sean had earned Callie\u2019s devotion. He would take care of her forever, putting her on a pedestal and loving her unconditionally.</p><p>Thorpe sighed. He felt like a terrible prick.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s waiting,\u201d Sean pointed out.</p><p>Looking down at Callie\u2019s sweet, round backside, Thorpe wished again he could give her more than this. Suddenly, all his regrets weighed two tons.</p><p>Trying to shove all the crap in his head aside for her, Thorpe caressed Callie\u2019s ass, then anchored one hand on her hip. The other he dipped down to her sweltering cunt and plunged two fingers inside. Her back arched. She cried out. Her flesh tightened around his digits. He began to sweat.</p><p>Rooting in her passage, he coated his fingers liberally with her wetness. He could probably find something in the galley to use as lubrication, but nature had provided well enough.</p><p>As soon as his fingers dripped with her essence, he circled her clit a few times. He wanted her not just aroused again, but as fevered as he could manage. It would blunt some of whatever pain she might feel.</p><p>With a steadying breath, Thorpe dragged his fingers through the well of her wetness again, then skimmed up to her back passage. With his free hand, he spread one cheek wide. She tensed. Her opening looked so small, untouched in any way. Was she even ready for this? Did she want any man to have this sort of dominant, primal claim on her?</p><p>\u201cTake the damn ear buds out. I need to talk to Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s surrendering so well. She\u2019s giving us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to consent to this, and I won\u2019t force it on her. Trust me, if she agrees to this, she\u2019s going to surrender more than she ever imagined. Even more than you hoped.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded, then removed the ear buds and cupped her face in his hands. \u201cAll right, lovely?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod. \u201cCan I see you?\u201d</p> <p>Flicking a glance in his direction, Sean asked a silent question. What\u2019s best for her? Thorpe nodded. Cutting off her senses was all well and good, but they\u2019d given her that test. She\u2019d absolutely passed, giving herself over and trusting them entirely. Now she needed reassurance. And he wanted to be with her, talk to her, look at her, feel that instant connection to her soul as he sank deep into her body.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Sean pulled off the blindfold.</p><p>She raised her gaze to him, then turned to look over her shoulder. Thorpe met her stare, and electricity zinged down his spine.</p><p>He leaned over her back, thrust his fingers into her hair and tugged slightly. He set his lips to her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get inside you, Callie. Deep. So damn deep. You\u2019re going to scream for us. You\u2019re going to come for us, too.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered, and to make his point, he rubbed at her clit again, then plunged his fingers into her cunt. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether. At the same time. Are you ready for that?\u201d</p><p>She froze and tried to look over her shoulder at him again. He tugged on her hair. \u201cYes or no. We can discuss it if you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d She stared up at Sean, and Thorpe saw the man\u2019s face soften at her expression. \u201cI trust you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take your ass, Callie. I\u2019m going to ease my way inside and fill you like you\u2019ve never felt. Sean\u2019s going to take up every available bit of space in your pussy. We\u2019re going to fuck you.\u201d We\u2019re going to love you. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make you feel so good. You will communicate with us. Tell us what feels good, what doesn\u2019t. If we\u2019re too fast, too slow, too hard, or just right. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, lovely,\u201d Sean praised her, then he bent to kiss her, taking her mouth with abandon.</p><p>Slowly, Callie relaxed under the long, devouring melding of lips. Thorpe took the opportunity to work her clit with teasing circles, a rhythmic brushing of all those nerves guaranteed to send her soaring when the time was right. Then he paused, cutting off her sensation for long moments. She groaned into Sean\u2019s mouth as if in agony. He repeated the process a few times, dragging her closer and closer to another orgasm with every delicious manipulation of her flesh and every maddening delay.</p><p>\u201cThorpe!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to finish the sentence for him to know what she begged for. \u201cNo coming, pet. You wait for us. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Callie moaned in protest. Thorpe slapped her ass.</p><p>Sean grabbed her chin. \u201cYou will be patient or you\u2019ll get nothing. Now answer Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body tensed, on the edge, flushed and ready and about to burst. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>God, she really was amazing. He knew they were pushing her far and fast, but she just drank in everything they gave her as if she needed to feel like she belonged with them.</p><p>Thorpe was painfully aware that he couldn\u2019t give her anything else tonight.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he praised, removing his fingers from her clit one last time, dipping them into her drenched cunt, then dragging them back to her untried rosette.</p><p>Slowly, gently, he worked his fingers in and spread them apart little by little, back and forth, over and over. They weren\u2019t going to do the job of a good set of anal plugs, and the sensations he was about to heap on her would be totally foreign. But she was as ready as he could make her now.</p><p>Fitting himself against her slick feminine folds, he slid inside her pussy, hissing out his pleasure and gripping her hips as she surrounded him. Fuck, it was heaven in here. Thorpe would love to stay and drown forever. But he remained only long enough to stroke her slowly and coat his cock with her juices. Then he withdrew.</p><p>Finally, he pulled apart the firm, pale globes of her ass and settled the head right against her puckered hole. \u201cArch your back, pet. Push down and exhale. I want this to go as smoothly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Callie gave him a shaky nod and did exactly as he demanded. She welcomed him. Maybe anal sex didn\u2019t say love to some people, but he knew the trust and courage she was showing, and he both admired and adored her for it. Of course, she also looked so fucking sexy, he could barely contain his need to shove inside her and pound her to the most demanding orgasm ever. But he did.</p><p>Backhanding perspiration from his brow, Thorpe began to slide inside her, a deliberate, steady push. The head of his cock eased in. She was every bit as tight as he imagined, and her body heat was already incinerating him. The sweat he\u2019d wiped away just moments ago popped up over his skin again. Then he reached the tight ring of muscle and paused.</p><p>\u201cCallie . . .\u201d He pried her cheeks apart a bit more. \u201cKeep arching. Push down as much as you can. Release a deep breath. Squeeze Sean\u2019s hand. Tell me if it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath and nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Bracing her knees a bit farther apart, she rebalanced and repositioned. Her ass pointed up to him, and he could see her releasing her breath.</p><p>Thorpe bent to kiss the small of her back, then pressed inside her again, gently tunneling down. The plum head of his shaft popped past the tight ring and . . . ah, he was gliding deeper and deeper. Callie gave a sharp gasp. A little pain\u2014not unexpected. But he petted her hip, crooned praises to her, watched as Sean smoothed the hair from her face and smiled at her as if to silently tell her that he was beside her every step of the way.</p><p>It seemed like forever before he found himself buried to the hilt. Once he was, Thorpe couldn\u2019t help but grip the lush curve of her hips and toss his head back with a groan.</p><p>\u201cYou in?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>Thorpe managed to uncross his eyes long enough to nod at the man. \u201cGet ready.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to tell Sean twice. The man grabbed frantically for his condom and tore off his pants. Thorpe didn\u2019t pay attention to the rest. He closed his eyes and reveled in every second of Callie\u2019s burn, of her sweet surrender. God, this would be seared in his memory forever.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he pulled back to the grip of her muscle, then melted into her again. This time, the stroke flowed. Callie breathed through it. Her moan of pleasure at the end ratcheted up his tightening arousal.</p><p>He withdrew and plunged his way into her again, this time with more speed and force. She rewarded him with another incoherent sound of need as she clawed at the sheet. Fuck, if that wasn\u2019t the sexiest thing he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d he barked at Sean. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d The other man wriggled under Callie, brought her head down to his, and kissed her furiously.</p><p>She dissolved into a puddle between them, moaning from deep in her throat, and undulating back into him stroke for stroke. Then Sean was gripping her hips and whispering something thick in her ear that Thorpe couldn\u2019t quite hear over the roar of his heart.</p><p>Callie gave a shuddering gasp as Sean probed her opening and worked his way into her pussy one agonizing inch at a time. Through the thin membrane inside her, Thorpe felt the other man coast up, slowly filling her with every inch of his cock until she began panting and let out a keening cry.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you, lovely?\u201d he asked, strain evident in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tight. I feel so stretched.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe gnashed his teeth and fought for patience. He peeked around Callie\u2019s creamy shoulder, kissing it, then shot Sean a look.</p><p>The other man nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it slow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d she screeched. \u201cFuck me, damn it. I\u2019m dying . . .\u201d</p><p>She liked anal sex and double penetration. Callie had already been the woman of his dreams, but this made her his hottest fantasy, too.</p><p>\u201cDemanding minx,\u201d Sean growled.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. Now hurry!\u201d</p><p>Thorpe slapped her ass once as a matter of principle. \u201cYou don\u2019t make the demands, pet. But as it happens, fucking you suits us.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t wait or reply or even give a shit what he was doing. He simply began thrusting up, shoving into her pussy with long, firm strokes that shook her body. Oh, no way was the fed getting all the pleasure.</p><p>Thorpe found the rhythm of Sean\u2019s strokes and began diving his way into Callie\u2019s ass between each. They quickly fell into sync, like a complicated trio of dancers\u2014Sean plunging inside her, then Thorpe grinding down into her, and Callie rocking her hips for the most impact. It became a symphony of breaths, moans, skin gliding, sheets rustling. Fuck, it was like they\u2019d done this a hundred times and knew the cadence and flow they each needed for maximum pleasure. It was utter magic.</p><p>Sweat now covered his chest and back. It was definitely on the cold side out on a houseboat in November, but July had nothing on him now. He sweltered, felt dizzy, almost fucking faint. His system was overloading with need and pleasure. And a love so strong, Thorpe knew he\u2019d never recover.</p><p>As one, they picked up the pace, each straining until they melded together in perfect sensual harmony. Every sensation seemed to magnify the closer he got to the runaway orgasm he couldn\u2019t stop. Air whispered over his skin. His heart roared. His muscles bunched. Even the hair on his arms stood up as goose bumps covered him. This was going to completely flatten him.</p><p>Change him.</p><p>Sean grabbed Callie and kissed her again, a passionate consuming of her lips cut short by her high-pitched wailing.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sean grated out. \u201cNow. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d Thorpe echoed, knowing that he was seconds from losing all control. \u201cCome for us.\u201d</p><p>Before he even finished the sentence, a guttural cry escaped Callie, something deep and primal and immensely satisfying as she jolted and bucked between them. Sean\u2019s hoarse shout echoed his own as ecstasy blindsided him. His entire body and soul poured into her as he released. She might have given him all of herself, but he\u2019d given her every bit of himself in return . . . everything but the three words that stuck in his throat. But Thorpe had no doubt that he loved her now, tomorrow, and forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>AFTER a shower and a change of sheets, Sean emerged to find Thorpe waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d the big Dom asked solemnly.</p><p>His heart stuttered. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot where Callie can hear us. Outside.\u201d</p><p>Where they\u2019d freeze their asses off? It had to be serious, and Sean feared he knew where this was headed.</p><p>Single file, they walked through the galley, where he paused to kiss Callie gently on the forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re going to step out here for a minute, lovely. We\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her dark brows dipping with obvious concern. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait in the bedroom? You look tired. Get comfortable.\u201d He tried to smile. \u201cTake half the bed. You always do anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d she protested.</p><p>Forcing a laugh, he herded the other man outside, noticing that Thorpe said nothing to Callie. He barely looked at her.</p><p>The moment the door shut behind them, Thorpe walked to the railing at the bow, then turned back to him as if preparing to launch a speech he\u2019d rehearsed in his head.</p><p>Sean lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say it,\u201d he snarled. \u201cOne reason I brought us here was to spend time together, so you could see how perfect this is. I\u2019ve given you access to every part of the woman I love, even some I\u2019ve never taken. I fucking trusted you not to break her heart.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s face closed up even more. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie about the fact that I will never be what she needs. The danger is going to come. Hopefully, she makes it out unscathed. Then you\u2019ll take care of her. You have the capacity to love her and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a total chickenshit. That woman loves you. She would lay down her life for you. Tonight, she trusted you with everything she\u2019s got. Did you not understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got it. Damn it, what do you want from me, to admit that I\u2019m fucking broken? Fine. I am.\u201d Thorpe grabbed his arm and snarled in his face. \u201cI will not spend months or years tearing her down while I try to get my shit together. It\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m doing her a favor.\u201d</p><p>Sean snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. If you leave, you\u2019re going to kill her. And you\u2019re going to destroy yourself in the process. When you wake up a bitter, lonely man, I\u2019m going to hold her tighter and tell her how much I love her. You\u2019ll only deserve every ounce of your misery.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had it. No way he could look at Thorpe anymore\u2014someone he\u2019d considered . . . if not a friend, then a partner in Callie\u2019s completion\u2014and not feel betrayed. Yes, the stupid lug had said he wasn\u2019t staying, but Sean had refused to believe that someone could love Callie as much as he did and still leave.</p><p>With a glare and a jerk of his arm from Thorpe\u2019s grip, Sean turned to head back to the galley.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Thorpe\u2019s voice shook.</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t turn back to him. He didn\u2019t care anymore. \u201cWe\u2019re done. As soon as she\u2019s safe, I expect you to fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will,\u201d he swore. \u201cJust . . . let me have the rest of tonight with her.\u201d</p> <p>That made Sean whirl around, jaw dropped. \u201cAre you out of your mind? There\u2019s no way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch her.\u201d Thorpe held up both hands, fingers splayed. \u201cBut she deserves an explanation. I\u2019ve never told anyone what I\u2019d like to share with her. I can\u2019t give her what she really needs, but I owe her this much.\u201d He swallowed hard, holding back a wealth of regret. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Sean wanted to punch Thorpe, make him hurt and bleed and welcome a painful death. He came so damn close. The only thing that stopped him was Callie. She\u2019d be mad, damn her big heart. And she\u2019d need Thorpe\u2019s explanation for closure. She wouldn\u2019t be able to move on without it.</p><p>\u201cI really hate you right now.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked up at the sky, whether for divine intervention or to ward off tears Sean didn\u2019t know. Nor did he give a shit.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be more than I hate myself.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so defeated. If he was anyone else in any other circumstance, Sean would feel sorry for him. But . . .</p><p>\u201cYou know what she\u2019s been through in the last nine years.\u201d His tone sounded every bit like the accusation it was.</p><p>\u201cI watched it for the last four. If I were the right man for her, I would have scooped her up back in Dallas, and you would never have had a shot. So don\u2019t tell me what she\u2019s endured.\u201d Thorpe drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cI am never going to convince you that I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for her and to not hate me. And I\u2019m deeply sorry. She\u2019s your submissive. I won\u2019t trespass any more than this. Do I have your permission to explain?\u201d</p><p>Sean huffed in short, furious breaths. He struggled to put Callie\u2019s needs above his pride. It chafed him in every way possible to let Thorpe even talk to her now. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a whole night alone in the bedroom with her.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shrugged. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t in order to get the words out. That\u2019s just so I can hold her and convey all I can\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got an hour. Then she\u2019s all mine.\u201d He stormed back into the galley, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Already, Callie looked like she knew she was about to get bad news that would shatter her heart. Sean swore he\u2019d do whatever he must to pick up the pieces and make her whole.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Thorpe reached his big hand out to her, his damp hair still slicked back, his cheeks lean with a fresh shave. Despite his grim expression, he was so achingly handsome.</p><p>Callie knew where this was going. She couldn\u2019t help but overhear his conversation with Sean from the other side of the door. The minute Thorpe\u2019s intention had become clear, a hollow sorrow had assailed her. Tears worked up from her chest, crowding her until she couldn\u2019t keep a blank face. Still, she tried like hell to press them down. All the while, she stared at his hand, wondering . . . if she didn\u2019t take it, would he still break her heart?</p><p>Finally, he approached her softly and slipped his hand in hers. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She dug in her heels. \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to save you,\u201d he swore as he tugged gently on her arm.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please just listen to what I have to say?\u201d</p><p>For once he wasn\u2019t ordering her. He wasn\u2019t using that Dom voice to demand her obedience. She wished he would, but no. Instead, his voice cracked. He sounded like he was falling apart.</p><p>Callie had no way to refuse him.</p><p>Stunned and disintegrating on the inside, she allowed him to lead her to the spare bedroom where the old computer rested. Her head raced, trying to think of a way to keep him from leaving. The pain of his departure was already pelting her all over and spreading debilitating agony. He\u2019d been her constant for four years. Losing him was like losing a piece of herself.</p><p>Thorpe closed the door behind them, then led her to the bed, sitting down and dragging her into his lap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she begged. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you love me at least a little?\u201d</p><p>It sounded pathetic the moment the words left her mouth, and she hated her weakness. The woman behind Callie Ward and every other alias had been tough, never allowing anyone to penetrate her armor, much less hurt her. Where was that woman now?</p><p>Gone. Deeply in love. Mired in loss.</p><p>\u201cI wish it were that simple,\u201d he said with such aching regret. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Callie leapt from his lap and to her feet. She\u2019d let herself fall in love twice, once with a man who couldn\u2019t love her back. Somehow, she had to pull herself together, gather her strength, and not beg Thorpe again.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it. You\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re safe, yes. If it all works out, by tomorrow this time, you\u2019ll be free to be Callindra Howe again.\u201d</p><p>And she wanted that so much. She wanted the world to know that she\u2019d loved her family and would never have harmed them. She wanted to honor their memories. But damn it, she wasn\u2019t sure it would mean anything without Sean by her side . . . and Thorpe on the other.</p><p>\u201cCan you do me one favor and tell me where I fell short. What do you need that I don\u2019t give you?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe cursed under his breath, then reached for her, tumbling her back to the bed and pinning her down with his thigh. She squirmed, anger flaring and making her fight him with everything she had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, damn it. Would you lie still and let me explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 speech? Spare me.\u201d She struggled against him. \u201cLet me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes, please.\u201d His voice shook.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? If you need me to tell you that your leaving won\u2019t break my heart, I\u2019ll lie to you. I love you enough to say that. Just . . . I don\u2019t want to hear the excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He stared down at her, his gray eyes so intent, almost angry with conviction. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare think otherwise. And don\u2019t you lie to me. This is breaking my heart, too. If I was the kind of man capable of the devotion you deserve, I would give it to you, Callie. I would give you everything. I would open my heart for you and . . .\u201d He broke away, turning his back on her and scrubbing a hand down his face. \u201cBut I\u2019m not. Would you please let me tell you why?\u201d</p><p>Callie felt her heart shatter into a thousand pieces in her chest. She wanted to be furious with him, rant and rail and tell him to go to hell. But it was obvious that whatever was tormenting him was killing him inside. He\u2019d always been an island\u2014controlled and closed off, a part of everyone around him yet not. His ability to remove himself was one of the things that made him a great Dungeon Master.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Tears fell like hot acid down her cheeks. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her with a watery gaze. \u201cI want you to know what I\u2019ve never told anyone. It\u2019s the only way I can explain that there\u2019s never been a more special woman in my life, and I will never forget you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word you say makes it sound like you love me. Whatever it is, we\u2019ll work it out. We\u2019re strong. We can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe summer I was fourteen, I started my first D/s relationship. My dad worked. My mom was out with friends, doing charity work, lunching . . . whatever she did. I was stuck alone in a big house with our cook and maid. To a teenage boy, Nara was hot. Eight years older than me and fresh from Brazil. I\u2019d been in lust with her for over a year.\u201d</p><p>Callie swallowed. She didn\u2019t want to hear this. She didn\u2019t. On some level, she knew that he needed to say it. And that she\u2019d need to understand later when the shock had passed and she bargained with herself to find him and try again\u2014whatever she thought would end her pain. So as much as she wanted to dash out of the room, she simply nodded. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad had some magazines. I know now they were BDSM-themed. I\u2019d been having fantasies of tying girls up and spanking them since puberty set in. My head told me it was wrong. A good guy didn\u2019t have \u2018violent\u2019 urges. But that didn\u2019t stop the thoughts. And these pictures proved that I wasn\u2019t the only one who felt this way. They fueled my thoughts like never before.\u201d He tried to turn his pained expression into a rueful smile. \u201cAs teenage boys do, when they don\u2019t have anyone to play with, they play with themselves. Nara found me.\u201d</p><p>A thousand questions ran through Callie\u2019s head. Had this woman chastised him? Made him feel dirty? Blabbed to his mother? \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was holding a pair of cuffs in her hand and said that if I wanted to experience my fantasies, she would teach me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexually, she could be. That summer, I began learning how to be a Dom. It was a teenage boy\u2019s paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou restrained her?\u201d</p><p>He gave a low, bitter laugh. \u201cIn the first five minutes. I spanked her, flogged her, paddled her. She taught me to use a whip, how to tie knots, how to read a sub\u2019s body language, how to anticipate her needs, how to discipline, control, and manipulate. There was nothing I couldn\u2019t do to her. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Callie blinked at him. \u201cYou had sex with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. A lot of it. In about every way you can think of.\u201d</p><p>At fourteen? \u201cMitchell . . . She took advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was no one\u2019s victim. I was a very willing participant. She gave me an education I craved. I\u2019m not proud of it now. At the time, I was the envy of my friends.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBy sixteen, I was six foot one and could grow a decent beard. No one questioned my age, so she took me to my first club. I loved it. She was an exhibitionist, and I didn\u2019t mind. I started learning from the other Doms. Needle play, fire play, blood play, breath play\u2014she wanted it all. She even let me pierce her. And m\u00e9nages. Lots and lots of those. She liked it when I invited friends over or took her to someone\u2019s house with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman had abused him. Of course, a teenage boy wouldn\u2019t see it like that, but there was no way he could have been ready for all that. Sex alone required some emotional maturity. A BDSM relationship even more. In retrospect, Callie had been way too unprepared to sleep with Holden at sixteen. She\u2019d felt a bit guilty and dirty afterward\u2014and that was with a guy she\u2019d thought she loved.</p><p>Oh gawd. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sighed heavily, the sound so deep with remorse. \u201cAfter four years together and sexcapades all across the East Coast, I thought so. Right after I turned eighteen, I saw college on the horizon. I knew I\u2019d be leaving home, and the thought of doing without Nara was killing me. It was all hormones and teenage angst.</p><p>\u201cAbout two weeks before I left, she called me late one night. As I\u2019d done many times, I snuck out and we met at some play party.\u201d Thorpe drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cAfter the scene and the sex, I finally worked up the courage to tell her that I loved her. She\u2019d never been one to make love or cuddle or show affection. She didn\u2019t even like kissing much. I just thought that was her.\u201d</p> <p>That terrible woman had used him. How could he have imagined that he loved her? Because he\u2019d been young and confused and hadn\u2019t known better. Her heart went out to Thorpe. She wanted to touch him so badly and tell him that it wasn\u2019t his fault, but she sensed that he wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I asked her to come away with me. Nara laughed. Completely fell on the floor, giggling hysterically. She called me a stupid boy. She said she\u2019d basically been changing my diapers for the last four years and she was done. According to her, I was too stupid to know that love didn\u2019t exist; only sex did. Then she told me that I\u2019d better not confuse the two again because I still had a lot to learn. Apparently, my father was a better fuck.\u201d</p><p>Callie gasped. Shock stunned her system, a jolt to her heart, a twist to her stomach. She couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cNara and your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Apparently, he found her on a business trip in Rio and hired her. My mother wasn\u2019t submissive and told him if he wanted to do \u2018that,\u2019 he needed to find someone else. So he did. He\u2019d moved Nara in to be his mistress and paid her well. But he traveled a lot, and she was angry at being left behind after he\u2019d promised to show her the world. I was her revenge.\u201d</p><p>That would have been a terrible blow to a teenage boy\u2019s spirit. Barely a man, he must have been crushed by her cruelty. To know she\u2019d used him over and over just to get back at someone else . . .</p> <p>Callie had felt stupid to have been deceived by Holden and hadn\u2019t trusted anyone for nearly a decade because of it. And her ex-boyfriend hadn\u2019t been vicious, just greedy and horny. Nara had done her best to destroy him for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She fused her gaze with his, willing him to understand that she would never treat him that way. \u201cWhat she did to you was unforgivable. You have to know I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d Thorpe was clearly trying to hold it together.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she could hear more. But for him, she would. In some ways, she understood how terrible it had been to endure such venom, then to keep it all inside. She knew the loneliness, the never feeling quite whole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confronted my father the day before I left for college. He was furious that I\u2019d touched his \u2018property\u2019 and told me that I deserved every bit of my heartache. He mocked me for thinking that I was in love. In his view, perverts like us aren\u2019t capable of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful. And wrong! You may not ever say the words to me, but I know you love me. You watched over me, took care of me, risked your life for me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a knowing gleam in his eyes, my father asked me if I had known that Nara was playing me, would I still have fucked her? He knew exactly what my answer would be. And he was right. I might have been more guarded, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were young.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shrugged as if he refused to excuse himself. \u201cAfter that, I went to my room. He cast Nara off the next day, sent her back to Brazil. He and I didn\u2019t speak again until my mother\u2019s funeral five years later.\u201d</p><p>More tears spilled down her cheeks. How was Thorpe even remotely warm or compassionate after all this? Because his soul was beautiful. How could she make him see that? \u201cDid you ever repair your relationship with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Thorpe looked down, clenching his jaw and his fists. \u201cHe came to my wedding and told me at the reception that I was an idiot for marrying a nice girl because I\u2019d soon be bored with her and either stray or divorce her\u2014or both. And if I stayed, I\u2019d be as miserable a bastard as he\u2019d been for thirty years. I invited him because Melissa begged me to bury the hatchet as a wedding gift to her, but I hated him with a passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told your ex-wife about Nara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cShe would have been horrified. She was from a loud Italian family, sarcastic and passionate, but very vanilla. I hadn\u2019t engaged in any BDSM activities since Nara. I\u2019d sworn off it, but the fucking need wouldn\u2019t go away. We\u2019d been growing apart because I couldn\u2019t say those three words to her. I approached her to see if she\u2019d be willing to try a light scene. I craved it so badly. She walked out that night and served me with divorce papers a week later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a bitch,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI scared her. Our sex had been tepid at best, and now she knew why. She swore that if I ever tried to spank her or tie her down, she\u2019d press charges. I couldn\u2019t change the way she was wired any more than she could change the way I was. The worst part for me was knowing my father had been right about our marriage. So after the split, I changed my whole life and gave myself over to my addiction.</p><p>\u201cI quit my job as a stockbroker. I moved out of Manhattan. I\u2019d been to Dallas once on a business trip and liked it. I moved there and bought Dominion with my savings. My dad died six months later, and I inherited more money than I knew what to do with. So I sunk a bunch back into the business and made it my life. I think I was completely numb for years.\u201d He drew in a ragged breath. \u201cThen came you . . .\u201d</p><p>Thorpe cupped her cheek, and she gripped his hand. \u201cThank you for trusting me with your story. You didn\u2019t have to tell me, but I know you did to help me.\u201d And when she hurt less, maybe she would be more grateful. \u201cDon\u2019t ever, ever think you\u2019re unworthy. You saved me, Mitchell Thorpe. You reminded me what it was like to belong somewhere again. You gave me strength. Even if you can\u2019t admit it, you gave me love.\u201d</p><p>He teared up again and swallowed down a lump. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you more than I can possibly express.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting them win, your father and Nara,\u201d she couldn\u2019t stop herself from pointing out. \u201cThey hurt you decades ago, but you\u2019re allowing them to keep you in misery. I don\u2019t need the words if you can\u2019t say them. Just don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He covered her lips with his finger. \u201cThey won a long time ago. Leaving is my way of refusing to let them hurt you. This is me protecting you. Let me. It\u2019s the only way I can show you what\u2019s here.\u201d He pounded on his chest. \u201cWhen I\u2019m gone, tell Sean my story, if you need. Above all, be happy with him.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shredded her, and still Callie just wanted to hug and soothe him. She wanted to give him her love. But if he needed to slip away quietly, she would let him. It was the only way he would allow her to show him that she loved him enough to sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cI, of all people, understand why sometimes you just can\u2019t stay.\u201d She barely got the words out past her tears. \u201cI will think of you every day. I will be happy with Sean because I love him. But I will always love you, too. And for what it\u2019s worth, I think you have a big heart that anyone would be blessed to share. Try to find some peace.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe finally broke down and grabbed her against him, sobbing silently into her shoulder. They stayed that way for what seemed like hours, breathing together, memorizing one another, mourning what couldn\u2019t be. He dug his fingers into her back and pressed her nose to his shoulder. Despite the discomfort, she couldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Sean finally eased the door open. \u201cLovely?\u201d</p><p>Callie sniffled and nodded at him. It was time. She and Thorpe had nothing left to say except he gave her an achingly soft kiss on her forehead and whispered one final word. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>DAWN began to break over the lake, mountains reaching toward the sky and still hiding the golden orb of the sun. Light leaked over the peaks, and everything looked so peaceful. Callie knew this day would likely be hell.</p><p>In a perfect world, they would find a car and drive quietly to the Vegas FBI field office and call Sean\u2019s boss. They would look at all the evidence, know that she wasn\u2019t guilty of murder while figuring out who was. Then authorities would arrest the person or people, and she could start actually living again.</p><p>But her life had never been perfect. Whether Sean said it or not, she was expecting the worst. And even if the danger never came, Thorpe would still go.</p><p>Either way, she was going to lose today.</p><p>Sean docked the boat in furious silence, glaring occasionally at Thorpe who stood two feet behind her\u2014a silent sentinel. All their bags sat at her feet. No one said a word.</p><p>The houseboat dipped toward the shore, nudging the rubber bumper on the dock before sliding into place. Sean killed the engine and leapt out to tie the boat off. As soon as it was secure, he approached and slung her backpack over his shoulder. Then he picked up his own, gave Thorpe\u2019s bags a pointed glower, took her hand, and led her ashore.</p><p>Nothing could have said more eloquently that Sean no longer considered Thorpe a partner. Callie stared over her shoulder at Thorpe\u2019s stony face as he grabbed his briefcase and followed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already called Werner. He should be here with his truck any minute. He\u2019s agreed to take us to the outskirts of the city. We can take a taxi from there,\u201d Sean told her.</p><p>\u201cLet me call Elijah,\u201d Thorpe argued. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that his Jeep is still in that Walmart parking lot. It\u2019s only been thirty-six hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your help,\u201d Sean snarled.</p><p>\u201cBut you need it until Callie is safe. It\u2019s not smart to wait on the street corner for a taxi like an easy target.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked like he was weighing his rage against his common sense. \u201cFine. Call him.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe stepped aside and withdrew his burner phone, turning away. Within seconds, he was having a low-voiced conversation Callie couldn\u2019t hear. She could feel Sean seethe as he started down the dirt road, waiting for the houseboat owner to fetch them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this. He\u2019s got demons bigger than you can ever imagine.\u201d She sent him an imploring stare. \u201cJust let it go. For me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hurt you. I thought he would help heal you, but he\u2019s leaving a gaping hole in your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assured. \u201cIt won\u2019t break me or kill me. It will always hurt some; I won\u2019t lie. But you and I? We\u2019ll be happy. We\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>Tight-lipped, Sean turned his attention back to the wide cement road and the pair of headlights bobbing up and down as a pickup truck traveled over the slightly uneven surface. Thorpe ended his call and joined them.</p><p>The old man stopped the truck near the dock and hopped out with an unexpectedly spry step. \u201cThrow your bags in the back and tell me where you want to go. We should make it fast. Some military types were in my office yesterday asking about you. I told them I didn\u2019t know anything, pushy bastards. But I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen the last of them.\u201d</p><p>Fear struck deep and hard in Callie\u2019s heart. She and Sean exchanged a glance, then she looked over at Thorpe, who wore his resolution like armor. Neither would let anything happen to her; they\u2019d give up their lives first. And no way was she going down without a fight. She was going to finally start living\u2014or die.</p><p>\u201cHow many? What did they look like?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo guys. One older, one younger. They both wore some fancy-shmancy uniform with the stupid little French hats.\u201d</p><p>The fear became terror. \u201cYou mean berets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the uniforms a gray-blue?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>Werner looked between the two of them. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Sean put his arm around her and did his best to calm her. Her enemies were close and closing in. She wanted to be brave and face this down\u2014and she would. But she couldn\u2019t seem to stop trembling.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He shepherded her toward the truck.</p><p>As soon as they\u2019d tossed their luggage in the back, Callie followed the guys to the passenger door and took hold of her backpack. She couldn\u2019t risk damaging the egg or losing the SD card tucked inside again. That disc was the key to her future. They\u2019d looked for a way to copy the file or backup the information somewhere else, just in case. But short of saving it on Werner\u2019s hard drive, they hadn\u2019t found the means. There had been no Internet or any other storage device on board. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Werner slipped into the driver\u2019s seat. Thorpe folded his tall frame in on the other side, sliding to the middle of the bench seat. His knees damn near folded against his chest. He had nowhere else to put them.</p><p>Looking like he\u2019d rather eat dirt, Sean climbed in beside him until they sat with their broad shoulders squeezed together and their thighs pressed close. He pretended like Thorpe didn\u2019t exist and put her backpack on the floorboard between his feet, then reached down a hand to help her. \u201cCome up. Sit on my lap.\u201d</p><p>She braced her foot on the running board and climbed in, doing her best to perch on Sean\u2019s thighs. Curling up against his chest, she found her senses pelted by the two men she loved. Their scents blended, the press of their bodies quickly warming the cab on this chilly morning. She\u2019d missed that so much as she\u2019d tried to sleep last night.</p><p>Callie wondered if this was the last time she\u2019d feel remotely whole.</p> <p>As soon as Sean managed to shut the passenger door, Werner took off, driving into the glorious sunrise spreading across the Nevada desert. It looked expansive and calm. Best of all, there was no way anyone could follow them clandestinely out here, in the middle of nowhere. There was no place to hide. So Callie tried to sink into the moment and push all the angst and worry aside. None of it would help her today. But it kept crowding in. By the time she laid her head down tonight to sleep, everything would likely be different.</p><p>Or she\u2019d be dead.</p><p>\u201cElijah says his Jeep is still at the Walmart,\u201d Thorpe offered. \u201cHe was waiting for his wife to return before he went out there, and that won\u2019t be for another few days. He says its ours for the duration if we need it.\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t say a word, just nodded. She really wished he wouldn\u2019t be so angry, and she suspected it wasn\u2019t totally about Thorpe hurting her. He\u2019d been hurt, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>\u201cLeast I could do,\u201d Thorpe answered with a wealth of meaning behind his words.</p><p>The rest of the drive was silent. Traffic was minimal this early in the morning. Soon, the roads would be hopping with commuters, but for now, they reached the big-box chain store with barely a stoplight to obstruct them.</p><p>Once in the parking lot, they fished the keys from the magnetic holder behind the wheel well and shoved most of their bags from the truck into the back of the Jeep. Sean jumped in the driver\u2019s seat, watching the parking lot all around them for any activity. But it was dead empty, save for a few employees. Callie gestured Thorpe to the front, then crawled in the back with her pack, wishing she could curl up and sleep. She hadn\u2019t all last night, even when Sean had drifted off with his arms around her protectively. She\u2019d missed having the other half of her soul beside her.</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give for everything to be different with Thorpe and for today to turn out right . . .</p><p>Sean looked at her in the backseat. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can drive straight to the field office here and walk you in to see the SAC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSAC?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSpecial Agent in Charge. Once we do that, we\u2019ll call back to the Dallas office and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s phone rang. They all froze. No one calling him at six-thirty in the morning was going to be trying to reach him for a friendly chat.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Sean barked.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut him on speaker.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe frowned, then did what Sean demanded. \u201cHey, man. What you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little more information, and none of it gives me a warm fuzzy. Elijah was finally able to send me a security image of the dude trolling for Callie at the airport . . . How is she, by the way?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Callie knew firsthand that Logan packed a hell of a wallop when he spanked a girl\u2019s ass, but he had also proven to be a friend through and through. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks. You and Tara?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll good. Don\u2019t worry about us. The guy at the airport, hun? His name is James Whitney. Does that ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She\u2019d never heard it in her life. \u201cShould it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. Tara did some digging, but is having a tough time finding much. He\u2019s twenty-nine and from some little-ass town in Alabama. An Iraq War vet. He came home to find his wife and kid had left. Between his PTSD and his antigovernment ravings, most of his neighbors thought he was a loose cannon. He was arrested for drunk and disorderly and unlawful possession of a handgun, but the charges didn\u2019t stick. About three years ago, he dropped off the grid. There are rumors that he\u2019s joined some group of mercenaries. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got now. But there\u2019s something here. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>Callie drew in a deep breath. Why would this James Whitney want anything to do with her? He had barely been much older than her when her family had been killed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either. But there\u2019s an answer here. We\u2019ll keep looking. Do you need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d There was nothing Logan could do for her from Lafayette.</p><p>\u201cI do, Edgington,\u201d Sean spoke up. \u201cSean Mackenzie here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my sub ever comes to you again wanting to disappear, politely refer her back to me.\u201d</p><p>Logan cleared his throat. \u201cI was trying to help. I didn\u2019t have all the info. Sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>With that, they ended the call. Sean drove northeast as Callie tried not to nibble on a ragged nail and imagine the worst.</p><p>\u201cThere are a million pieces to this puzzle and I don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said finally, her voice tight with encroaching panic.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why this Whitney character would be hunting you down in the Vegas airport. But if he was wearing the same uniform as the older man who came to your house just before your father\u2019s murder, they might be in league together,\u201d Sean mused. \u201cAfter all, Werner just said that two uniforms visited him, one old, one young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking,\u201d Thorpe popped in. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re related to some sort of mercenary group, maybe they wanted Aslanov\u2019s research to make themselves better or something like that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that made sense in a warped way. \u201cBut to kill innocent men, women, and children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreed does strange things to people, lovely,\u201d Sean pointed out. \u201cI\u2019ve been a criminal investigator for a decade. I\u2019ve seen some terrible instances of that.\u201d</p><p>How fucking tragic. Her father had only tried to do something good for the world and instead, he set off a chain of murders, including his own, and set her life on its ear.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take the FBI to read everything on the SD card, investigate, and arrest people? Weeks? Months?\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where it will lead, Callie. You\u2019ll be free from any implication.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt\u2019s possible you may be put in Witness Protection. If that happens, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s heart stopped. She had spent a decade being someone else. She didn\u2019t want that anymore. The time had finally come to be Callindra Howe again, to put her family\u2019s memory to rest. To live the life her mother had hoped for her.</p><p>And if the federal government put her into hiding . . . She watched movies and read books. Callie already knew that she\u2019d never be allowed to contact Thorpe again. That would put them both in danger.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s got to be another way. I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019d rather die.\u201d</p><p>Sean gaped at her from the rearview mirror. Thorpe turned around and glared.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you do that,\u201d Sean snapped.</p><p>\u201cI have to second that,\u201d Thorpe added.</p><p>They gave one another a wary stare before Sean snapped his gaze back to the road. Traffic was beginning to pick up as rush hour began and they drove closer to the heart of the city.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anyone trustworthy in the Vegas office you can call?\u201d Thorpe asked. \u201cLet them know we\u2019re coming in. Or better yet, maybe they can send someone to escort us, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s face tightened. \u201cThe agents I worked with a couple of years ago have been reassigned or retired. I\u2019m not sure who I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had questions about the decisions in the Dallas office,\u201d Thorpe conceded. \u201cBut does that necessarily mean that someone here is keeping secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not . . . but I can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we already know that killers are hot on our tail from Werner,\u201d Callie argued. \u201cNo one in the FBI will shoot us dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cBut there are worse things than being shot. That\u2019s what worries me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean if someone is dirty?\u201d Thorpe looked tense and pensive.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s possible I\u2019m being paranoid.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve got an escape route if we need it, so I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>Sean pulled off the road into a fast-food restaurant\u2019s parking lot. As commuters started wrapping around the building in their vehicles, waiting for liquid caffeine and fortification, he drove to the edge of the lot and kept the engine running. \u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>He jumped out with his phone in both hands, staring intently at the screen and dialing something. A moment later, he pressed the phone to his ear. The conversation lasted less than thirty seconds. Then Sean was running back to the car. He tossed his phone onto the asphalt, and it splintered into a dozen pieces.</p><p>Callie gasped. \u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He peeled out of the parking lot and swerved back onto the freeway, cutting off a little subcompact. \u201cAs soon as I identified myself, the SAC took the phone. That shouldn\u2019t happen. He demanded that I bring you in, Callie. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Her heart caught in her throat. \u201cLike he wants to arrest me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called it \u2018questioning,\u2019 but something is off. He asked what we\u2019d been doing in Vegas for the last thirty-six hours. He knew you were with me. He knew I\u2019d shopped at that Walmart and that we\u2019d taken a taxi from there. Which means he may even know we\u2019re in this Jeep.\u201d Sean weaved in and out of the swelling traffic. \u201cI tossed my phone so that he couldn\u2019t trace that signal anymore, just in case they\u2019re locked on to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I do the same?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hurt.\u201d Sean nodded tightly.</p><p>Thorpe rolled down the window and dumped it onto the freeway without hesitation. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur one saving grace was that they hadn\u2019t been able to find out from the cab company exactly where they\u2019d taken us. They were still doing paperwork to obtain the information. We have to ditch this Jeep and find another cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should probably head back toward the Strip,\u201d Thorpe suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Mouth pressed together tensely, Sean switched lanes and followed the signs toward the touristy section of Vegas. \u201cIt will probably take twenty or thirty minutes or so from here. Depends on the traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we get a cab, where are we going then?\u201d Callie asked. \u201cIt\u2019s all fine and dandy to disappear into anonymous transportation, but where do we tell him to drive us if not the field office? Local police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sean said immediately. \u201cThe SAC will just swoop in and claim jurisdiction, then we\u2019ll be right back to where we started. There\u2019s got to be another way to get you free. Who else wants the information on that disc?\u201d</p><p>Callie sat back in the seat, trying not to let panic overwhelm her. If Sean didn\u2019t know where to turn, she feared they were doomed. \u201cMaybe Logan could get paperwork for us to leave the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that if the killers tracked us to Lake Mead, they can follow us anywhere. The way they\u2019re operating, I don\u2019t think they have boundaries. They\u2019ll go wherever and do whatever for that remaining research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said my father burned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know that,\u201d Thorpe reminded. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if we find a way to convey that the research doesn\u2019t exist anymore, maybe they will leave me alone?\u201d That sounded awfully optimistic, but Callie still hoped deep down that Sean believed it, too.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYou still know something about these people and what they want. You still have enough evidence to suggest they killed your family and the Aslanovs. And you\u2019re the only eyewitness who can tie both Whitney and the older bastard he\u2019s working with to this conspiracy. They will kill you in a heartbeat to bury their skeletons.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Callie fought to breathe. She wouldn\u2019t die for greed, for research that didn\u2019t exist anymore, to keep a dirty secret.</p><p>Then a solution hit her\u2014so simple and effective. She grabbed her backpack and tore into it, pulling out her cosmetics case. \u201cAs soon as we find a taxi, I think I know where to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>SEAN began to wonder if Callie was out of her mind. She was in the backseat getting all dolled up, carefully applying mascara with a hand mirror, then teasing and smoothing her hair with a small brush.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, lovely, but I don\u2019t think now is the time to worry about all this.\u201d</p><p>A glance to his right showed that Thorpe looked as confused as he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect time. I\u2019m going to make a big splash.\u201d She dug into her backpack and pulled out some black leggings and a simple V-neck shirt in red. She shimmied out of her old clothes and into the new, then exchanged her tennis shoes for some black sandals.</p> <p>Somehow, she made clothes that had been rumpled into a ball five minutes ago look perfect.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Thorpe demanded. \u201cWhat do you have planned in that mischievous head of yours?\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m still working out the details. Get me to a taxi. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should clue me in. After all, I have some experience at eluding bad guys,\u201d Sean said ironically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put my trust in you for the last thirty-six hours. Now it\u2019s time for you to do the same for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing and grumbling, Sean continued heading northwest, toward downtown. Traffic was definitely picking up now that it was after seven a.m. They slowed to the speed he\u2019d drive on a residential street as he headed north on I-515. Fucking mess.</p><p>Ten minutes to go, max. Then they could disappear into a cab, get lost in a sea of humanity, and hopefully whatever the devil was in Callie\u2019s head would save the day.</p><p>Another glance in the rearview mirror alarmed him. A black sedan two cars back and to the right. They\u2019d picked it up a few minutes ago\u2014along with a lot of other cars. But this one . . . every time he switched lanes, so did the sedan.</p><p>With the hair at the back of his neck standing up, Sean slowed down. It wasn\u2019t hard with this many cars. The lane of traffic beside him was moving a tad faster. But the black sedan slowed, too.</p><p>Growling a curse, Sean changed lanes again, getting directly in front of the dark car. He glanced in the rearview mirror, hoping to see someone blabbing on the phone, a woman putting on her mascara, or someone reading their texts\u2014anything that said this driver wasn\u2019t really paying attention to them. Instead, he saw two men in an unfamiliar bluish uniform, one fancier than the other. He tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Thorpe asked.</p> <p>Sean didn\u2019t really want to talk to him, but Thorpe was another gun and more muscle. He needed that more than resentment now. \u201cWe\u2019ve got company. Callie, have you worked out your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to make a phone call. Neither of you has a phone anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re destroyed.\u201d Thorpe looked grim.</p><p>\u201cKeep getting to the taxi. I\u2019ll figure out how to make this work.\u201d</p><p>An exit appeared on the right. He sped up and put on his blinker, pretending that he intended to change to the fast lane on the left. At the last moment, he jerked the wheel right, cutting off an SUV, then bumped onto the off-ramp, flooring it.</p><p>The other car hit the brakes, tires screeching, then followed them off the ramp.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Thorpe said, turning to look out the back windshield.</p><p>That summed it up. Sean navigated the traffic, dodging cars, changing lanes, screaming through a yellow light to try to lose their tail.</p> <p>The black sedan simply ran the red and continued on, firing a semiautomatic out the window.</p><p>\u201cJesus, they could kill anyone!\u201d Sean cursed, thankful that the bullets had missed. \u201cWe should hit the Strip soon. If I can\u2019t shake this tail, we won\u2019t have time to retrieve our luggage from the back. Callie, hand Thorpe your backpack. As soon as I stop the Jeep, everyone bail out and run.\u201d</p><p>In the backseat, Callie gave him a nod. Besides lushing up her lashes with mascara, she\u2019d rimmed her bright blue eyes in her signature black liner. Her eyes stood out in her pale face, broken only by the red gloss on her lips. Now wasn\u2019t the time to notice how damn beautiful she was, but he couldn\u2019t help it. She looked especially lovely with her delicate face full of determination. Hell, he really was madly in love.</p><p>As Sean raced down Tropicana Avenue, he also realized that finding a quick place to ditch the Jeep on the Strip might be tough. Time to improvise.</p><p>Sean hung a right onto Las Vegas Boulevard the second he could, grateful that traffic wasn\u2019t too heavy. When he saw the street sign for Las Vegas Boulevard, he hung a sharp right onto the edge of the Strip. A screech of tires behind told him the sedan was doing its best to follow suit.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you going?\u201d Thorpe barked.</p><p>\u201cLooking for a place to lose the Jeep and pick up a cab,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>Thankfully, the traffic in the tourist areas wasn\u2019t as heavy at this hour. Random cars and the occasional cab drifted by. Some hungover partiers were doing the walk of shame back to their hotels.</p><p>The grandeur of the Bellagio jumped out at him, the famous fountain show idle this early in the morning. He floored it down the relatively empty side street leading to the hotel, past the standing streetlamps meant to be charming. Through the back passenger window, he caught a glimpse of the fake Eiffel Tower that always made him roll his eyes\u2014and the black sedan heading toward the curve to follow him, about thirty seconds behind. At least they had stopped shooting for now.</p><p>He roared under the canopy and glanced to his right, past the topiaries. A few idling taxies, a shuttle bus full of spent revelers leaving for the airport, and some members of the valet staff milling around.</p><p>The second the car came to a shuddering stop, they all jumped out and slammed the doors.</p><p>Sean threw the keys at a valet attendant and flashed his badge. \u201cEmergency. I\u2019ll be back. Park it now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the young man answered.</p><p>He gripped Callie\u2019s hand as they ran toward the hotel, searching the line of taxis and praying that his instincts were right. Bingo! Away from the line of vehicles for hire he spotted a taxi with its light off and an older man napping in the front seat. He pounded on the window.</p><p>The man started and adjusted his ball cap with a glower. \u201cCan\u2019t you read? I\u2019m off duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s life or death. Please.\u201d Callie pressed her face to the glass and she might have thrust her breasts a bit closer to the window, too.</p><p>As Sean flashed his badge he wanted to gnash his teeth, but at least the guy wasn\u2019t scowling anymore.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a thousand dollars in cash if you get us out of here in the next ten seconds.\u201d Thorpe reached into his pocket and pulled out a wad of bills. \u201cAnd keep yourself off duty.\u201d</p><p>The driver straightened up and unlocked the doors. They all piled in as the cabbie peeled out.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sean looked at Callie, who crawled down to the floorboard. He didn\u2019t want to think about how filthy it was down there, but to her credit, she didn\u2019t blink once, just put their safety above possible germs. In order to conceal himself, he had to slink low in the seat and bow his head. Thorpe reclined, propping himself up on his elbow against the lumpy upholstery. Hopefully, they were hidden enough so that anyone driving by wouldn\u2019t notice them.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest TV station?\u201d she asked the driver.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Thorpe howled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to the press?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely,\u201d Sean began with a note of warning. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out. The egg can prove my identity. Because so few still exist, the owners of all the remaining pieces can be verified. What\u2019s on the SD card can prove that I\u2019m not guilty of anything. It cuts through the red tape and BS. No going back into hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making yourself a bigger target,\u201d Sean protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She shook her head, her dark hair covering her shoulders and brushing her arms. \u201cWhoever\u2019s been looking for me wants the part of the research that no longer exists. We go public with the fact that my father burned it. And whoever offed everyone else and is after me now wants to keep their dirty deeds a secret. By exposing it all, killing me doesn\u2019t bury anything anymore. It only draws attention to their misdeeds. Once the world knows I\u2019m alive and what\u2019s happened . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be a media frenzy,\u201d Thorpe finished for her. \u201cYou\u2019ll have such a spotlight on you, they won\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s damn clever.\u201d Sean couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. \u201cLovely minx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s that TV station?\u201d she asked the cabbie, who looked totally confused by their conversation.</p><p>\u201cLess than a mile up the road. It\u2019s KSNV, the NBC affiliate. Will that do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Relief made her entire face glow. \u201cThe Today show should be on. It\u2019s got a great viewership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord should travel fast,\u201d Thorpe agreed.</p><p>Sean wanted to pound the wistful expression off the other man\u2019s face and tell him that if he adored Callie so much, he should fucking stay. But no sense in arguing now. Sean had to focus on shielding her from the coming media storm. But he had no doubt he\u2019d wish now and then that Thorpe had pulled his head out of his ass before it had come to good-bye.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . that\u2019s great and all,\u201d the driver interjected, \u201cbut I think someone is following us. Black sedan?\u201d</p><p>Sean resisted the urge to peek through the back windshield to verify. Damn it, how had these goons figured out their escape route so quickly? Why couldn\u2019t they shake these assholes?</p><p>\u201cAct like there\u2019s nothing wrong. See if you can get him to pass us. Confuse him by taking a circular route to the TV station. Anything.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed for a moment, and the cabbie seemed to change lanes. He pulled out a smoke and fished around for his lighter. As soon as he found it, he dropped it and stomped on the gas pedal.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any fooling the guys in the black sedan. They\u2019ve got guns!\u201d</p><p>And they were tenacious. A second later, a loud bang resounded, and the back window on the passenger\u2019s side shattered. Thorpe reacted quickly, covering Callie\u2019s body with his own.</p><p>Sean drew the Glock he\u2019d been hiding in the waistband holster tucked inside his jeans and peeked out the open window. \u201cSlow down so I can get a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d The man\u2019s gray brows slashed down in the rearview mirror. \u201cI\u2019m not aiding a murder, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a badge, remember? I\u2019m FBI, protecting a witness. Now slow down so I can get a damn shot. If you don\u2019t and we somehow manage to live, I\u2019ll arrest your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking do what he said!\u201d Thorpe barked.</p><p>Sean waited as the driver eased off the gas. The sedan roared up to their side again.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I say so, take the next right and floor it. Got it?\u201d</p><p>The cabdriver nodded excitedly. \u201cI always wanted to do this. It looks cool in the movies.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to roll his eyes, Sean inched up and aimed his weapon out the window. He fired off a couple of shots, hitting the side of the car, but not the passenger or driver. That shit only happened in the movies. But even if they turned right suddenly, Sean didn\u2019t think it was going to be enough to prevent the attackers from pursuing. He needed to try again.</p><p>\u201cKeep her on the floor and covered.\u201d He barked at Thorpe as he slammed back against the seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your back,\u201d Thorpe vowed.</p><p>Not always, but now wasn\u2019t the time to worry about tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cJust a little farther,\u201d he told the old man at the steering wheel. \u201cAt the parking lot on the other side of the upcoming intersection, turn in. Don\u2019t signal, just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cBob.\u201d He gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get to be on the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d Sean nearly shook his head. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>As they soared through the green light and just past the black car, he took another shot and hit the windshield. It splintered, caving in on the pair of mercenaries.</p><p>Bob jerked the car right, and it bounced into the parking lot. He dodged a hatchback swinging into the parking lot.</p><p>The sedan locked up its brakes and tried to turn right in front of the far lane of traffic. Tires screeched. A pickup truck hit the car\u2019s back panel on the passenger side with a cringeworthy metallic crunch. Sean twisted around to look through the back windshield. The sedan was almost backward in the intersection. The truck ground to a halt, along with several of the cars behind them, and blocked the intersection. The sedan was trapped.</p><p>A bystander got out to check on the people involved in the accident. The driver of the sedan, the older asswipe in uniform, rolled down his window and started shouting, gesturing wildly for everyone to get out of his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The back window on the driver\u2019s side of the car eased down. Out came the gun again. People screamed and dropped to the ground.</p><p>\u201cFloor it!\u201d Sean told Bob. \u201cGet us to that fucking TV station now.\u201d</p><p>They made a right and left the scene of the accident\u2014and their pursuers\u2014behind. Sean breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d Bob roared as he cruised down a side street.</p> <p>\u201cIs it safe now?\u201d Callie asked under Thorpe.</p><p>\u201cI think.\u201d Sean tapped Thorpe on the shoulder. \u201cYou, ease up. But be prepared, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe nodded and lifted away from Callie, but helped her up from the tight wedge of the floorboard, clutching her hand in his and drawing it closer to his chest. She looked so pale, it scared him.</p><p>Sean grabbed her chin. \u201cBreathe, lovely. Don\u2019t pass out on me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and drew in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m good. I swear.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t convinced, but before he could question her further, Bob was pulling up into a parking lot, past a giant carport, heading for a nondescript off-white building with a big blue News 3 sign jutting from the flat roof. He brought the car to a grinding halt in a reserved spot with a big grin on his face.</p><p>Bouncing against the backseat, Thorpe thrust into his pocket and extracted Bob\u2019s money. Sean grabbed his wrist and counted out half, then gave it to Bob. \u201cStay here and idling for a few minutes. Once we know it\u2019s safe, one of us will give you the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew! You got it.\u201d Bob grinned. \u201cThat was a rush!\u201d</p><p>Sean just hoped the station would talk to Callie, and he wouldn\u2019t be here for the cabbie\u2019s adrenaline crash. He opened the door and leapt out, reaching for Callie. She piled out, and Thorpe followed. All together, they ran for the doors. A security guard stopped them immediately inside the cool white linoleum lobby.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d the cop-in-a-box asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to see whoever is in charge of the news,\u201d Callie said with her sweetest smile.</p> <p>The thirtysomething guy looked at her like he\u2019d rather ask her out than turn her down, but he still shook his head. \u201cThe news director is a busy man. You\u2019ll have to make an appointment and come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will give him the biggest news story of his career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s heard that before and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut him on the phone with me,\u201d Callie pleaded earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ll convince him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got strict orders not to disturb him.\u201d</p><p>Sean had reached his limit and fished out his badge. \u201cFBI. He\u2019ll see us.\u201d</p><p>The security guard stepped back, looking from him, then to Callie, before scoping out Thorpe. Finally, his gaze settled on the glinting shield in Sean\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d the guard said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for your cooperation.\u201d Sean wondered if the man heard the irony in his tone.</p><p>Less than a minute later, the news director appeared. A portly man with a shock of gray hair, he had a weathered look that said he\u2019d not only seen decades\u2019 worth of news, but lived it.</p><p>\u201cRoger Coachman.\u201d The man thrust out his hand at Sean. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you can do for her.\u201d He gestured to Callie.</p><p>The news director turned his attention to her with a practiced smile, looking a bit impatient.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re busy, so I\u2019ll get to the point. Is there somewhere we can talk privately? I think I have a story that will interest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We can talk in my office.\u201d</p><p>As Coachman led them toward the secure area of the building, Sean turned back to the security guard. \u201cYou never saw us.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded, his expression a bit like a child denied a treat. Clearly, he was curious about Callie and her story. He\u2019d find out soon enough if this went well.</p><p>The man escorted them down some halls. People in suits bustled about. An older blonde wearing a headset paced, brushed past them like she was on a mission. In the distance, a phone pealed with a loud ring.</p><p>As soon as the news director led them into his office, Callie sat in one of the chairs opposite his desk. Sean sat beside her, while Thorpe closed the door and lounged against the wall behind them.</p><p>\u201cSo, young lady, you have a story? I can\u2019t promise that I\u2019ll put it on the news, but I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>Only because Sean had flashed a badge, and that annoyed him. He understood the guy probably saw crackpots, but . . .</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll put me on in the next five minutes, or I\u2019ll be forced to take the story elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Coachman laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. We\u2019re on network feed from New York for another few hours. We only get short breaks for local traffic and weather every so often.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head. \u201cCall the network. They\u2019ll want this story, too. Everyone will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your dog talk or something?\u201d he asked, his tone a bit patronizing. \u201cDid the mold in your bathroom tub grow into the shape of the Virgin Mary, Miss . . .\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cIf you\u2019re not even going to listen to me or try to take me seriously, I won\u2019t bother you anymore. Remember that I tried to give you a story that will put you on the map internationally as a hard-hitting journalist.\u201d</p><p>As Callie started for the door, Sean grabbed her wrist, wondering again if she was out of her mind. The street was too dangerous until this story broke.</p><p>She whirled on him and flashed him a sharp stare, but he couldn\u2019t mistake the calculating gleam in her eye. Thorpe grinned.</p><p>\u201cNo. Please sit,\u201d Coachman invited. \u201cSorry, but you have to understand how often I hear that someone has an important story, and it\u2019s usually nothing newsworthy.\u201d</p><p>Callie played reluctant before she settled back into her seat. \u201cThis should be a top headline across the country, maybe even the world. Promise me you\u2019ll call the network if I\u2019ve sufficiently piqued your interest and get us on ASAP.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his big, soft shoulders, rustling his navy coat. \u201cSure. If they\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>She simply smiled. \u201cThank you. They will. Now let\u2019s get down to business, Mr. Coachman. I\u2019m Callindra Howe and I can prove it. I can also prove that I didn\u2019t kill my father.\u201d</p><p>The news director\u2019s bushy gray brows rose and he leaned forward, elbow braced against his desk. His jaw looked like it might hit there as well. \u201cYou . . . You\u2019re . . . Wow. Okay, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Quite intently, too. Sean watched the man\u2019s reaction with satisfaction.</p><p>Flashing the older man a winning smile, Callie dug into her backpack and pulled out her mother\u2019s Faberg\u00e9 egg.</p><p>LESS than ten minutes later, Callie shooed away the hair and makeup artist hovering around her. Predictably, the network had gobbled up her story. Coachman stared at her like she was a cross between a ghost and a mega celebrity. The local morning news anchor trembled and fumbled with his papers. His slightly terrified expression hinted that he might pee his pants.</p><p>She shared his nerves. The next ten minutes would determine if she could be herself again and finally start living. If everything went well during this interview, she\u2019d get to share her tomorrows with a wonderful man she loved. As they did a last-minute camera check, Callie smiled at Sean. He gave her an encouraging nod. Thorpe stood beside Sean, looking both stony and proud.</p><p>Damn it all, she was going to miss him.</p><p>\u201cMs. Howe, can I get you anything?\u201d Coachman\u2019s assistant asked, staring. \u201cCoffee? Tea? Water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been on the run for almost ten years,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cWhat was that like?\u201d</p><p>Terrible. Scary. Frustrating. But in an odd way, a blessing. She would never have grown this much spine or met these two wonderful men otherwise. \u201cAs soon as we go on air, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>The station returned from commercial, and the network anchor in New York had been patched through, just waiting for them to go live with the breaking story. Callie drew in a deep breath as they finished the last of the audio checks. Finally, the director cued them on air.</p><p>And the questions began from the national anchor. She recounted being shot at, then betrayed by Holden, skipping towns, finding a safe haven in Dallas with Thorpe, then running from Agent Mackenzie, only for the two of them to find her again and help her discover the evidence she needed to go public.</p><p>\u201cI owe them my life,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI share a very special bond with them both.\u201d</p><p>Let everyone read between the lines. They\u2019d dig and find out that she\u2019d lived in a fet club and fallen for its Dungeon Master. They\u2019d probably even uncover that she wore Sean\u2019s collar. Hell, she was wearing it now. Fingering it with a faint smile, she didn\u2019t care what anyone else thought. They\u2019d judge, regardless of what she said or did. But she knew what was in her heart. The most important thing was exposing what the monsters had done to her family and clearing her name from anything criminal. Last time she checked, being in love with two men wasn\u2019t a crime.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be standing here without the two of them,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cI\u2019ll always be grateful.\u201d</p><p>Finally, they cut away. The news director was jumping up and down that every network in the country had just picked up the interview, along with a few overseas. The morning anchor sat, blinking in astonishment at her story. Now that she\u2019d recounted everything, Callie couldn\u2019t believe that she had actually lived through it all.</p><p>It was over. The secret James Whitney and his mercenary brethren had fought to keep was out, along with the news that her father had burned all the research the criminals had sought. Hopefully, when the media circus died down, she could finally be herself and live.</p><p>Coachman approached her, still practically dancing a jig. \u201cThe network wants to fly you out to New York to continue the interview there with Matt Lauer tomorrow and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thorpe cut the news director off with an intimidating stare. Coachman stepped back.</p><p>After working his way directly in front of her, Thorpe cupped her cheek, those gray eyes of his focused on her with such approval.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a remarkably strong woman. You handled that perfectly. I\u2019m so proud of you, pet.\u201d</p><p>His words warmed her. But his voice rang suspiciously with farewell.</p><p>\u201cMitchell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sean appeared beside her next, then drew her tight against his chest. \u201cYou answered every question with such grace and poise, lovely. Brilliant plan. You\u2019re safe to be Callindra Howe again.\u201d Then he whispered in her ear. \u201cBut you\u2019ll always be my Callie.\u201d</p><p>When she looked up to smile at him, she noticed that Thorpe no longer occupied the room. She searched every corner with her frantic gaze. He was gone.</p><p>Before she could do more than open her mouth in disbelief and feel the tears prick her eyes, Coachman cut in again. \u201cMs. Howe, New York? The network needs to make arrangements. What time would you like to fly out today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sir,\u201d Coachman\u2019s assistant popped her head into the studio, looking somewhere between apologetic and worried. \u201cThe FBI is here to take Ms. Howe in for questioning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>THORPE stared out the window overlooking Dominion\u2019s dungeon at the Friday night crowd diving into their play with gusto. With a critical eye, he surveyed the stations, the dungeon monitors making the rounds, the mood on the floor.</p><p>Satisfied everything was well under control, he locked up his observation room and headed downstairs into the secure area of the building. With a silent sigh, he returned to his apartment in the back and flipped on the TV, grabbing a fresh bottle of water. He should probably remove his suit, take a shower, and try to get some sleep.</p><p>Every time he closed his eyes, all he saw was Callie\u2019s face, her sparkling eyes, her lush mouth. Her \u201cI love yous\u201d echoed in his head.</p><p>Exhaustion weighed on him. He\u2019d tried to resume a normal life since returning to Dominion. But the lump in his throat when he thought of her never quite went away. His eyes constantly stung. For the last three weeks, he\u2019d been wracked with a vague but constant pain that debilitated his whole body.</p><p>Not surprising when he felt as if half of himself was missing.</p><p>Thorpe took a sip of water and tried to force the liquid down to drown the ache. That didn\u2019t work. That persistent tightness in his chest constricted even more. Why the fuck couldn\u2019t he take a deep breath?</p><p>Easing down into an overstuffed chair, he cued up his DVR. A mountain of news programs took up all the space on the device. He chose the most recent show, one he\u2019d taped yesterday. The one that torqued his pain the most. Thorpe had never considered himself a masochist, but apparently he\u2019d been wrong. He\u2019d already watched this show half a dozen times.</p><p>The host introduced himself and vomited at the mouth about a bunch of political shit Thorpe couldn\u2019t care less about. He had several windbag guests he called pundits, each less significant than the last. They shouted at one another, full of self-importance. Thorpe stifled his impatience as he fast-forwarded past it all and finally arrived at the segment he sought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy next guest is all over the news. Her story of survival and vindication is the talk of the networks, water coolers, and Twitterverse. She\u2019s gracing the cover of next week\u2019s People with her incredible tale. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s just the beginning for the beautiful Callindra Howe. Welcome.\u201d</p><p>The camera panned over to her. Thorpe hadn\u2019t thought it possible, but she looked even more beautiful than he remembered. Her eyes were magnetically blue. Her hair hung in touchable, inky waves. Her red lips curled up in a gracious smile. She almost looked happy. Someone who didn\u2019t know her would believe that she was. But Thorpe understood her too well not to see the sadness that haunted her eyes.</p><p>Fuck, his chest tightened again. He drank more water, but the feeling just wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cThank you for having me on the show.\u201d Callie\u2019s smile widened as she poised herself for the first question.</p> <p>\u201cThe last few weeks have been insane for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind, but I\u2019m satisfied now that most of the saga is finally over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d The geezer, who was a reputed letch, patted her hand, and Thorpe wanted to reach through the TV and rip his nuts off. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d</p><p>Footage rolled, showing a montage of the events\u2014the murders, her years on the run. Next, the voiceover mentioned her time at Dominion. This was exactly why every time Thorpe left the building, he had to wade through a small sea of reporters. He\u2019d called the police more than once to get them off his property because they were blocking members from entering the club\u2019s door. Idiots.</p><p>Then the clip went on to discuss him and Sean, crediting them with saving her from \u201cdangerous mercenaries\u201d the FBI was still trying to identify. Finally, they played a snippet of her first interview in Las Vegas. Callie looked tired and pale, but somehow glorious. No, complete. She didn\u2019t look like that now.</p> <p>That had to be an illusion. Or wishful thinking on his part. She still wore Sean\u2019s collar because she loved him. The fed would always give her everything she needed and more.</p><p>In time, Thorpe knew he\u2019d be an afterthought. If he wasn\u2019t already.</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s an amazing decade,\u201d the host said. \u201cYou\u2019ve survived a great deal. The FBI is still seeking the people who wanted you dead. Any update?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re hard at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to have so many people believe for years that you killed your family?\u201d</p><p>Callie seemed to collect her words. \u201cCrushing. I loved my family. I was prepared to leave them at sixteen, but I never anticipated not seeing them again. To have them gone so suddenly and violently, then hear that the police\u2014along with public opinion\u2014considered me a suspect was devastating. I had a lot of years when it felt like me against the world, but I\u2019m happy that chapter of my life is over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019ve been completely exonerated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard there\u2019s a book deal in the works. And a TV movie. What can you tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is final yet. We\u2019ll see if it works out. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been busy cleaning out my childhood home, deciding if I want to sell it. I\u2019m also getting my affairs in order and moving on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rumored you\u2019re giving several million dollars of the fortune you\u2019ve inherited to charity,\u201d the host said.</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve actually started the Cecilia Howe Foundation for Cancer Research. All tests and experiments will be conducted according to the highest standards. No genetic trials will ever be performed. The foundation will be dedicated to curing cancer that affects women, especially ovarian cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich your mother died of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re also continuing your father\u2019s scholarship and changing its name to the Daniel A. Howe Fund?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThe brightest young minds in American business should have the means to attend college. It\u2019s something my father was passionate about. I will always mourn his loss, and that of my sister, but I feel this is a good way to honor him and continue his legacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve also donated your mother\u2019s Imperial Faberg\u00e9 egg to the Smithsonian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fitting. She loved to look at it. I know she\u2019d be proud to have it seen by millions of enthralled people every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor has you romantically linked with Agent Mackenzie. Any comment?\u201d</p><p>She blushed, unconsciously fingering the pretty bit of bling around her neck. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful man, and I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us shortly, and we\u2019ll get his side of the story. But Mitchell Thorpe is an enigma. He\u2019s declined all interviews and seemingly isn\u2019t interested in the spotlight.\u201d</p><p>The fondness shining in her eyes was apparent. That all-over mystery pain punched him again. \u201cHe\u2019s a very private man with a very big heart.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s pectorals felt so damn taut. His heart stuttered. He struggled to breathe . . . but he feared how much it would hurt if he did.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to him since you left Las Vegas?\u201d the host asked.</p><p>Her smile faltered. \u201cNo, but he knows how grateful I am to him for all the years of protection and care he gave me. I love him and I always will.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the arm of his chair until his knuckles turned white. His chest seized up, constricting again. Thorpe wondered if he was having a heart attack.</p><p>Motherfucking son of a bitch.</p><p>He stopped playing the show, shut off the TV, and tossed the remote onto the nearby table. He glanced longingly at a bottle of scotch in the corner, then looked away. He\u2019d gotten completely shitfaced his first night back at Dominion. Everything he\u2019d been avoiding before the first sip was still there the following morning, along with a devil of a hangover.</p><p>He\u2019d walked away from Callie and he knew the reasons why. But damn it, when she said she loved him for all the world to hear . . . How much more proof did he need that she wasn\u2019t like Nara? Or Melissa? And his father had been so fucking wrong. Perverts were capable of more than sex. He knew it now because he loved Callie more than life. How could he be worthy of her if he didn\u2019t try? He\u2019d left her to avoid the pain of losing her, but it already hurt so bad he could barely breathe without aching.</p><p>Thorpe dragged in a lungful of air, and yes, there it was. The agony he\u2019d been dodging, crushing him down like the weight of a steamroller. Every joint ached worse. Every muscle twinged in pain. He felt at least a hundred fucking years old. And hollow on the inside. He missed her so much.</p><p>Gulping water now, trying to wash away the thoughts, he wondered if he\u2019d ever feel like smiling again. Or even like simply breathing. He didn\u2019t expect love or happiness. He\u2019d given any hope of that away.</p><p>Fuck, that scotch really looked good.</p><p>A sharp rap sounded on the door, and he clambered to his feet. \u201cWho the hell is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxel.\u201d</p><p>Which meant there was a problem on the floor. He cursed. But wouldn\u2019t solving someone else\u2019s problem take his mind off his own? He\u2019d operated that way for twenty years. And maybe, if he was really lucky, he\u2019d get to help Axel crack some skulls.</p><p>Aggression sounded nice about now.</p><p>Thorpe yanked the door open. Axel plowed in\u2014along with a host of other familiar faces. Logan and Hunter Edgington, Xander and Javier Santiago, Tyler Murphy, Deke Trenton, and his business partner, the infamous Jack Cole.</p><p>He knew exactly why they\u2019d come. And it pissed him off.</p><p>\u201cIs there some all-male gangbang I haven\u2019t heard about? You boys will have to play without me. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked insulted. \u201cWe are not here to fuck your ass, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust your mind,\u201d Jack quipped.</p><p>Self-controlled son of a bitch. Jack was happily married with a young son. What did he understand about this situation? Any of them, really? They were all settled. Well, except Axel, and that guy had layers of shit, so his head of security better not be up in his grill.</p><p>\u201cStill not interested.\u201d Thorpe opened the door wider and gestured them all back into the hall.</p><p>Tyler scoffed. \u201cNice try. Avoidance didn\u2019t help me when I wanted to worm out of the intervention the wives all sprung on me before Delaney. Damn if they weren\u2019t right, too. So I think you should shut the fuck up and listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Deke piped in. \u201cMy cousin Luc had to give me some tough love before I was smart enough to get over myself and marry Kimber. It\u2019s a valuable mental ass kicking every guy should have. Good times . . .\u201d He looked down the hall and frowned. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>Deke stepped aside for Luc Traverson to enter, who held a plate that on any other day would look and smell divine. Since returning to Dominion, everything had tasted like dog shit.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Thorpe said politely.</p><p>As if he hadn\u2019t spoken, Luc shoved the plate in his hands and shut the door to Thorpe\u2019s living quarters behind him. \u201cI hunted down what passes for a kitchen here and reheated a veritable masterpiece just for you. Axel said you haven\u2019t eaten a whole meal since you returned.\u201d</p><p>The platter under his nose held some sort of veal dish with a red wine sauce, roasted sweet potatoes, and glazed carrots. In a restaurant, this dish would be at least fifty bucks, probably more because Traverson made it.</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s stomach revolted. \u201cI\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when people lie.\u201d Hunter stepped up and took the plate, carrying it to Thorpe\u2019s little bistro table in the corner. \u201cSit down and eat.\u201d</p><p>The older Edgington brother may have been a SEAL, but Thorpe didn\u2019t need for anyone to Dom the Dom. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve spoken. You don\u2019t come into my house and tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Logan gave him a shove toward his brother and the plate. \u201cWe will for your own good because we\u2019ve all been there. Don\u2019t be a pussy. You said a lot of things I needed to hear before I won Tara back. Now you\u2019re going to listen.\u201d</p><p>Xander stood beside him with his arms crossed over his chest, his charcoal suit perfectly pressed. Javier had chosen something navy, but the pose was a dead ringer for his younger brother\u2019s. They both looked gravely serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to echo Logan,\u201d Xander said. \u201cMan up. Listening won\u2019t hurt. Much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need advice. Thank you for the effort.\u201d Thorpe gritted his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can dish out the good advice but you can\u2019t take it?\u201d Javier challenged with a look that tried to shame him.</p><p>Thorpe snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need advice about anything. I\u2019m goddamn fine! I\u2019m better than fucking fine. Never been happier. Leave me the hell alone!\u201d</p><p>The moment he lost control, he wanted to kick his own ass. He had to get his shit under wraps or he\u2019d give in to that nagging urge he\u2019d been fighting to call Sean and ask if there was any way he could take back every fucking word of good-bye and join them. Callie deserved better than him.</p><p>Thorpe drew in a shuddering breath, forcing a lid back onto his temper.</p><p>Tyler shoved him in the chair. \u201cWhat a bunch of BS. Fucking eat something.\u201d</p><p>Hunter held him down and shoved a fork in his hand. \u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t like liars. You\u2019re in love with Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is Sean Mackenzie\u2019s collared submissive.\u201d Thorpe pressed his lips tightly together. And he was just waiting for the day he heard about their engagement. It was coming, he knew.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to bullshit me that you\u2019re not in love with her?\u201d Logan scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply stating that she no longer lives here and is no longer available.\u201d He didn\u2019t admit that it was killing him. They didn\u2019t need more ammunition when they were already so close to the bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that fa\u00e7ade like everything is fine except for the stick up your ass and the ax in your heart,\u201d Axel complained. \u201cYou\u2019re so heavy these days, you\u2019re like a black hole, sucking the life out of yourself and everyone around you. I\u2019ve seen you turn down no less than a dozen subs you\u2019ve played with in the past. If you\u2019re not going to do something about the fact that you love Callie, at least get laid. Dena has been asking about you. I can call her to come release some of the pressure in your valve, man.\u201d</p><p>The thought of touching any of the women who had come to him and knelt and offered themselves . . . Thorpe hadn\u2019t thought it was possible, but the food smelled even worse. His stomach turned over. He pushed the plate away and stood.</p><p>\u201cCallie loves you,\u201d Luc said. \u201cShe\u2019s stated that on TV repeatedly. If there\u2019s anyone who knows what it\u2019s like to be in denial about his feelings, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m lucky Alyssa wanted me enough to put up with my shit. You want to look up tomorrow and find that Callie has moved on?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She already had. How did these stupid fuckers not see it? \u201cIf you look in her room, you\u2019ll find she\u2019s not there. You will find her with Sean Mackenzie, where I\u2019m sure he\u2019s making her very happy, which is what she deserves, so get off my fucking back!\u201d</p><p>Thorpe winced. There he went, losing control again. Son of a bitch, he needed to get himself wired up tight enough to get them out of here. Then maybe he could gather the pieces of himself and move on. He held in a snort. Like that\u2019s going to happen.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d Jack began, pacing up to him with a swagger that put Thorpe on edge. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t love this girl. Make me believe it, and we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Four words. All he had to do was say \u201cI don\u2019t love her,\u201d and this goddamn torture would be over. It should be simple. Open his mouth, let shit come out, end the pain.</p> <p>Thorpe quickly realized that if he couldn\u2019t admit out loud that he loved Callie, he also couldn\u2019t say that he didn\u2019t love her. It was a betrayal of everything he felt, and he refused to do it.</p><p>Logan was right. When had he become a pussy? These men told their wives that they loved them every single day. They were still standing and whole. Blissfully fucking happy even. If all he had to do to hold Callie again was tell her that he loved her, would that really be so hard? If love bettered a man, why couldn\u2019t it heal him enough to make him good for her?</p><p>He sat again and hung his head, feeling a shudder work up in his chest, the lump tighten in his throat. But now was the lightest it had felt since leaving Vegas . . . and Callie. \u201cI love her and I sent her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d Deke asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for her. I\u2019m too rough for her. I\u2019m too . . .\u201d Bottled up for her.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t see it that way, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that isn\u2019t what Deke asked,\u201d Hunter reminded. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He scrubbed a hand through his hair. It was too long, but he just hadn\u2019t found the energy to have it cut. Or to give a shit about it. \u201cI regretted it instantly.\u201d</p><p>The door to his apartment opened again. \u201cThat\u2019s all you had to say.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe whipped his head around at that familiar voice. Sean Mackenzie stood in the entry, then closed the door behind him with a soft snick.</p><p>Staggering to his feet, Thorpe approached the man on autopilot. His relief in seeing Sean was so strong, it felt physical. Suddenly, he didn\u2019t have an elephant sitting on his chest.</p> <p>Instead, he had something far more dangerous: hope.</p><p>It occurred to him that when he\u2019d said good-bye to Callie, he hadn\u2019t just lost the woman he loved, he\u2019d also lost a partner . . . a friend. He\u2019d come to like Sean. Rely on him.</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, of course.\u201d He looked around the room at the other men. \u201cCan you give us a minute, guys?\u201d</p><p>Most nodded. Deke looked disappointed.</p><p>Tyler sighed noisily. \u201cI thought I was going to get to kick some ass.\u201d</p><p>But he grinned under that put-out expression.</p><p>Luc slapped him on the back. \u201cYou really are an asshole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that supposed to be news?\u201d Tyler snapped back.</p><p>Collective male laughter filled the air as most of the guys filed out.</p><p>Logan hung back. \u201cListen, I owed you for helping me straighten my shit out. This was my way of repaying you. Someday, you\u2019ll thank me, and we\u2019ll be even. Now work it out with Sean, tell Callie how you feel, and fucking be happy. I want an invitation to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>With a wink, Logan shut the door.</p><p>The silence suffocated Thorpe. His palms began to sweat. A million words crowded his brain. He didn\u2019t know which one of them to speak first.</p><p>Swallowing, he sat at the bistro table, picking at Luc\u2019s plate and took a bite. He hoped that looking busy would cut through the awkwardness, but no. He still wasn\u2019t sure what to say. And damn, that veal was really good.</p><p>\u201cHow are you not horrifically pissed off at me?\u201d Thorpe blurted.</p><p>Sean tried not to laugh, but it still slipped out. \u201cWho\u2019s to say I\u2019m not?\u201d Then he sobered. \u201cBut Callie told me about your past. I can\u2019t imagine how devastating that was. A betrayal at every level. But you know it was a long time ago, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed quickly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know Callie is nothing like the woman who took advantage of you as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s me. I just closed myself off and refused to care about anyone much. I\u2019ve been a miserable son of a bitch.\u201d Thorpe drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know how much until her. In over twenty years, I\u2019ve never told a single person that I love them.\u201d</p><p>It had always terrified him, the fear of having his heart crushed again. Callie wouldn\u2019t hurt him on purpose; he knew that in his head. But he truly loved her in a way the boy he\u2019d once been, blind with adolescent lust, couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend. In a way his own father had never been capable of. This was so much deeper. As vital as breathing.</p><p>It gave her so much power to hurt him.</p><p>So now he\u2019d come to a fork in the road. He knew that safety came with loneliness, sharper now because he knew exactly how precious the woman he\u2019d lost was to him. Callie had awakened something that just wouldn\u2019t rest again: his heart. But loving without risk was impossible.</p><p>He had to make a choice.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you that life will always be simple,\u201d Sean said. \u201cWe\u2019re three very different people trying to make something unconventional last. But I think we\u2019ve got a few things in our favor. Our differences are our strengths. If you and I were the same, she wouldn\u2019t need us both. Would it be easier on my ego if she didn\u2019t love you? Yeah. I\u2019m sure you feel the same.\u201d</p><p>Sean was absolutely right. But this had stopped being about Thorpe\u2019s ego and started being about his heart. And about Callie\u2019s. Clearly, Sean felt the same or he wouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Thorpe said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already been through some really hard times. As long as we stood together, it made us stronger. No reason to think we couldn\u2019t grow with time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I know how to love.\u201d That realization made Thorpe feel inadequate\u2014something both deeply unfamiliar and uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an expert, either.\u201d Sean shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never really tried until Callie. But I think you\u2019ve been loving her for the last four years. Maybe it doesn\u2019t look like a relationship in a movie, but I don\u2019t think it has to. It just has to be honest and make us all happy.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe grunted, but he couldn\u2019t look Sean in the eye. \u201cYou make love sound easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re overcomplicating it. Put her first. Be honest. Don\u2019t let fear stop you from getting what you want.\u201d</p><p>Sean was right. So simply right that he just stared. He\u2019d been letting fear stop him for far too long.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve another chance, but I want one,\u201d Thorpe murmured, then finally met the other man\u2019s gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell her that you love her? Look her right in the eye and swear she\u2019s the most important woman in the world to you?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe closed his eyes and focused on every emotion he\u2019d been trying to dam behind a wall of numbness. He pictured releasing it and just feeling whatever came. And it did. God, it was a massive flood of biblical proportions\u2014a wave bittersweet, poignant, and painful. It robbed his breath. He gasped. Then relief came.</p><p>And he was finally able to take a deep breath without agony for the first time in weeks.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to be the pussy Logan accused him of being any longer. And he refused to allow Nara\u2019s indifference or his father\u2019s contempt to break him. He was going to embrace life and love. He was going to settle down, grow old with Callie, be a good friend and partner to Sean, and enjoy every moment they had together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could stop myself,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Sean smiled. \u201cGood. The rest is up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sucked in a breath. \u201cThank you. You\u2019ve always been the bigger man when it came to Callie. If she\u2019ll have me, I\u2019ll at least meet you halfway from now on. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>Sean held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to it.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shook it, then brought the man in for a brotherly hug. He still had so many thoughts pouring through his head that he couldn\u2019t process them all, but as Sean slapped his back, he felt certain this was right.</p><p>Finally, they backed away, and Thorpe had to work to keep it together. Another stiff breath, a long pause, then he was finally able to carry on. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me catch you up on a few things. We\u2019ve intentionally kept Callie in the spotlight so the mercenaries who tried to kill her will shy away from finishing the job. We can\u2019t say it on the air, and it\u2019s classified so don\u2019t make me shoot you, but the FBI is running down the identities of those assholes. James Whitney is part of a homegrown separatist group, run by ex-military malcontents, calling themselves LOSS, or the League of Secessionist Soldiers. We\u2019re trying to figure out who\u2019s funding them. The NSA is getting involved. It seems they\u2019ve been working this case from another angle. But Whitney and some of his counterparts have slipped into Mexico. They\u2019ll be caught; it\u2019s just a matter of time. The most important thing now is that Callie no longer appears to be a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news. I think we\u2019d be wise to remain cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sean confirmed. \u201cThe bureau has kept me on the case, so I\u2019m up on the latest. I also have some answers to the questions I didn\u2019t have when they first sent me to watch over her. According to my boss, the bureau knew about Aslanov\u2019s genetic research and knew the later findings had disappeared. Eventually, they figured out that Daniel Howe probably had them, but before they could reach him, LOSS did. Though the Chicago PD botched things by labeling her a suspect early on, everyone in the loop here hoped Callie had important information, even if it was something she knew unconsciously. These genetic experiments are still going on, and Uncle Sam isn\u2019t excited about the idea of an army of superior soldiers under the control of people who want to overthrow our government. Hence, all the secrecy. Since Callie had proven ridiculously slippery over the years to bring in, they sent me to her, hoping I could find out what she knew before she ran again. Of course, the bureau wishes Callie would have kept some of the details in her father\u2019s notes to herself, and if my boss had given me more information about my mission, I might have been able to facilitate that, but mission accomplished. Everyone is happy.\u201d</p><p>Well, almost. Thorpe nodded. \u201cAll the douche bags who\u2019ve chased her over the years, who sent them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bureau is disavowing knowledge of any bounty hunters, but personally I think they\u2019re full of shit. It might have been the NSA or some other player of Uncle Sam\u2019s who hasn\u2019t shown his cards yet. Who knows? Either way, now that the secret about the research and Daniel Howe\u2019s murder is out, Callie knows nothing else of value to make anyone want to kill her. I\u2019m guessing the assassins were sent by LOSS. We\u2019re still running that down.\u201d Sean shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s not much else on that front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we should talk about Callie. I\u2019m making a huge assumption that she\u2019ll actually have me back.\u201d Thorpe held his breath.</p><p>If she wouldn\u2019t, he had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for her, but I can say that she hasn\u2019t been the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring her last interview, she looked . . . I don\u2019t know, sad. Not quite complete.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cShe was determined not to bother you if you didn\u2019t want her, no matter how much it was hurting her.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe grunted his disbelief. \u201cI wish she had \u2018bothered\u2019 me. This is probably the only time I\u2019ll ever be tempted to turn her over my knee for following my directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d like that.\u201d Sean grinned.</p><p>\u201cI would, too.\u201d After he kissed her, held her tight, told her that he loved her and would never let her go. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fling for me. It\u2019s the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt better be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you know I\u2019m getting old. Callie is still so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you Old Yeller now? You think I should take you out back and shoot you? Stop. It\u2019s going to work out if you let it. Don\u2019t think about anything except that we love her and she loves us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn smart, Mackenzie.\u201d Thorpe shook his head wryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you of that next time you think about calling me a dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Despite the moment being cloaked with laughter, Thorpe knew that he and Sean had forged a friendship with respect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Thorpe asked. \u201cI want to see her.\u201d Desperately. Right now.</p><p>\u201cAt home. I didn\u2019t want to bring her here or get her hopes up unless I knew that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d pulled my head out of my ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Sean admitted. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve rented a quiet little house near Highland Park. She\u2019s there now, probably in bed reading. She likes that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe always has.\u201d Thorpe smiled fondly. Then worry set in. \u201cWhere does she think you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork. I rushed out the door after I got a few calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Axel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first one came from Logan to ask if I\u2019d come. Axel rang next with details. Luc called to ask what you like to eat. Jack called to ask me a series of questions that told me he\u2019s a scary-smart bastard. You have some interesting friends.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe smiled. He did. He\u2019d have to thank them, too. Eating crow would suck, but they\u2019d been right.</p> <p>Now that he was determined to be with Callie, a vital question stomped across his brain. \u201cI have to know, have you already put a ring on her finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s been a whirlwind for weeks, running from one interview to the next, dealing with her estate, moving into a new place. We\u2019re finally home for a few days, so . . .\u201d Sean shrugged.</p><p>Which meant that Sean intended to propose.</p><p>\u201cWhat if . . . I married her?\u201d When Sean opened his mouth, Thorpe\u2019s stomach tightened. \u201cJust hear me out.\u201d He paced for a silent moment, then turned back. \u201cYou\u2019ve already collared her. That\u2019s sacred. I would never try to impede on that bond. But since you\u2019ve got that claim on her, I have no other way to call her mine.\u201d</p><p>Sean said nothing for a very long minute. \u201cAre you thinking of not sharing in her submission?\u201d</p><p>The idea was like a stab in the gut. He would take Callie however he got her, but he was a Dominant through and through. Never having her kneel or call him her Sir, not really having the authority to punish or praise her except in the most vanilla ways . . . \u201cI want her submission more than anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I suspected. Have you ever thought about claiming her before?\u201d</p><p>Sean was so unflinchingly honest and unafraid. Thorpe knew he had to be the same. \u201cA little more than two years ago, before I knew who she really was, I was mad for her. Completely smitten. I bought this.\u201d</p><p>He turned away to his bedroom, gesturing for Sean to follow. Inside his closet, he shoved clothes aside to reveal a safe. A few turns of the dial and he was holding a black velvet box. He handed it to Sean. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>The lid opened in soft silence. Sean\u2019s eyes fell to the contents and widened. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. It suits her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I bought it. I have a jeweler friend, and when I told her I\u2019d been looking for the right something for Callie, she showed this to me. I couldn\u2019t not buy it.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI realized Callie\u2019s identity two weeks later and tried to tell myself it was for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you return it?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe had asked himself that question a million times. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to. In my head, it was made for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to have cost you a fortune.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cIt did. And at the time, I just didn\u2019t care. She was worth every penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand completely. If you want to see Callie now, bring that with you and be prepared to use it. I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d</p><p>CALLIE looked at the clock again. After eleven. She frowned. If Sean wasn\u2019t assigned to another case, whatever happened tonight had to be about hers. Gawd, she hoped that Whitney and his cronies hadn\u2019t cut short their Mexican vacation to come back and finish murdering her for the hell of it.</p><p>Not that Sean had left her unprotected. She more than suspected that he\u2019d hired bodyguards to watch the house day and night. Maybe it should bother the independent woman in her, but he cared about her safety. So even though she\u2019d learned to take care of herself, his precautions made her a little warm and fuzzy.</p><p>She focused on her e-reader again, doing her best to lose herself in a cozy mystery. It was either that or wish Sean was home. And miss Thorpe some more.</p><p>Sighing, Callie looked out the massive French doors in the master bedroom, over the expansive backyard. Dominion was out there, only twelve point two miles away\u2014she\u2019d mapped it out\u2014but the distance might as well be a whole universe. Thorpe was gone. He wasn\u2019t over his past and he wasn\u2019t coming back. Callie wanted to be angry, but she was mostly sad as hell.</p><p>Her saving grace had been Sean. His love, his reassurance, his laughter were all balms to her pain. Despite their travel and hectic schedule lately, he never missed an opportunity to make love to her. His touch\u2014frequent and adoring\u2014always made her feel like the center of the universe. Sometimes, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he was trying to fill the gap left by Thorpe\u2019s absence. How did she tell him that he already filled half of her so perfectly that just being next to him sometimes made her cry because she was so blessed? She didn\u2019t expect him to fill the other half of her left bleeding and empty when Thorpe had gone. Her former boss and protector couldn\u2019t fill Sean\u2019s half, either. Neither was a substitute for the other.</p><p>She simply loved them both.</p><p>Pointless thoughts. Callie tossed the e-reader down and rose, her short black nightie swishing around her thighs.</p><p>Across the house, she heard the sound of the garage door opening, the chime of the alarm, the door shutting, the rattle of keys, the sounds of footsteps. She smiled.</p><p>Sean appeared a few seconds later, his face unreadable. He crossed the floor directly to her, took her face in his hands, and pressed a rapt kiss on her mouth. With a moan, she melted into him. Now he would take her in his arms and strip off the scrap of silk covering her. He would show her his devotion and she would give it back, opening her heart even wider to him.</p><p>Instead, he stepped away. \u201cKneel for me, lovely.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was in that mood. They hadn\u2019t engaged in any BDSM play since the houseboat. Now that the possibility was in front of her, she realized how badly she\u2019d missed it. Itched for it. Needed to feel as if she could put herself in the hands of the man she loved, knowing he would push her to her limits, yet trusting him utterly not to break her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She fell to her knees at his feet, bowed her head, and waited breathlessly. Her body began to bloom with anticipation.</p><p>Without a word, he bent to her. She heard a little click, and the wire of white gold lifted from around her neck.</p><p>He had uncollared her?</p><p>Callie gasped and looked up at Sean with horror. \u201cW-what have I done? How have I not made you happy?\u201d</p><p>Sean crouched in front of her and smoothed a hand against her cheek. He held her heart in his hands. He was breaking her in two, and yet he looked so excited. If he left her . . . No! Her chest was already splitting open at the thought.</p><p>\u201cYou make me very happy. It\u2019s a different claim I want on you now.\u201d He pulled a little velvet box from his pants, and her crushing pain transformed into astonished joy. \u201cCallindra Alexis Howe, will you marry me? God knows I\u2019ve loved you from the beginning, and I can\u2019t imagine spending much longer without making you my wife. Please say yes.\u201d</p><p>As he stood and helped her to her feet, Callie teared up. She threw herself into his arms, gripping him so tightly, overwhelmed when he held her with the same intensity. Tears fell so swiftly as her heart overflowed. She pulled back and, through her watery gaze, stared into his eyes. She wanted him to know how much she meant this.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever understand how much, but I\u2019ll do my best to show you every day. Yes!\u201d</p><p>Sean pulled her in and gripped her close again, and she clung for dear life, celebrating what would be now that they\u2019d be husband and wife, what could be once they started a family. And mourning what could never be without Thorpe.</p><p>Callie dug her fingers into Sean. She had to stop that. Thorpe could not be the specter between them. He\u2019d made it clear that he didn\u2019t want her, and she had to exorcise him. She\u2019d ached for family, belonging, and happiness since her father and sister had been murdered. Eventually the people responsible would get their justice. But she wouldn\u2019t forfeit the love she shared with Sean now and forever to pine for a man who wouldn\u2019t share his heart.</p><p>Gently, Sean pulled back, peppering her face with soft, sweet kisses. Then he opened the box. Callie clapped a hand over her lips, overjoyed at the beauty of the ring\u2014and the moment.</p><p>A lovely round center stone winked up at her, surrounded by a circle of smaller diamonds. The band was covered in the same delicate stones. It wasn\u2019t extravagant. It wasn\u2019t anything like the giant rock her father had given her mother\u2014and she was glad. What Sean had given her was absolutely perfect and what she would have picked herself.</p><p>The poignant beauty of the event only felt more complete when he slipped the ring on her finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you happy,\u201d she whispered, smiling through her tears.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll do everything I can to make you happy, too, lovely.\u201d He stole another soft kiss. \u201cI always will.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. Her neck felt naked without his mark of possession there. That didn\u2019t make her happy at all. \u201cI could still wear your collar too, you know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not how I wanted to make you mine. I first put it on you under false pretenses. You first accepted it for the wrong reasons. This\u201d\u2014he thumbed her engagement ring\u2014\u201cis for us. For the right reasons. I\u2019m going to cherish you always. Besides, something else needs to go around your neck.\u201d</p><p>Sean caressed her cheek, then walked past her, settling himself in the big club chair in the corner. What the hell was he talking about?</p><p>\u201cPet?\u201d</p><p>The deep voice that haunted her now rang in her head. She had to be hallucinating. But when she zipped around, Callie knew she wasn\u2019t hearing things.</p><p>\u201cThorpe?\u201d He stood there, fatigued and distinctly nervous, but as commanding as ever with his feet spread, his hands behind his back. His gray eyes penetrated her, reaching all the way to her heart with one glance.</p><p>He raised a brow at her. \u201cThat address will do for now. Kneel for me.\u201d</p><p>She whipped her gaze over to Sean, who didn\u2019t say a word. He merely watched in silence.</p><p>\u201cYou brought him here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked. He asked to see you,\u201d her fianc\u00e9 said.</p><p>To apologize? To make some stupid amends? For sex? She turned back to Thorpe, blinking in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not kneeling yet, pet.\u201d He stared expectantly at the floor, then back to her. Everything about his demeanor said that he expected to be obeyed.</p><p>\u201cI think you should do as he asks, lovely.\u201d Sean wore a faint smile.</p><p>Their byplay reminded her of Las Vegas. They were on the same page of some agenda she didn\u2019t quite grasp. But she\u2019d loved the results then. Despite the danger surrounding her at the time, Callie had never been happier.</p><p>She sank to her knees, the plush carpet cushioning her. She risked a glance up at Thorpe\u2019s face. His expression softened.</p><p>He caressed the crown of her head, and the touch electrified her, radiating down her spine. She\u2019d never imagined that she would ever see him again, much less be this close. The tears of joy that had assailed her during Sean\u2019s proposal returned. Her fianc\u00e9 would never have brought Thorpe here if he intended to break her heart again.</p><p>Smiling, she bowed her head. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s closer to the form of address I\u2019d like to hear, Callie. But I want you to call me something far more important.\u201d He cradled her chin in his hand and lifted it to him. \u201cI want to be your Master. I desire you to be my one and only pet.\u201d</p><p>He brought his other hand in front of his body, gripping an oblong black box.</p><p>Callie blinked. His face was tempered with unmistakable affection and devotion. Her heart skittered, then began to pound.</p><p>Were all her dreams really coming true?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have questions for me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd you have every right to them. Let me see if I can answer them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She could barely choke the word out past the emotion constricting her throat.</p><p>\u201cI was an ass for leaving you. Stupid. Logan called me something less complimentary, and he was right. I\u2019ve never felt so complete as when I\u2019m with you. You fulfill all my Dominant needs when you submit . . . and you\u2019re just bratty enough to be a challenge. I can\u2019t live without you anymore. Please don\u2019t make me try. If you say yes, I will treat your submission with the utmost care. I will push your limits and keep you safe, while giving you the discipline you need and the affection you deserve. There will never be another for me, and I will never leave you again. I hope you\u2019ll consent to wear my collar and call me Master with pride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opened the box, and Callie was in for the second jolt of amazement for the night. Nestled in velvet lay a glittering collar. A thick length of platinum would encircle her neck, unbreakable, symbolizing their bond. The glimmering metal met in the front and would be held together by one petite lock on each side of a massive dangling center stone. The stunning aquamarine was encircled with petite diamonds and would rest right in the hollow of her throat.</p><p>Callie raised astonished eyes to him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. He bought it for you two years ago and has held on to it,\u201d Sean supplied.</p><p>\u201cIt was made for you, pet. I\u2019ve always wanted you to wear it for me. Will you have me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you really be here tomorrow?\u201d The question sounded as scared as she felt. Callie bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cEvery day for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe said everything right . . . except those three words that had been in their way. Still, were they important? She knew he loved her. Wasn\u2019t the commitment more important than the platitude? Yes, but she still yearned for him to hold her close, look into her eyes, and tell her what was in his heart.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you want to hear, pet?\u201d Thorpe prodded.</p><p>It was enough for now. But she\u2019d also just committed her life to Sean. He\u2019d brought Thorpe here, so she imagined her fianc\u00e9 approved, but . . . she looked his way in question.</p> <p>\u201cThorpe and I have talked, lovely. We\u2019re reconciled. We both felt this arrangement works best because I\u2019ve always wanted to marry you. I\u2019m more traditional.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMy ring on your finger means everything to me. The press already has us linked romantically. This will simply seem like the natural evolution of our relationship to the outside world. Because it is.\u201d</p><p>His ring on her finger meant the world to her, and she would be proud to be his wife.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve always wanted you to be my submissive,\u201d Thorpe said, his voice thick. \u201cI\u2019ve had a wife. The marriage didn\u2019t give me that deep bond of trust and understanding I\u2019ve been searching for my whole life. I entered into it for the wrong reasons. The union was easily broken, and I didn\u2019t mourn its loss. What we share feels nothing like that. The minute I left you, the pain nearly crushed me. I\u2019ve never collared a submissive of my own to\u201d\u2014he turned to Sean with a nod\u2014\u201c\u2018cherish\u2019 is the perfect word. Thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>Sean smiled faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be the first and the last, Callie, to enter with me into the bond I hold most sacred.\u201d Thorpe stood before her, looking vulnerable but proud. Body tall, shoulders imposing, eyes all but begging.</p><p>She melted inside. For four years, she\u2019d watched him with sub after sub, looking for something he\u2019d never found. The discontent she\u2019d always seen then was gone. Her fondest fantasy when she\u2019d lived at Dominion was to become his collared one and only. She\u2019d always suspected that if he let himself care and took one woman as his, he would do everything to make the bond as deep and real as a marriage.</p> <p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s not to say that he won\u2019t regard you like a husband,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cOr that Sean won\u2019t praise or punish you like your Dom when you need it.\u201d Thorpe gave her a firm nod.</p><p>She expected nothing less.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard what we want, but the choice is yours,\u201d Thorpe said softly.</p><p>The tears she\u2019d managed to hold at bay fell in hot rivulets down her face. She shuddered in a breath, then looked up at Thorpe with her heart in her eyes. \u201cI accept this collar as a symbol of your ownership. To you, I pledge my obedience and my love. I have every faith that you will give me both the affection and the discipline I need. In return, I offer to you the gift of myself and am proud to call you Master.\u201d</p><p>With a look of supreme pride and shaking hands, Thorpe fastened her new collar around her neck. Fleetingly, she noticed that it felt so right as he hauled her to her feet and brought her against him. \u201cThank fucking God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Sean said, rising from the chair in the corner.</p><p>As Thorpe layered his mouth over hers for a softly commanding kiss, Sean sidled in behind her and pressed his lips to her neck. \u201cNow get ready to hear the words I suspect you\u2019ll hear often, lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe cupped her face in his hands and fused their stares together, seeing right down into her soul. \u201cI love you, Callie. You will hear it often. I hope you can get used to it.\u201d</p><p>The joy exploded inside her, and she was left gloriously bleeding with emotion, speechless, and so ready for the future.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Mitchell.\u201d She turned in his arms to face Sean. \u201cAnd I love you, Sean. My world is forever changed to the most beautiful existence possible because of you.\u201d</p><p>Sean kissed her forehead, her nose, then lingered at her lips. \u201cI love you, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear it from me often as well. But that wasn\u2019t what I was referring to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She sent him a beguiling smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure not, pet.\u201d</p><p>Callie cast Thorpe a glance over her shoulder. It warmed her to know that her acceptance of their bond put that contented look on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo what else did you mean to say?\u201d She smiled coyly.</p><p>Thorpe drew in a deep breath. His shoulders rose, his chest widened. He wore his authority like a well-made suit as he gave her his first command as her Master. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>She flushed from head to toe. She\u2019d been expecting it, and it still made her tingle, made her body burn with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>Sean caressed her shoulder, and her gaze lifted to his face, the longing in his eyes. She answered back with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cNow, lovely, if you please.\u201d</p><p>A smile broke out across her face. Her world was perfect. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
