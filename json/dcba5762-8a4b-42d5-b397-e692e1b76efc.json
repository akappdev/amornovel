Even from here, the stench of soured ale accosted her, forcing bile into her throat. A burly man elbowed her aside as he went out the door. \u201cWatch yerself, luv.\u201d</p><p>She pasted herself against the doorjamb, wondering at the singular form of address implied in \u201cluv.\u201d The man\u2019s comment had clearly been directed toward both of her breasts.</p><p>With a shiver, she wrapped her cloak tight across her chest. Taking one last deep breath, she sidled her way into the dank, drunken confusion, forbidding her gray serge skirts to brush against anything. Much less anyone. From every murky corner\u2014and for a squared-off tea caddy of a building, this tavern abounded in murky corners\u2014eyes followed her. Suspicious, leering eyes, set in hard, unshaven faces. It was enough to make any young woman anxious. For a fugitive young lady of quality, traveling alone, under the flimsy shield of a borrowed cloak and a fabricated identity ...</p><p>Well, it was almost enough to make Sophia reconsider the whole affair. An unseen someone jostled her from behind. Her gloved fingers instinctively clutched the envelope secreted in her cloak. She thought of its brethren, the letters she\u2019d posted just that morning, breaking her engagement and ensuring a scandal of Byronic proportions. Seeds of irrevocable ruin, scattered with the wind.</p><p>A cold sense of destiny anchored her rising stomach. There was no going back now. She could walk through far worse than this shabby pub, if it meant leaving her restrictive life behind. She could even endure these coarse men ogling her breasts, so long as they did not glimpse the secret strapped between them.</p> <p>Her resolve firmed, Sophia caught the eye of a bald-headed man wiping a table with a greasy rag. He looked harmless enough\u2014or at least, too old to strike quickly. She smiled at him. He returned the gesture with a completely toothless grin.</p><p>Her own smile faltering, she ventured, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Captain Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course you is. All the comely ones are.\u201d The gleaming pate jerked.</p><p>\u201cGray\u2019s in the back.\u201d</p><p>She followed the direction indicated, moving through the crowd on tiptoe in an effort to keep her hem off the floor. The sticky floorboards sucked at her half boots. Toward the back of the room, she spied a boisterous knot of men and women near the bar. One man stood taller than the others, his auburn hair looking cleaner than that of his company. A brushed felt beaver rested on the bar nearby, an oddly refined ornament for this seedy den. As Sophia angled for a better view, a chair slid out from a nearby table, clipping her in the knee. She bobbled on tiptoe for a moment before tripping forward. The hem of her cloak caught on her boot, and the cloak wrenched open, exposing her chest and throat to the sour, wintry air. In her desperate attempt to right herself, she clutched wildly for the wall\u2014</p><p>And grasped a handful of rough linen shirt instead.</p> <p>The shirt\u2019s owner turned to her. \u201cHullo there, chicken,\u201d he slurred, his breath rancid with decay. His liquor-glazed eyes slid over her body and settled on the swell of her breasts. \u201cFancy bit of goods you are. By looks, I would have priced you beyond my pocket, but if you\u2019s offerin\u2019 ...\u201d</p><p>Had he mistaken her for some dockside trollop? Sophia\u2019s tongue curled with disgust. Perhaps she was disguised in simple garments, but certainly she did not look cheap.</p><p>\u201cI am not offering,\u201d she said firmly. She tried to wriggle away, but with a quick move, he had her pinned against the bar.</p><p>\u201cHold there, lovely. Jes\u2019 a little tickle, then.\u201d</p><p>His grimy fingers dove into the valley of her bosom, and Sophia yelped.</p><p>\u201cUnhand me, you ... you revolting brute!\u201d</p><p>The brute released one of her arms to further his lascivious exploration, and Sophia used her newly freed hand to beat him about the head. No use. His fingers squirmed between her breasts like fat, greedy worms burrowing in the dark.</p><p>\u201cStop this,\u201d she cried, making her hand a fist and clouting his ear, to no avail. Her efforts at defense only amused her drunken attacker.</p> <p>\u201cS\u2019all right,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI likes my girls with plenty o\u2019 pluck.\u201d</p><p>Desperation clawed at her insides. It wasn\u2019t simply the insult of this lout\u2019s hands on her breasts that had her panicking. She\u2019d forfeited her genteel reputation the moment she left home. But his fingers groped closer and closer to the one thing she dared not surrender. If he found it, Sophia doubted she would escape this tavern with her life intact, much less her virtue.</p><p>Her attacker turned his head, angling for a better look down her dress. His grimy ear was just inches from her mouth. Within snapping distance. If she bit it hard enough, she might startle him into letting her go. She had all but made up her mind to do it, when she inhaled another mouthful of his rank sweat and paused. If her choices were putting her mouth on this repulsive beast or dying, she just might rather die.</p><p>In the end, she didn\u2019t do either.</p><p>The repulsive beast gave a yawp of surprise as a pair of massive hands bodily hauled him away. Lifted him, actually, as though the brute weighed nothing, until he writhed in the air above her like a fish on a hook.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Bains,\u201d said a smooth, confident baritone, \u201cyou know better than that.\u201d</p><p>With an easy motion, her rescuer tossed Bains aside. The brute landed some feet away, with the crunch of splintering wood.</p><p>Sagging against the bar with relief, Sophia peered up at her savior. It was the tall, auburn-haired gentleman she\u2019d spied earlier. At least, she assumed him to be a gentleman. His accent bespoke education, and with his dark-green topcoat, fawn-colored trousers, and tasseled Hessians, he cut a fashionable silhouette. But as his arms flexed, the finely tailored clothing delineated raw, muscled power beneath.</p><p>And there was nothing refined about his face. His features were rough-hewn, his skin bronzed by the sun. It was impossible not to stare at the golden, weathered hue and wonder\u2014did it fade at his cravat? At his waist? Not at all?</p><p>The more she peered up at the man, the less she knew what to make of him. He had a gentleman\u2019s attire, a laborer\u2019s body ... and the wide, sensuous mouth of a scoundrel.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you, Bains? That\u2019s no way to touch a woman.\u201d His words were addressed to the lout on the floor, but his roguish gaze was fixed on her. Then he smiled, and the lazy quirk of his lips tugged a thin scar slanting from his jaw to his mouth.</p><p>Oh yes, that mouth was dangerous indeed.</p><p>At that moment, Sophia could have kissed it.</p><p>\u201cThe proper way to touch a woman,\u201d he continued, sauntering to her side and propping an elbow on the bar, \u201cis to come at her from the side, like so.\u201d</p><p>In an attitude of perfect nonchalance, he leaned his weight on his arm and slid it along the bar until his knuckles came within a hair\u2019s width of her breast.</p><p>Mouth of a scoundrel, indeed! Sophia\u2019s gratitude quickly turned to indignation. Had this man truly yanked one lout off her just so he could grope her himself? Apparently so. His hand rested so close to her breast, her flesh heated in the shadow of his fingers. So close, her skin prickled, anticipating the rough texture of his touch. She wished he would touch her, end the excruciating uncertainty, and give her an excuse to slap the roguish smirk from his face.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said, waggling his fingers in the vicinity of her bosom. \u201cThis way you don\u2019t startle her off.\u201d</p><p>Coarse laughter rumbled through the assembled crowd.</p><p>Retracting his hand, the scoundrel lifted his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t I have the right of it, Megs?\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to a curvy redhead gathering tankards. Megs barely looked up from her work as she sang out, \u201cAin\u2019t no one like Gray knows how to touch a lady.\u201d</p><p>Laughter swept the tavern again, louder this time. Even Bains chuckled. Gray. Sophia\u2019s heart plummeted. What was it the bald man had said, when she asked for Captain Grayson? Gray\u2019s in the back.</p><p>\u201cOne last thing to remember, Bains,\u201d Gray continued. \u201cThe least you can do is buy the lady a drink.\u201d As the tavern-goers returned to their carousing, he turned his arrogant grin on Sophia. \u201cWhat are you having, then?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>What was she having? Sophia knew exactly what she was having. She was having colossally bad luck.</p><p>This well-dressed mountain of insolence looming over her was Captain Grayson, of the brig Aphrodite. And the brig Aphrodite was the sole ship bound for Tortola until next week. For Sophia, next week might as well have been next year. She needed to leave for Tortola. She needed to leave now.</p><p>Therefore, she needed this man\u2014or rather, this man\u2019s ship\u2014to take her.</p><p>\u201cWhat, no outpouring of gratitude?\u201d He cast a glance toward Bains, who was lumbering up from the floor. \u201cI suppose you think I should have beat him to a pulp. I could have. But then, I don\u2019t like violence. It always ends up costing me money. And pretty thing that you are\u201d\u2014his eyes skipped over her as he motioned to the barkeep\u2014\u201cbefore I went to that much effort, I think I\u2019d at least need to know your name, Miss ... ?\u201d</p><p>Sophia gritted her teeth, marshalling all her available forbearance. She needed to leave, she reminded herself. She needed this man. \u201cTurner. Miss Jane Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss ... Jane ... Turner.\u201d He teased the syllables out, as if tasting them on his tongue. Sophia had always thought her middle name to be the dullest, plainest syllable imaginable. But from his lips, even \u201cJane\u201d sounded indecent.</p><p>\u201cWell, Miss Jane Turner. What are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drinking anything. I\u2019m looking for you, Captain Grayson. I\u2019ve come seeking passage on your ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the Aphrodite? To Tortola? Why the devil would you want to go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a governess. I\u2019m to be employed, near Road Town.\u201d The lies rolled effortlessly off her tongue. As always.</p><p>His eyes swept her from bonnet to half boots, stroking an unwelcome shiver down to her toes. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like any governess I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>His gaze settled on her hands, and Sophia quickly balled them into fists. The gloves. Curse her vanity. Her maid\u2019s old dress and cloak served well for disguise\u2014their dark, shapeless folds could hide a multitude of sins. But as she\u2019d dressed herself for the first time in her life that morning, her fingers shook with nerves and cold, and Sophia had assuaged their trembling with this one indulgence, her best pair of black kid gloves, fastened with tiny black pearl buttons and lined with sable. They were not the gloves of a governess.</p><p>For a moment, Sophia feared he would see the truth.</p><p>Balderdash, she chided herself. No one ever looked at her and saw the truth. People saw what they wanted to see ... the obedient daughter, the innocent maiden, the society belle, the blushing bride. This merchant captain was no different. He would see a passenger, and the promise of coin</p><p>Long ago, she\u2019d learned this key to deceit. It was easy to lie, once you understood that no one really wanted the truth.</p><p>\u201cLovely, aren\u2019t they? They were a gift.\u201d With a gloved flourish, she held out her letter. The envelope bore the wear and marks of a transatlantic voyage. \u201cMy offer of employment, if you\u2019d care to examine it.\u201d She sent up a quick prayer that he would not. \u201cFrom a Mr. Waltham of Eleanora plantation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaltham?\u201d He laughed, waving away the letter.</p><p>Sophia pocketed it quickly.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner, you\u2019ve no idea what trials you\u2019re facing. Never mind the dangers of an ocean crossing, the tropical poverty and disease ... George Waltham\u2019s brats are a plague upon the earth. One your delicate nature and fine gloves are unlikely to survive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know the family, then?\u201d Sophia kept her tone light, but inwardly she loosed a flurry of curses. She\u2019d never considered the possibility that this merchant captain could claim an acquaintance with the Walthams.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know Waltham,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe grew up together. Our fathers\u2019plantations shared a boundary. He was older by several years, but I paced him for mischief well enough.\u201d</p><p>Sophia swallowed a groan. Captain Grayson not only knew Mr. Waltham\u2014they were friends and neighbors! All her plans, all her carefully tiered lies... this bit of information shuffled them like a deck of cards. He continued, \u201cAnd you\u2019re traveling alone, with no chaperone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can look after myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. And I tossed Bains across the room just now for my own amusement. It\u2019s a little game we seamen like to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can look after myself,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIf you\u2019d waited another moment, that revolting beast would be missing an ear.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a deep, scrutinizing look that made her feel like a turned-out glove, all seams and raw edges. She breathed steadily, fighting the blush creeping up her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cI\u2019m certain in that fertile female imagination of yours, you think sailing off to the West Indies will be some grand, romantic adventure.\u201d He drawled the phrase in a patronizing tone, but Sophia wasn\u2019t certain he meant to deride her. Rather, she surmised, his tone communicated a general weariness with adventure.</p> <p>How sad.</p><p>\u201cFortunately,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve never known a girl I couldn\u2019t disillusion, so listen close to me now. You\u2019re wrong. You will not find adventure, nor romance. At best, you\u2019ll meet with unspeakable boredom. At worst, you\u2019ll meet with an early death.\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked. His description of Tortola gave her some pause, but she dismissed any concern quickly. After all, it wasn\u2019t as though she meant to stay there.</p><p>The captain reached to retrieve his felt beaver from the bar.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She clutched his arm. Heavens. It was like clutching a wool-sheathed cannon. Ignoring the warm tingle in her belly, she made her eyes wide and her voice beseeching. The role of innocent, helpless miss was one she\u2019d been playing for years. \u201cPlease, you must take me. I\u2019ve nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m certain you\u2019d figure something out. Pretty thing like you? After all,\u201d he said, quirking an eyebrow, \u201cyou can look after yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaptain Grayson\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss. Jane. Turner.\u201d His voice grew thin with impatience. \u201cYou waste your breath, appealing to my sense of honor and decency. Any gentleman in my place would send you off at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019re no gentleman.\u201d She gripped his arm again and looked him square in the eye. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>He froze. All that muscle rippling with energy, the rugged profile animated by insolence\u2014for an instant, it all turned to stone. Sophia held her breath, knowing she\u2019d just wagered her future on this, the last remaining card in her hand.</p><p>But this was so much more thrilling than whist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a tradesman, and I need to turn a profit. So long as you\u2019ve silver to pay your passage, the brig Aphrodite has a waiting berth.\u201d</p><p>Relief sighed through her body. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you trunks?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo. Outside with a porter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d His mouth curved in a slow, devilish smile. A conspiratorial smile. The sort of smile a young lady of fine breeding didn\u2019t acknowledge, let alone return.</p><p>So naturally, wicked thing that she was, Sophia smiled back.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthis is going to be a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she asked, feeling suddenly disinclined to put up much of a fight.</p><p>\u201cRetrieving your trunks, with you clinging to my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yes, she was still clinging to his arm, wasn\u2019t she? Drat. And yet\u2014she wasn\u2019t quite ready to let it go.</p><p>Maybe it was the lingering desperation from her episode with Bains, or the flood of profound relief that accompanied her rescue. Perhaps it was a perverse fascination with this enigma of a man, who possessed the brute strength to toss grown men around, and just enough charm to be truly dangerous. Or maybe it was simply the feel of his rock-hard muscles beneath her hand, and the knowledge that she\u2019d made them flex. Sophia couldn\u2019t say. But touching him made her feel exhilarated. Powerful and alive. Everything she\u2019d been waiting her whole life to feel. Everything she\u2019d been prepared to travel halfway across the globe to find. In running away, she had made the decision to embrace infamy. And lo, here he was.</p><p>The girl really needed to let him go.</p><p>This was the voyage Gray went respectable. And it was off to a very bad start.</p><p>It was all her fault\u2014this delicate wisp of a governess, with that porcelain complexion and her big, round eyes tilting up at him like Wedgwood teacups. She looked as if she might break if he breathed on her wrong, and those eyes kept beseeching him, imploring him, making demands. Please,rescue me from this pawing brute. Please, take me on your ship andaway to Tortola. Please, strip me out of this revolting gown and initiateme in the pleasures of the flesh right here on the barstool. Well, innocent miss that she was, she might have lacked words to voice the third quite that way. But, worldly man that he was, Gray could interpret the silent petition quite clearly. He only wished he could discourage his body\u2019s instinctive, affirmative response.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to do with the girl. He ought to do the respectable thing, seeing as how this voyage marked the beginning of his respectable career. But Miss Turner had him pegged. He was no kind of gentleman, and damned if he knew the respectable thing. Allowing a young, unmarried, winsome lady to travel unaccompanied probably wasn\u2019t it. But then, if he refused her, who was to say she wouldn\u2019t end up in an even worse situation? The chit couldn\u2019t handle herself for five minutes in a tavern. Was he truly going to turn her loose on the Gravesend quay? What would he tell George Waltham then?</p><p>Damn it. After years of aimless carousing, Gray had reached the point in his life where, for one reason and another, he actually wanted to behave in an honorable fashion. The trouble was, somewhere in all those years of aimless carousing, he\u2019d mislaid his sense of honor. He could sail through a cyclone and not lose his course. He could navigate a woman\u2019s body in the dark. But his moral compass had grown rusted with disuse. However ... he never lost sight of the bottom line. And so, with this governess putting him to the test, Gray reverted to his usual method of making decisions\u2014he opted for profit. Miss Jane Turner was a passenger. He had a ship with empty berths. The decision was simple. He was a tradesman, and this was business. Strictly business.</p><p>He had no business studying the exquisite alabaster sweep of her cheekbone.</p><p>And she had no business clutching his arm.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner,\u201d he said sternly, in the same voice he gave orders to his crew.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go now.\u201d</p><p>She released his arm, blushing fetchingly as she did so and looking up at him through trembling lashes. Gray sighed. If it wasn\u2019t one thing, it was another.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve one last piece of business, then. Stay here.\u201d</p><p>With that imperious command, he crossed the tavern. Bains sat at a table, hunkered over a fresh tankard of ale. Gray clapped a hand on his shoulder and leaned over to speak in his unwashed ear. A few more stern words, a few coins, and there was one more quandary resolved to his profit.</p><p>\u201cNow then, Miss Turner. We can be on our way.\u201d Grasping her firmly by the elbow, he whisked her out the tavern door.</p><p>\u201cYou gave him money?\u201d Struggling under his grip, she twisted to look back toward Bains. \u201cAfter what he did to me, what you did to him ... You paid him?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her question, he caught the porter\u2019s eye. \u201cThe lady\u2019s belongings,\u201d he commanded briskly.</p><p>The porter wrapped beefy forearms around the larger of her two trunks.</p><p>Gray reached for the smaller one, hefting it onto his shoulder and holding it balanced there with one hand. He took three paces before he realized she wasn\u2019t following.</p><p>He paused long enough to toss a comment over his shoulder. \u201cCome along, then. I\u2019ll take you out to the Aphrodite. You\u2019ll be wanting to meet the captain.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>The captain?</p><p>Sophia stood staring numbly after him. Had he just said he\u2019d introduce her to the captain? If someone else was the captain, then who on earth was this man?</p><p>One thing was clear. Whoever he was, he had her trunks.</p><p>And he was walking away.</p><p>Cursing under her breath, Sophia picked up her skirts and trotted after him, dodging boatmen and barrels and coils of tarred rope as she pursued him down the quay. A forest of tall masts loomed overhead, striping the dock with shadow.</p><p>Breathless, she regained his side just as he neared the dock\u2019s edge. \u201cBut... aren\u2019t you Captain Grayson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he said, pitching her smaller trunk into a waiting rowboat, \u201cam Mr. Grayson, owner of the Aphrodite and principal investor in her cargo.\u201d</p><p>The owner. Well, that was some relief. The tavern-keeper must have been confused.</p><p>The porter deposited her larger trunk alongside the first, and Mr. Grayson dismissed him with a word and a coin. He plunked one polished Hessian on the rowboat\u2019s seat and shifted his weight to it, straddling the gap between boat and dock. Hand outstretched, he beckoned her with an impatient twitch of his fingers. \u201cMiss Turner?\u201d</p><p>Sophia inched closer to the dock\u2019s edge and reached one gloved hand toward his, considering how best to board the bobbing craft without losing her dignity overboard.</p><p>The moment her fingers grazed his palm, his grip tightened over her hand. He pulled swiftly, wrenching her feet from the dock and a gasp from her throat. A moment of weightlessness\u2014and then she was aboard. Somehow his arm had whipped around her waist, binding her to his solid chest. He released her just as quickly, but a lilt of the rowboat pitched Sophia back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cSteady there,\u201d he murmured through a small smile. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>A sudden gust of wind absconded with his hat. He took no notice, but Sophia did. She noticed everything. Never in her life had she felt so acutely aware. Her nerves were drawn taut as harp strings, and her senses hummed.</p><p>The man radiated heat. From exertion, most likely. Or perhaps from a sheer surplus of simmering male vigor. The air around them was cold, but he was hot. And as he held her tight against his chest, Sophia felt that delicious, enticing heat burn through every layer of her clothing\u2014cloak, gown, stays, chemise, petticoat, stockings, drawers\u2014igniting desire in her belly.</p><p>And sparking a flare of alarm. This was a precarious position indeed. The further her torso melted into his, the more certainly he would detect her secret: the cold, hard bundle of notes and coin lashed beneath her stays. She pushed away from him, dropping onto the seat and crossing her arms over her chest. Behind him, the breeze dropped his hat into a foamy eddy. He still hadn\u2019t noticed its loss.</p><p>What he noticed was her gesture of modesty, and he gave her a patronizing smile. \u201cDon\u2019t concern yourself, Miss Turner. You\u2019ve nothing in there I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p><p>Just for that, she would not tell him. Farewell, hat.</p><p>To a point, he was correct. She likely had nothing in there he had not seen before. He\u2019d certainly seen a sovereign in his life, and a banknote or two. He may have even seen almost six hundred pounds\u2019 worth of them, all lined up in a tidy row. But he likely hadn\u2019t seen them in the possession of a governess, because no woman with that sort of money would ever seek employment.</p><p>That scuffle with Bains in the tavern had only underscored her peril. She needed to focus on the tasks at hand. Escaping England and marriage. Guarding her secrets and her purse. Surviving until her twenty-first birthday, when she could return to claim the remainder of her trust. And in aid of it all, keeping men out of her stays. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After untying the boat, Mr. Grayson wedged himself onto the narrow plank across from her and gathered the oars.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a boatman?\u201d she asked. Their knees were practically touching, they sat so close together. She sat up a bit, widening the gap.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d Levering one oar, he pushed off from the dock. She frowned. Surely it wasn\u2019t usual, for the ship\u2019s owner and principal investor to row himself to and from the quay. Then again, surely it wasn\u2019t usual for the ship\u2019s owner and principal investor to have the shoulders of an ox. As he began to row in earnest, the bold, rhythmic power of his strokes entranced her. The soft splash of the oars cutting through the water, the confident motions of his hands, the way strength rippled under his coat again, and again, and again ...</p> <p>Sophia shook herself. This was precisely the sort of observation she ought to avoid.</p><p>With reluctance, she dragged her gaze from his muscled shoulders and settled it on a more benign prospect.</p><p>Burnt sienna. To capture the color of his hair, she would start with a base of burnt sienna, mixed with a touch of raw umber and\u2014she mentally added, as the boat drifted through a shaft of sunlight\u2014the faintest trace of vermillion. More umber at the temples, where sideburns glossed with pomade slicked back toward his slightly square-tipped ears. A controlled touch would be needed there, but the breeze-tossed waves atop his head invited loose, sinuous brushstrokes, layered with whispers of amber. Indian yellow, she decided, lightened with lead white.</p><p>The mental exercise calmed her nerves. These wild, mutinous passions that ruled her\u2014Sophia might never master them, but at least she could channel them into her art.</p><p>\u201cWas it a convent you escaped, Miss Turner?\u201d He turned the boat with a deft pull on one oar.</p> <p>\u201cEscaped?\u201d Her heart knocked against her hidden purse. \u201cI\u2019m a governess, I told you. I\u2019m not running away, from a convent or anywhere else. Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cBecause you\u2019re staring at me as though you\u2019ve never seen a man before.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s cheeks burned. She was staring. Worse, now she found herself powerless to turn away. What with the murky shadows of the tavern and the confusion of the quay, not to mention her own discomposure, she hadn\u2019t taken a good, clear look at his eyes until this moment.</p><p>They defied her mental palette utterly.</p><p>The pupils were ringed with a thin line of blue. Darker than Prussian, yet lighter than indigo. Perhaps matching that dearest of pigments\u2014the one even her father\u2019s generous allowance did not permit\u2014ultramarine. Yet within that blue circumference shifted a changing sea of color\u2014green one moment, gray the next ... in the shadow of a half-blink, hinting at blue.</p><p>He laughed again, and flinty sparks of amusement lit them. Yes, she was still staring.</p> <p>Forcing her gaze to the side, she saw their rowboat nearing the scraped hull of a ship. She cleared her throat and tasted brine. \u201cForgive me, Mr. Grayson. I\u2019m only trying to make you out. I understood you to be the ship\u2019s captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, grasping a rope thrown down to him and securing it to the boat, \u201cnow you know I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I have the pleasure, then, of knowing the captain\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, securing a second rope. \u201cIt\u2019s Captain Grayson.\u201d</p><p>She heard the smirk in his voice, even before she swiveled her head to confirm it. Was he teasing her? \u201cBut, you said ...\u201d</p><p>Before Sophia could phrase her question\u2014or even decide exactly which question she meant to ask\u2014Mr. Grayson shouted to the men aboard the ship, and the rowboat lurched skyward. A splinter gouged her palm as she gripped the seat. The boat made a swift, swaying ascent. As they reached deck level, Mr. Grayson stood. With the same sure strength he\u2019d exhibited on the dock, he grasped her by the waist and swung her over the ship\u2019s rail, setting her on deck and releasing her an instant too soon. Her knees wobbled. She put out a hand to grab the rail as a pair of crewmen hoisted her trunks aboard. She, and everything she owned in the world, now resided on this creaking bowl of timber and tar. The ship jogged with a passing wave, and dizziness forced her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to face Mr. Gr ... or Captain ... Him, whoever he was. Instead, she found herself staring into the starched cravat of a different man. A very different man.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d never seen a man like him before. Many of England\u2019s best families kept Negro servants in their employ. In fact, black footmen were quite the fashion in the ton\u2014their presence hinted at lucrative foreign holdings, and ebony skin made an aesthetically pleasing contrast with a powdered wig.</p><p>But this man\u2019s skin was not ebony. Rather, the tone of his complexion more accurately matched the warm gloss of a ripe hazelnut, or strong tea lightened with a drop of milk. He wore no wig at all, but a tall gray hat. And beneath the hat, his brown, tightly curled hair was cropped close to his scalp. His dark-blue greatcoat was as well-tailored and elegant as any dandy\u2019s. Golden-brown eyes regarded her from a fine-featured face. He was handsome, and\u2014to Sophia\u2019s further confusion\u2014handsome in a vaguely familiar way.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner.\u201d Mr. Grayson stepped forward, shrinking the triangle. \u201cAllow me to present Captain Josiah Grayson.\u201d</p><p>She slid her gaze from the black man just long enough to shoot him a sharp glare. \u201cYou said you were Mr. Grayson.\u201d</p><p>Both men smiled. Sophia set her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI am Mr. Grayson. And this\u201d\u2014he clapped a hand on the black man\u2019s shoulder\u2014\u201cis Captain Grayson.\u201d</p><p>She looked from one man to the other, then back again. \u201cYou share the same name?\u201d</p><p>Their smiles broadened.</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d Mr. Grayson said smoothly, that thin scar on his chin curving up to mock her. \u201cBrothers usually do.\u201d</p><p>Gray watched with satisfaction as a blush bloomed across those smooth, delicate cheeks. Perhaps he was enjoying Miss Turner\u2019s confusion a bit too much. But damn, ever since he\u2019d lifted Bains off her in the tavern, he\u2019d been enjoying everything a bit too much. The way the circumference of her waist so perfectly filled his crooked arm. The feel of her soft, fragile body pressed up against his in the rowboat. The clean, feminine scent of her\u2014hints of powder and rose water and another scent he couldn\u2019t quite place. Something sweet.</p><p>And the way she kept staring at him. Bloody hell. It heated his blood, made him want things that even he recognized as less than respectable. So it was a relief now, to let her blink up at his brother for a bit.</p><p>\u201cBrothers.\u201d She looked from Gray to Joss and back again. Her gaze sharpened, seemed to refocus somewhere behind him. Gray fought the urge to turn and look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes of course,\u201d she said slowly, tilting her head to one side. \u201cI ought to have seen it at once. The squared-off tip, the little notch above the lobe ...\u201d</p><p>He exchanged an amused glance with Joss. What the devil was this about notches and tips?</p><p>\u201cYou have the same ears,\u201d she finished, a smile tipping the corner of her mouth as she made a smooth curtsy.</p><p>Gray paused a beat, then gave a soft laugh. There was a self-assured grace to her movements that he found oddly entrancing, and now he understood why. This was a gesture of satisfaction, not deference. She curtsied not to please, but because she was pleased with herself. In short, the girl was taking a bow.</p><p>And damned if he wasn\u2019t tempted to applaud. She hadn\u2019t been destined for employment, he would stake the ship on that. Gentle-bred, certainly, despite those deplorable garments. From a wealthy family, he surmised, fallen on hard times. Those fine gloves were only a subtle clue; it was her bearing that made the confession. Gray knew how to discern the true value of goods beneath layers of spit and varnish, and Miss Turner ... Miss Turner was a quality piece.</p><p>She straightened. \u201cI am honored to make your acquaintance, Captain Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe honor is mine,\u201d Joss replied with a smooth bow. \u201cYou travel alone, Miss Turner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am to be employed, near Road Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s to be governess to George Waltham\u2019s whelps,\u201d Gray interjected.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say, I attempted to caution her against taking such a thankless post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner.\u201d Joss\u2019s voice took on a serious tone. \u201cAs captain of this vessel, I must also question the prudence of this journey.\u201d</p><p>Miss Turner foraged in her cloak. \u201cI ... I have a letter, from Mr. Waltham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t misunderstand me,\u201d Joss said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your employment I\u2019m concerned for, it\u2019s your reputation. We have no other passengers aboard this ship.\u201d</p><p>No other passengers? Gray cleared his throat.</p><p>Joss shot him a look. \u201cSave my brother, of course. A young, unmarried woman, traversing the Atlantic without a chaperone ...\u201d</p><p>Gray shuffled his feet impatiently. What was Joss on about? Surely he didn\u2019t intend to refuse her passage?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you would do better to wait. The Peregrine sails for Tortola next week.\u201d</p><p>Hell. He did intend to refuse her passage.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she objected. \u201cNo, please. Captain, I appreciate your concern for my reputation. Had I any prospects other than this post, had I any family or friends who would take exception ... I might share your concern. As matters stand, I tell you with complete honesty\u201d\u2014she swallowed\u2014\u201cthere is no one who will care.\u201d</p><p>Gray tried, very hard, to pretend he hadn\u2019t just heard that. She continued, \u201cIf you can ensure my safety, Captain Grayson, I can promise to behave in strict accordance with propriety.\u201d</p><p>Sighing hard, Joss shifted his weight. \u201cMiss Turner, I\u2019m sorry, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged, laying a delicate hand on his brother\u2019s arm. \u201cYou must take me. I\u2019ve nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s expression softened. Gray was relieved to learn he wasn\u2019t the only man that wide-eyed plea worked on. For no definable reason, he was also annoyed, to watch it plied on another man.</p><p>\u201cTake pity, Captain Grayson. Surely Miss Turner must be fatigued.\u201d Gray spied the old steward limping down the deck. \u201cStubb, kindly show Miss Turner to the ladies\u2019 cabin. Berth seven is vacant, I believe.\u201d</p><p>Stubb gave an amused cackle. \u201cThey\u2019re all vacant, I believe.\u201d</p><p>Well, yes. But they\u2019d all be full on the voyage home, thanks to the dwindling profits of sugar plantations. Scarcely anyone was traveling to the West Indies anymore, save Methodist missionaries. And, apparently, the occasional winsome governess.</p><p>Seeming to recognize defeat, Joss bowed. \u201cWelcome aboard the Aphrodite, Miss Turner. I hope your voyage is pleasant.\u201d</p><p>The young lady curtsied once again before Stubb escorted her to the narrow stairs that led belowdecks. Gray watched Miss Turner descend into the belly of the ship, knowing that for good or ill, this voyage had just become a great deal more interesting.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bains?\u201d Joss asked suddenly. \u201cWhat are you doing, rowing yourself back to the ship? Is he following with more cargo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him go? What the devil for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with his eyesight.\u201d Any man who mistook Miss Turner for a dockside whore had to be losing his vision. Not to mention, Gray didn\u2019t want a sailor who had a habit of taking what wasn\u2019t offered him. In voyages past, that attitude might have been a desirable trait, but not anymore. The Aphrodite was a respectable merchant ship now.</p><p>Joss\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cYou can\u2019t let him go. He\u2019s my crewman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. You go ashore for two hours of trade, and somehow you\u2019ve exchanged an experienced sailor for a governess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, and goats. I did buy a few goats\u2014the boatman will have them out presently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, don\u2019t try to change the subject. Crew and passengers are supposed to be my responsibility. Am I captain of this ship or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Joss, you\u2019re the captain. But I\u2019m the investor. I don\u2019t want Bains near my cargo, and I\u2019d like at least one paying passenger on this voyage, if I can get one. I didn\u2019t have that steerage compartment converted to cabins for a lark, you realize.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019ll believe your interest in that girl lies solely in her six pounds sterling ...\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cSince you mention it, I quite admired her brass as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damn well what I mean. A young lady, unescorted ...\u201d He looked askance at Gray. \u201cIt\u2019s asking for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking for trouble?\u201d Gray echoed, hoping to lighten the conversation.</p><p>\u201cSince when does the Aphrodite need to go asking for trouble? We\u2019ve stowed more trouble than cargo on this ship.\u201d He leaned back, propping both elbows on the ship\u2019s rail. \u201cAnd as trouble goes, Miss Turner\u2019s variety looks a damn sight better than most alternatives. Perhaps you could do with a bit of trouble yourself. It\u2019s been a year, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Joss\u2019s face drew tight. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year, two months, and seventeen days. I have troubles enough of my own, Gray. I\u2019m not looking for more.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stared out over the harbor.</p><p>Damn. Gray knew he shouldn\u2019t have said that. It was just\u2014well, he missed the old, piss-at-the-devil Joss. He missed his brother. He kept hoping the old Joss would surface someday, once he released all that pain dragging him down. But the chances of that seemed even less likely, now that Gray had made him captain. Navigating the sea would be the least of Joss\u2019s worries on this, his first voyage in command. Navigating the balance of power between a green captain and fifteen men more accustomed to plundering cargo than protecting it\u2014now that was treacherous going. Here there be monsters.</p><p>And Joss was worried\u2014perhaps rightly\u2014that having an attractive, unmarried young lady aboard would cock it all up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep the girl out of trouble,\u201d Gray said, in what seemed to him a rather magnanimous gesture. \u201cI\u2019ll watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve no doubt you will. But who\u2019s going to watch out for you?\u201d</p> <p>Gray\u2019s nerves prickled. So, it wasn\u2019t the girl Joss was concerned about. No, he expected Gray to cock it all up.</p><p>\u201cRight, Joss. I\u2019m an unprincipled, lecherous bastard.\u201d He paused, waiting for his brother to argue otherwise.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Gray protested, \u201cShe\u2019s a governess, for the love of gold. Prim, proper, starched, dull.\u201d Soft, he thought in counterpoint. Delicate, sweet. Intriguing.</p><p>\u201cAh. So you\u2019ll dally with any chambermaid or serving wench who\u2019ll lift her skirts, but you\u2019d draw the line at seducing a governess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Have a look at me, man.\u201d Gray smoothed his brushed velvet lapel, then gestured upward at the banners trimming the freshly tarred rigging.</p><p>\u201cLook at this ship. I\u2019m telling you, my libertine days are over. I\u2019ve gone respectable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to change your coat. It\u2019s a great deal harder to change your ways.\u201d</p> <p>Gray sighed heavily. He\u2019d never been a model brother, and God knew he\u2019d never be a saint. But whether Joss believed it or not, he\u2019d worked damn hard to launch this business. He\u2019d worked damn hard for them\u2014to give this patched-together family of theirs some security, the place in society their father had forfeited de cades ago. He\u2019d talked investors into entrusting him with thousands of pounds; he\u2019d promised the insurers he could be trusted to safely deliver the cargo.</p><p>Yet his own brother didn\u2019t trust him to keep out of a girl\u2019s skirts. The irony would have struck him as humorous, had it wounded him any less. Had it been any less deserved. Gray rubbed his face with one hand and tried again, all trace of joking gone from his voice. \u201cListen, Joss. I won\u2019t pursue her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pursue her,\u201d Gray repeated slowly. \u201cAnd I thought that you weren\u2019t looking.\u201d</p><p>Joss stared back out at the water. \u201cI was widowed, Gray. I didn\u2019t go blind.\u201d</p><p>No, not blind, Gray thought. Just ... numb. When Joss turned and caught him staring, Gray just smiled and shook his head. \u201cThe girl\u2019s right, you know. We both have his ears.\u201d He pushed off the rail and straightened, pulling a hand through his hair.</p><p>His uncovered, wind-mussed hair.</p><p>\u201cWitch\u2019s tit,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d</p><p>Joss raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Gray wheeled about, searching the deck and glancing over the rail. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my damn hat.\u201d</p><p>Joss broke into low laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. I just bought that hat. I liked that hat. Cost me a bloody fortune, that hat.\u201d</p><p>Joss laughed again, and this time Gray laughed with him. Yes, that hat had cost him a bloody fortune. And now that hat had purchased him a moment of carefree laughter with his brother, on the deck of the Aphrodite. An echo, somehow, from a happier time past.</p><p>Gray smiled to himself. Damn, but he loved a good bargain.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Surely there was a man in there somewhere, Sophia thought. Somewhere under all that hair.</p><p>The hunched, ancient steward shuffled down the narrow staircase, whistling a jaunty tune as he went. She followed, treading gingerly on the bowed boards. As her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, she took in the greasy, gray tangle of hair that hung midway down the man\u2019s back, the grizzled froth of beard that extended nearly as far down in front, the lightly furred forearms exposed by his loose checked tunic.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ere we are, miss,\u201d he announced. \u201cLadies\u2019 cabins.\u201d He pushed aside a thin curtain of dark fabric, and they entered a small, low-ceilinged chamber with a round table and chairs occupying the center. Sunlight streamed into the space from a skylight above. Four doors opened off the small room, two on either side. The steward crossed to the door marked \u201cSeven\u201d and opened it with a flourish. \u201cYour berth, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Stubb, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Stubb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe privy\u2019s just there.\u201d He nodded toward a small door. \u201cGo through the cabin this way, and you\u2019ll hit top steerage\u2014that\u2019s where all the provisions are kept\u2014and then the forecastle. Go the other direction, and you have the gentlemen\u2019s cabin, the galley, then the captain and mates\u2019 cabins at the stern. But if you need anything, you just call on me, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Stubb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your trunks down in a wink, then.\u201d He bowed extravagantly, sweeping the floor with the fringe of his beard.</p><p>Sophia entered her berth and shut the door, then turned a slow circle in place. There wasn\u2019t room to do much else. The little closet, for lack of a better term\u2014her family\u2019s Mayfair town home boasted cupboards larger than this\u2014consisted of a narrow bed protruding from the wall at shoulder height, storage space beneath the bunk, and a small writing desk that folded down from the wall.</p><p>No chair.</p><p>Sophia removed her bonnet and knotted the ribbons together, then hung it from a peg driven into the wall. She might have sat down, but there was nowhere to sit. She could have lain down, but she wasn\u2019t certain how to vault herself into the high bed. Instead, she returned to the common area and sat at the table, dropping her head into her hands.</p><p>Had she succumbed to seasickness already? The gentle rolling of the anchored ship seemed insufficient to occasion this amount of dizziness. The whole vessel was a study in contradictions. The captain who wasn\u2019t a captain. The governess who wasn\u2019t a governess. Two men\u2014one white, one black\u2014claiming the close kinship of brotherhood.</p><p>Strangely enough, she believed the last. Something about their square-tipped ears, and the way their angular jaws balanced those arrogant grins ... They were like two garments cut from the same pattern, but fashioned from different cloth.</p><p>Ah, yes. They were half brothers, of course. This overdue realization of the obvious gave Sophia a bit of peace. Apparently, her flow of comprehension had not been dammed entirely. Merely slowed, to the trickling rate of syrup.</p><p>She knew what\u2014or rather, whom\u2014to blame for that. Him, and his insufferable teasing. Coming to her rescue in the tavern, only to humiliate her further. Deliberately misleading her about the captain\u2019s identity simply to gather amusement from her befuddlement. And possessing the unmitigated gall to do it all looking so handsome, with that roguish smirk and the mocking scar beneath it.</p><p>How did he get it, that scar? So thin and straight, slanting from the cleft of his chin to the corner of his mouth. From a blade of some sort, most definitely. Perhaps a stray swipe of a knife in a bawdy-house brawl. Or maybe a more honorable man had called him out in a duel, to avenge his callous acts of insolence toward unsuspecting ladies. A flick of the rapier could make such a scar. But if he had walked away from the duel with a scratch, what had become of his opponent?</p><p>Her imagination ran wild with the notion, painting a vivid scene in her mind. She could visualize the knot of muscle in his arm, sketch the straining sinew in his wrist as he loomed over his trembling rival, lifting the sword for a lethal blow\u2014</p><p>\u201c \u2019Ere we are, then.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s head jerked up.</p><p>Stubb reappeared in an aura of grizzled hair, followed by two sailors each balancing one end of her stacked trunks. The steward directed, \u201cIt\u2019s berth seven, what\u2019s marked for the lovely miss.\u201d</p><p>Her trunks deposited, Sophia stood to offer her thanks. At that moment, however, the ship gave a sudden lurch, and she found herself tossed right back in the chair.</p><p>\u201cAnchors aweigh!\u201d The call came echoing through the grated skylight. \u201cAll hands! All hands!\u201d</p><p>The three men hurried back the way they\u2019d entered, and Sophia followed them up the narrow staircase and onto the deck.</p><p>What a glorious commotion awaited her there\u2014the sailors shouting and hauling and climbing into the rigging like spiders scaling webs. She craned her neck to watch their progress, shading her eyes with one hand. One by one, the square sails unfurled, four apiece on each of the two soaring masts. The wind quickly found and filled the sails, puffing them out like frogs\u2019 throats.</p><p>She went to the rail and stayed there for hours, watching the river widen beneath them and the dense clamor of Gravesend diffuse into pastoral calm. Before she expected it, the Thames spat them out into a wide basin of churning water. They had yet to reach the open sea, but the arms of land on either side grew increasingly distant, as the tide tugged the Aphrodite free of England\u2019s embrace. Daylight was fading, and tendrils of fog wound over her neck and before her eyes, obscuring her view of the low, chalky banks.</p><p>Sophia fought the childish impulse to wave farewell. She clung to the lip of wood instead\u2014for strength, and for stability, as the vessel\u2019s pitching grew increasingly violent. The ship crested a large swell, then dipped into a gray-green valley. Cold, salty spray rushed up to sting her eyes and cheeks.</p><p>It must be the fog, she thought, squeezing her eyes shut and wiping her cheeks. Or the steady rocking of the ship, like a cradle. Perhaps it was the encroaching darkness and the muted roaring of the sea that made her feel, for the first time in many years, so very small.</p><p>And so very, very alone.</p><p>But then, suddenly, she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHomesick already? Or merely seasick?\u201d Mr. Grayson joined her at the rail.</p><p>Sophia tried not to look at him. It was a struggle.</p><p>When a few moments passed without her reply, he said, \u201cI\u2019d offer a few soothing words, but they\u2019d only be lies. It\u2019ll get worse before it gets better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t ask which type of sickness he referred to. Both, she suspected. \u201cAre the waves always this large?\u201d</p><p>But when she turned to him, he\u2019d disappeared. A shout drew her gaze heavenward. Above her, sailors called to one another as they ascended the rigging again. Her stomach churned, just watching them sway back and forth against the backdrop of greenish sky. Sophia clutched the rail and shut her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable. It\u2019s just a few clouds,\u201d came a low murmur, behind her.</p> <p>\u201cAye, a few big, black clouds to the West. You know as well as I do, a storm\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit of a blow, perhaps. The Aphrodite\u2019s weathered far worse. Reef the topsails, keep all hands at the ready.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, thick with enmity.</p><p>\u201cNot in the Downs,\u201d came the terse reply. \u201cI\u2019ll not risk springing a mast our first night at sea. We\u2019ll drop anchor and furl the sails, and we\u2019ll wait it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss, you\u2019re behaving\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m behaving as the captain of this ship, Gray. If you don\u2019t start affording me the respect that deserves, I\u2019ll order you below.\u201d The voice sank deeper still. \u201cAnd if you dare contradict me in front of my crew, I\u2019ll throw your arse in the brig.\u201d</p><p>A burst of spray hit Sophia\u2019s face again, startling her eyes open. With droplets of seawater clinging to her eyelashes, she slowly rotated her neck until the two brothers came into focus.</p><p>The men glared at each other, and the fog swirling around them took on the charged heat of steam. Apparently, the Grayson brothers shared no more affection than Sophia and her sister did.</p><p>The captain turned toward the ship\u2019s bow, calling, \u201cMr. Brackett!\u201d</p><p>A third man joined them. The fog and spray obscured the features of his face, but Sophia could see he was tall and lean, standing ramrod straight despite the waves.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brackett,\u201d said the captain, \u201csee that all passengers\u201d\u2014he shot another glance at his fuming brother\u2014\u201care returned to their cabins. Furl the topsails and prepare to drop anchor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, aye, Captain.\u201d Mr. Brackett strode forward, sharp cheekbones and blade-thin nose slicing through the fog. He began barking orders, and the crew exploded into activity.</p><p>\u201cCome along then, Miss Turner.\u201d Stubb took her elbow and urged her toward the companionway hatch. They crossed the deck in a lurching gait as the waves rolled beneath.</p><p>Once they were safely below, Stubb left her alone, only to return a few moments later with a bucket threaded over his arm. Behind him followed another of the sailors\u2014an impossibly tall and broad-shouldered black man whose size required him to nearly double over and turn sideways just to thread his body through the compartment entry.</p><p>\u201cLevi \u2019ere will be putting up the deadlights.\u201d Stubb tilted his hoary crown toward the black man as he bent to lash the chair legs to the table\u2019s bolted base.</p><p>\u201cDeadlights?\u201d Just the sound of the word left Sophia cold, and she braced herself against the table to receive its meaning.</p><p>\u201cShutters for the cabin windows,\u201d the steward explained. \u201cTo keep out the storm and sea.\u201d</p><p>Levi nudged past her, squeezing into her berth. He carried a circular plate, drilled \u2019round with screw holes.</p><p>Stubb passed the bucket to Sophia. \u201cYou\u2019re like to have need of this.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down at the leather pail. \u201cAm I to bail out the seawater, then?\u201d</p><p>Stubb cackled with laughter. \u201cLevi! The lovely miss thinks she\u2019ll be put to work, bailing out the bilge!\u201d Levi made no reply as he emerged from her berth, but Stubb laughed twice as loudly to compensate. \u201cNay, miss. If we take on some sea, there\u2019s a pump in the hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the bucket?\u201d Sophia asked. The ship dropped suddenly, and her stomach rolled with it. \u201cOh. That.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t be worried about the waves, miss. Save your concerns for the lightning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLightning?\u201d She didn\u2019t like the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cAye. Strange things occur when lightning strikes a ship. That electric fluid bounces all through the hull, and woe to the sailor caught holding a bit of metal.\u201d Stubb fluffed his whiskers. \u201cWhat do you think turned this beard of mine to white?\u201d He flashed a toothless grin. \u201cHad me a whole set of gold teeth. All melted to slag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d the steward said, though he threw Sophia a sly wink. \u201cJust ask Levi here. He won\u2019t speak a word to contradict me.\u201d</p><p>Neither would he speak a word to support you, she surmised. The black man hadn\u2019t broken his silence since entering. But arms crossed and face stony, he looked capable of supporting the London Bridge.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d the old man continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why they call me Stubb. Before the lightning struck, I used to have a wooden leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wooden ...\u201d Sophia stared at the steward\u2019s bare, furred feet for a moment before Stubb broke into loud, toothless laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry yerself about a little blow like this one, miss,\u201d Stubb said, backing his way out of the cabin. \u201cWe\u2019ll come through it fine.\u201d</p><p>Once the men had left, taking the lamp along with them, Sophia fumbled her way into her berth. It was dark as a pocket, and even if she had some light by which to undress or unpack her trunks, the boat\u2019s turbulent motions made it difficult just to remain upright.</p><p>She settled for removing her gloves, and then her cloak, reaching into the folds to retrieve her \u201cletter of employment.\u201d This she tucked beneath her bodice, where it curled around her purse. She groped with her feet until she located her trunks. Then, climbing atop them and clinging to the edge of the bunk for balance, she spread her cloak across the high, flat plank and\u2014between groaning tilts of the ship\u2014managed to scramble into bed. That letter\u2014it was a stroke of good fortune that neither Captain nor Mr. Grayson had been inclined to examine it. Her handiwork could easily deceive someone unacquainted with either party, but Mr. Grayson possessed intimate knowledge of the Waltham family. He would be certain to notice something amiss.</p><p>It all had begun as a lark, a joke. While tucked away at a country house party, Sophia had amused her friend Lucy Waltham by drafting a nonsense letter to Lucy\u2019s cousins in Tortola, whom she had never met. At the time, Sophia\u2019s sole motive had been to needle Lucy about her suitor, Jeremy Trescott, the Earl of Kendall. But the romance of it all, the idea of her scribblings floating across the sea to a tropical clime, had gripped Sophia and refused to let go. She posted the letter on a whim, signing Lucy\u2019s name but giving her own London address. Then Lucy had married Jeremy, and Sophia had become engaged, and Tortola had been forgotten. Until a week ago, when Sophia received a reply.</p><p>My dear cousin Lucy, the letter read.</p><p>Although your kind letter arrived addressed to Papa, he has bade me reply, since heassumes we are nearly of an age. I am Emily, his eldest, recently turned sixteen, and I happy to oblige his request. Compared to the hardships I am typically made to endure,such as minding my four incorrigible siblings, penning a letter is a true delight. At any rate, I extend to you our entire family\u2019s felicitations on your marriage and ourfondest hopes for your happiness. Would that I could invite you and your new husband tovisit us here in the West Indies, but Papa threatens daily that we shall soon depart forAmerica, as soon as he finds a buyer for our land. How desolate I shall be, to bid farewellto our beloved home, Eleanora, where I have been born and bred and lived so manyhappy years.</p><p>Forgive me, I must end. I hear the telltale clanging that informs me young George andHarry have taken to fencing on the veranda again. Fondest regards from your cousin,</p><p>Miss Emily Waltham</p><p>On first reading, the letter was merely a welcome source of amusement, during a week that held levity in short supply. But that was before Sophia learned that her dowry was actually a trust, and only her twenty-first birthday stood between her and complete financial independence. Before she wandered into that gallery in Queen Anne Street and saw that magnificent painting of a ship braving a stormy sea, and dared to imagine that she, too, could brave the world. Before everything changed\u2014or, more accurately, before Sophia realized she never would.</p><p>Then the letter became a plan. A new sheet affixed to the original envelope, some doctoring of the address, and Sophia Hathaway\u2014or rather, Miss Jane Turner\u2014had an offer of employment. An escape.</p><p>And she had to escape. She\u2019d been escaping for years now, through clever lies and wicked fantasies. Surely Sophia was the only girl at school who kept a secret folio of naughty sketches buried beneath the obligatory watercolor landscapes. The only debutante at Almack\u2019s who mentally undressed unsuspecting gentlemen between dainty sips of ratafia. Surely none of the other young ladies in the Champions of Charity Junior Auxiliary lay abed at night with their shifts hiked to their waists, dreaming of pirates and highwaymen with coarse manners and rough, skillful hands. She was a perfect fraud. And no one saw the truth. Least of all the dear, deluded man who had wished to marry her.</p><p>Now she\u2019d done it. She\u2019d run away, in the most scandalous fashion imaginable, ensuring she could never return. Thanks to her farewell notes, by now half of London would be under the impression she\u2019d eloped with a French painting master named Gervais. Fabricated or no, her ruin was complete. No longer was Sophia the pretty ribbon adorning a twenty-thousand-pound dowry, a trinket to be bartered for connections and a title. At last, she\u2019d be her own person, free to pursue her true passion, experience real life.</p><p>Well. If she\u2019d wished to experience real life, she\u2019d gotten her wish indeed. A very real storm howled around her, the thunder rumbling in rebuke, as if the world had conspired to put her bravery to the test. She huddled into her cloak and took deep, slow breaths, as if by calming her inner tempest of emotions, she might tame the storm without. It didn\u2019t work, in either respect.</p><p>Gray seethed with anger.</p><p>Having been ordered belowdecks in such insulting fashion, he thundered his way down to the gentlemen\u2019s cabin. Once inside his tiny berth, he wrestled out of his coat. Between the cramped size of the room and the rolling of the ship, the experience was like tumbling a chambermaid in a closet, only far less pleasurable. One particularly impatient yank on his sleeve earned him bloodied knuckles when his fist banged the low ceiling. When he\u2019d ordered the Aphrodite converted to accommodate passengers, the builder had given him an option. Did he want four gentlemen\u2019s cabins, similar to the ladies\u2019? Or would he prefer to squeeze six smaller berths into the same space?</p><p>Gray\u2019s answer? Six, of course. No question about it. Two extra beds meant two extra fares. He hadn\u2019t dreamed he\u2019d one day occupy one of these cramped berths.</p><p>Six feet of angry man, lashed into a five-foot bunk, in the midst of a howling gale\u2014it wasn\u2019t a recipe for a good night\u2019s sleep. Gray craved the space and comfort of his former quarters aboard the Aphrodite\u2014the captain\u2019s cabin. But as his brother had so officiously pointed out, Gray wasn</p><p>\u2019t the captain of this ship anymore.</p><p>Throw his arse in the brig, had Joss threatened? Gray tossed indignantly, his chest straining against the ropes that held him in the child-sized bed. The ship\u2019s brig didn\u2019t sound so bad right now. He\u2019d put up with a few iron bars, the rancid bilgewater and rats, if it meant he could stretch his legs properly. Hell, this room was so damned small, he couldn\u2019t even get his blasted boots off.</p><p>He kicked the wall of his berth, no doubt scuffing the shine on his new Hessians. He hated the cursed things anyway. They pinched his feet. Why the devil he\u2019d thought it a brilliant notion to get all dandified for this voyage, Gray couldn\u2019t remember. Just who was he trying to impress? Stubb?</p><p>No, not Stubb.</p><p>Bel. It was all for Bel.</p><p>Gray couldn\u2019t forget the way she\u2019d looked at him when he\u2019d left last year. The disappointment welling in those big eyes, as dark and doleful as any medieval icon\u2019s. Hadn\u2019t she learned by then to stop expecting so damned much of him? He\u2019d never lived up to his little sister\u2019s ideal. He wasn\u2019t sure any man could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But now Gray could show her he\u2019d changed. As much as it was within his power to change, at any rate. He\u2019d given up the reckless, albeit far more entertaining, life of a privateer and become a successful tradesman. The owner of a shipping concern, with two new vessels in construction besides the Aphrodite, and investors lining up to back more. Able to offer her a home in London, a comfortable life, whatever else she might desire. Bel might have preferred he grow a conscience, rather than build a fortune. But Gray knew better than to waste his time. If a scoundrel like him had any hope of Heaven, it rested solely on the strength of Isabel Grayson\u2019s prayers.</p><p>Prayer wouldn\u2019t help him tonight. From Gray\u2019s experience, the best ward against seasickness was to turn one\u2019s mind to sin.</p><p>Surprising, then, that his thoughts drifted to Miss Turner. He thought he\u2019d outgrown admiring her sort, those delicate English roses. Give him an exotic orchid. A voluptuous woman with unbound hair and bold, dark eyes, who knew what she was about. Girlish blushes, demure smiles\u2014they\u2019d lost their allure for Gray years ago.</p> <p>But still he thought of her. He could no more rid his mind of her than command the storm to cease. Tossing fitfully in his bunk, he recalled her near-breakable beauty, her delicate scent. And the feel of her body pressed against his for those few seconds in the rowboat. Not just the enticing sensation of her soft, pillowy breasts flattening against his chest, but beneath them, a pulse racing like a bird\u2019s, pounding against his torso through all those layers of womanly flesh and wool. As if something caged inside her was clamoring for escape. Begging him to set it free. It was then he discovered an unhappy consequence to all his tossing and turning. One of the ropes binding him to his bed had drifted south\u2014and now cinched his body at a most unfortunate latitude.</p><p>Damn it to hell.</p><p>He undid the ropes and wrestled out of the bed. What the devil was happening to him? His little brother had him confined to his cabin. A prim governess had him tied in knots. And worst\u2014he\u2019d been off the sea so long, he was losing his instincts. Joss had been right; the storm was growing violent.</p><p>Arms braced against either side of the corridor, Gray made his way from the gentlemen\u2019s cabin to the companionway. He needed to see the storm for himself, judge how the ship\u2019s new rigging and spars were weathering the gale.</p><p>But when he reached the stairs, his plans changed. There was a girl in his way.</p> <p>Miss Turner stood perched on the third rung of the ladder, straining on tiptoe to peek through the half-open hatch. Had Gray been the superstitious sort, he might have thought her a ghost. Her fingers were white, delicate webs where she clutched the handle of the hatch with one hand and the ladder with the other. Flashes of luminous beauty alternated with darkness. Each fork of lightning illuminated her finely wrought features and the droplets of spray clinging to her hair and eyelashes.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t a ghost. But she was a vision just the same.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner,\u201d he said, bracing one shoulder against the wall. She didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>Gray cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cMiss Turner.\u201d</p><p>Now she startled, nearly losing her grip on the ladder. \u201cMr. Grayson. I ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice caught, and she dabbed her face with her sleeve. \u201cI wanted to see the storm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how do you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWet.\u201d</p><p>Gray chuckled, surprised.</p><p>\u201cAnd beautiful,\u201d she continued, as another bolt of lightning threw her features into relief. \u201cOut here on the water, with no solid land beneath\u2014it\u2019s so different. As though there\u2019s no boundary between sky and sea, and we\u2019re simply at Nature\u2019s mercy. It\u2019s so wild and gothic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, precisely.\u201d Another bright flash revealed the curve of a smile. Gray frowned. What was she doing, smiling at him in a storm? Sending electric pulses through his blood with each glimpse of her pale, haunting beauty? She ought to be huddled in her bunk, fearing for her life. He crossed the small space in one stride, gripping the ladder with one hand and offering her the other, to assist her descent. \u201cWise passengers wait out a storm in their berths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d she whispered, taking his hand. \u201cWhat does that make us, then?\u201d</p><p>Now this, this was danger. He didn\u2019t miss the coy lilt in her voice, nor the tremor of her rain-dampened shoulders, an unconscious shiver that all but begged for his embrace. No, she didn\u2019t even realize the invitation she\u2019d made, but the signs were unmistakable to Gray. He\u2019d seen this reaction, many times before, and he knew better than to be flattered by it. It was nothing more than instinct.</p> <p>Any port in a storm.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make us anything,\u201d he said, helping her down. The feel of her chilled, slender fingers in his triggered all manner of instincts. \u201cIt makes me a concerned investor. And it makes you a girl with an overactive imagination. Go back to your berth.\u201d</p><p>The lightning had ceased, but her eyes sparked with a fire all their own.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not safe here.\u201d He wrenched open the door to the ladies\u2019 cabin and waved her through it. \u201cGo to bed, Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>Yes, go to bed, he thought, as she wordlessly swept through the door and he drew it shut behind her. Go to your bed, before I sweep you off tomine.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Sophia woke with a start, alone and disoriented in the dark. Her pulse responded first, pumping panic through her veins at a furious rate. She pressed her hand to her heart, and her fingers curled around her purse. Awareness returned in a dizzy rush.</p><p>A faint silvery glow leaked under the door of her berth. It was morning. And if it was morning, that must mean she\u2019d survived the night. She turned onto her side. Every muscle screamed with pain. Her skirt and cloak were still heavy with damp, resisting her feeble attempts to rise. Perhaps she didn\u2019t need to move, after all.</p><p>Oh, but she did. She drew a deep breath, then wished she could spit it out. The air was thick with humidity and rank with the odors of sickness and bilge. She slid from her bunk, ignoring the protestations of her aching limbs, and flung open the door of her berth.</p><p>She lunged for the staircase, scrambling up on her hands and knees. A salty breeze nipped at her ears as she emerged headfirst into the gray dawn. She inhaled a deep, bracing breath of fresh air. The thought of returning below held no appeal whatsoever. Yet neither could she remain like this, head and neck protruding from a hole in the deck, like some species of seafaring marmot.</p><p>She climbed abovedecks and struggled into an upright position, planting her feet in a wide stance to buffer the ship\u2019s rolling. Sophia closed her eyes. Either the ship was caught in a whirl pool, or her head was spinning like a top. She looked toward the nearest rail\u2014only five paces away, perhaps six. Beyond it, the English coastline appeared to teeter on a fulcrum. She bowed her head, focused her gaze on the deck beneath her, and took one step. Two.</p><p>Then the deck pitched suddenly, and her locked knees buckled. She was falling, spinning, out of control.</p><p>She was caught.</p><p>\u201cSteady there.\u201d Two large hands gripped her elbows. Her fingers instinctively closed over two strong arms. Sophia barely had time to register the feel of superfine wool and hard muscle beneath her fingertips, a brief instant to catch a glimpse of two gray-green eyes.</p><p>And then she vomited all over two slightly scuffed, tassel-topped Hessians.</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d She coughed and sputtered. Mr. Grayson\u2019s iron grip on her elbows refused to relax, preventing her from turning away. \u201cSir ... Release me, I beg you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. You\u2019re not steady on your feet. This way, then.\u201d He guided her sideways, nudging her to take small steps and twirl slightly right</p><p>\u2014the most mortifying waltz Sophia had ever endured. He backed her against a small crate. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, sinking onto the rough wooden slats gratefully. Still holding her fast by the elbows, he crouched before her. She could not bear to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll come back presently.\u201d</p><p>Oh, please don\u2019t. Sophia cringed as his soiled boots carried him away. The instant his footsteps faded, she pulled a handkerchief from her cloak and wiped her brow. She willed her head to stop spinning, so she could rise to her feet unaided and make her escape. But he was too fast for her. Within the space of two minutes, he was back, boots rinsed\u2014with seawater, she supposed\u2014and steaming tankard in hand.</p><p>\u201cDrink this.\u201d He wrapped her trembling hands around the tankard. Delicious warmth prickled through her chilled fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea, with treacle and lemon. And a touch of rum.\u201d When she merely stared at the drink, he added, \u201cDrink it. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>Sophia raised the mug to her lips and sipped carefully. Fragrant steam warmed her from the inside out. The syrupy sweetness coated her throat, masking the bitter taste of bile. She sipped again. \u201cThank you,\u201d she finally managed, keeping her eyes trained on the liquid sloshing in the tankard. \u201cI\u2019m ... I\u2019m sorry about your boots.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou should be sorry.\u201d He crouched beside her. Sophia stubbornly stared into her tankard. \u201cI despise these boots,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019d just been contemplating yanking them off my feet and tossing them overboard. But now it seems I\u2019ll have to keep them.\u201d Surprise tugged her gaze up to his. He grinned. \u201cFor sentimental reasons.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, she told herself. Don\u2019t smile back.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u201cMr. Grayson ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d His elbow nudged her thigh. An accident? He did not apologize.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I believe you can call me Gray.\u201d</p><p>His gaze sparked\u2014a hint of silver flashing in murky green\u2014and Sophia became suddenly, painfully aware of the picture she must present. Soiled, wrinkled dress still damp at the hem, flax-colored hair teased loose from its pins. The pale, wan complexion of illness.</p><p>And yet ...</p><p>His eyes did not merely skim her surface. Instead, they focused some distance beneath her stained garments, plumbing the depths of her appearance in a most disconcerting way.</p><p>Despite the chill, a light sheen of perspiration bloomed over her thighs.</p><p>\u201cMr. Grayson. I thank you for the tea.\u201d Sophia shifted the tankard to one hand and shook out the handkerchief she\u2019d kept in her palm. A sudden puff of wind wrenched it from her grasp.</p><p>His hand darted out, and he caught the fluttering scrap of white effortlessly, as though it were a dove trained to fly to his hand. Sophia reached for it. \u201cOnce again, I thank you.\u201d</p><p>He whisked it out of her grasp. \u201cSave your thanks. I haven\u2019t given it back.\u201d</p><p>He fingered the eyelet trim. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll decide to keep it. For sentimental reasons.\u201d</p><p>It came to her so easily, the flirtatious response. He had only to look at her, and her caution collapsed in the flick of a fan. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tease, Mr. Grayson. It isn\u2019t at all charitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019m a tradesman. I\u2019m interested in profit, not charity. And I asked you to call me Gray.\u201d He leaned closer, and now\u2014at this diminished distance\u2014Sophia would have sworn his eyes were not green at all, but a pale blue.</p><p>Piercing blue.</p><p>\u201cYou have money, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry. He knew. From the handkerchief? It must be too fine, too embellished. Obviously it belonged to a lady of wealth. Curse it. If only Sophia had had more time to plan her escape, she would have managed a better disguise. It had been difficult enough to leave her painstakingly selected trousseau behind and take only her everyday linens.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had time to assemble a coarser wardrobe, nor even any notion of where the poorer classes shopped.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Her fingers tightened around the rapidly cooling tankard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMoney. You do have money, don\u2019t you? You never paid your fare yesterday. It\u2019s six pounds, eight. If you haven\u2019t the coin, I\u2019ll have no choice but to hold you for ransom once we reach Tortola.\u201d</p><p>Her fare. Sophia sipped her tea with relief. If Mr. Grayson was this concerned over six pounds, he surely had no idea he was harboring a runaway heiress with nearly one hundred times that amount strapped beneath her stays. She suppressed a nervous laugh. \u201cYes, of course I can pay my passage. You\u2019ll have your money today, Mr. Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Grayson,\u201d she said, her voice and nerves growing thin, \u201cI scarcely think that my moment of ... of indisposition gives you leave to make such an intimate request, that I address you by your Christian name. I certainly shall not.\u201d</p><p>He clucked softly, wrapping the handkerchief around his fingers. With hypnotic tenderness, he reached out, drawing the fabric across her temple.</p><p>\u201cNow, sweetheart\u2014surely my parents can be credited with greater imagination than you imply. Christening me \u2018Gray Grayson\u2019?\u201d He chuckled low in his throat. \u201cEveryone aboard this ship calls me Gray. Sorry to disappoint you, but it\u2019s no particular privilege. There\u2019s but one woman on earth permitted to address me by my Christian name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>He grinned again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cOh, now don\u2019t look so disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>Sophia slanted her gaze to her lap, cursing herself for playing into his charm. If the sight of him drove the wits from her skull, the solution was plain. She mustn\u2019t look.</p><p>But then he pressed the handkerchief into her hand, covering her fingers with his own, and Sophia could not retrieve the small, defeated sigh that fell from her lips. His touch devastated her resolve completely. His hand was like the rest of him. Brute strength, neatly groomed. She heartily wished she</p><p>\u2019d thought to put on gloves.</p><p>He leaned closer, his scent intruding through the pervasive smell of seawater\u2014wholly masculine and faintly spicy, like pomade and rum.</p> <p>\u201cAnd sweetheart, if I did make an intimate request of you\u201d\u2014his thumb swept boldly over the delicate skin of her wrist\u2014\u201cyou\u2019d know it.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sucked in her breath.</p><p>\u201cSo call me Gray.\u201d He released her hand abruptly.</p><p>Disappointment\u2014unbidden, imprudent, unthinkable emotion\u2014cinched in Sophia\u2019s chest. Distance from this man was precisely what she wished. Well, if not precisely what she wished, it was exactly what she needed. He looked at her as though he\u2019d laid all her secrets bare, and her body as well. She pushed the tankard back at him, leaving him no choice but to take it from her hands. \u201cI shall continue to address you as propriety demands, Mr. Grayson.\u201d She cast him a sharp look. \u201cAnd you certainly are not at liberty to call me \u2018sweetheart.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He donned an expression of wide-eyed innocence. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what it stands for, then?\u201d Teasing the handkerchief from her clenched fist, he ran his thumb over the embroidered monogram.</p><p>S.H.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d He traced each letter with the pad of his finger. \u201cSweet. Heart. I thought surely that must be it. Because I know your name is Jane Turner.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in that insolent grin. \u201cUnless ... don\u2019t tell me. It was a gift?\u201d</p> <p>At least this time she made it to the rail.</p><p>And there Sophia clung, until she was certain she must be casting up remnants of Michaelmas dinner. Until the heavy footfalls of those soiled boots told her that he\u2019d left.</p><p>Back in her berth, she dipped a clean, unembroidered handkerchief into a basin of fresh water. Stripped down to her drawers and stockings, she sponged the icy water over her neck and face, then between her breasts and under her arms. After toweling dry, she dusted her body with scented rice powder.</p><p>She still felt filthy.</p><p>With trembling fingers, she restrapped the heavy bundle around her ribs. She tugged a clean chemise over her head and cinched up her stays. She still felt exposed.</p><p>She brushed out her hair with sharp yanks, as if to punish the feeble mind beneath the tingling scalp. Of all the times and places to go distracted over a man! During her Season, she\u2019d been courted by no fewer than nine of the ton\u2019s most eligible bachelors. No dukes or earls among them, to her parents\u2019 dismay, but she had become engaged to the most coveted catch of the ton\u2014the supremely charming Sir Toby Aldridge. And never, not once, in all those waltzes and garden strolls and coy conversations, had Sophia\u2019s perfect composure been shaken. She knew how to manage attractive men; or rather, she knew how to manage herself around them. She knew nothing. She was an idiot, an imbecile, a simpleton, and a ninny. Boarding a ship under an assumed name, then whipping a monogrammed handkerchief from her cloak?</p><p>Sophia yanked and twisted her hair into a severe style, then stabbed the coiled knot with several hairpins.</p><p>Foolish, foolish girl. If Mr. Grayson learned about that money, he would know her instantly for a fraud. He could take her purse away, or hold her captive in hopes of extorting more. Worse, he could turn out to be a gentleman after all, and simply return her to her family. Be calm, she bade herself, taking a deep breath. Considering his friendship with the Walthams, Mr. Grayson was bound to discover her deceit eventually. But by the time the ship reached Tortola, she would be just weeks from her twenty-first birthday. Just weeks away from freedom. If Mr. Grayson possessed some shred of gentlemanly honor that might compel him to return a ruined debutante to England\u2014and Sophia doubted he did\u2014it would already be too late. By then, her trust and her future would belong to her alone.</p><p>Her anxiety somewhat allayed, Sophia reached for her dress. It pained her to put on the same wrinkled gown, but she had no choice. Her trunk accommodated only four dresses in addition to the one she wore. Two were last summer\u2019s muslin frocks, to wear once they reached the tropics. The third was not a dress at all, but rather a smock for painting, and the fourth ... the fourth was pure folly.</p><p>Once dressed, she turned her attention to the smaller trunk, which held her dearest treasures. Paints, charcoal, pastels, palette, brushes\u2014and one hundred sheets of heavy paper, divided into two parcels, each wrapped tightly in oilcloth. One hundred sheets to ration over a month, perhaps longer.</p><p>Although she might have allowed herself three, Sophia withdrew only two sheets of paper. She gathered up a small drawing board and a stub of charcoal before neatly repacking her artist\u2019s cache. As she replaced the oilcloth packet, her hand brushed against the worn leather cover of a small book. Smiling, she lifted the volume to the top of the trunk. The Book.</p><p>Given to her by her friend Lucy Waltham, now the Countess of Kendall, this tiny volume had proved an invaluable source of both information and inspiration. The Memoirs of a Wanton Dairymaid, the title read. Its contents were, as one might expect, ribald accounts of a dairymaid\u2019s trysts with her gentleman employer. As a whole, Sophia had found The Book shocking, titillating, and woefully lacking in illustrations. This last, she had set out to remedy.</p><p>She flipped through the first half of the book, now painstakingly embellished with pen-and-ink sketches of the wanton dairymaid and her gent in various states of undress. She had planned to return it to Lucy when she finished, but now ... A pang of loneliness pinched in her chest. Even if she did see Lucy again, her friend would be forced to cut her. A countess didn\u2019t consort with fallen women.</p><p>A sudden image sprang to her mind. A frenzy of colors, textures, tastes... Snow-white petticoats bunched at her waist. Straw strewn on a stable floor. The warm gush of an overturned pail of milk. Miles of smooth, bronzed skin. The taste of salt on her tongue and the scrape of rough whiskers against her neck.</p><p>She threw the book back in her trunk and shut it quickly. Irrepressible dreamer she might be, but Sophia was not a wanton dairymaid. And Mr. Grayson, as he was so fond of reminding her, was no gentleman. The air inside the cabin had grown uncomfortably close. She needed to clear her mind. She needed to draw. To gather all this diffuse, unruly sensation within her and force it through the tip of her pencil, onto paper where it could be caged by four margins. Safe. She tucked charcoal and paper under her arm and mounted the ladder, intending to sketch on deck. The instant her head emerged through the hatch, however, Sophia\u2019s plans changed.</p><p>She found herself face-to-face with a goat.</p><p>With a rude bleat, the goat snatched a sheet of paper from her grasp and crumpled it between its jaws. Sophia watched in confounded outrage as the goat casually masticated and swallowed her precious parchment. When the animal extended its long, narrow tongue in every indication of lunching on her second sheet, Sophia startled into action. She grabbed her drawing board with both hands and smacked the impertinent animal on the nose.</p><p>\u201cEasy there, sweetheart.\u201d Mr. Grayson\u2019s deep voice carried from somewhere above. \u201cThat\u2019s my investment you\u2019re bludgeoning.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stared at the goat. She paused a half-second to imagine Mr. Grayson\u2019s handsome features superimposed on that furry, blunt-nosed visage. Then she whacked it over the head again.</p><p>My, but that felt good.</p><p>Evidently, the goat did not agree. It grasped the corner of Sophia\u2019s board with its teeth and pulled. Sophia tugged back with all her strength. She lost her footing on the stair and tumbled backward into the cabin. The goat fell with her. Or rather, the goat fell on top of her.</p><p>Drat.</p><p>Bleating indignantly, the goat scrambled to its feet, its forelegs and hindlegs on either side of Sophia\u2019s midsection. Sophia struggled to raise herself up on her elbows. Her serge skirt had flipped up, exposing her stockings. The powerful stench of farm animal smothered her like a goat-hide blanket. Two pendulous teats dangled before her eyes, swaying gently with every motion of the ship.</p><p>\u201cWell, well.\u201d Mr. Grayson\u2019s teasing tone carried down the staircase. The remaining sheet of paper fluttered to a rest near Sophia\u2019s elbow. The goat ingested it with alacrity. \u201cThis is a very pretty picture. What a fetching dairymaid you make, Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>\u201cGoats.\u201d Joss swore. \u201cWhy did it have to be goats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have empty space on a merchant vessel.\u201d Gray tore his gaze from the rustic tableau belowdecks. Now there was an image that would haunt his dreams. The girl already owed him one night\u2019s rest. \u201cSpace wasted is money lost. And we\u2019ll have fresh milk all the way to Tortola. You\u2019ll be thanking me soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you purchased them, did you pause to consider just where we</p><p>\u2019d house the bloody beasts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be disparaging, Joss.\u201d Gray tugged the ear of the brown-and-white nanny. \u201cThese bloody beasts are from Hampshire\u2019s finest stock. They\u2019ll fetch a good price. And I thought they\u2019d stay put in the hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently, you thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have chewed through their ropes last night.\u201d Gray paused, considering. \u201cWe\u2019ll put them in the gentlemen\u2019s cabin. Damned berths are too small for human habitation anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Joss tapped the toe of his boot against the deck. \u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019re going to look after them there? Clean up after them? Milk them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. Stubb and Gabriel can share the milking. As for the tending ... That green hand of yours is fresh off the farm, isn\u2019t he? Ah, there he is.\u201d He whistled through his teeth. \u201cBoy!\u201d</p><p>A pale-faced youth trotted across the deck, a thick coil of rope threaded over his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavy Linnet, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, Davy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome from the farm, have you?\u201d</p><p>The lad shifted his feet. He regarded the goats warily. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I suppose you know how to tend a goat.\u201d</p><p>The boy hesitated, looking toward Joss.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cDo you know a goat\u2019s teat from her tail, or don\u2019t you?\u201d When the boy still paused, he added, \u201cSpeak up now, or I\u2019ll ask you the same about girls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tended goats, sir. It\u2019s just ... I wasn\u2019t expecting to tend them at sea. I rather thought I was finished with that.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cA man can\u2019t shake his past, Davy. And don\u2019t I know it. Take them down to the gentlemen\u2019s cabin, then. One to a berth.\u201d He raised his voice and spoke in the direction of the hatch. \u201cAnd rescue Miss Turner from that animal under her skirts.\u201d</p><p>Davy stowed his coil of rope and grabbed a cannon rammer from the rack at the ship\u2019s rail. He prodded one goat\u2019s flank with the blunt end. \u201cGet along, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if the goats are in the gentlemen\u2019s cabin,\u201d Joss asked, turning toward the helm, \u201cwhere do you intend to sleep? Not curled up with your flock, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s always the la\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ladies\u2019 cabin?\u201d Joss stopped. His eyes narrowed. \u201cThink again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose the for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think about bunking in the forecastle. I\u2019ll not have you in there carousing with the crew, undermining my authority.\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cThen that leaves steerage, it would seem. I\u2019m certain Davy can spare some room for me amongst the barrels.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI own the damn ship, and I\u2019ll be bedding down in steerage with the green hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look to me for sympathy,\u201d Joss said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want your bloody goats. Or their milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll drink their milk. You\u2019ll drink it, and you\u2019ll thank me for it.\u201d Gray teetered on the brink of anger, and his brother\u2019s smirk pushed him over the edge. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019ve taken on risks for this business, Joss. I\u2019ve made sacrifices. All so the family ... so you can reap the benefits. I wish you\u2019d cease throwing them back in my face.\u201d</p> <p>Gray knew instantly he\u2019d gone too far. Lately, conversing with Joss was like swimming through shark-infested waters. And the steely glint in his brother\u2019s eye signaled an imminent attack.</p><p>\u201cYou. Want to tell me. About sacrifices.\u201d Joss took a step toward him, his voice rough. \u201cI reap the benefits, do I? My family reaped the sugarcane that paid for this ship. They lived and died for it. And you may own the damn ship, but you don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>Damn it to hell. Whenever Gray thought they\u2019d finally moved past the inequity of their births, he found himself quite rudely corrected. It wasn\u2019t as though Gray could change the fact that he\u2019d been the first born, legitimate son. As the younger brother, Joss would never have had the same opportunities as Gray, whether he\u2019d been born of a mistress, a wife, or in this case, a slave.</p><p>\u201cJoss, that\u2019s unfair. You know the fact we\u2019re of different mothers didn\u2019t matter to our father. It\u2019s never mattered to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters to some. I\u2019ve the scars to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Joss studied the mainmast towering above them. \u201cGo bugger one of your goats, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring Gray entirely, Joss turned to his second mate. \u201cMr. Wiggins!</p><p>Summon all hands. Prepare to weigh anchor.\u201d</p><p>Gray walked away. There wasn\u2019t anything more he could say. At least, there wasn\u2019t anything more he knew how to say. He\u2019d just have to keep quiet, he supposed. Keep quiet, and look after the money. There wasn\u2019t any way he could change the past and little enough he knew to do in the present. He\u2019d never had any talent for morality\u2014that, he gladly left to Bel. But if he looked after the money, everything else would fall into place. Even the goats.</p><p>\u201cSir, you owe me a debt.\u201d</p><p>Sophia dodged Mr. Grayson\u2019s elbow as he wheeled to face her. She had him right where she wanted him. With the mast directly behind him, and rigging to either side, he had nowhere to escape.</p><p>\u201cMr. Grayson.\u201d She took a deep breath and clenched one hand into a fist at her side. The other hand she raised into the space between them, brandishing a sheet of clean parchment. \u201cYou\u2014and your goat\u2014owe me two leaves of high-quality paper. Heavy stock, free of markings. I expect restitution.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed one palm along his jaw, then slid it back to cup his neck. \u201c</p><p>\u201cPaper?\u201d One eyebrow arched as he took in her disheveled appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all worked up over a few sheets of paper?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly self-conscious under his gaze, Sophia smoothed a lock of hair behind her ear. After the theft of her paper and the humiliation of landing in a farmyard tangle, she had relied upon her indignation to shield her from Mr. Grayson\u2019s charms. Perhaps she had overestimated the protective quality of pique.</p><p>Although she still wore the same bedraggled garment she\u2019d been wearing since the moment of their introduction, he\u2019d changed his attire. His tailored navy-blue topcoat and buff trousers were the height of fashion. His unruly waves of hair had been tamed with a touch of pomade, and the light growth of beard only increased his roguish good looks. The sole defect in his appearance remained the scuffed boots, which had now suffered all manner of abuse, from saltwater to sickness.</p><p>He looked unforgivably handsome. The sheet of paper crumpled in Sophia\u2019s grip. Drat him, now he owed her three.</p><p>\u201cPaper,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, paper. It may be just \u2018a few sheets of paper\u2019 to you, but to me, it\u2019s... well, it\u2019s paper.\u201d Sophia was painfully aware of how idiotic she sounded.</p><p>\u201cI have a very limited supply, you see, and it\u2019s simply too dear to be wasted on livestock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His brows knit together as he stared at the sheet in her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Sophia felt tears pricking the corners of her eyes. Of all the absurd occasions to cry. She\u2019d told herself she could leave everything else behind\u2014her family, her friends, her belongings\u2014so long as she had her art. Only now she found herself missing everything else a bit more than she\u2019d planned, and to have her creative outlet threatened by this, this beast</p><p>\u2014not to mention his goat ... She sniffed fiercely. \u201cOf course, you don\u2019t see. How could you? You\u2019re thinking it\u2019s just a bit of paper, but it isn\u2019t at all. It\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s paper.\u201d</p><p>Blinking back her tears, Sophia turned to stare resolutely at the horizon.</p><p>\u201cYes, precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, sweetheart, where\u2019s that lacy little handkerchief when you need it?\u201d</p><p>After a furtive swipe at her eyes, Sophia crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cHo there, boy!\u201d A sharp voice cut through their conversation. \u201cGo aloft and set the fore royal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Mr. Brackett.\u201d</p><p>A youth about Sophia\u2019s height hurried between them and paused at the base of the rigging. She recognized him as the boy who\u2019d removed the unwelcome goat from her cabin.</p><p>\u201cFirst time then, Davy?\u201d Mr. Grayson asked.</p><p>The youth swallowed audibly. \u201cFirst time at sea, sir.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cJust take your time. The royal\u2019s not nearly so tricky as the topgallant\u2014it\u2019s higher, but there\u2019s no need to go out on the yardarm. Stick to the rigging. Keep your feet on the ropes and your eyes on your hands, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>The lad nodded. He mounted a part of the rigging that formed a tarred, narrow ladder and began to climb, his face grim. Sophia watched, breathless, as he quickly gained the first of the perpendicular beams that held each of the Aphrodite\u2019s square-rigged sails. There, some twenty feet above the deck, he reached a sort of railing that surrounded the mast, where he paused before resuming his climb.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Davy,\u201d Mr. Grayson called. \u201cLook lively, then.\u201d</p><p>The boy moved on to a new set of tiered ropes and resumed climbing.</p><p>\u201cHow far up does he have to go?\u201d Sophia cupped a hand over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTo the royal yard.\u201d Mr. Grayson met her puzzled expression. \u201cAll the way.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back and let her gaze follow the mast skyward. She couldn\u2019t discern whether she actually glimpsed the top, or whether the towering column simply faded into the distance. The prospect was dizzying.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s so high!\u201d She blinked up at the mast again. \u201cAnd on his second day at sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. If he\u2019s to be a sailor, he must become accustomed to the feel of the rigging and the motion of the ship. The officers do him no favors if they coddle him at the outset.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked up again. Davy had reached the next yard. He paused there for some moments, clinging to the rigging. He was only halfway to the top of the mast, yet so high she could no longer distinguish the features of his face. The mast swayed back and forth with each pitch of the ship.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he falls?\u201d she asked, swallowing hard.</p><p>Mr. Grayson shrugged. \u201cFrom where he\u2019s at now? He\u2019d be a mite banged up, but he\u2019d live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the royal yard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then he\u2019d likely die. Whether he hit the deck or the sea, it wouldn\u2019t much matter. But don\u2019t worry, sweetheart. He won\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Davy\u2019s boot slipped in its foothold. The boy caught himself quickly, but not before Sophia gasped and clapped a hand to her mouth. The sheet of crumpled paper fell from her grasp. It never hit the deck. Mr. Grayson snagged it easily between his first finger and thumb. He smoothed the sheet against his embroidered waistcoat before handing it back.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want to waste another sheet of paper,\u201d he said with a slight smile. \u201cBut you see, sweetheart\u2014we sailors catch on quickly. A sailor with slow reflexes is a dead sailor.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked back up to the rigging. She and Mr. Grayson weren\u2019t the only ones watching Davy\u2019s progress. From the mainmast, bow, helm\u2014all eyes were fixed on the boy. The crewmen watched his ascent with great interest and whispered speculation, as though it were a horse race or a prizefight.</p><p>When Davy reached the next yard, a clamor of approval rose up from the deck. \u201cThat\u2019s the topgallant now, boy,\u201d a burly sailor called out. \u201cAlmost home!\u201d</p><p>When the boy hesitated, clinging to the mast, Mr. Grayson cupped his hands around his mouth. \u201cGet on with it then, Davy! The goats are getting lonesome!\u201d</p><p>The youth began the last, most perilous section of his climb. Sophia could not bear to watch any longer. She focused on the planks beneath her feet instead, and then\u2014when the suspense became too great to tolerate\u2014she let her gaze slide to Mr. Grayson\u2019s hand where it hung at his side. Sophia kept her eyes trained on that hand\u2014the strong, sculpted fingers, the palm ridged with callus. With that hand, he\u2019d caught her handkerchief, the paper, and Sophia herself on more than one occasion. If Davy stumbled, surely that hand would reflexively move to catch him. She stared at his hand because she knew\u2014so long as it dangled loose at Mr. Grayson\u2019s side, the boy was safe.</p><p>She was safe.</p><p>Oh, no. Where had that thought come from? An absurdity, that. He was dangerous, Sophia reminded herself. He could expose her deceits and force her back to a miserable existence, and she, who could recite falsehoods effortlessly to dukes and doormen alike, lost all power to dissemble whenever he drew near. And yet, despite all this\u2014or perhaps because of it?\u2014standing in his broad shadow, Sophia began to feel strangely safe. Protected.</p><p>She shook herself. It would seem seasickness or Mr. Grayson\u2019s teasing, or most likely both, had rendered her completely nonsensical. Logic demanded she flee to the cabin that instant and remove herself from the influence of that potent, self-assured charm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, she inched closer.</p><p>He felt it, her sudden nearness. A warm, feminine propinquity that drew his every nerve to attention. He didn\u2019t need to look.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t need to, but he did.</p><p>God, she truly was exquisite.</p><p>Even his grief-blinded brother had called her beautiful, but that word wasn</p><p>\u2019t quite enough. There was a rightness to her face somehow, a quality that resonated in his bones. Like the clear ring of fine crystal clinked in celebration, or the echo of a whisper in a cathedral.</p><p>Exquisite.</p> <p>A raucous cheer announced young Davy\u2019s success, and Gray looked up to the royal yard to see the square sail unfurling high above, like a handkerchief.</p><p>The loud clanging of the bell cut through the crew\u2019s whoops and whistles. Mr. Brackett stood on the raised deck toward the ship\u2019s stern, his expression forbidding. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a circus, you louts! All hands back to work!\u201d</p><p>The sailors returned to their duties, grumbling among themselves. If Gray couldn\u2019t fault the officer for chasing the sailors back to work, at least he could make up for their absence by congratulating young Davy heartily on his descent.</p><p>\u201cWell done, boy.\u201d He clapped a hand on the youth\u2019s trembling shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in the forecastle with the sailors soon enough. Perhaps by the time we cross the Tropic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d The boy wiped his brow with his sleeve.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m going to be sick, sir.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed and stepped back quickly. \u201cJust do me a favor, boy. Spare my boots a second baptism.\u201d</p><p>Stifling a nervous giggle, Miss Turner gave the boy a warm smile. \u201cYou\u2019re very brave, Mr. Linnet.\u201d</p><p>Gray observed the blanched, tight skin over her knuckles where she gripped the edges of her cloak. He knew she\u2019d been sick with worry for the boy. Even now, she was struggling to mask her true emotions behind that gracious smile\u2014because she understood, as Gray did, how important it was for Davy\u2019s confidence, that he never see her fear.</p><p>But Gray saw it. He\u2019d felt it, as she\u2019d inched closer to him. Even now, she stood so close that their shadows bled together on the deck. Her vulnerability disarmed him, somehow; and that smile had him envying a fifteen-year-old green hand like he\u2019d never envied a prince. Gray was seized by the absurd notion to climb the mast himself, just to bask in that warm approbation.</p><p>Davy lurched off toward the rail, and Gray laid a hand at the base of Miss Turner\u2019s spine, turning her in the opposite direction. That lovely smile aside, she didn\u2019t look too well herself. With a light yet firm touch, he ushered her up the steps onto the elevated deck at the helm. She made no protest. Damn, but she fit so perfectly under his palm. Gray imagined his hand could nearly span the width of her waist. He tested the idea, fanning his fingers over the small of her back. She shivered under his touch, but did not pull away.</p><p>In fact, she seemed to shrink closer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cThe lad came through it admirably. So did you.\u201d</p><p>She wheeled to face him, those heavy woolen skirts swirling about his legs. A strange swell of protectiveness rose in his chest. Driven by some impulse he could no better understand than he could deny, Gray lifted her hand to his lips, pressing a warm kiss to her fingers.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhat were we discussing?\u201d For the life of him, he couldn\u2019t hold a thought in his head.</p><p>\u201cPaper. You ... you still owe me two sheets of paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still owe me six pounds, eight shillings,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNot to mention a new pair of boots. So I think you\u2019re rather ahead.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, Gray was losing ground fast. Those lovely eyes, her whisper-soft skin, the sweet scent that only grew more potent as the warmth between them built ... If they stood like this much longer, he wouldn\u2019t give tuppence for anything but gathering her in his arms, covering her lips with his, and ravaging that pert blossom of a mouth.</p><p>No, no. What was he thinking? One didn\u2019t ravage an English rose of a governess. This was a girl who\u2019d expect to be kissed sweetly. Chastely. Tenderly.</p><p>Hell. The word \u201cchaste\u201d wasn\u2019t even in his vocabulary. And Gray didn\u2019t do anything tenderly.</p><p>\u201cSweet, I hate to break it to you. But no matter how many sheets of paper you fill with letters home\u2014there\u2019s no mail coach stopping by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not for letters. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d She looked up at him again, those big eyes searching his. There was a story behind that desperate gaze. One that wouldn\u2019t fit on two sheets of paper, nor even two hundred, he supposed.</p><p>He squeezed her hand. Go on, some fool part of him urged. Tell meeverything.</p><p>She never had a chance.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Miss Turner.\u201d Joss stood at Gray\u2019s shoulder, looking as though someone had mixed bilge-water into his tea. \u201cI need a word with my brother, if I may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, Captain. Mr. Grayson was just ... explaining the workings of the ship.\u201d She attempted to tug her hand from Gray\u2019s grasp, shooting him a pained look when he refused to relinquish his prize. Gray said smoothly, \u201cActually, we were discussing debts. Miss Turner still owes me her fare, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you, you\u2019ll have it today.\u201d Beneath that abomination of a skirt wrapped about his leg, she planted her heel atop his booted toe and transferred all her weight onto it. Firmly. Once again, Gray regretted trading his old, sturdy boots for these foppish monstrosities. Her little pointed heel bit straight through the thin leather.</p><p>With a tight grimace, Gray released her hand. He\u2019d been about to say, and I have her handkerchief to return. But just for that, he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, then.\u201d A sweet smile graced her face as she stomped down on his foot again, harder. Then she turned and flounced away. He made an amused face at Joss. \u201cI think she likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my cabin, Gray.\u201d</p><p>Gray gritted his teeth and followed Joss down the hatch. Whether he liked being Gray\u2019s half brother or not, Joss was damn lucky right now that he was.</p><p>Gray wouldn\u2019t have suffered that supercilious command for any bond weaker than blood.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your word, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I? And what word was that?\u201d</p><p>Joss tossed his hat on the wood-framed bed and stripped off his greatcoat with agitated movements. \u201cYou know damn well what I mean. You said you wouldn\u2019t pursue Miss Turner. Now you\u2019re kissing her hand and making a spectacle in front of the whole ship. Bailey\u2019s already taking bets from the sailors as to how many days it\u2019ll take you to bed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gray rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI hope he\u2019s giving even odds on three. Two, if you\u2019ll send young Davy up the mast again. That got her quite excited.\u201d</p><p>Joss glared at him. \u201cNeed I remind you that this was your idea? You wanted a respectable merchant vessel. I\u2019m trying to command it as such, but that\u2019ll be a bit difficult if you intend to stage a bawdy-house revue on deck every forenoon.\u201d</p><p>Gray smiled as Joss slung himself into the captain\u2019s chair. \u201cBe careful, Joss. I do believe you nearly made a joke. People might get the idea you have a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything humorous about this. This isn\u2019t a pleasure cruise around the Mediterranean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Gray paced toward the windows spanning the ship\u2019s stern. \u201cBelieve me, I know perfectly well what\u2019s at stake here. They\u2019re my stakes, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Joss made a dismissive snort. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to remind me whose money it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s my money and my ship, but I\u2019ve entrusted them both to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you haven\u2019t. You\u2019re ordering my crew around, questioning my decisions ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what this is about. The storm yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe storm, the goats, Bains, the girl. You\u2019ve countermanded me at every turn, and we\u2019re only a day out from land. I\u2019m telling you, if you want a captain who thinks only of profit, with no regard for the comfort and safety of people aboard\u2014\u201d</p><p>No regard for people? Oh, now Gray was getting angry. This was all about his regard for people\u2014two rather important people, one of whom stood glaring at him with murder in his eyes. The other being the principal reason for his presence on this ship. Fetching his baby sister for her London debut was something he\u2019d been waiting to do for years. That task, Gray wouldn\u2019t delegate.</p><p>\u201cI want a captain who doesn\u2019t furl the sails and drop anchor at the sight of a few clouds,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yes, damn it, I need a captain with the fortitude to put up with a few goats and governesses, if that\u2019s what it takes to turn a profit.\u201d He rounded the table to stand toe-to-toe with his brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you? We used to churn up these seas like a pair of sharks. We took everything, feared nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were young. And stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but we were great. We sailed the fastest ship on the Atlantic. The Aphrodite captured more prize than any other privateer in service of the Crown, and we didn\u2019t do it by playing safe.\u201d Gray put a hand on Joss\u2019s shoulder and lowered his voice. \u201cThe war\u2019s over. And I don\u2019t need to tell you how much of that money\u2019s sunk into this venture. We have to conquer honest trade now. We have to chase success with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? What\u2019s all this talk of \u2018we\u2019? When did that word enter your vocabulary?\u201d Joss shrugged off his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you become such an insufferable ass? It\u2019s always been \u2018we.\u2019We were supposed to be full partners, until you changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are we going to tally broken promises now? Be my guest, but I\u2019m warning you ... I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an argument you want to start.\u201d</p><p>Gray took a slow breath, forcing himself to remain calm. \u201cWhat\u2019s past is past. I\u2019ve done what I can on my own, but now we have to make this work. We owe it to Bel. And to Jacob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. It\u2019s your money, but it\u2019s our obligation.\u201d Joss shrugged off Gray\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t presume to tell me what I owe my own son. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll take lessons on family duty from you.\u201d</p><p>Gray stared at his brother. Their father\u2019s ears aside, he scarcely recognized Joss anymore. When he wasn\u2019t cutting the pitiful figure of a mourning widower, he was being a downright prick. Why couldn\u2019t he see this was all for the good of the family? That Gray had worked all these years, assumed all these risks\u2014for him and Bel, and now Jacob?</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner may be a sweet-looking lass,\u201d Joss said, \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to look the other direction. Aside from my responsibility as captain to guard her personal safety, I can\u2019t afford the melodrama that accompanies your affaires, Gray. You know full well what it\u2019ll do to the crew if they know you\u2019re bedding her under their noses. And what happens when you tire of her?</p><p>Need I remind you of the French captain\u2019s widow? That incessant wailing did wonders for shipboard morale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I won\u2019t tire of her,\u201d Gray protested, just to be contrary. Because, apparently, that was how brothers behaved.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a dolphin will fly out of your arse. And here\u2019s an argument even you can\u2019t refute. Grayson Shipping doesn\u2019t need a reputation for delivering damaged goods. You want me to hand George Waltham an impregnated governess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get her with child. Give me that much credit, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you credit for nothing. Let\u2019s try this one last time, shall we? You made me this ship\u2019s captain. If I\u2019m the captain, what I say goes. And I say you don\u2019t touch her. If you can\u2019t abide by my orders, take command of the ship yourself and let me go home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo home and do what? Squander your fortune and talent on dirt farming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home and take care of my own family. Go home and do what I damn well please, for once.\u201d</p><p>Cursing, Gray leaned against the wall. He knew Joss would make good on that threat, too. It hadn\u2019t been easy, coaxing his brother out of mourning. Gray had resorted to outright bullying just to convince him to take command of the Aphrodite, threatening to cut off his income unless he reported to London as agreed. But he needed Joss, if this shipping concern was to stay afloat. He\u2019d worked too hard, sacrificed too much to see it fail. And if Joss didn\u2019t become a willing partner, it all would have been in vain.</p> <p>\u201cStay away from the girl, Gray.\u201d</p><p>Gray sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same ship. I can\u2019t help but be near her. I\u2019ll not promise to refrain from touching her either, because the girl seems to lose her footing whenever I\u2019m around. But I give you my word I\u2019ll not kiss her again. Satisfied?\u201d</p><p>Joss shook his head. \u201cGive me your word you won\u2019t bed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a legend you\u2019re making me! Insinuating I could bed her without even kissing her first.\u201d Gray worried the edge of his thumbnail as he considered. \u201cThat might prove an amusing challenge, now that you suggest it.\u201d</p><p>Joss shot him an incredulous look.</p> <p>\u201cWith some other lady, on some other ship.\u201d Gray raised his hands in a defensive gesture. \u201cI\u2019ll not bed her. You have my word. And don\u2019t think that\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not a great sacrifice, because it is. I\u2019d have her in two, three days at the most, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce again\u2014not amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Joss, it\u2019s a joke. What do you want, an apology? I\u2019m sorry for kissing Miss Turner\u2019s hand, all right?\u201d</p><p>Joss shook his head and flipped open the logbook. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d The odd thing of it was, Gray was telling the truth. He knew he was being an ass, but the joking was easier than honesty. For all his teasing, he hadn\u2019t kissed her hand with the intent to seduce, or to judge if she tasted as sweet as he\u2019d dreamed. He\u2019d kissed her fingers for one reason only. Because they were trembling, and he\u2019d wanted them to stop. It was wholly unlike him, that kiss. It was not a gesture he thought it wise to repeat. The girl did something strange to him.</p><p>Gray tried again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for kissing Miss Turner\u2019s hand.\u201d He crossed to stand opposite his brother\u2019s chair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for arguing about the storm. I\u2019m sorry for sacking Bains. Hell, I\u2019ll even say I\u2019m sorry for the goats. I\u2019m sorry you had the great misfortune to be sired by my degenerate father, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck with an equally degenerate half brother.\u201d</p> <p>Joss looked up sharply.</p><p>Gray said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mara died.\u201d</p><p>Joss looked back down.</p><p>Gray sat down across from him. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sorry I made you the captain of this ship, Joss. Joss.\u201d He waited until his brother met his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one I can trust. I need you to command this ship, and I\u2019ll not jeopardize that in any way. I won\u2019t countermand you again. I\u2019ll stay out of any disputes.\u201d He fanned his fingers out over the blotter and recalled the slender width of Miss Turner\u2019s waist. Then he closed his hand into a fist. \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t pursue Miss Turner. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Joss snorted.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I wish one of these days you\u2019d learn to trust me.\u201d</p><p>His brother looked him in the eye. \u201cNot half as much as I wish you\u2019d give me a reason to.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p> <p>Sophia was hungry. Suddenly, ravenously hungry.</p><p>A near brush with disaster could do that to a woman.</p><p>She followed the stairs down into the belly of the ship. Hadn\u2019t Stubb mentioned the galley was down here somewhere? She couldn\u2019t remember where.</p><p>Pausing at the bottom of the stairs, she propped one hand on the ladder to steady herself. Her heart throbbed in her chest. The air was too thick. Her breaths were shallow, and she was faint with hunger.</p><p>She\u2019d come so close to confessing everything.</p><p>If only he weren\u2019t so infuriating and so solicitous, all at once. One or the other, she knew how to resist, but insolence and charm made a potent brew indeed. The way he\u2019d soothed her concern with rough fingers, even as his words teased. The way he\u2019d guided her with a light touch at the small of her back, kissed her fingers so tenderly ... they could have been in an elegant ballroom, preparing to dance a quadrille.</p><p>By all evidence\u2014his fine attire, cultured accent, proud bearing, the rare flash of politesse\u2014Mr. Grayson was a man who could move in the highest echelons of English society, but delighted in doing just the reverse. For a moment, she\u2019d thought: If she told him everything, perhaps he would understand.</p><p>Perhaps he was a runaway, too.</p><p>Foolish, foolish girl. He understood profit. He understood six pounds, eight shillings. Mr. Grayson was no different from any fortune-hungry suitor of the ton. Or for that matter, from even her own family. He looked at her and saw gold, tied up with a pretty bow. And she would give him his blasted gold and have done with him\u2014just as soon as she had something to eat. Instead of turning left into the ladies\u2019 cabin, Sophia went right. She emerged into a cabin quite similar to her own in appearance, but distinguished by the strong smell of goat. Holding her sleeve to her nose, she passed through the common area quickly and stepped through a door</p><p>on the opposite side.</p><p>\u201cShut the bloody door, then!\u201d The voice thundered at her through a cloud of steam.</p><p>Sophia complied hastily.</p><p>A tall, lean black man stood over a pot of boiling water, carving chunks from a peeled potato with a large knife. \u201cNot time for mess now, is it?\u201d he said without looking up. \u201cThat\u2019s six bells just sounded, and I ain\u2019t so old as I can\u2019t hear, nor so stupid as I can\u2019t count. So off with you then, you greedy bastard, and come back in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Sophia would have obeyed this request, but she was momentarily shocked immobile. No one, in all her twenty years of genteel privilege, had ever addressed her in such a coarse manner. Much less a Negro cook. She couldn\u2019t quite name the sensation that overtook her. It wasn\u2019t anger, or shame. It was more a sense of complete disorientation. As if God, in a fit of boredom, had thought it might be amusing to flip the globe on its ear. The cook flung the knife down and wiped his hands on an apron. \u201cI told you, you can bugger off. You\u2019re not getting nothing until\u2014\u201d He turned, saw Sophia, and froze.</p><p>They stood there, staring at each other, not speaking, until the pot boiled over.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d The cook grabbed an iron and wrenched open the stove, poking vigorously at the fire. Sparks shot out to mingle with the steam.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cI only hoped to ask for a bit of bread. Perhaps ...\u201d The cook swore again as he banged the stove shut, and she jumped. \u201cPerhaps a drop of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s I who must beg your pardon, miss.\u201d He wiped his hands on his apron again, leaving dark smudges of soot. \u201cHave a seat, Miss... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat then, Miss Turner.\u201d He pulled a three-legged stool up to a square, butcher-block table and patted it with his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sat down quickly. It was a comfortable stool, and a comfortable space. A square little room, lined with cabinets and the stove to one side. Overhead, the ceiling hovered a foot or so above deck level, letting fresh air and sunlight in from all four sides. The aromas of cooking food had her stomach grumbling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch your bread and tea,\u201d the man said. Now that he\u2019d ceased swearing, the exotic cadence of his voice intrigued her. Unlike the sharp commands the seamen volleyed from rigging to deck, Gabriel\u2019s speech was smooth and resonant. \u201cI\u2019m not accustomed to having passengers aboard.\u201d He looked her over, and a white, toothy smile split his face. \u201cFor a moment there, I thought you were an angel, come to take me up to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not an angel.\u201d She knew he meant to be conciliatory, but he may as well have called her a beetle, for all the pleasure that appellation conveyed. \u201cI\u2019m a governess.\u201d</p><p>His angel, Toby had always called her. His innocent dove. He would wax nearly poetic about how perfect she was, how beautiful and pure. He had no idea.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he\u2019d whisper after each kiss, swallowing hard between ragged breaths. \u201cYou\u2019re so lovely, I can\u2019t help myself. But don\u2019t be frightened, my angel. I shan\u2019t press you further. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>But Sophia hadn\u2019t been sorry, or frightened in the least. She recited the demure deferrals that come as naturally as embroidery to any young lady of accomplishment, but she left these encounters feeling frustrated and curious. She longed to be pressed further. Pressed further, harder, and in unspeakably intimate places.</p><p>A lifetime of playing Toby\u2019s perfect angel had loomed before her like a living hell. She had no use for purity; Sophia wanted passion. So she\u2019d run away. She\u2019d fled the dream wedding\u2014and dream groom\u2014of every young lady in England, on the slim hope of finding it.</p><p>But at the moment, she would settle for some tea, and a morsel of bread.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for cursin\u2019 at you like that.\u201d He put a kettle on the stove. \u201cI thought you were one of the sailors, come looking for extra food. Can\u2019t let \u2019em have a morsel more than their allotment, the greedy beggars. You give them one biscuit extra, and they\u2019ll expect the same every day until we make port.\u201d He set a hunk of bread before her. \u201cThat\u2019s the last of the bread, miss. Enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Sophia bit into it gratefully. Stale bread had never tasted so delicious. \u201cI\u2019d gladly forgive you anything for a cup of tea. But what if,\u201d she asked, swallowing, \u201cwhat if I had been Captain Grayson? Or Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel made a dismissive wave of his hand. \u201cI been chasing Gray and Joss out of one kitchen or another since they was boys. They know better than to run afoul of old Gabriel.\u201d He reached for a canister of tea and paused. \u201cBut it might have been that Mr. Brackett. And something tells me he\u2019d not take kindly to being told to bugger off.\u201d He shrugged, scooping tea into a tin pot. \u201cLots of changes for an old man like me. Not used to men of Brackett\u2019s type aboard this vessel. Nor beautiful young misses like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t be old,\u201d Sophia insisted. Gabriel laughed, and she peered through the steam at his face. Smooth, unwrinkled skin with the sheen of polished mahogany stretched over high cheekbones and a flat nose. His laughter revealed a full set of straight, white teeth. Only the faintest dusting of white in his close-cropped hair hinted at advancing age. The kettle whistled.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you mean, you\u2019re not accustomed to passengers?\u201d Sophia propped her elbow on the table and rested her chin in her hand, entranced by the steaming trickle of water from kettle to teapot. \u201cAre all the berths typically occupied by goats, then?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel chuckled. \u201cNow don\u2019t disparage the goats, Miss Turner. They\u2019ll give you milk for your tea, and a taste of chowder on Sundays.\u201d He set a tin mug on the table before her and ladled a generous amount of treacle into it.</p><p>\u201cBut these cabins are all new, miss. Used to be just steerage all through, from galley to forecastle. The Aphrodite is a whole new ship inside. It\u2019s like her maiden voyage.</p><p>\u201cWe needed all that space during the war,\u201d he continued, pouring tea into her cup. \u201cFor extra crewmen and guns. Powder and cannonballs, too. And the ship had to leave port half-empty at least, so we\u2019d have room for prize cargo and prisoners.\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked at him, ignoring the delicious-smelling tea before her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCannonballs? Prisoners? Was the Aphrodite a warship, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss.\u201d He smiled and went back to his pot of potatoes on the stove.</p><p>\u201cThis crew, falling in with the British Navy? No, the Aphrodite was a privateer vessel. Brought in three-and-sixty prizes\u2014French ships, American ships. And she brought Gray more money in five years at sea than the old Mr. Grayson lost in thirty years of farming sugarcane.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia\u2019s hand plunked down on the table. \u201cBut privateers ... aren\u2019t they nearly the same as pirates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss. There\u2019s a world of difference between the life of a privateer and a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess violent?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shook his head. \u201cAbout the same, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore honorable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily. That would depend on the particular privateer and the particular pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how is it different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, privateering\u2019s legal, of course. Sanctioned by the Crown. Can\u2019t be hanged for a privateer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Course, the war\u2019s over now.\u201d Gabriel sprinkled the dish with pepper before removing the pot from the stove. \u201cNo more privateering to be had. So we\u2019ve got to turn respectable, Gray says. It was either that, or turn pirate.\u201d Gabriel winked at her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m rather attached to my neck.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sipped her tea, amazed. She was the lone female passenger\u2014the lone passenger, really\u2014aboard a ship crewed entirely by men who might as well be pirates, except that they couldn\u2019t be hanged. And Mr. Grayson, with his arrogant swagger and mercantile lust, was their erstwhile, unhangable pirate king.</p> <p>Mercy.</p><p>She drained the rest of her tea in one long draught, capped with an audible swallow. \u201cThank you for the refreshment,\u201d she said, rising to her feet. Blood rushed from her head, leaving her dizzy. The steam was suddenly too thick to breathe. \u201cI ... I believe I\u2019ll go take some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>As she hurried on deck, her mind was awhirl. All that time that Mr. Grayson had been touching her, teasing her ... she\u2019d been consorting with a pirate. If he had the slightest inkling that she carried hundreds of pounds beneath her stays, he\u2019d surely stop at nothing to get it. And yet, she could not bid caution to overtake the gothic thrill. For Heaven\u2019s sake, a pirate. She could be in danger, she admonished herself.</p><p>She could be plundered.</p><p>The possibility really ought to have frightened her more than it did. Perhaps she could not escape the man, but she had to tamp down this response he incited in her. There was only one thing for it. She would go to her cabin and sketch. Something simple, innocent. Rosebuds, apples, blocks of wood. Anything but him.</p><p>Then something fell to the deck with a loud thud, startling Sophia to a halt. It was a knotted length of rope, only a few feet long, and it had landed almost at her feet. A rather small object to have made such a noise. It must have fallen from high above.</p><p>Shading her eyes with her hand, Sophia craned her neck and looked upward. Davy Linnet descended the rigging hand over hand, like a monkey.</p><p>For all his nervousness earlier, he looked born to the ropes now. He landed at her feet in a graceful swoop. \u201cBeg yer pardon, miss.\u201d He picked up the offending coil and, flashing a shy smile, made an ungainly bow. Sophia graced him with her best debutante\u2019s smile, gratified by the manner in which his pale cheeks colored when she did. At least someone on this ship knew how to treat a lady. \u201cMr. Linnet, I wonder if I might trouble you for a favor.\u201d</p> <p>The youth swallowed, his expression suddenly earnest. \u201cAnything, miss. Anything.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Over the next few days, Gray found himself partnered in an absurd sort of quadrille. Miss Turner was always in his sights, but rarely within reach. And when their paths collided occasionally, as much by accident as by design, she quickly twirled away from him, to be lost in the dance once again. Just as well.</p><p>He learned the pattern of her activities. She came abovedecks shortly after breakfast, presumably to take some fresh air. Then she would disappear again, usually until the dogwatches in late afternoon. A sailor\u2019s favorite time of day, the dogwatch\u2014when work slowed and the sun hung low in the sky and dinner loomed hopefully on the horizon. It was the time of day when those who had pipes would play them, and those who had cards would gather \u2019round, and men with no talent for music or gambling might light a pipe instead. Only natural, then, that Miss Turner would be drawn to the deck at that hour, lured by the air of camaraderie and the sounds of laughter or song.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine how she passed her time between forenoon and dusk. What did ladies do with themselves on a transoceanic voyage?</p><p>Sewing? Reading? Gray himself grew itchy with idleness. He found little to do, save charting the latitude religiously and circling the deck, pausing to chat with the sailors now and then. Every once in a while, a sail might appear on the horizon. And, according to his right of whimsy as captain, Joss might or might not decide to hail the ship and let the carved goddess adorning the Aphrodite\u2019s prow curtsy to a kindred figurehead. Odd, to watch the ships approach willingly now, rather than flee.</p><p>\u201cSay!\u201d</p><p>The shout drew Gray\u2019s attention. A knot of sailors surrounded young Davy, who appeared as riled up as a fifteen-year-old green hand could get. Davy stood nose-to-chest with O\u2019Shea, jabbing a finger into the Irishman\u2019s chest. \u201cGive it back then, you big, ugly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch yer mouth there, boy! Mind who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d O\u2019Shea gave him a half-strength push that sent Davy sprawling into Quinn, one of the new men. Quinn shouted in protest and threw a swift elbow, knocking Davy to the deck.</p><p>Gray strode over to join the group. A bit of good-natured hazing never hurt a new boy. He had to learn his place among the crew. But Gray had never countenanced cruelty on his ship. And this was, he reminded himself, still his ship. Wordlessly, he extended a hand to Davy and hauled him to his feet. The crewmen nudged one another, silencing the laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, O\u2019Shea?\u201d Gray knew better than to solicit Davy\u2019s version of the conflict first. Shipboard hierarchy was sacred. The Irishman shrugged. \u201cBoy\u2019s got himself all worked up over a bit of paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaper?\u201d Gray laid a hand on Davy\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>Davy struggled in Gray\u2019s grip. \u201cIt\u2019s my paper, you great lout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said I\u2019ll give it back to ye, now didn\u2019t I, ye wee bugger?\u201d O\u2019Shea clenched his fists and turned to Gray. \u201cCan I hit \u2019im, Gray? Let me hit \u2019im. He insulted me mum, the little piece of sh\u2014\u201d</p><p>The bell clanged at the helm. All wheeled to view Mr. Brackett, wearing his usual black overcoat and equally dark expression. \u201cBack to your stations, all of you!\u201d He stomped to the skylight above the galley and called down, \u201cCook! No grog tonight for larboard watch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Mr. Brackett.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s voice wafted up on a cloud of steam. The men grumbled in chorus, and Davy took a few dull knocks to the kidneys. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter let me have the paper, O\u2019Shea,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with the boy here about minding his place.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Shea handed him a crumpled sheet of parchment before heading back toward the ship\u2019s bow.</p><p>Gray turned to the boy. He cleared his throat, summoning the serious tone he reserved for reprimands and funerals and other rare occasions.</p><p>\u201cNow, Davy. It\u2019s bad form, and generally a bad idea, to run afoul of O\u2019Shea. Or any of the crewmen, for that matter. You\u2019re together on this ship for the next month, you realize. Life at sea isn\u2019t all grog and sunshine. Your mates hold your life in their hands, and you don\u2019t want to give them any reason to lose their grip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d came the boy\u2019s sullen reply. \u201cIt\u2019s just ...\u201d He gestured toward the crumpled paper in Gray\u2019s hand. \u201cHave a look at it, sir.\u201d</p><p>Gray smiled. \u201cWhat is it, then? A love letter from your girl back on the farm?\u201d He released Davy\u2019s sleeve and smoothed the paper against his chest before glancing down at it.</p><p>He nearly dropped the page.</p><p>It was a charcoal sketch of young Davy Linnet. And it was a revelation.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner done it,\u201d Davy said simply.</p><p>She had, indeed. The boy\u2019s likeness was rendered in deft, light strokes, and in stunningly faithful detail. It wasn\u2019t anything like the schoolgirl sketches most</p><p>produced\u2014generic,</p><p>blocky</p><p>human</p><p>figures</p><p>distinguishable only by the shade of the subject\u2019s hair, or the line of his nose. Every inch of this sketch was inimitably Davy. The restless energy in his stance and rumpled tufts of dark hair. The awkward ears and too-large hands he\u2019d eventually grow into. The spark of youthful optimism in his eye, hedged by the self-conscious, lopsided quirk of his lips, a shadow of future irony. In a single sketch, the artist\u2014for this was most certainly the work of an artist\u2014had captured the boy Davy was and the man he would one day become. It wasn\u2019t merely a likeness; it was a portrait. It made Gray feel wistful for his boyhood. It made him feel strangely humbled and alone. It made him want to garrote the bloody goat that had eaten Miss Turner\u2019s two sheets of paper and turn the ship around just to buy her more.</p><p>And most of all, it made Gray greatly curious\u2014and a little bit afraid\u2014to know what Miss Turner saw when she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d save it for my mum,\u201d Davy said, \u201cso she\u2019ll not forget what I look like. Miss Turner only worked on it while I was off-watch, Mr. Grayson. Said I was doing her a favor, giving her a subject to practice on.\u201d The boy scrubbed at his face with his sleeve and craned his neck to look over Gray\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNever had a portrait of myself before. Is it like me enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery like,\u201d Gray said quietly. Then he cleared his throat and forced a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a handsome devil, Mr. Linnet. Give it a few years, and you\u2019ll be breaking the ladies\u2019 hearts on two continents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Quinn called from the crow\u2019s nest. \u201cLad\u2019s up to his ears in love with Miss Turner. Aren\u2019t ye, boy? She\u2019s all he can talk about, Gray. Don\u2019t go tempting him with talk of other girls. There\u2019ll be no other lady for him\u2014not this voyage, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Davy colored and stammered. \u201cI ... It\u2019s not ...\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed and clapped a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t fault your choice, Davy. She\u2019s a beautiful woman, and talented at that.\u201d</p><p>Davy shifted his weight awkwardly. \u201cWell, and of course she won\u2019t look at me. I do know that, sir. I just ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a normal lad of fifteen. I was one once myself, you realize. And I never caught the eye of a lady half so fine as Miss Turner.\u201d He gave the sketch one more lingering gaze before returning it to Davy.</p><p>\u201cAnd she must think a great deal of you, Davy,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cShe\u2019s given you a whole sheet of paper.\u201d</p><p>As Sophia emerged from the hatch, she immediately recognized Mr. Grayson\u2019s roguish laughter, coming from somewhere to her right. She turned left.</p><p>An overnight rain had scrubbed the inverted basin of sky to a bright, cloudless blue. The sun shone down with unmitigated audacity, and the crest of each wave gleamed. Their collective brilliance was almost painful to behold; like a sea of diamonds.</p><p>This should have been her wedding day.</p><p>Sophia wondered if the sun was shining on a small, picturesque chapel in Kent. What had happened, she wondered, to the hundreds of hot house flowers especially cultivated for the occasion? She thought of the wedding breakfast, so carefully planned to the last gilt demitasse spoon. Was the pastel pyramid of almond-and rose-flavored ices waiting stoically for her return, a fashionably Egyptian monument to her betrayal? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even if they\u2019d managed to keep her disappearance concealed until now... when she failed to appear for her own wedding, the secret would be out. Rumors of her elopement with the mysterious Gervais would leap from lady to lady like fleas in a church pew. She\u2019d be the talk of the ton\u2014although not quite the way her social-climbing parents would have hoped. What an elaborate joke she\u2019d played on them all. What a laugh. So why did she feel like crying?</p><p>Standing on tiptoe and clutching the wooden pins, she leaned over the ship\u2019s side, staring hard into endless waves and swirling trails of foam. A single tear fell from the corner of her eye, dropping into the seawater with all the significance of a grain of sand strewn in a desert. A flash beneath the waves caught her gaze. A smooth dart rose up from the blue-green depths, then sank beneath the surface again. Sophia waited, holding her breath. It surfaced once more, a bolt of quicksilver slicing through the waves, pacing the Aphrodite\u2019s brisk progress. A sailor nearby called to another, and the two men joined her at the rail, marking the elegant creature\u2019s course.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sophia wondered aloud, her eyes never leaving the water.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a dolphin-fish, miss,\u201d one of the crewmen answered. The creature leapt from the water, its sleek, shimmering form sailing through the air before disappearing once more beneath the waves. It leapt again, and then again, carving playful, exuberant arcs through the spray, trailing silver-dipped rainbows in its wake.</p><p>The fish\u2019s course veered, bringing it even closer to the ship\u2019s hull. Sophia admired the creature\u2019s flat snout and the sharp blade of its fin, running the full length of its spine. But most marvelous of all were the bold, iridescent shades decorating its scales.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>A harpoon shot out from the sailor\u2019s hand, skewering the fish with a sick squelch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dinner,\u201d the crewman said cheerfully. The two men dropped a net over the side and hauled their thrashing catch aboard.</p> <p>Gagging, Sophia pressed a hand to her mouth and turned away.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t be squeamish, miss,\u201d the crewman said. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss the colors.\u201d</p><p>The colors? Sophia peeked over her shoulder. The men had the fish completely aboard now, and its flat body thumped uselessly on the planked deck.</p><p>\u201cSee, miss? The colors are starting.\u201d</p><p>As the sailor spoke, the bold hues of the fish\u2019s scales began to shimmer and change. Sophia stepped toward it, fascinated. Its light-blue belly deepened to the truest cobalt. A stripe of fresh green turned electric with gold. Sophia had never seen colors so vivid\u2014not in nature, not in paintings. Not even in her dreams. The fish was a living rainbow.</p><p>A dying rainbow, rather. Its arcing body eventually went pale and limp, turning as colorless as the decking. Having withdrawn their harpoon, the crewmen returned to the rail to look for more. And there the fish lay, gutted and lifeless.</p> <p>Sophia had never felt so disillusioned. The stark reality of life and death had been splashed in her face like so much seawater. She realized, with sudden clarity, that all her life she\u2019d been raised to view the world as a collection of objects assembled for her amusement, her admiration, her consumption. But now she understood\u2014nothing existed for beauty alone.</p><p>Even a beautiful fish still died, was still food.</p><p>She\u2019d left home seeking to experience real life, true passion, grand adventure. Well, this was real life, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. And every moment she stood here, staring blankly at the deck and crying pointless tears, was a moment of real life wasted.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another,\u201d one of the sailors called, flinging his harpoon back into the sea. A second later, he crowed with triumph. \u201cGot \u2019im in one.\u201d</p><p>Sophia rushed back to the rail and peered over the edge at the thrashing fish churning the waves to froth. A giddy thrill warmed her toes. The crewman began to pull in the rope, hand over hand.</p><p>\u201cMay I help bring it in?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the sailor grunted, not losing his pace.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d She jerked her chin at the struggling fish and laid one hand on the rope, above his. She had reeled in a fish before\u2014granted, it was a smallish trout, plucked from a stream in the English midlands. But still, the principle appeared the same.</p> <p>He stared at her a moment, then shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t see why not.\u201d</p><p>Sophia grasped the rope with both hands, and he showed her how to brace one foot on the bulwark and pull hand over hand, letting the rope fall in a neat coil at their feet.</p><p>\u201cReady to try it yerself?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, and he released the rope.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Sophia gave a sharp cry as several yards of cable slid straight through her grip. The dolphin-fish was swifter than she\u2019d expected, and stronger, too. Now she\u2019d made matters worse by giving it more slack, more room to struggle.</p><p>\u201cShall I help you, miss?\u201d the sailor asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll do.\u201d Bracing her foot and tightening her grip, Sophia clenched her teeth and began to pull, arm over arm. For every arm-length of rope she pulled in, it seemed the dolphin-fish took three. What with all this thrashing, the fish would probably resemble mincemeat by the time she hauled it aboard.</p><p>But she would haul it aboard, if it was the last thing she did. And she would rejoice to see even minced fish on her plate tonight, instead of salt pork.</p><p>After a minute, the task seemed to grow easier, presumably because the fish grew weaker. But just when she thought she had it netted, the dolphin-fish made one last desperate surge for freedom, dragging her a few steps toward the bow. Her boot caught in the coiled rope, and she very nearly tripped. She managed to pull up, however, and regain control. Her efforts were rewarded with a rousing chorus of whistles and cheers.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way, miss!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got \u2019im now!\u201d</p><p>Slowly pivoting her head from one side to the other, Sophia realized she\u2019d amassed quite an audience. Evidently her battle with the fish made for high entertainment. Ah, well. Let the men laugh. She was having fun, too. She smiled as she resumed pulling in the catch.</p><p>In fact, she was having the time of her life.</p><p>Jesus Christ. The chit was going to get herself killed.</p><p>From the stern, Gray looked on in disbelief as Miss Turner played tug-o-war with a fish and the crew watched with glee. What the hell were they thinking?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are they thinking?\u201d Joss came to Gray\u2019s side. \u201cMr. Wiggins,\u201d he ordered, \u201ctell the men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Gray called out, vaulting over the rail that separated helm and quarterdeck. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to it myself.\u201d</p><p>Long strides carried him across the decking, while Gray tried to hold panic at bay. Devil take it, when had the Aphrodite become so damned long? Up at the bow, Miss Turner lost her footing, tripping over the coiled rope, and Gray very nearly lost his breakfast.</p><p>\u201cBloody idiots,\u201d he muttered, as a prelude to the worse invectives running through his mind. Only a fool let a fish thrash at the end of a rope like that, churning up the froth, leaving a wake of blood and innards on the waves. It was a cretinous way to catch a fish, and a surefire method of attracting a\u2014</p><p>\u201cShark!\u201d</p><p>And from there on, it all went so fast. But so slowly, at the same time. Had the girl any common sense, she would have dropped the line at once. But she had no sense. She made no sense. She was a pale English rose of a governess, adrift in a watery wilderness, on her way to a grueling post on a godforsaken island, when any fool could have told her\u2014a woman so lovely need never work for her keep.</p><p>Had the men around her any sense, they would have cut the rope immediately. But they were idiots, bloody shite-for-brains idiots, too entranced by the pretty girl in peril to reach for their knives. Had Gray his own knife, he would have drawn it. But he wasn\u2019t wearing his knife, because he wasn\u2019t the captain on this ship, was he? Nor an officer, nor even part of the crew. He was just a stupid, overdressed passenger who hadn\u2019t strapped on a goddamned knife that morning because it might ruin the lines of his goddamned brand-new coat.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t have his knife. But he had his legs, powering him the remaining yards to the bow. He had his arms, lashing around Miss Turner just as the shark\u2019s jaws snatched the dolphin-fish carcass and dragged it under the waves. And he had his voice, that authoritative tone of command. The voice that carried over storms, and gunfire, and howls of pain.</p><p>\u201cLet go of the line.\u201d He grabbed her forearms and shook them. Jesus, she\u2019d been holding on to the thing for so long, her instinct was to tighten her fingers further. Precisely the wrong thing to do. As the shark lunged away, the cable streamed through her two-fisted grip, no doubt taking the skin of her palms along with it.</p><p>\u201cLet it go!\u201d he ordered. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>She did. Her shaking fingers were white; her palms were abraded and raw.</p><p>And damn it to hell, he stared at those ruined hands an instant too long. By the time Gray attempted to pull her back from the rail, the shark had spooled out several more yards of rope. The rope that lay coiled and tangled about her foot, that was.</p><p>\u201cCut the bloody line!\u201d he commanded, tightening his arms around her slender frame and jamming his boot down on top of hers.</p><p>The rope cinched like a noose about their ankles, yanking their feet out from under them. She screamed as together they fell to the deck, then skidded toward the rail, tugged by their intertwined legs. In a matter of seconds, they would either be pulled overboard entirely, or have their legs torn off. Neither alternative sounded particularly pleasant. Gray shoved his free boot against the bulwark, bracing himself for what he knew would be a futile, and brief, wrestling match with a shark. He gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cSomeone. Cut. The. Damn. Line.\u201d</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>Someone did.</p><p>Gray lifted his head to spy Levi\u2019s hand on an ax handle, and the blade several inches deep in the rail. \u201cThank you,\u201d he huffed, letting his head fall back against the deck.</p><p>And now here he lay on the forecastle, holding Miss Turner as if they were two spoons in a drawer. The crown of her head tucked neatly under his chin, and her round little bottom nestled between his thighs. She was damp with sweat, and panting for breath. Gray was struck by the ridiculous notion that he\u2019d had a dream the other night, very much like this. Except they\u2019d been wearing fewer clothes. And there hadn\u2019t been a half-dozen gawking seamen standing about.</p><p>And what did she say, his dream girl? This exquisite, rose-scented siren who would smile as she pulled him to his death?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was exciting.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cThat\u201d\u2014Mr. Grayson slammed the door of the captain\u2019s cabin\u2014\u201cwas the most breathtaking display of stupidity I have ever witnessed in my life.\u201d</p><p>Sophia cringed in her chair as he plunked a basin of water on the table. Liquid sloshed over the side, trickling toward the floor. With jerky motions, he removed a flask from his breast pocket, unscrewed the top, and added a splash of brandy. Then he threw back a healthy swallow, himself. She\u2019d never seen him so agitated. He took everything as a joke, laughed off confrontation, deflected insult with a roguish smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I\u2019m angry. I\u2019d like to string every one of those bloody idiots up to the yardarm and shout them deaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here, shouting at me?\u201d</p><p>He yanked open a drawer and removed a box. When he flung it on the table and flipped the latch, the box proved to be a medicine kit, crowded with brown glass vials and plasters and rolls of gauze.</p><p>\u201cBecause ...\u201d With a sullen sigh, he dropped into the other chair.</p><p>\u201cShouting the crew deaf is the captain\u2019s privilege. And I\u2019m not the captain. So I\u2019m here instead, playing nursemaid. Give me your hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lifted her clenched hands to the table and slowly uncurled her fingers. Across each palm was painted a wide, angry swath of red. Swearing under his breath, he gingerly lifted one of her hands and laid it across his own. His tanned, weathered fingers dwarfed hers. With his free hand, he dipped a piece of gauze into the basin. \u201cThis will hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will hurt more.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia winced as he sponged the wound. Yes, it did hurt more. It hurt worse when she looked at it, so instead she looked at him. She hadn\u2019t come this near to him in days, not since they watched Davy Linnet climb the mast. Now she drank in every detail of his rugged, handsome face: the strong jaw sporting several days\u2019 growth of beard, that thin scar tracing a path to his sensuous lips, the faint creases at the corners of his eyes, the result of weather or laughter or both. His was a face sculpted by real life, and it wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>It was captivating.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize you could have died?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>Sophia bit her lip. She did understand, in some way, that together they had just cheated death. Perhaps she ought to be rattled now, shaking with terror\u2014but instead, she felt nothing but alive. Gloriously alive, and connected to this man, as though that rope were still binding her ankle to his.</p><p>He dipped the gauze again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let go of the line when I told you to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obvious. For a governess, you don\u2019t have much sense.\u201d He blew lightly across her palm, raising the hairs on the back of her neck. His gray-green eyes locked with hers. \u201cFor a governess, you don\u2019t make much sense.\u201d</p><p>And now a shiver swept down to her toes.</p><p>He released the one hand and took up the other, dunking a fresh piece of gauze. Swabbing at her wound, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a puzzle, Miss Turner, but none of the pieces fit. That abhorrent gown cannot have been made for you. Your gloves were a gift. The loss of two sheets of paper has you in tears, and even your handkerchiefs bear someone else\u2019s monogram.\u201d</p><p>Panic coursed through her body, drawing every nerve to attention. He blew over her palm again, and this time the sensation nearly undid her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think I had. Her heartbeat pounded as he dressed her wounds, winding the bandage tightly around her palm. \u201cI told you, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you\u2019d pay your fare that day, and you\u2019ve been avoiding me ever since. I know why, Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He bandaged her other hand.</p><p>Oh, God. How much did he truly know? Should she stick with her old story? Invent a new one? Normally, Sophia could weave an entire web of lies with the same effortless talent of a spider spinning silk. But he\u2019d always thrown her off balance, from their very first meeting, and now ... now she was wounded and in pain, and he was caring for her so tenderly. And when she closed her eyes, she saw the angry, gaping maw of a shark\u2014but she felt his arms around her, holding her fast. Protecting her. All she could think of was how right it felt, and how much she wanted to feel it again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been lying to me all along, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t answer. Her voice simply wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he said, his gaze running over her face. \u201cGone white as sailcloth. I knew it. You never intended to pay your fare. You don\u2019t have a shilling to your name, do you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked at him. What to say? She needed to keep her money\u2014which meant she needed to keep it secret. He was offering her a gift, with his ridiculous, wrongheaded, oh-so-male assumption. She would be a fool not to take it.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he repeated, his thumb tightening over her wrist. Casting her eyes to her lap, Sophia released a breathy, dramatic sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with you,\u201d he said, his voice growing curt with anger again. \u201cDeceitful little minx. I\u2019m of half a mind to put you to work, milking the goats. But that\u2019s out of the question with these hands, now isn\u2019t it?\u201d He curled and uncurled her fingers a few times, testing the bandage. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Stubb to change this twice a day. Can\u2019t risk the wound going septic. And don\u2019t use your hands for a few days, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use my hands? I suppose you\u2019re going to spoon-feed me, then?</p><p>Dress me? Bathe me?\u201d</p><p>He inhaled slowly and closed his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t use your hands much.\u201d His eyes snapped open. \u201cNone of that sketching, for instance.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her hands out of his grip. \u201cYou could slice off my hands and toss them to the sharks, and I wouldn\u2019t stop sketching. I\u2019d hold the pencil with my teeth if I had to. I\u2019m an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. I thought you were a governess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I\u2019m that, too.\u201d</p><p>He packed up the medical kit, jamming items back in the box with barely controlled fury. \u201cThen start behaving like one. A governess knows her place. Speaks when spoken to. Stays out of the damn way.\u201d</p><p>Rising to his feet, he opened the drawer and threw the box back in. \u201cFrom this point forward, you\u2019re not to touch a sail, a pin, a rope, or so much as a damned splinter on this vessel. You\u2019re not to speak to crewmen when they\u2019re on watch. You\u2019re forbidden to wander past the foremast, and you need to steer clear of the helm, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that leaves me doing what? Circling the quarterdeck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He slammed the drawer shut. \u201cBut only at designated times. Noon hour and the dogwatch. The rest of the day, you\u2019ll remain in your cabin.\u201d</p><p>Sophia leapt to her feet, incensed. She hadn\u2019t fled one restrictive program of behavior, just to submit to another. \u201cWho are you, to dictate where I can go, when I can go there, what I\u2019m permitted to do? You\u2019re not the captain of this ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d He stalked toward her, until they stood toe-to-toe. Until his radiant male heat brought her blood to a boil, and she had to grab the table edge to keep from swaying toward him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you who I am,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man who cares if you live or die, that\u2019s who.\u201d</p><p>Her knees melted. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly. Because I may not be the captain, but I\u2019m the investor. I\u2019m the man you owe six pounds, eight. And now that I know you can\u2019t pay your debts, I\u2019m the man who knows he won\u2019t see a bloody penny unless he delivers George Waltham a governess in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Sophia glared at him. How did he keep doing this to her? Since the moment they\u2019d met in that Gravesend tavern, there\u2019d been an attraction between them unlike anything she\u2019d ever known. She knew he had to feel it, too. But one minute, he was so tender and sensual; the next, so crass and calculating. Now he would reduce her life\u2019s value to this cold, impersonal amount? At least back home, her worth had been measured in thousands of pounds, not in shillings.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about six pounds, eight shillings. That\u2019s the reason you\u2019ve been watching me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He made a dismissive snort. \u201cI haven\u2019t been watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaring at me, every moment of the day, so intently it makes my ... my skin crawl and all you\u2019re seeing is a handful of coins. You\u2019d wrestle a shark for a purse of six pounds, eight. It all comes down to money for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He slammed a fist, knuckles-down, on the table. Everything in the cabin rattled, from the glass-paned cabinet to Sophia\u2019s teeth. The brute strength in the gesture was a tiny bit frightening and wildly arousing, and he glared at her mouth so hard, she was almost certain he would kiss her. She was very certain she wanted him to.</p><p>But then he stepped back, doubling the distance between them, and gave her a lazy shrug. That smile\u2014that damnable arrogant grin\u2014tipped his mouth and sent that ghost of a kiss sliding right off his lips. The insolent scoundrel was back.</p><p>\u201cIt all comes down to money, sweet. Anyone who tells you different is lying. If it didn\u2019t all come down to money, you wouldn\u2019t be headed for a governess post in Tortola, would you?\u201d</p><p>He had her there. \u201cNo. I suppose I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is business. Strictly business. Mind you don\u2019t give me more trouble than you\u2019re worth, or I\u2019ll strand you in some Azorean fishing village and never look back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think?\u201d He paused in the door and lifted a brow. \u201cWell, sweetheart, somewhere there\u2019s a French captain\u2019s widow who\u2019d correct that assumption.\u201d</p><p>Gray spent an endless afternoon in steerage, turning pages of a book he lacked the concentration to read. No matter how hard he stared at the blocks of dark print swimming on the pages, he couldn\u2019t see words. He could only see her.</p><p>As the afternoon light faded, he let the book fall against his chest. He shut his eyes and tried to sleep.</p><p>He could only see her.</p><p>When the bells rang for the second dogwatch, he gave up. Tossing the book aside with a curse, he rose from his hammock and prepared to go abovedecks. If the image of her lovely face was going to haunt him no matter what he did, he might as well suffer the torment in person. Ah, but it wasn\u2019t just her lovely face that haunted him. Nor the soft, lush body he was increasingly desperate to see liberated from that woolen cocoon. It was the way she\u2019d so willingly owned up to the truth. The way her spirit had sparked when he\u2019d told her to put aside her art. The way she\u2019d practically made sweet, innocent love to him with her eyes when he\u2019d said he cared if she lived or died.</p><p>Good Lord. The laughable irony of it. He\u2019d wasted weeks of his adolescence memorizing sonnets, spent years perfecting little murmured innuendos. Only to learn the most seductive phrase in the English language was something akin to: All things being equal, I\u2019d rather not see you mauled by a shark.</p><p>Business, he admonished himself as he shrugged back into his topcoat. This was strictly business. He promised Joss he\u2019d watch out for the girl. After today, there was no doubt she needed watching over. And watching over her was a great deal easier when she was in his sights. When he gained the quarterdeck, however, he found it deserted. All the sailors were knotted at the ship\u2019s bow. The volume of their laughter told Gray the rum was flowing freely. The officers stood sober at the helm. In the middle, there was no one. She\u2019d stayed below.</p><p>Gray joined his brother at the stern, propping one elbow on the rail. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair wind tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Is Miss Turner well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was well enough when I left her.\u201d</p><p>In silence, they watched the sun slide over the curve of the earth. A loud whoop rose up from the crew at the other end of the ship. Gray shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re allowing the men to drink, after what they did today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday. Wives and sweethearts, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the devil\u2019s own birthday. If this ship were under my command, they\u2019d not taste a drop until the Tropic.\u201d</p><p>Joss made a derisive sound. \u201cFortunate thing she\u2019s not under your command, then. You know as well as I, what a fool decision that would be. In fact, after what you did today, you ought to go join them.\u201d</p><p>Gray sighed. He knew his brother was right. Brushes with death were commonplace at sea, and a true sailor learned to shrug them off with a laugh or a smile. One moment, a man could be scaling the rigging\u2014a false move, a soft splash, and the next moment, he\u2019d be gone. Lives were gambled and lost on the whims of fate. When fortune did work in a man\u2019s favor and he survived a narrow scrape, it was bad form to brood. Made the crew tense, and even more prone to accidents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, the only thing for it was to go on with life. To smile, to joke, to drink and make merry. To toast wives and sweethearts, just as they did every Saturday.</p><p>Funny, for Joss to remind him of this. Of all the men who needed to smile, laugh, and just get on with life.</p><p>\u201cCome have a drink with me then,\u201d Gray said, nudging his brother with his elbow.</p> <p>Joss shook his head. \u201cNo sweetheart to toast. No wife, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo raise a glass to her memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d Joss pushed off the rail and headed for the hatch, only pausing long enough for one last remark\u2014a remark that summed up just about every word Joss had spoken to Gray since the day Mara died: \u201cGo on without me.\u201d</p><p>And Gray still hadn\u2019t figured out how to argue back.</p><p>Once his brother had disappeared belowdecks, Gray ambled toward the bow of the ship, to join the weekly celebration. In fact, he began the celebration a bit early by pausing to take out his flask and toss back a large swallow.</p> <p>He froze, flask tilted to his lips, when the music stopped and he heard a light, flirtatious, most distinctly feminine laugh coming from the assembled crew.</p><p>It had to be her. He knew this simply because she was the only female aboard\u2014not because he recognized her laugh. And that had him tossing back another draught of brandy, to think that he\u2019d been several days in a beautiful woman\u2019s proximity and not yet made her laugh. How utterly unlike him.</p><p>How depressing.</p><p>A few paces more, and one glance confirmed his suspicion. There Miss Jane Turner sat, balancing a tankard between her fingertips, the skirts of her ill-fitting gown draped across an overturned crate. Damn it, hadn\u2019t he just told the chit she was to stay aft of the foremast?</p><p>Bailey struck a few notes on the pipes, and the crew launched into another rousing song. Gray waited a full verse before approaching her, prowling around her periphery and coming to rest behind her right shoulder. A few of the men gave him friendly nods, but most were too absorbed in their spirits and song to pay him any mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, flicking him a glance through the swaying lamplight.</p> <p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m simply leaning against the foremast. You know, this tall bit of timber you weren\u2019t to go past.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her drink.</p><p>Gray pushed off the mast and crouched at her side. If she\u2019d turn and look at him, they would be eye-to-eye. But she didn\u2019t. \u201cThe better question is, what the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying myself,\u201d she said lightly, taking another drink. \u201cI suggest you do the same.\u201d She passed the tankard to him and applauded with wild enthusiasm as the song came to its tuneless end.</p><p>Gray peered at the half-empty tankard, then lifted it to his nose and sniffed. Straight, unadulterated rum, the girl was drinking. That would explain the enthusiasm. Her applause concluded, she snatched the tankard back and downed a swallow to do a sailor proud.</p><p>Bloody hell. Gray suspected the only thing worse than watching over a prim governess would be watching over a soused one.</p><p>\u201cGray!\u201d O\u2019Shea pushed through the crowd and thrust a brimming mug into his hand. \u201cJust in time for another round of toasts.\u201d O\u2019Shea lifted his own cup high. \u201cTo the fair Maureen, and her lovely bits. She\u2019s firm in the arse, and soft in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead,\u201d Gray interrupted, prodding the Irishman\u2019s bulk with his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cGot porridge for brains, if she dallies with the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>While the men laughed and drank \u201cTo fair Maureen,\u201d Gray reached for Miss Turner\u2019s elbow. \u201cCome along, then. You don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was invited here,\u201d she ground out. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no place for ladies.\u201d He squeezed her elbow firmly and lifted her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Gray,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not here to drink. I\u2019m here to see our little Miss Turner back to her cabin. It\u2019s past her bedtime.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. He glared right back.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gray,\u201d another sailor called. \u201cJust one toast.\u201d</p><p>Miss Turner raised her eyebrows and leaned into him. \u201cCome on, Mr. Grayson. Just one little toast,\u201d she taunted, in the breathy, seductive voice of a harlot. It was a voice his body knew well, and vital parts of him were quickly forming a response.</p><p>Siren.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He lifted his mug and his voice, all the while staring into her wide, glassy eyes. \u201cTo the most beautiful lady in the world, and the only woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>The little minx caught her breath. Gray relished the tense silence, allowing a broad grin to spread across his face. \u201cTo my sister, Isabel.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed to slits. The men groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun anymore, Gray,\u201d O\u2019Shea grumbled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve gone respectable.\u201d He tugged on Miss Turner\u2019s elbow.</p><p>\u201cAnd good little governesses need to be in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, if you please.\u201d She jerked away from him and turned to face the assembled crew. \u201cI haven\u2019t made my toast yet. We ladies have our sweethearts too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Bawdy murmurs chased one another until a ripple of laughter caught them up. Gray stepped back, lifting his own mug to his lips. If the girl was determined to humiliate herself, who was he to stop her? Who was he, indeed?</p><p>Swaying a little in her boots, she raised her tankard. \u201cTo Gervais. My only sweetheart, mon cher petit lapin.\u201d</p><p>My dear little rabbit? Gray sputtered into his rum. What a fanciful imagination the chit had.</p><p>\u201cMy French painting master,\u201d she continued, slurring her words, \u201cand my tutor in the art of passion.\u201d</p><p>The men whooped and whistled. Gray plunked his mug on the crate and strode to her side. \u201cAll right, Miss Turner. Very amusing. That\u2019s enough joking for one evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s joking?\u201d she asked, lowering her mug to her lips and eyeing him saucily over the rim. \u201cHe loved me. Desperately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe French do everything desperately,\u201d he muttered, beginning to feel a bit desperate himself. He knew she was spinning na\u00efve schoolgirl tales, but the others didn\u2019t. The mood of the whole group had altered, from one of good-natured merriment to one of lust-tinged anticipation. These were sailors, after all. Lonely, rummed-up, woman-starved, desperate men. And to an innocent girl, they could prove more dangerous than sharks.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have loved you too much, could he?\u201d Gray grabbed her arm again. \u201cHe seems to have let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he did.\u201d She sniffed, then flashed a coquettish smile at the men. \u201cI suppose that means I need a new sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>That was it. This little scene was at its end.</p><p>Gray crouched, grasped his wayward governess around the thighs, and then straightened his legs, tossing her over one shoulder. She let out a shriek, and he felt the dregs of her rum spill down the back of his coat.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, you brute!\u201d She squirmed and pounded his back with her fists.</p><p>Gray bound her legs to his chest with one arm and gave her a pat on that well-padded rump with the other.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he announced to the group, forcing a roguish grin, \u201cwe\u2019ll be off to bed.\u201d</p><p>Cheers and coarse laughter followed them as Gray toted his wriggling quarry down the companionway stairs and into the ladies\u2019 cabin. With another light smack to her bum that she probably couldn\u2019t even feel through all those skirts and petticoats, Gray slid her from his shoulder and dropped her on her feet. She wobbled backward, and he caught her arm, reversing her momentum. Now she tripped toward him, flinging her arms around his neck and sagging against his chest. Gray just stood there, arms dangling at his sides.</p><p>Oh, bloody hell.</p><p>She stared up at him, with those wide, searching eyes. Fair glossed over with rum, those eyes, but beautiful nonetheless. And those lips\u2014soft, swollen, pouting, just begging to be kissed. God, he wanted to kiss her. Kiss her long and slow and deep, until he was drunk on her sweet, rum-scented breath.</p><p>She pursed those lovely lips together\u2014</p><p>And then she laughed. She bent her head and buried her face in his coat and laughed, long and loud, until her shoulders shook with it.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d he said weakly. Weakly, because he didn\u2019t truly want her to stop. So stupid, this small thrill of triumph. At last, he\u2019d made the pretty girl laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is. Those men up there ... What do you think they think we\u2019re doing down here?\u201d</p><p>It took Gray a moment to follow her through that labyrinth of a question.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll think we\u2019re lovers,\u201d she cooed, bursting into laughter again.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019d better pray they do.\u201d He put both hands on her waist and pushed her away. But she wouldn\u2019t release his neck. They did a strange imitation of a Russian dance as he walked her backward, until she collided with a wall. He pinned her to the paneling with his hands on her hips and his most intimidating glare drilling into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d better pray that they think I\u2019m down here rogering you within an inch of your precious life. Because that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll sleep undisturbed tonight. They won\u2019t try a thing, if they think you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into the locks of hair at his nape. She toyed with them idly, letting her fingernails rake over his skin. Her bandaged palm brushed his neck.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. A muscle in his thigh began to quiver.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be using your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not using them much.\u201d She rested her chin on his chest and peered up at him. \u201cHow many teeth does a shark have, I wonder? It seemed like hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no ... no idea.\u201d He groaned as her finger traced the sensitive groove behind his ear. His eyelids fluttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t close your eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cI like the way you look at me. So hungry. So dangerous. As if you\u2019re a pirate ... and I\u2019m a prize worth far more than six pounds, eight shillings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk is what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. And you\u2019re a man. A big, strong man with the softest, most lovely hair.\u201d Her fingers slid up, caressing his scalp until he was fully, excruciatingly aroused.</p><p>She started giggling again. Gray had never been much for giggling women, but damned if her soft, rolling laughter wasn\u2019t driving him insane with desire. He could stop that giggling. He could kiss her quiet, fondle her breathless.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know why I\u2019m laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gray,\u201d she mimicked saucily, her hips wriggling under his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I\u2019ve gone respectable, he reminded himself, as of this voyage. Damned if he could remember why, or what was the bloody rush. Why hadn\u2019t he waited another month to reform? The start of the new year would have been a logical choice. What kind of a fool made resolutions in December?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anyway,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s your hair. It\u2019s such a beautiful color, this dark, delicious brown, with the red undertones all through. And up here\u201d\u2014her fingers danced up his temples\u2014\u201clittle strands of gold.\u201d She frowned with concentration, as though it cost her a great deal of effort to focus her eyes. \u201cIt reminds me how, from the very first time I saw you, I\u2019ve been wanting ...\u201d</p><p>She broke off giggling again.</p><p>And damn it, now he did want to know why. He wanted very, very much to know why. Because Gray didn\u2019t find this situation amusing in the slightest. His body was aching with quite serious need. What ever scraps of resolve he possessed were quickly disintegrating, and his trembling fingers couldn\u2019t\u2014or just plain wouldn\u2019t\u2014hold her off anymore. Releasing her hips, he braced both hands on the wall, caging her between his arms. There, now he wasn\u2019t even touching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she was touching him. Still stroking her soft fingers through his hair, now pressing her warm body to his. His straining erection finally met with the welcome friction of her belly, and it was all he could do not to grind against it. He ought to walk away. Walk straight out of the room without looking back.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. God, he just couldn\u2019t. She felt too good. She wanted him, and that felt too good. The wanting, he could resist. But this feeling of being wanted\u2014it was always his undoing. His little siren would pull him straight to his death, all the way to damnation, and he was literally inches away from giving in and enjoying the ride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting,\u201d she breathed, \u201cso very much ... to paint you.\u201d</p> <p>To paint him?</p><p>He laughed. Oh, what fun he could have with her. \u201cSweetheart, I ...\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s voice trailed off as a vivid image appeared in his mind. Not Miss Turner naked and writhing beneath him\u2014though that image would certainly haunt his dreams.</p><p>No, he saw her charcoal sketch of young Davy Linnet. The perception in it, the attention to detail. And suddenly, Gray formed a vision of himself through those all-seeing, artist\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He saw an unshaven brigand, inches away from plundering an innocent governess who was far from home and full in her cups. A man poised to break his word to his only brother, again\u2014as though it were an easy habit. A fraud in foppish boots, trying to buy his way into the graces of his sister and society because he lacked the merit to earn their respect. In that fraction of a second, Gray glimpsed his own portrait, and he did not like what he saw. He might never be the picture of respectability, but he\u2019d be damned if the world would remember him like this.</p> <p>With a harsh growl, he pushed off against the wall. She fell back against the paneling, her bandaged hands dangling at her sides.</p><p>\u201cThis is not going to happen,\u201d he said, as much to himself as to her. He paced away in agitation and ran his hands through his hair, as if he could brush off the memory of her delicate, teasing touch.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Don\u2019t you want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want anything from you. I don\u2019t want you to paint me. I don\u2019t want you to touch me. I don\u2019t want to see you distracting the crew. I don\u2019t want to see you baiting sharks. I don\u2019t want to see you. At all.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. No more giggles now.</p><p>But Gray wasn\u2019t done. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d He shook a finger at her. \u201cYou are so bloody stupid. You have no idea how damned lucky you are. Do you know what could happen to you, crossing the ocean alone with no money and no chaperone? Do you have any notion what a dangerous game you play, going addled with rum and then prancing before the crew like a common harlot?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted you,\u201d he said, bracing one hand on the wall above her shoulder and looming over her in an attitude of threat, \u201cI could have had you days ago, your very first night on this ship. I\u2019d probably have tired of you by now. Your innocence would be gone, and you\u2019d have thrown it away. For nothing. Maybe if you were especially good, I\u2019d have knocked a few shillings off your fare.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. The drunken gloss in them was gone.</p><p>Good. Maybe now she\u2019d behave with some sense. Hadn\u2019t he warned her from the first? He\u2019d never met a girl he couldn\u2019t disillusion. Gray took a step backward, then another. Easing his way toward the door.</p><p>\u201cSo be a good little governess, Miss Turner. Go to your berth, blockade the door, crawl into your bunk, and say your prayers. And thank Almighty God in Heaven that I don\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Curse the sun.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s eyelids fluttered open. A narrow crease of daylight greeted her, winking from underneath the door. She squeezed her eyes shut, recoiling in pain. Her head pounded. Her hands throbbed. Her body ached all over, no doubt from yesterday\u2019s wrestling matches with fish and men. Oh, God. Men.</p> <p>Fragmented memories of last night floated to the surface of her consciousness, began piecing themselves into a picture. A picture that made her sick.</p><p>She groped wildly for the water basin and retched into it. What on earth had she done? She\u2019d announced to a dozen disorderly sailors that she\u2019d just finished a torrid affair with a Frenchman and was currently searching for his replacement. Then she\u2019d plastered herself to Mr. Grayson, murmuring all manner of rubbish and winding her fingers through that dark, thick hair.</p><p>And oh, it had been so soft.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know which was more humiliating: the fact that she\u2019d offered herself to him with all the finesse and enthusiasm of a back-alley whore? Or the fact that he\u2019d refused?</p><p>I don\u2019t want you, he\u2019d said.</p><p>No, this was the most humiliating fact: For all her bodily aches and pains, the severest wound was to her pride. A proper, well-bred young lady would have praised God that, despite all her imprudent, scandalous behavior, she\u2019d awakened this morning with her virtue intact. But Sophia had long ago decided to leave her proper, well-bred life behind and embrace infamy. And now, infamy himself wouldn\u2019t have her.</p><p>I don\u2019t want you.</p><p>His words had cut her like a knife. Each time they echoed in her mind, the knife twisted.</p><p>Who would want her, after the way she\u2019d behaved? Heavens, if she hadn\u2019t been born into wealth and guarded so closely all these years, what kind of sordid end would she have come to? One that would make even a wanton dairymaid blush. If Toby could see her now, he\u2019d be congratulating himself on his lucky escape.</p><p>A light knock sounded at her door. Sophia winced.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Her voice was scratchy and feeble.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breakfast,\u201d came Stubb\u2019s voice. He cackled. \u201cCompliments of your sweetheart, Germaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGervais,\u201d she moaned, diving back under her blanket. Good Lord, how could she face him again? How could she face anyone on this ship?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t, it turned out, for quite some time.</p><p>She spent three whole days cloistered in her cabin, taking her meals in solitude, spending the daylight hours hunched over a sketch, venturing only to the privy and back. Stubb broke her seclusion a few times a day, to deliver meals and change the dressings on her wounds.</p><p>Eventually, her boredom eclipsed her embarrassment. By her estimate, there were three weeks or more remaining in this journey. She couldn\u2019t remain holed away in the cabin that long. She needed fresh air and light, and inspiration for her artist\u2019s eye.</p><p>On the fourth morning, Sophia removed the bandages from her hands and gingerly stretched the new pink skin covering her wounds. Then she gathered her drawing board and charcoal\u2014and any scrap of courage she could find\u2014and climbed abovedecks.</p><p>The ship was unnaturally quiet. Although she stared at the boards beneath her feet, she could feel all heads swiveling in her direction. Mr. Grayson\u2019s head wasn\u2019t among them. She would have sensed it, had he been there. She was all too familiar with the prickling heat of his gaze. Taking a deep breath, she hiked her chin, squared her shoulders, walked all of five paces to a low stool, and sat down. There, that hadn\u2019t been so difficult.</p><p>She was vaguely conscious of the sailors talking and laughing among themselves. No doubt her antics four nights ago were the source of their amusement. Sophia didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if any of them approached her, hoping to be the next \u201cGervais.\u201d Despite the humiliation of being hauled from the deck in such barbaric fashion, she hoped Mr. Grayson had been correct in saying they\u2019d not make advances if they thought she was his.</p><p>Of course, if they thought she was his, they were dead wrong. I don\u2019t want you.</p><p>Enough. She\u2019d been reliving those events for days now, ruminating over the implications and castigating herself\u2014and, when regrets became tiresome, savoring the memory of his wavy hair caught in the webs of her fingers, or the sensation of his strong hands encircling her waist ...</p><p>Enough. It was time to go back to work. Once she put charcoal to paper, a bubble of concentration formed around her, blocking out all distractions. She drew a kitten, of all things. A kitten, with wide eyes and sharp little claws, wiggling back on its hindlegs as if preparing to pounce. Pounce on what, she had not yet decided.</p><p>A shadow fell over her paper, and a low whistle sounded from some feet above. Sophia froze, afraid to look up.</p><p>\u201cWould ye look at that. Got his sights on a wee mousie, has he?\u201d</p><p>It was O\u2019Shea. Sophia sighed with relief. She didn\u2019t know all the crew by name yet, but O\u2019Shea\u2019s thick brogue\u2014and mammoth size\u2014distinguished him from the crowd. \u201cI hadn\u2019t yet decided,\u201d she answered him, tilting her head to the side. \u201cI was thinking, perhaps a cricket. Or maybe a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave puss.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shielded her eyes with her hand and peered up at the Irishman\u2019s face. His hard eyes wandered from her hand, to her face, to the sketch in her lap. He made a gruff noise in his throat\u2014the sort of noise men make when they\u2019re working up to saying something and don\u2019t quite know how to get it out, but want to keep up the aura of brute masculinity in the midst of their indecision.</p><p>He was making Sophia nervous. He meant to ask her something, and she was afraid to learn just what.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cThe crew ... We had it out between ourselves, Miss Turner. There were a bit o\u2019 scuffling, but I came out on top.\u201d He suddenly crouched before her, transforming his silhouette from tree-trunk to boulder in an instant. His craggy face split in a devilish grin. \u201cI get to be first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drew lots, Miss Turner. It\u2019s my turn next.\u201d Sophia looked up from her drawing board. Quinn stood before her, wringing his tarred sailor\u2019s cap in massive, knob-knuckled hands, wearing an expression more fit for a funeral than a portrait-sitting. \u201cDo take a seat, Mr. Quinn.\u201d</p><p>The man lowered his weight onto the crate opposite, bracing his arms on his knees. \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d</p><p>With her fingernail, Sophia sharpened the stub of charcoal. \u201cYou needn\u2019t do anything but sit there.\u201d She gave him a small smile, then quickly looked down again, as it clearly made him uncomfortable. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about yourself?\u201d She directed her question to the paper as she began to rough in the oval of his face.</p><p>He scratched his chin. \u201cNot much to tell. Born in Yorkshire, I was. My father moved us to London when I was a lad. Got pressed into the Navy when I was sixteen, and I\u2019ve not called dry land home since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a wife then? No family of your own?\u201d Sophia kept her tone light, stealing furtive glances at Quinn\u2019s hawk\u2019s-beak nose and heavy brow between questions.</p><p>\u201cNot as yet, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you\u2019ve a sweetheart for Saturdays?\u201d</p><p>Quinn gave a rough laugh. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve one for every day of the week, Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stilled her charcoal and lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhat a relief to learn that your calendar is full, Mr. Quinn. For I warn you, I shan\u2019t be tempted to stray from Gervais.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, and his posture relaxed. Sophia was relieved, too. In the week since that night, her drunken toast had become just another shipboard joke. Mr. Grayson had returned abovedecks quickly enough to prevent the crew from suspecting an affair. Neither had the men taken Gervais seriously, thank Heaven, and she was coming to understand why. Most of their toasts weren\u2019t based in reality, either. Life at sea was a dangerous business. The men flirted with death on a daily basis, and they laughed off their close calls. But even if they could escape death, they could not escape loneliness. It was an ever-present shadow that they worked to shrug off\u2014through song, drink, embroidered tales. Sophia could wholeheartedly relate to that sentiment. She knew loneliness, all too well. And having a fantasy lover\u2014well, for the first time in her life, it didn\u2019t make her feel isolated. Here, she was just like everyone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She set to work on her sketch, keeping Quinn occupied with questions about his childhood, his home, his service in the war. Asking a man to recall his past invariably caused him to look away, as though his memories marched along the horizon. And while Quinn focused on that far-off time, Sophia could study his features openly without making him ill at ease. She noted the small divot between his eyebrows that appeared likely to become a furrow with time. She observed the tar embedded under his fingernails and in the creases of his palms; stains that would likely never wash off. And when he spoke of his nephew, she caught the faintest hint of a smile at the corner of his eyes.</p><p>How different it was, to draw people\u2014 real people with lives of sweat and labor, each a unique challenge. A far cry from sketching the same old vases of flowers and copies of copies of great masterworks. It gave Sophia a surprising amount of pleasure to simply talk with the men and gain their confidence. When they sat down before her, they trusted her to collect all their weathered features and tiny imperfections and commit them to paper, to assemble them into likenesses for their wives, their sweethearts, themselves. It felt somehow important. When she handed them the completed sketch, she gave them something of value that came from her talent, not from her fortune or her pretty face.</p><p>Of course, it also helped pass the time. And it kept Sophia, for those few hours a day, from thinking of him.</p> <p>He was everywhere on the ship; there was no escaping him. Even if she remained in her cabin most of the day, the skylight was always open, and through it flowed steady streams of sunshine and fresh air and his voice. Mr. Grayson, as she\u2019d learned from the first, was not a quiet man. He spoke often. He spoke loudly. And when he spoke, people listened. Including her.</p><p>The coarse shouts of the sailors, their muttered curses... the periodic clanging of the ship\u2019s bell, the scrape of chains across the deck, the creaking of the ship\u2019s wooden joints ... All these sounds had blended into a flotsam of sound that now floated beneath Sophia\u2019s consciousness. But never his voice. Mr. Grayson\u2019s baritone rang out over all, assailing her at the most awkward moments.</p><p>She would be dressing in her chamber, bared to the waist, lacing her stays with a newly gained efficiency, and Mr. Grayson would choose that particular moment to linger above the cabin and scandalize young Davy Linnet with a ribald joke. It irritated Sophia beyond reason, that he could bring her nipples to tight peaks without even occupying the same room. Without even knowing he did so.</p><p>At least, she prayed he did not know he did so. Sometimes she wondered.</p><p>She might have been the sole person Mr. Grayson aroused with a simple laugh or phrase, but she certainly wasn\u2019t the only one he affected. When the crew fell idle on a calm afternoon and the sluggish silence grew thick, those were the times Mr. Grayson chose to sing. As though he\u2019d been waiting for Nature herself to grow still in anticipation of his performance. He\u2019d burst out with a song\u2014some bawdy, coarse sailor\u2019s shanty, sung with all the reverence of a hymn\u2014and by the time he\u2019d reached the end of the first verse, the entire crew would have joined him. The chorus would ring from every mast, and down in the cabin, Sophia would smile despite her best efforts not to.</p> <p>At other times, he\u2019d smooth over a brewing argument with a jest, delivered in a smooth, disarming tone. Or his casual comment about the wind would be followed by swift adjustments in the rigging. With that clear, pleasing baritone, Mr. Grayson directed the crew just as surely as the rudder steered the ship.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Gray.\u201d O\u2019Shea\u2019s brogue lilted down through the skylight one warm morning, while Sophia was hard at work. Mr. Grayson responded, a raw longing in his voice. \u201cAye. It would be so easy to take her.\u201d</p><p>Sophia nearly dropped her quill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve the advantage of the wind,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.</p><p>\u201cAnd a faster ship,\u201d Gray replied. \u201cWe\u2019d be on her stern in no time.\u201d</p><p>Ships. Sophia breathed again. They were speaking of ships.</p> <p>\u201cThose were the days.\u201d O\u2019Shea gave a low whistle. \u201cOne cannonball to the rudder ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t even need that. She\u2019d accept our terms with little more than a signal shot and a smile.\u201d</p><p>She could hear that smile in his voice.</p><p>He continued, \u201cCannons are for amateurs. Seizing a ship intact ... it\u2019s all in the approach. From the moment that sail appears on the horizon, you act as though it\u2019s already yours. All that remains is to inform the other captain.\u201d</p><p>Now Sophia smiled with him. She knew exactly what he meant. It was the same attitude she\u2019d carried with her into the bank that day. A half-hour later, she\u2019d walked out with six hundred pounds. She wished she could tell Mr. Grayson that story. He would find it amusing, no doubt. She could almost hear the ringing laugh he\u2019d give when she described the red-faced clerk and the way she\u2019d ...</p><p>How curious.</p><p>She\u2019d barely spoken with Mr. Grayson in over a week. How could she have done, after that horrid night? But somehow, through these overheard conversations and stray remarks, she\u2019d come to know him quite well. She\u2019d come to like him.</p><p>She\u2019d come to think of him as a friend. He\u2019d saved more than her life that day.</p> <p>There was no denying it now, after the conversation she\u2019d just overheard. She had to face up to the truth she\u2019d been avoiding.</p><p>He could have had her that night, so easily. Conquest was his specialty, as he\u2019d just said. Ships, women ... what ever Mr. Grayson wanted, he took. And he had wanted her, at least in the carnal sense, despite all his protests to the contrary. When she\u2019d pressed up against him so shamelessly, she\u2019d felt his unmistakable arousal. She\u2019d made herself his for the taking, and he had walked away.</p><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t the first person to guard her virtue. Her family, her schoolmistresses, her companions\u2014even her own betrothed\u2014all her life, she\u2019d been surrounded by a fortress of people, all devoted to keeping her untouched. Because her virtue was currency, a token to be bartered for social connections. Would any of those same people give two straws about her virginity, had Sophia been a lowborn, penniless orphan? She doubted it. But Mr. Grayson did. He thought her a poor, friendless governess, with no connections worth mentioning and no one to care. And still, he\u2019d guarded her virtue when, in a moment of drunken foolishness, she would have thrown it away.</p><p>In running away from home, Sophia had seized control of her fortune. But she\u2019d also seized control of her body. Her nouveau-riche parents had been desperate for one of their daughters to marry a title. When her older sister, Kitty, had failed to do so, their hopes had transferred to Sophia. But to marry without passion or love, simply for money and connections\u2014it would have made her the worst sort of whore. Sophia didn\u2019t want to lose her virginity as a means of completing a transaction. She dreamed of a different experience, one of passion and emotion and breathtaking romance.</p><p>And she\u2019d have lost that dream, if not for him.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d been right. Maybe she ought to thank Almighty God in Heaven that he didn\u2019t want her.</p><p>What did it mean then, that she couldn\u2019t?</p><p>Rising to her feet, she packed away her quill and ink. Maybe she couldn\u2019t tell Mr. Grayson the story of her own conquest. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t speak to her at all. But the day was fine, and there was a sail on the horizon, and she simply couldn\u2019t stay put in the cabin a moment longer. She wanted to be in the center of the activity, enjoying the warm rays of the sun. Oh, who was she fooling?</p><p>She wanted to be near him.</p><p>Gray froze as Miss Turner emerged from the hold. For weeks, she\u2019d plagued him\u2014by day, he suffered glimpses of her beauty; by night, he was haunted by memories of her touch. And just when he thought he\u2019d finally wrangled his desire into submission, today she\u2019d ruined everything. She\u2019d gone and changed her dress.</p><p>Gone was that serge shroud, that forbidding thundercloud of a garment that had loomed in his peripheral vision for weeks. Today, she wore a cap-sleeved frock of sprigged muslin.</p><p>She stepped onto the deck, smiling face tilted to the wind. A flower opening to greet the sun. She bobbed on her toes, as though resisting the urge to make a girlish twirl. The pale, sheer fabric of her dress billowed and swelled in the breeze, pulling the undulating contour of calf, thigh, hip into relief.</p><p>Gray thought she just might be the loveliest creature he\u2019d ever seen. Therefore, he knew he ought to look away.</p><p>He did, for a moment. He made an honest attempt to scan the horizon for clouds. He checked the hour on his pocket watch, wound the small knob one, two, three, four times. He wiped a bit of salt spray from its glass face. He thought of England. And France, and Cuba, and Spain. He remembered his brother, his sister, and his singularly ugly Aunt Rosamond, on whom he hadn\u2019t clapped eyes in de cades. And all this Herculean effort resulted in nothing but a fine sheen of sweat on his brow and precisely thirty seconds\u2019delay in the inevitable.</p><p>He looked at her again.</p><p>Desire swept through his body with startling intensity. And beneath that hot surge of lust, a deeper emotion swelled. It wasn\u2019t something Gray wished to examine. He preferred to let it sink back into the murky depths of his being. An unnamed creature of the deep, left for a more intrepid adventurer to catalog.</p><p>Instead, he examined Miss Turner\u2019s new frock. The fabric was of fine quality, the sprig pattern evenly stamped, without variations in shape or hue.</p><p>The dressmaker had taken great pains to match the pattern at the seams. The sleeves of the frock fit perfectly square with her shoulders; in a moment of calm, the skirt\u2019s single flounce lapped the laces of her boots. Unlike that gray serge abomination, this dress was expensive, and it had been fashioned for her alone.</p><p>But it no longer fit. As she turned, Gray noted how the neckline gaped slightly, and the column of skirt that ought to have skimmed the swell of her hip instead caught on nothing but air.</p><p>He frowned. And in that instant, she turned to face him. Their gazes caught and held. Her own smile faded to a quizzical expression. And because Gray didn\u2019t know how to answer the unspoken question in her eyes, and because he hated the fact that he\u2019d banished the giddy delight from her face, he gave her a curt nod and a churlish \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>And then he walked away.</p><p>Gray burst into the galley. \u201cMiss Turner is not eating.\u201d</p><p>The cramped, boxed-in nature of the space, the oppressive heat\u2014it seemed an appropriate place to take this irrational surge of resentment. If only his emotion could dissipate through the ventilation slats as quickly as steam.</p><p>\u201cAnd good morning to you, too.\u201d Gabriel wiped his hands on his apron without glancing up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not eating,\u201d Gray repeated evenly. \u201cShe\u2019s wasting away.\u201d He didn\u2019t even realize his hand had balled into a fist until his knuckles cracked. He flexed his fingers impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWasting away?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s face split in a grin as he picked up a mallet and attacked a hunk of salted pork. \u201cNow what makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer dress no longer fits properly. The neckline of her bodice is too loose.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stopped pounding and looked up, meeting Gray\u2019s eyes for the first time since he\u2019d entered the galley. The mocking arch of the old man\u2019s eyebrows had Gray clenching his teeth. They stared at each other for a second. Then Gray blew out his breath and looked away, and Gabriel broke into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d live to see the day,\u201d the old cook finally said, \u201cwhen you would complain that a beautiful lady\u2019s bodice was too loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s a beautiful lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked up sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not merely that she\u2019s a beautiful lady,\u201d Gray amended. \u201cShe\u2019s a passenger, and I have a duty to look out for her welfare.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be the captain\u2019s duty?\u201d</p><p>Gray narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know my duty well enough,\u201d Gabriel continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I\u2019m denying her food, now is it? I\u2019m thinking Miss Turner just isn\u2019t accustomed to the rough living aboard a ship. Used to finer fare, that one.\u201d</p><p>Gray scowled at the hunk of cured pork under Gabriel\u2019s mallet and the shriveled, sprouted potatoes rolling back and forth with each tilt of the ship.</p> <p>\u201cIs this the noon meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis, and biscuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order the men to trawl for a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be the captain\u2019s duty?\u201d Gabriel\u2019s tone was sly. Gray wasn\u2019t sure whether the plume of steam swirling through the galley originated from the stove or his ears. He didn\u2019t care for Gabriel\u2019s flippant tone. Neither did he care for the possibility of Miss Turner\u2019s lush curves disappearing when he\u2019d never had any chance to appreciate them. Frustrated beyond all reason, Gray turned to leave, wrenching open the galley door with such force, the hinges creaked in protest. He took a deep breath to compose himself, resolving not to slam the door shut behind him. Gabriel stopped pounding. \u201cSit down, Gray. Rest your bones.\u201d</p><p>With another rough sigh, Gray complied. He backed up two paces, slung himself onto a stool, and watched as the cook grabbed a tin cup from a hook on the wall and filled it, drawing a dipper of liquid from a small leather bucket. Then Gabriel set the cup on the table before him. Milk.</p> <p>Gray stared at it. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Gabriel. I\u2019m not six years old anymore.\u201d</p><p>The old man raised his eyebrows. \u201cWell, seeing as how you haven\u2019t outgrown a visit to the kitchen when you\u2019re in a sulk, I thought maybe you\u2019d have a taste for milk yet, too. You did buy the goats.\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. He lifted the cup to his lips and sipped cautiously at first, paused, then drained the cup quickly, as if it held rum rather than goat\u2019s milk. It coated his tongue, tasting bland and creamy and smooth. Innocent. Gray looked down at the empty cup ruefully. He wished he\u2019d made it last a bit longer.</p><p>Gabriel took up his mallet and started pounding again, and Gray looked up sharply, about to ask the old man to leave off and find some quieter occupation. A task more conducive to ... to Gray\u2019s pondering, or yearning, or regretting, or what ever damn fool thing he\u2019d sat down to do. But a glimpse of something fluttering behind the cook\u2019s shoulder stole the complaint from his lips.</p><p>Another sketch\u2014this one of Gabriel\u2014hung on the wall above the water cask. It swiveled gently on a single tack; or rather, the paper hung plumb with gravity while the whole ship swiveled around it. She\u2019d captured Gabriel\u2019s toothy, inoffensive grin and the devilish gleam in his eye, and the effect of the paper\u2019s constant, subtle rocking was to make the image come alive. Softly, strangely\u2014the portrait of Gabriel was laughing. Gray shook himself. Laughing at him, most likely.</p><p>\u201cShe comes here?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cAye. That she does. Every morning.\u201d Gabriel straightened his hunched spine and adopted a cultured tone. \u201cWe take tea.\u201d</p><p>Gray frowned. One more place he\u2019d have to avoid\u2014the galley at morning teatime. \u201cSee to it that she eats something. Slip more milk in her tea. Make her treacle duff every day, if she cares for it. Are you giving her a daily ration of lime juice?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled down at the salt pork. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Gabriel\u2019s grin widened.</p><p>\u201cAnd stop grinning, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The old man practically sang the words as he pounded away at the meat. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d live to see the day.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p> <p>It was Christmas Eve morning, and Sophia\u2019s mood could only be described as morose. She sat in the cabin, which felt incongruously warm considering the holiday. Paper, inkwell, and quill sat before her on the table. By now, she\u2019d adapted her artistic technique to the ocean\u2019s ceaseless rolling. Her inkwell she affixed to the tabletop with a large dab of melted wax, so it could not easily be dislodged into her lap. The paper she braced under straps of leather she\u2019d removed from her trunk and stretched over the tabletop. And as she laid quill to paper, she kept the joints of her arm and wrist loose to buffer any sudden lurch of the ship.</p><p>She\u2019d illustrated three-quarters now of The Book, meticulously documenting the wanton dairymaid and her lover in each of their amorous attitudes. This morning, however, lewdness did not excite her. She flipped to the epilogue, wherein the gentleman proposed marriage to his lover and together they embarked on a long and fruitful union. Without any excess of concentration, Sophia began sketching a scene of the couple picnicking together beneath the shade of a willow tree. The dairymaid, now dressed in a lady\u2019s finery, sat on a blanket, legs extended before her, ankles crossed, her gaze searching the horizon. The gentleman lay with his head in her lap, looking up at the sky. They did not regard each other, but the easy intimacy of their postures gave them the air of a couple very much in love.</p><p>\u201cAhoy! Ship ahoy! Larboard bow! All hands!\u201d</p><p>The ship bustled into activity, and Sophia recognized the familiar sounds of the off-watch sailors thundering up from the forecastle, the mainsail being backed against the mast. The boat slowed and swung around. She recapped her inkwell and wiped her hands on her apron hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking\u201d with another ship could take minutes or hours, depending on the circumstance. Sometimes the captains merely exchanged names and destinations in a friendly \u201chow-do\u201d fashion, like two ladies crossing paths in the park. In other instances, long conversations and trade might take place. The other day, Mr. Grayson had boarded a Portuguese trader and returned with a crate of bartered goods.</p><p>But whether the encounter lasted minutes or hours, Sophia\u2014like everyone else aboard\u2014did not want to miss it. Nothing rivaled the sight of a sail approaching. It served as a comforting reminder that the Aphrodite was not simply drifting the globe alone. A promise that civilization and society awaited them at the end of this journey, somewhere.</p><p>She hastened abovedecks, shielded her eyes with her hand, and performed a slow circle. There was no ship to be seen, not even a single puffed sail hugging the horizon. Yet the men were all assembled on deck, buzzing with anticipation. All the sailors, at least. Mr. Grayson was notably absent, as were the captain, his officers, and Stubb.</p><p>Confused, Sophia approached Quinn. \u201cI thought we were to speak with another ship.\u201d</p><p>A wide grin split Quinn\u2019s weathered face. \u201cThat we are, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d Sophia scanned the distance again, and her voice trailed out to sea.</p><p>\u201cOh, \u2019tisn\u2019t a ship coming across the sea,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cNay, we\u2019re expecting a visitor come up from the sea. We\u2019ve crossed the Tropic of Cancer. And that means we\u2019ve got to appease old Triton before we go any further.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked around at the milling crewmen. \u201cTriton? Up from the sea? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sailors\u2019 tradition, miss.\u201d O\u2019Shea approached, his thick brogue cutting through Sophia\u2019s confusion. \u201cThe Sea King himself comes aboard to have a bit of sport with those crossing the Tropic for the first time, like the new boy there.\u201d He nodded toward Davy, who stood to the side, looking every bit as confused as Sophia but unwilling to own to it. Quinn crossed his massive forearms over his chest, stacking them like logs. \u201cAnd Triton always collects his tax, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis tax?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>O\u2019Shea gave her a sly look. \u201cBest be ready with a coin or two, Miss Turner. If you can\u2019t pay his tax, old Triton just might sweep ye down to the depths with him and keep ye there forever.\u201d</p><p>Quinn chuckled, shooting the Irishman a knowing look. \u201cKnowing old Triton, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he did just that.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Shea winked at the crewman. \u201cCould hardly blame him.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s heart pounded, and with every wild thump it slammed against the purse secured beneath her stays. Was this \u201cTriton\u201d the seafaring equivalent of a highwayman, then? Some sort of pirate?</p><p>\u201cWhere are the officers?\u201d she asked Quinn. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the captain greet any approaching vessel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain and his mates tend to steer clear of Triton. Sailors\u2019business, this is.\u201d</p><p>Well, if Sophia had been looking for an excuse to flee belowdecks, she\u2019d just been handed one. But before she could move, a voice called out, \u201cAll hands at attention! Prepare to greet yer king! The ruler of the ocean depths himself, and with him today comes his fair mistress, the Queen!\u201d</p><p>Coarse laughter rippled through the crowd. None of the sailors seemed the least bit distressed at receiving this visitor, Sophia noted. Of course, none of them had much to lose.</p><p>Two sailors hauled on ropes, hoisting the jolly boat up to the ship\u2019s side, revealing two apocryphal figures standing in the center of the small craft. At first glance, Sophia only saw clearly the shorter of the two, a gruesome creature with long tangled hair and a painted face, wearing a tight-fitting burlap skirt and a makeshift corset fashioned from fishnet and mollusk shells. The Sea Queen, Sophia reckoned, a smile warming her cheeks as the crew erupted into raucous cheers. A bearded Sea Queen, no less, who bore a striking resemblance to the Aphrodite\u2019s own grizzled steward. Stubb.</p><p>Sophia craned her neck to spy Stubb\u2019s consort, as the foremast blocked her view of Triton\u2019s visage. She caught only a glimpse of a white toga draped over a bronzed, bare shoulder. She took a jostling step to the side, nearly tripping on a coil of rope.</p><p>\u201cFoolish mortals! Kneel before your king!\u201d</p><p>The assembled sailors knelt on cue, giving Sophia a direct view of the Sea King. And even if the blue paint smeared across his forehead or the strands of seaweed dangling from his belt might have disguised him, there was no mistaking that persuasive baritone.</p><p>Mr. Grayson.</p><p>There he stood, tall and proud, some twenty feet away from her. Bare-chested, save for a swath of white linen draped from hip to shoulder. Wet locks of hair slicked back from his tanned face, sunlight embossing every contour of his sculpted arms and chest. A pagan god come swaggering down to earth.</p><p>He caught her eye, and his smile widened to a wolfish grin. Sophia could not for the life of her look away. He hadn\u2019t looked at her like this since ...</p><p>since that night. He\u2019d scarcely looked in her direction at all, and certainly never wearing a smile. The boldness of his gaze made her feel thoroughly unnerved, and virtually undressed. Until the very act of maintaining eye contact became an intimate, verging on indecent, experience. If she kept looking at him, she felt certain her knees would give out. If she looked away, she gave him the victory. There was only one suitable alternative, given the circumstances. With a cheeky wink to acknowledge the joke, Sophia dropped her eyes and curtsied to the King. Mr. Grayson laughed his approval. Her curtsy, the crew\u2019s gesture of fealty</p><p>\u2014he accepted their obeisance as his due. And why should he not? There was a rightness about it somehow, an unspoken understanding. Here at last was their true leader: the man they would obey without question, the man to whom they\u2019d pledge loyalty, even kneel.</p><p>This was his ship.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the owner of this craft?\u201d he called. \u201cOh, right. Someone told me he\u2019s no fun anymore.\u201d</p><p>As the men laughed, the Sea King swung over the rail, hoisting what looked to be a mop handle with vague aspirations to become a trident.</p><p>\u201cBring forth the virgin voyager!\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s stomach gave a panicked flutter. What in God\u2019s name did Mr. Grayson intend to do to her? She half-feared, half-yearned to find out. Then the flutter spread pleasantly downward, and the balance tipped in favor of yearning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the sailors took no notice of her. Instead they pushed Davy Linnet to the fore.</p><p>\u201cHere he is, yer majesty!\u201d Quinn called out. \u201cNew boy, first time crossing the Tropic.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson leveled his \u201ctrident\u201d at the lad. \u201cIf you wish to cross my sea, young man, you must submit yourself to questioning. And you must tell the truth, do you understand? No one lies to the Sea King. If you attempt to deceive me, I shall know it. And then I\u2019ll suck you down into the depths of the ocean to live with the eels, never to be heard from again.\u201d</p> <p>Davy glanced around him, looking uncertain whether to laugh or tremble.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, your majesty,\u201d Triton corrected.</p><p>Davy shuffled his feet. \u201cAye, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>A pair of crewmen pushed a barrel against the mast, and Davy was made to stand upon it. Somewhere in the crowd, a sailor made a crude remark.</p> <p>The men erupted into laughter.</p><p>Mr. Grayson banged his mop-handle trident on the deck for silence\u2014once, twice. The men hushed, and he turned to Davy. \u201cNow then, boy, tell me your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavy Linnet, sir.\u201d</p><p>Bang went the mop handle. \u201cYour majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavy Linnet, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your age, Davy Linnet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifteen, sir.\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p><p>Davy jumped. \u201cFifteen, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson began to circle the lad at a leisurely pace. \u201cFrom whence do you hail, Davy Linnet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Sussex. Town of Dunswold. Yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many siblings have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive, yer majesty. Four sisters and one brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your parents living?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth, sir. Er, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson turned slowly on his heel, his arm muscles flexing as he propped the makeshift trident on one shoulder. The drape of his toga slipped, and he casually repositioned the fabric with his free hand. But not before Sophia glimpsed a shocking scar near his collarbone\u2014an irregular circle of pink, puckered flesh nearly the size of her palm. She pressed her own hand to her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd tell me, Davy Linnet,\u201d Mr. Grayson continued, \u201cgiven a choice, do you prefer brown bread or white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAle or grog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrog, yer majesty.\u201d Davy began to relax, a shy smile playing on his face. Clearly, he\u2019d anticipated a harsher interrogation than this. He\u2019d anticipated correctly.</p><p>\u201cEver stolen anything, Davy Linnet?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s smile vanished, and his brow creased. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you\u201d\u2014Mr. Grayson leveled the mop handle at the boy\u2014\u201cever stolen anything? Are you a thief?\u201d</p><p>Davy hedged. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve nicked a scrap here and there in my time. Food, mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly?\u201d</p><p>Davy\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cMostly.\u201d Mr. Grayson held his silence, but the youth did not elaborate. Finally, he added, \u201cWeren\u2019t much to go around in the Linnet house.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson gave him a stern look. \u201cSo hunger excuses theft, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, sir. No, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you steal from your crewmates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Davy shot back, resolute. He looked around at the sailors. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p><p>\u201cNo, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson turned a slow circle. \u201cWhat if you were hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, yer majesty. Not from my crewmates. Can\u2019t steal from those as share everything. If I\u2019m going hungry, it means everyone\u2019s going hungry.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson gave a stiff nod, obviously satisfied with Davy\u2019s response. He paused a long beat. Then his posture changed abruptly as he leaned back against the ship\u2019s rail. \u201cHave you a wife, Davy Linnet?\u201d</p><p>The boy chuckled, obviously relieved at the change of subject. \u201cNo, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I do hope it\u2019s not for lack of trying. How many sweethearts have you had?\u201d</p><p>Davy\u2019s cheeks colored. \u201cNone, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTumbled any girls, Davy Linnet?\u201d</p><p>Davy\u2019s face went scarlet. He mumbled, \u201cN-no.\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p><p>\u201cNo, yer majesty,\u201d the boy amended quickly. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>This last drew a roar of laughter from the crew and a smirk from the Sea King. Davy\u2019s posture relaxed.</p><p>\u201cHow about love? Ever been in love, Davy Linnet?\u201d</p><p>The boy went rigid again. His eyes flitted to Sophia for an instant, and her heart squeezed. She knew the boy harbored an infatuation for her\u2014everyone aboard the ship knew it\u2014and she knew just as certainly it wasn\u2019t anything to approach the love he\u2019d one day feel for a wife. But then, one couldn\u2019t tell a fifteen-year-old his emotions were less than real. The silence stretched as the entire assembly awaited the boy\u2019s response. Quinn grinned and winked at Sophia. Davy swallowed hard. Mr. Grayson rapped his staff against the barrel, causing Davy to sway.</p><p>\u201cThe truth, boy. Or the eels.\u201d</p><p>The boy studied his feet for a moment. Then his head shot up and he met Mr. Grayson\u2019s eyes directly. \u201cAye, sir. I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>Raucous laughter burst like a thunderclap, quickly organizing itself into a bawdy chant. Davy\u2019s face flushed red as a cake of vermillion. Sophia bit her lip, inwardly aching for him. Not even when he\u2019d climbed the mast that first day at sea, white-knuckled and shaking with fear, had she ever witnessed such courage. The irony pricked at the corners of her eyes. She couldn\u2019t remember ever hearing those words and truly believing them\u2014not from her family, not from her friends. She\u2019d been courted by a legion of suitors and even been betrothed, but her first sincerely-uttered declaration of love came from this brave, earnest boy.</p><p>Davy\u2019s admission must have affected the Sea King, too. For though he kept his face carefully composed, Mr. Grayson neglected to bang his trident and elicit the required \u201cyer majesty.\u201d</p><p>Sophia longed to gauge Mr. Grayson\u2019s reaction further, but she kept her gaze trained on the youth. Davy stood tall, despite the jeering of his crewmates. She prepared to reward him with a gracious smile, should he look in her direction, though she suspected he\u2019d be too proud to do so. And he was. The boy stared stubbornly at Mr. Grayson. \u201cAny more questions, yer majesty?\u201d</p><p>Another storm of laughter swept through the crew.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cOnly one, Davy Linnet. Have you coin to pay your tax?\u201d</p><p>The lad blinked. \u201cTax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, your tax. There\u2019s a price for crossing these waters unharmed. And if you cannot pay it with coin, you must suffer the consequences.\u201d Mr. Grayson nodded toward Stubb, who pushed forward another barrel, this one open at the top and sloshing with liquid. A stench wafted from the barrel\u2014odors of tar and rotting fish mingling with the pervasive aroma of stirred-up bilge.</p><p>Davy\u2019s nose wrinkled as he regarded the noxious brew from his high vantage point. \u201cI ... I haven\u2019t a coin to my name, yer majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Davy Linnet,\u201d Mr. Grayson continued smoothly, \u201cif you can\u2019t pay the tax, you must be dunked.\u201d</p><p>Stubb pulled out a rusted strap of metal and waved it above his head.</p><p>\u201cDunked and shaved!\u201d</p><p>The men erupted into cheers. Levi and O\u2019Shea took Davy by either leg, lifting him toward the bilge-filled barrel.</p><p>Sophia knew she shouldn\u2019t intervene. The boy would come to no harm, she told herself. It was just a bit of bilge water. Clearly all of the sailors had suffered some similar hazing their first voyage, or they wouldn\u2019t be taking such glee in Davy\u2019s plight. But the lad had already endured too much humiliation, and endured too much of it on her account.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she called out.</p><p>To a one, the crewmen froze. A dozen heads swiveled to face her. Sophia swallowed and turned to Mr. Grayson. \u201cWhat about me? I\u2019m also a virgin voyager.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked as his gaze swept her from head to toe and then back up partway. \u201cAre you truly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I haven\u2019t a coin to my name. Do you plan to dunk and shave me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s an idea.\u201d His grin widened. \u201cPerhaps. But first, you must submit to an interrogation.\u201d</p><p>A lump formed in Sophia\u2019s throat, impossible to speak around. Mr. Grayson raised that sonorous baritone to a carrying pitch. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name then, miss?\u201d When Sophia merely firmed her chin and glared at him, he warned dramatically, \u201cTruth or eels.\u201d</p><p>Bang.</p><p>Excited whispers crackled through the assembly of sailors. Davy was completely forgotten, dropped to the deck with a dull thud. Even the wind held its breath in anticipation, and Sophia gave a slight jump when a sail smacked limp against the mast.</p><p>Though her heart pounded an erratic rhythm of distress, she willed her voice to remain even. \u201cI\u2019ve no intention of submitting myself to any interrogation, by god or man.\u201d She lifted her chin and arched an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not impressed by your staff.\u201d</p><p>She paused several seconds, waiting for the crew\u2019s boisterous laughter to ebb.</p><p>Mr. Grayson pinned her with his bold, unyielding gaze. \u201cYou dare speak to me that way? I\u2019m Triton.\u201d With each word, he stepped closer. \u201cKing of the Sea. A god among men.\u201d Now they stood just paces apart. Hunger gleamed in his eyes. \u201cAnd I demand a sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Her hand remained pressed against her throat, and Sophia nervously picked at the neckline of her frock. This close, he was all bronzed skin stretched tight over muscle and sinew. Iridescent drops of seawater paved glistening trails down his chest, snagging on the margins of that horrific scar, just barely visible beneath his toga.</p><p>\u201cA sacrifice?\u201d Her voice was weak. Her knees were weaker.</p><p>\u201cA sacrifice.\u201d He flipped the trident around, his biceps flexing as he extended the blunt end toward her, hooking it under her arm. He lifted the mop handle, pulling her hand from her throat and raising her wrist for his inspection.</p><p>Sophia might have yanked her arm away at any moment, but she was as breathless with anticipation as every other soul on deck. She\u2019d become an observer of her own scene, helpless to alter the drama unfolding, on the edge of her seat to see how it would play out.</p><p>He studied her arm. \u201cAn unusually fine specimen of female,\u201d he said casually. \u201cYoung. Fair. Unblemished.\u201d Then he withdrew the stick, and Sophia\u2019s hand dropped to her side. \u201cBut unsatisfactory.\u201d</p><p>She felt a sharp twinge of pride. Unsatisfactory? Those words echoed in her mind again. I don\u2019t want you.</p><p>\u201cUnsatisfactory. Too scrawny by far.\u201d He looked around at the crew, sweeping his makeshift trident in a wide arc. \u201cI demand a sacrifice with meat on her bones. I demand ...\u201d</p><p>Sophia gasped as the mop handle clattered to a rest at her feet. Mr. Grayson gave her a sly wink, bracing his hands on his hips in a posture of divine arrogance. \u201cI demand a goat.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>The stench of live goats had permeated the Aphrodite for weeks. Now, the more pleasing aroma of cooked goat battled for precedence. Gray found it a refreshing change, but the remaining livestock didn\u2019t seem to agree. They bleated loudly in their berths, protesting the sudden decrease in their number.</p><p>Gray picked his way through the barn that had formerly been the gentlemen\u2019s cabin, careful not to brush up against anything. He\u2019d just bathed and dressed, and it wouldn\u2019t do to show up at Christmas Eve dinner with goat dung on his boots.</p><p>He passed into the galley and was greeted by a cloud of fragrant steam. The exotic scent of spices mingled with the tang of roasting meat. Startled, Gabriel choked on a sip from a tankard. In the corner, Stubb quickly shoved something behind his back. The old men\u2019s eyes shone with more than holiday merriment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHappy Christmas, Gray.\u201d Gabriel extended the tankard to him. \u201cHere. We poured you some wine.\u201d</p><p>Gray waved it off with a chuckle. \u201cThat my new Madeira you\u2019re sampling?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nodded as he downed another sip. \u201cThought I should taste it before you serve it to company. You know, to be certain it ain\u2019t poisoned.\u201d</p> <p>He drained the mug and set it down with a smile. \u201cNo, sir. Not poisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the figs? The olives? The spices? I assume you checked them all, too? For caution\u2019s sake, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Stubb said, pulling his own mug from behind his back and taking a healthy swallow. \u201cEveryone knows you can\u2019t trust a Portuguese trader.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. He plucked an olive from a dish on the table and popped it into his mouth. Rich oil coated his tongue. \u201cDid you find the crate easily enough?\u201d he asked Stubb, reaching for another olive.</p><p>The old steward nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s all laid out, just so. Candles, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeels like Christmas proper.\u201d Gabriel tilted his head. \u201cMiss Turner even gave me a gift.\u201d</p><p>Gray followed the motion, squinting through the steam.</p><p>I\u2019ll be damned.</p><p>A small canvas sat propped on the cabinet. Painted on it was a deceptively simple seascape. Masterful brushstrokes captured the swirling motion of the water and the dance of the breeze. Fading sunlight kissed the waves with brilliance.</p><p>And as was the case with all Miss Turner\u2019s work, Gray found himself genuinely moved by it\u2014not only by the painting\u2019s beauty, but by the care that occasioned its creation. She\u2019d given Gabriel a window for the galley, just as surely as if she\u2019d cut a hole in the ship\u2019s side and installed a pane of glass. She\u2019d given him a gift, indeed.</p><p>Stubb said, \u201cShe made a sketch of Bailey for his wife. Now he\u2019s fashioning her these little canvases from spare bits of wood and sailcloth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Bailey have sails to mend?\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m not paying the man to make canvases.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shrugged, throwing him an offended look. \u201cI just give the man his biscuit three times a day. I don\u2019t keep track of how he spends his time.\u201d</p><p>Gray knew he was being an ass, but he found it damned maddening, this constant assault of her artistry. These little scraps of beauty strewn about his ship. Dazzling his eyes, yanking him about with little tugs on his gut. Their collective effect left Gray feeling more than a bit resentful. But not so resentful that he\u2019d ceased looking for them\u2014hell, hoping to find them\u2014in a manner that verged uncomfortably on habit.</p><p>Not that any of her sketches or paintings were for him. He turned to Stubb. \u201cDid she give you a present, too?\u201d</p><p>The man smiled through his grizzled beard. \u201cAye. It\u2019s in steerage. Lovely little painting of a mermaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Gray sanded his palm on his bearded jaw.</p><p>The steward picked up a wooden spoon and prodded Gray in the side.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you, you know. Get in there, so we can serve.\u201d</p> <p>Gray hurried through the passage before Stubb could prod him again. He traversed the small corridor of the officers\u2019 berths and entered the captain\u2019s cabin. The men rose as he entered, Joss at the head of the narrow table, flanked by the other officers.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he mumbled, suddenly self-conscious. He nodded to the men, then turned and made a bow to Miss Turner before sliding into the chair opposite.</p><p>Stripes.</p><p>Out of habit, Gray immediately noted the answer to his question. The persistent, ever-present question that plagued his days, popped into his mind whenever he saw her or anticipated seeing her. Which was nearly all of the time.</p><p>Which frock would she be wearing? Sprigs or stripes?</p><p>Gray harbored a slight preference for the stripes. Not only did the darker color suit her complexion, but the neckline plunged in an enticing manner, displaying a wedge of sheer chemise. The sprigged gown had a higher, square neckline, and only one flounce to this frock\u2019s two. But then ... The sprigged gown had tiny buttons down the side\u2014fourteen buttons, to be exact, and though just mentally undoing them was enough to drive Gray mad with frustration, that mile-long stretch of minuscule pearl dots was some comfort. The fastenings of this striped gown, by contrast, were completely invisible. Were there little hooks, he wondered, under the sleeves? Hidden in the seams somewhere?</p><p>Miss Turner coughed and shifted in her seat.</p><p>Dear God. Gray shook himself, realizing he\u2019d just spent the better part of a minute openly staring in the direction of her breasts. At a distance of no more than two feet. Worse\u2014he\u2019d wasted that blasted minute obsessing about hooks and buttons, when he could have been scanning for the shadow of an areola, or the crest of a nipple.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>And now he had no choice but to drop his gaze and study the china. It did look well, the porcelain. The acanthus pattern complemented the scrollwork on the silver quite nicely. Odd, to be drinking Madeira from teacups, but at least they were better than tin. The white drape beneath it all was nothing of quality, but the lighting was dim, and it would do. Gray put out a hand to straighten his fork.</p><p>\u201cThe table looks lovely,\u201d she said, to no one in particular. Dear God. Once again, she jolted him back into reality, and Gray realized he\u2019d spent the better part of two minutes now fussing over china and table linens. First dressmaking, now table-setting ... If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that her voice called straight to his swelling groin, Gray might have begun to question his masculinity.</p><p>What the hell was happening to him?</p><p>He wanted her. He wanted her body, quite obviously. More disturbing by far, he could no longer deny that he wanted her approval. And he wanted both with a near-paralyzing intensity, though he knew he could never have one without sacrificing the other.</p><p>Then she extended her slender wrist to reach for the teacup, and Gray remembered the reason for this entire display.</p><p>He wanted to see her eat.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Stubb?\u201d he growled, tetchy with hunger. All sorts of hunger.</p><p>\u201cRight behind you, sirs and madam.\u201d Stubb shuffled in, bearing a steaming tureen. \u201cFirst course, soup.\u201d He moved around the table, beginning with Miss Turner, ladling generous helpings of creamy chowder into their bowls.</p><p>Silence reigned, save for the light clink of silver on china. Gray ate his soup quickly, scarcely tasting it, scalding the roof of his mouth in the process. Then he sat back and sipped Madeira from his teacup, trying not to stare at her as she daintily spooned chowder to her lips. Perhaps he was going mad.</p><p>Next to him, Wiggins cleared his throat. \u201cYou must forgive us, Miss Turner. We seamen are poor dinner companions, I fear. We are accustomed to eating quickly, efficiently, with little conversation. And we are certainly unused to the company of a beautiful lady.\u201d</p><p>Gray coughed, setting his teacup down on its saucer with a crack. Miss Turner swallowed slowly and laid down her spoon. \u201cI am most grateful for company this evening, even of the quiet variety. I am no great conversationalist, myself.\u201d</p><p>Gray snorted. Not a conversationalist. The girl had coaxed the life story out of every sailor on this ship.</p><p>She had just picked up her spoon again when Joss spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou do not find the voyage too tedious, Miss Turner?\u201d Joss asked. \u201cI regret that you are left to entertain yourself, being the sole passenger.\u201d</p><p>She laid down her spoon. \u201cThank you, Captain, but I find sufficient activity to occupy my hands and my mind. Reading, sketching, walking the deck for fresh air and healthful exertion. I\u2019m surprisingly content, living at sea.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s heart gave an odd kick.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Christmas, Miss Turner. You are away from your home.\u201d Brackett\u2019s voice was cool. \u201cSurely you must miss your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I do.\u201d She folded her hands behind her half-full bowl of chowder. \u201cI miss ... Oddly enough, I miss oranges. We always had oranges at Christmas, when I was a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Joss, his lips curving in the rare hint of a smile. \u201cYes, so did we. Didn\u2019t we, Gray?\u201d</p><p>Oranges. They wanted oranges. As if it could be so simple, to go back to the time when happiness came in a knobby round package and fit in the palm of one\u2019s hand. And yet, were there oranges to be had at that moment, Gray would have traded the ship for a crate of them. He watched as Miss Turner lifted a spoonful of soup to her lips with agonizing slowness. He stared, fascinated, as her lips parted, revealing the tip of her tongue ...</p><p>\u201cI say, Miss Turner\u2014\u201d Wiggins again.</p><p>Her spoon paused in mid-air.</p><p>Gray crashed his fist on the table. \u201cChrist, man! Can\u2019t you see the lady is trying to eat?\u201d Crossing his arms, he slumped back in his chair. Its wooden joints creaked in protest.</p><p>And now everyone put down their spoons.</p><p>Gray felt their eyes on him. He kicked the table leg, frustrated with himself, with her, with his goddamned boots. They still pinched his feet. Stubb shuffled in, accompanied by Gabriel this time. \u201cMain course,\u201d the old steward called.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s meat-and-kidney pie,\u201d Gabriel announced proudly, setting the dish in the center of the table. \u201cMade the crust from biscuit meal. Thought my arm would fall off from pounding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s the roast!\u201d Stubb lowered his offering to the table, a well-browned haunch that smelled of grease and savory. Olives and small, white rounds of goat\u2019s-milk cheese ringed the meat.</p><p>\u201cThank you, gentlemen.\u201d Joss wrenched the carving knife from the roast, and a trickle of rich juices flowed forth.</p><p>Conversation was adjourned, by unanimous decree.</p><p>Generous helpings of meat and pie, along with second and third cups of Madeira, did much to improve the general mood. Seemingly gripped by holiday nostalgia, Wiggins prattled on and on about his children. During a particularly inane monologue on little Master Wiggins\u2019s affinity for his schoolmaster, Brackett pushed back from the table and excused himself to resume his watch on deck. Gray helped himself to more roast, taking the opportunity to slide an extra slice onto Miss Turner\u2019s plate. She glanced up at him, her expression a mixture of shock and reproach. And this was his reward for generosity.</p><p>He gave a tense shrug by way of excuse, then replaced the knife and fork and busied himself with his own food. He felt her staring at him. That was it. If she was entitled to stare at him, he was damned well going to stare back. And if this governess was going to reprimand him like an incorrigible charge ... well, then Gray was going to misbehave. Letting his silver clatter to the china, he balled his hands into fists and plunked them down on either side of his plate. \u201cYou say you miss your family, Miss Turner? I wonder at it.\u201d</p><p>Her glare was cold. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me in Gravesend you\u2019d nowhere to turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke the truth.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing my family since long before I left England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re dead?\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted with her fork. \u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not all?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and spoke in a low voice, though anyone who cared to listen might hear. \u201cWhat sort of relations allow a young woman to cross an ocean unaccompanied, to labor as a plantation governess? I should think you\u2019d be glad to be free of them.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>He picked up his fork and jabbed at a hunk of meat. His voice a low murmur, he directed the next question at his plate. \u201cOr perhaps they\u2019re glad to be free of you?\u201d</p><p>Something crushed his foot under the table. A pointy-heeled boot. Then, just as quickly, the pressure eased. But her foot remained atop his. The gesture was infuriating, and somehow wildly erotic.</p><p>He met her gaze, and this time found no coldness, no reproach. Instead, her eyes were wide, beseeching. They called to something deep inside him he hadn\u2019t known was there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Please, she mouthed. Don\u2019t.</p><p>She bit her lip, and he felt it as a visceral tug. That unused part of him stretched and ached. And at that instant, Gray would have sworn they were the only two souls in the room. In the world.</p><p>Until Wiggins spoke again, confound the man.</p> <p>\u201cHow strange you must find it, Miss Turner,\u201d the second mate said,</p><p>\u201ccelebrating the holiday in this tropical climate. Not a typical English Christmas, is it?\u201d</p><p>Sophia cleared her throat. \u201cNo indeed.\u201d God bless Mr. Wiggins. She extricated herself from Mr. Grayson\u2019s enigmatic gaze and reached for her Madeira. Loath to field further questions of any variety, she passed the burden of conversation like a hot serving dish. \u201cWould you agree, Captain Grayson?\u201d</p><p>Beneath the table, she allowed her foot to slide back down to the floor. That was a mistake. In the next heartbeat, his boot clamped over hers like a trap.</p><p>Sophia kept her gaze trained on the captain. His thin black eyebrows rose. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t say, Miss Turner. All of my Christmases have been spent at sea, or on Tortola.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia wriggled her foot madly, but it was no use. Mr. Grayson\u2019s Hessian pinned her nankeen half boot to the cabin floor. She shot him an angry glare, but he had taken a sudden interest in searching the depths of his Madeira.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Sophia replied to the captain. \u201cMr. Grayson,\u201d she said pointedly, hoping to draw the scoundrel\u2019s attention, \u201cmentioned to me that your father owns a plantation there. What crop did you tell me your father raises, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>He refused to look up. Shrugging, he set down his cup and began worrying his thumbnail. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar,\u201d the captain answered. \u201cIt was a sugar plantation, Miss Turner, but our father died several years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sophia forced herself to turn to the captain, though her gaze wanted to linger on Mr. Grayson\u2019s face, study the shadows that flickered there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d The words were a low, casual murmur. So faint, Sophia wondered if she\u2019d imagined them. She looked around the table. If anyone else had heard the remark, they gave no sign.</p> <p>Her foot stopped struggling beneath the weight of his boot, and the pressure eased. The contact remained.</p><p>\u201cWho manages the property now?\u201d She pushed an olive around her plate.</p><p>\u201cHave you an older brother, or a land agent?\u201d</p><p>The two brothers exchanged a strange look.</p><p>\u201cThe land is no longer in the family,\u201d Captain Grayson said tersely. \u201cIt was sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That must have been a difficult decision, to sell your boyhood home.\u201d</p><p>Captain Grayson rested one elbow on the table. \u201cOnce again, Miss Turner, I couldn\u2019t say. Was it, Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it what?\u201d Mr. Grayson clearly wished to evade the question. Sophia knew he\u2019d been heeding the conversation, and she winced with discomfort as his leg tensed, crushing her toes once more.</p> <p>\u201cPudding!\u201d With his usual flourish, Stubb swept through the cabin door and added the dish to the table. As he uncovered the dome-shaped pudding, the aromas of figs and spices and brandy mingled with the familiar comfort of treacle-scented steam. A Christmas miracle, indeed. Sophia\u2019s mouth watered.</p><p>\u201cThe lady asked a question, Gray.\u201d The captain leaned forward, ignoring both Stubb and pudding. His voice took on a steely edge. \u201cWas it a difficult decision, to sell our boyhood home? I\u2019ve told her I couldn\u2019t say, seeing as how I wasn\u2019t involved in that decision. So the question falls to you. Was it difficult?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson clenched his jaw. His eyes narrowed as he regarded his brother. \u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t difficult in the least. It was the only profitable course.\u201d</p><p>The captain\u2019s mouth quirked in a humorless smile, and he sat back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your answer, Miss Turner. Decisions never give my brother pause, so long as the profitable course is clear. He keeps his conscience in his bank account.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s gaze darted back and forth from brother to brother. The men warred silently, a battle of stony glares and firmed jaws and tight grips on silver. Then Mr. Grayson\u2019s posture suddenly relaxed, and, as Sophia had seen him do on so many occasions, he took the advantage with a roguish smile. Charm was always his weapon of choice.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why Gray\u2019s never married.\u201d Mr. Wiggins gave an easy chuckle. He leaned over the table to slice into the pudding, dispelling the tension between the brothers. \u201cA rich man may keep his conscience in a vault, but we poor men have to marry ours.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson made a show of smiling at the jest. But his grin faded, for a moment Sophia saw what she had never before noticed, in those dozen occasions. It cost him something, that roguish smile. Behind it, he looked ... weary. Empathy gripped her before she could push it away. She\u2019d spent many evenings in many ballrooms, struggling under the weight of feigned levity. Fooling everyone but herself.</p><p>He looked up suddenly and caught her staring. Sophia blushed, feeling as though she\u2019d walked in on him in his bath.</p><p>And that thought made her blush deeper still.</p><p>Mr. Wiggins rescued her again. \u201cWithout my wife, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with myself. I can\u2019t even decide what color waistcoat to order at the tailor</p><p>\u2019s.\u201d He gave Sophia a playful glance, his eyes merry with wine. \u201cDo tell, Miss Turner, how is it such decisions come naturally to the fairer sex?\u201d</p><p>Sophia smiled. \u201cFor you, Mr. Wiggins, the choice is clear. With your dark coloring, an ivory waistcoat would definitely suit you best.\u201d</p><p>The man beamed, tucking into his pudding. A trickle of brandy sauce dribbled down his lapel. Cursing, he dabbed it with his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cBut then, ivory does show stains most dreadfully.\u201d She looked down at her plate, testing the pudding\u2019s texture with her fork. \u201cYou see, sir, there are some of us for whom decisions are no trial. Living with those choices ...</p><p>now that is our burden.\u201d She gave Mr. Grayson a cautious glance. His boot released hers, and Sophia felt oddly bereft. She wiggled her toes inside her stocking. After all that time, she worried they might never regain sensation.</p><p>She need not have been concerned. For Mr. Grayson did not retract his foot. He merely moved it to the floor, to rest alongside hers. And then he stretched his leg and slid that foot forward, so that the edge of his boot caressed her from toe to heel.</p><p>Oh, yes. Her sensation was intact. And not only in her toes. A hot tingling spread like flames throughout her body, and her heart began to bounce in her chest. Sophia froze, her fork poised in mid-air. She stared down at her plate, afraid he\u2019d see the crimson staining her cheeks.</p><p>Then his ankle brushed hers. Her heart leapt into her throat. And before she knew what was happening, the warm weight of his calf was crooked around her own, his leg twining with hers in an intimate embrace. The posture instantly recalled their tussle with the shark\u2014boots lashed together, bodies entangled, chests heaving with the exhilaration of escape. Oh, and now Sophia blushed everywhere. Her lips, her nipples, the cleft between her legs\u2014she felt every pink part of her body swelling and turning deep red.</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with your pudding, Miss Turner?\u201d</p><p>Curse the arrogant charm in his voice. Curse her body\u2019s response to it. She closed her eyes, then opened them. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Teasing, teasing man. He\u2019d rejected her once before; she\u2019d be a fool to throw herself at him again. She ought to pull her leg away, Sophia told herself. Kick him in the shin; stab his thigh with her fork as though it were a slab of roast goat. But she didn\u2019t want to do any of those things. She wanted to sit like this for hours, letting his strong leg support her own. Feeling alive and exhilarated and desired ... and not the slightest bit alone. And beyond this dinner, this night, this secret embrace\u2014Sophia wanted more. She wanted to be as close to him as she possibly, humanly could. She wanted him. This night was her chance, and this time she wasn\u2019t scared or uncertain or drunk on rum. This time, she wouldn\u2019t let him get away.</p><p>The decision was easy to make. Living with it would be another matter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated boldly, looking up. No longer caring if he saw her wanton blush or noted her shallow breath or heard her wildly thumping pulse. His eyes issued a challenge, and she met it without blinking, trading him smile for smile. \u201cEverything is quite to my liking.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Joss turned on him the moment Gabriel cleared the last of the china.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was what?\u201d Gray pulled a flask from his breast pocket and offered it to his brother.</p><p>Joss waved it away. \u201cYou know damn well what I mean. Something\u2019s going on between you and Miss Turner, I know it.\u201d</p><p>Gray uncapped the flask and took a sip. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d He circled the table, discreetly examining the angle of the tablecloth and the perspective from the captain\u2019s chair. Surely Joss couldn\u2019t have seen what had taken place under the table. Even if his brother had noticed, he could demand all the answers he wished. Gray had no desire\u2014or words\u2014to explain it.</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d left England, Gray gave thanks for the thin, impractical leather of those dandified Hessians. The feel of her lithe, shapely leg against his ... She\u2019d accepted the contact so readily, blushed so attractively. Beneath that table, they\u2019d formed some sort of alliance. And then she had extended a clear verbal invitation.</p><p>If he went to her berth right now, she would be expecting him. At last, he could solve the mystery of what held together that damned striped frock. Or... he could simply rip it from her body.</p><p>Gray shoved the image aside before his groin could react further. Joss did his bit to provide distraction. \u201cHow did she know about the plantation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her in Gravesend, before we even set sail. The minute she mentioned Waltham.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cAnd on that topic,\u201d Gray continued, \u201cwhat the hell was that about?</p><p>Interrogating me about selling the land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner brought it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou continued it. Why this resentment now, Joss? It\u2019s been almost eight years, and until M\u2014\u201d Gray bit off the end of that sentence. Joss didn\u2019t need another reminder of his wife\u2019s death. \u201cUntil recently, you never once complained. At the time, you told me you understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time, I was nineteen years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was three-and-twenty. Not precisely a man of the world. I did my best. I\u2019ve done my best ever since. And if my best doesn\u2019t meet your high expectations, I don\u2019t know what to say. Except that it\u2019s no surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play the martyr with me. You\u2019re the one who didn\u2019t keep his word. And speaking of your word and its dubious worth, don\u2019t change the subject. I saw the looks you and Miss Turner were exchanging. The lady goes bright pink every time you speak to her. For God\u2019s sake, you put food on her plate without even asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s the crime in that?\u201d Gray was genuinely curious to hear the answer. He hadn\u2019t forgotten that shocked look she\u2019d given him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gray. You know very well one doesn\u2019t take such a liberty with a mere acquaintance. It\u2019s ... it\u2019s intimate. The two of you are intimate. Don\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do deny it. It isn\u2019t true.\u201d Gray took another swig from his flask and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cDamn it, Joss. Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to have to trust me. I gave you my word. I\u2019ve kept it.\u201d</p><p>And it was the truth, Gray told himself. Yes, he\u2019d touched her tonight, but he\u2019d never pledged not to touch her. He had kept his word. He hadn\u2019t bedded her. He hadn\u2019t kissed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, what he wouldn\u2019t give just to kiss her ...</p><p>He rubbed the heel of his hand against his chest. That same ache lingered there\u2014the same sharp tug he\u2019d felt when she\u2019d brought her foot down on his and pursed her lips into a silent plea. Please, she\u2019d said. Don\u2019t</p><p>. As if she appealed to his conscience.</p> <p>His conscience. Where would the girl have gathered such a notion, that he possessed a conscience? Certainly not from his treatment of her. A bitter laugh rumbled through his chest, and Joss shot him a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve scarcely spoken to the girl in weeks. You can\u2019t know the lengths I\u2019ve gone to, avoiding her. And it isn\u2019t easy, because she won\u2019t stay put in her cabin, now will she? No, she has to go all over the ship, flirting with the crew, tacking her little pictures in every corner of the boat, taking tea in the galley with Gabriel. I can\u2019t help but see her. And I can see she\u2019s too damn thin. She needs to eat; I put food on her plate. There\u2019s nothing more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>Joss said nothing, just stared at him as though he\u2019d grown a second head.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, what now? Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe what you\u2019re saying,\u201d his brother said slowly. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d</p> <p>Gray folded his arms and leaned against the wall. \u201cAnd what are you hearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered why you\u2019d done all this ... the dinner. Now I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Gray was growing exasperated. Most of all, because he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYou care for this girl.\u201d Joss cocked his head. \u201cYou care for her. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare for her.\u201d</p><p>Joss\u2019s expression was smug. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>The idea was too preposterous to entertain, but Gray perked with inspiration. \u201cSay I did care for her. Would you release me from that promise? If my answer is yes, can I pursue her?\u201d</p><p>Joss shook his head. \u201cIf the answer is yes, you can\u2014and should\u2014wait one more week. It\u2019s not as though she\u2019ll vanish the moment we make harbor. If the answer is yes, you\u2019ll agree she deserves that much.\u201d</p><p>Wrong, Gray thought, sinking back into a chair. Regardless of the answer, he knew she deserved far better. Damn it, he couldn\u2019t even enjoy the fantasy of destroying that striped frock. Because he knew she\u2019d only one other to wear, and he\u2019d be too concerned over whether she possessed the needle and thread to mend it. Because the pattern might never match up right again; the stripes would be off, and the effect would be a bit less lovely than before. Because he would have taken something from her, destroyed something beautiful and perfect ... and never again would she look at him with those clear, trusting eyes and tug on his heart. Please. Don\u2019t.</p><p>Gray punched his thigh. This was why when he took a fancy to a woman, he pursued her, sampled her, and moved on. Becoming acquainted first ruined everything.</p><p>Agitated, he hooked a finger under his neck cloth and pulled it loose.</p><p>\u201cCare for her,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow could that be possible? I\u2019ve scarcely gone near the woman in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible, but it seems to be true. In fact, I think you\u2019re half in love with her. More than half, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Rising from his chair, Gray straightened to his full height. \u201cNow wait. I\u2019m half out of my mind with lust, I\u2019ll grant you that. More than half, perhaps. But I</p> <p>\u2019m certainly not in love with that girl. Don\u2019t forget who you\u2019re talking to, Joss. I keep my conscience in my bank account, remember? I don\u2019t even know what love looks like.\u201d</p><p>Joss paused over his desk. \u201cI know what love looks like. Using up all those Portuguese goods on one meal, killing a valuable goat, bringing out porcelain from the cargo hold ... Crack one plate, and you\u2019d lose half the set\u2019s price. Serving meat onto a lady\u2019s plate.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cLove looks something like that.\u201d</p><p>Gray ran his hands through his hair, shaking off the lunatic notion before it could take root in his brain. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not in love. I\u2019m just too damned bored. I\u2019ve nothing to do on this voyage but plan dinner parties. And it\u2019s about to get worse. No chance of cracking a plate tonight.\u201d He jerked his chin at the lamp dangling from a hook, which on any normal night would have been swaying in time with the waves. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re becalmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d noticed.\u201d Joss grimaced and motioned for the flask. Gray tossed it to him. \u201cGood thing we\u2019ve given the men a fine meal and grog tonight. Becalming\u2019s never good for the crew\u2019s morale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good for the investor\u2019s morale, either.\u201d Gray rubbed his temples.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>The calm lasted for days. For all of Christmas Day, and all of Boxing Day, too. The idleness that began as a welcome holiday quickly became a hardship to all aboard the Aphrodite. By the third morning, the same men who\u2019d spent Christmas singing and joking were sniping at one another and grumbling under their breath at every order. Without wind, there was little for them to do but mend the rigging and scrape the chains. Men\u2019s equivalent of needlework, Sophia mused, eyeing the foot-long marlinespikes the sailors used to reeve and splice the lines. The crew had her sympathy. She\u2019d always detested needlework.</p><p>The sky was cloudless, the air was listless, the men were restless. And above all, it was hot. Hotter than Sophia could ever have dreamed. The tropical air smothered her like a thick, woolen blanket.</p><p>With no breeze, the cabin became an oven. Sophia had no intention of staying inside. The men rigged an unused sail into a canopy, and she sat on a crate beneath it, fanning herself with her drawing board and sketching from time to time. Watching the mast\u2019s shadow crawl across the dock. Sitting absolutely, perfectly still.</p><p>Mr. Grayson, by contrast, was in constant motion. He roamed between hold and deck, fore and aft, seemingly the most restless man aboard. Sophia hadn\u2019t known what to expect, after their furtive exchange beneath the dinner table. She\u2019d lain awake half that night, counting the bells that marked each half-hour. At first, sensual excitement clanged through her with each sharp ring. As hours passed, the buzzing pulses turned to pangs of trepidation. Then, as night gave way to morning, hollow disappointment reigned. Capricious, teasing man. Why hadn\u2019t he come? Surely he couldn\u2019t have desired any clearer invitation.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t appeared that night. Not the next morning, either. By the time she finally crossed paths with him the following afternoon, his mumbled \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d was the extent of their exchange. It seemed they were back to silence.</p><p>I don\u2019t want you.</p><p>She tried to ignore the words echoing in her memory. They weren\u2019t true, she told herself. She was an expert at deceit; she knew a lie when she heard one.</p><p>Still. What else to believe, when he avoided her thus?</p><p>Although he rarely spoke to her over the next two days, Sophia frequently overheard him speaking of her. Even these remarks were the tersest of commands: \u201cFetch Miss Turner more water,\u201d or \u201cSee that her canopy doesn\u2019t go slack.\u201d She felt herself being tended, not unlike a goat. Fed, watered, sheltered. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t complain. Food, water, and shelter were all welcome things.</p><p>But Sophia was not livestock, and she had other, more profound needs. Needs he seemed intent on neglecting, the infuriating man. On their third morning of calm, Captain Grayson ordered the crew to put in the longboat. This order was met by loud grumbles and curses among the sailors.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sophia asked as O\u2019Shea stomped past.</p><p>\u201cThe captain\u2019s ordering us to go out in the longboat and tow the ship. He\u2019s hoping if we move around, we\u2019ll find some wind. But rowing in this heat ...\u201d</p><p>The big Irishman squinted and wiped his brow with his forearm. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a bitch.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Shea walked off without even apologizing for his language. Sophia couldn\u2019t blame him. She would be cursing, too, if she had to perform hard physical labor under this blistering sun.</p><p>The men took three shifts, each with one officer and four men out in the longboat, rowing with all their might for an hour to make little discernible progress. Sophia watched with sympathy, but also with fascination. While out on the longboat, the men removed their shirts, and she took the opportunity to make discreet sketches. Even from a distance, she could plainly see their cord-like muscles, their vivid scars and exotic tattoos. These men were a far cry from the languid Greek marbles she\u2019d been taught to copy. They were imperfect, perspiring, striving, and most of all, real.</p><p>But soon the heat swamped even this diversion, as the pencil slipped from Sophia\u2019s sweaty grasp and rolled away.</p><p>Drat.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be bothered to chase it.</p><p>One hour blurred into another after that. The men continued through their rotations, one crew rowing, the other overhauling rigging, the third at rest. Mr. Grayson had disappeared belowdecks.</p><p>Davy Linnet walked past, and Sophia perked. \u201cGood afternoon, Davy,\u201d</p><p>she said, smiling. Ever since the Tropic crossing, she\u2019d made an extra effort to favor Davy in front of his crewmates. Even in this sweltering heat, courage deserved its reward.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Turner.\u201d He ducked his head to hide a shy grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking very well, Davy. I\u2019d wager you\u2019ve gained a stone since we left England. They won\u2019t be able to call you \u2018boy\u2019 much longer.\u201d She tilted her head in coquettish fashion. \u201cDo they have you in the forecastle yet?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and scratched the back of his neck. \u201cStill have a lot to learn, miss. I\u2019ll make it there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you will.\u201d She smiled again, and the lad blushed. Sophia knew how much he craved admittance to the forecastle, where all the sailors bedded down. He\u2019d been sleeping in steerage since the voyage began, and there he would remain until he\u2019d proven himself, in both ability and character.</p><p>\u201cMan aloft to splice the fore topgallant lift!\u201d</p><p>From around the foremast, Quinn grumbled and began moving toward the ratlines.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Davy dodged in front of the sailor, throwing him off balance. Quinn gritted his teeth, but profanity flowed freely through the gaps. \u201cOut of my way, boy, or I\u2019ll throw you to the sharks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Davy held out a hand. \u201cLend me your marlinespike.\u201d</p><p>Quinn gave him a skeptical look. \u201cThis is sailor\u2019s work, boy. Have you spliced a cable before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve practiced on deck.\u201d</p><p>The older man harrumphed and elbowed the boy aside.</p><p>With a glance in Sophia\u2019s direction, Davy stepped in front of him again. He stood undeterred even when Quinn puffed his chest and drew up to full height, a full head taller than the youth.</p><p>\u201cLet me do it,\u201d Davy insisted. \u201cHow can I learn if you don\u2019t give me a chance to try?\u201d</p><p>Quinn paused, staring up at the mast. Then he wiped his brow and looked back at the boy. \u201cIf you want to climb up there in this heat, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>He unknotted the marlinespike from his belt and slapped the needle into Davy\u2019s outstretched palm. \u201cDon\u2019t cock it up, or I\u2019ll gut you myself.\u201d</p><p>With those words of encouragement, Davy sprang into the rigging. She watched his ascent for a while, and then he climbed out of her sight, behind the canopy. Sophia decided her loyalty to Davy did not extend that far, as to wilt and freckle in the tropical sun while he repaired a bit of rope. She would conserve her energy for congratulating him once he finished. She waited, chin propped in her hands. Her eyelids grew heavy. She was drifting ... drifting ...</p><p>Thwack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sharp noise jolted her awake.</p><p>\u201cHo, there! Get down here, boy!\u201d She recognized Mr. Brackett\u2019s harsh bark.</p><p>Sophia scrambled out from under the canopy. The crew gathered around the foremast, watching in ominous silence as Davy slowly descended the ratlines. At the center of the scattered group stood Mr. Brackett, hands planted on either hip, and legs braced wide in an attitude of imminent threat.</p> <p>\u201cAhoy! All hands!\u201d</p><p>She shook herself, trying to dispel the drowsy haze from her brain. What could Davy have done that would warrant this assembly, resembling nothing so much as a shipboard trial, with Mr. Brackett looking like judge and executioner in one?</p><p>Then she saw it, sticking out of the deck like a giant\u2019s dart\u2014the marlinespike driven straight into the planks. That must have been the loud thwack she\u2019d heard. Davy had dropped it from the topgallant yard. If it had struck a man ... Despite the heat, Sophia shivered. It was a miracle no one on deck had been killed.</p><p>She might have counted their blessings too soon.</p><p>As Davy finally reached the deck, Mr. Brackett\u2019s expression spelled quiet murder. He walked over to the offending sliver of iron, planted a boot on the board it had pierced, grasped the spike with both hands, and pulled it free with one swift yank. He brandished it before Davy, jabbing the point into the center of the boy\u2019s chest. \u201cCareless, Linnet. Very careless.\u201d</p> <p>The boy stood a bit taller, but Sophia noticed his left knee begin to shake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. My hand was sweaty. It just slipped. It won\u2019t happen again, sir.\u201d Davy\u2019s voice cracked as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to believe that, Linnet. But I think I\u2019d better teach you a lesson. Just to be certain.\u201d</p><p>Teach him a lesson? What could the man mean? Sophia scanned the deck. The captain was out in the longboat. Mr. Wiggins was presumably belowdecks, resting. For the moment, the ship was Mr. Brackett\u2019s to command.</p><p>And Sophia could tell, he wasn\u2019t about to let the men forget it. The air and the water were so calm, so still, that every word echoed off the decking, as though it were a stage. And Brackett definitely had an air for the theatrical. He circled the men, turning his hawkish glare from one sailor to the next, letting his boots clunk ominously with each slow step. He held his audience rapt.</p><p>\u201cThis crew is the most indolent band of curs I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve been itching to give you men a taste of real discipline.\u201d Brackett turned to Davy.</p> <p>\u201cDo you really mean to be a sailor, boy? Do you think you have what it takes?\u201d</p><p>Davy nodded, once.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t handle a marlinespike, can you? But perhaps you can handle a taste of the lash.\u201d</p><p>Sophia leapt forward. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Brackett turned to her. \u201cMiss Turner, this isn\u2019t a fit spectacle for ladies. You ought to return to your cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t do this. I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>The moment the words escaped her throat, Sophia knew she\u2019d made a grave mistake. If Davy had any hope of leniency, she\u2019d just erased it. Brackett\u2019s black eyes pinned her, as dark and unyielding as obsidian. He would never back down now. To spare Davy at her behest would be tantamount to surrendering authority in front of his crew. Unthinkable.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for offending your genteel sensibilities, Miss Turner. Justice can be an ugly business. Now, I advise you to go belowdecks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo on, Miss Turner,\u201d Davy said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my share of beatings. It\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t felt before.\u201d</p><p>And of course he didn\u2019t want her to see, the brave boy. Sophia cast him an apologetic look. Then she firmed her chin and spoke to Brackett. \u201cThank you, I will stay. If you can perform this atrocity, you can perform it in front of me.\u201d Perhaps the man would go lightly on Davy with her here. Or maybe she could swoon at a fortuitous moment and put a stop to it altogether.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d Brackett turned on his heel, swinging the marlinespike around like a compass needle, ultimately selecting Quinn as its true north.</p><p>\u201cYou there. String Linnet up to the yardarm.\u201d</p><p>Muffled curses rose up from the assembled crew. Quinn shifted his weight uneasily. Brackett swung \u2019round again, making another swiping threat with the marline-spike, and losing his hat in the process. The men dropped back in silence.</p><p>The sweat on Sophia\u2019s neck went cold.</p><p>\u201cRemove your shirt, Linnet.\u201d When the boy simply stood in place, Brackett hooked the tip of the marline-spike into Davy\u2019s collar and yanked, ripping the coarse tunic from neck to waist. Then he reached out with his free hand to tear the shirt away from the youth\u2019s torso, exposing a smooth, pale chest.</p><p>Brackett rested the marlinespike on his shoulder like a dueling pistol and turned to Quinn. \u201cString. Him. Up.\u201d</p><p>Quinn did not move. Braced in a wide stance, arms crossed over his chest, he was a towering mountain of muscle. And he received Brackett\u2019s command with all the stony indifference of a mountain that had just been ordered to jump. Make me, his gaze said. I\u2019d like to see you try. Sophia wanted to believe the man felt some allegiance to Davy, but she suspected the heat factored strongly in his defiance. If Quinn hadn\u2019t wanted to climb the mast ten minutes ago, he could hardly relish the idea of hauling a boy up with him now.</p><p>Mr. Brackett did not seem angered by Quinn\u2019s mute refusal. Instead, Sophia thought he looked oddly gratified. His face lit with a smug, expectant grin. \u201cDo you disobey a direct order then, Quinn?\u201d</p><p>Quinn did not move.</p><p>\u201cInsubordination,\u201d said Brackett, circling Quinn slowly, \u201cis a serious infraction. I advise you to reconsider. I\u2019ll say it but one more time, Quinn.\u201d</p><p>Brackett punctuated each word with a jab to the sailor\u2019s chest. \u201cString. Him. Up.\u201d</p><p>Quinn shrugged off the spike, as a horse twitches its flank to dislodge a fly.</p><p>Brackett sneered, sweat trickling off his brow. His black hair was soaked with perspiration, matted to his scalp like raven feathers. Whether it was the heat, the power of command, or both\u2014this scene had unleashed something dark in the man. Something terrifying. His eyes were wild, and he wielded the marlinespike like one of the devil\u2019s own tormentors.</p><p>\u201cI was going to make an example of the boy there, but now I think you\u201d\u2014he jabbed Quinn again\u2014\u201cwill make a better example by far.\u201d</p><p>With sudden, agile fury, Brackett swung the heavy iron spike and hit Quinn square in the back of his knee. The man\u2019s leg crumpled beneath him, and he dropped to the deck with a heavy thud.</p><p>Sophia clapped a hand over her scream.</p><p>Quinn groaned and rolled to his knees. Brackett twirled the marlinespike in his hand and hammered him between the shoulder blades with the blunt end, sprawling him face-first onto the deck. Before the sailor could recover from the blow, Brackett had his boot planted on the man\u2019s neck, holding him down.</p><p>The assembled crew stood frozen, the men glancing frantically from one to another. Sophia understood their hesitation. Even if their captain would not countenance such violence\u2014and Sophia felt certain he wouldn\u2019t\u2014to overpower Brackett would be mutiny.</p><p>Quinn struggled to rise. Brackett crushed his heel down on the man\u2019s neck, stifling all protest.</p><p>Sophia glanced toward the ship\u2019s prow. It was impossible to see the longboat from here. If only she could make some sort of signal ... or call out to the captain.</p><p>\u201cFetch me the lash,\u201d Brackett ordered, pointing the marlinespike at Davy.</p><p>\u201cAnd be quick about it, or I\u2019ll double your strokes.\u201d</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t wait for Davy\u2019s response. She turned on her heel and bolted down the stairs belowdecks, racing through the ladies\u2019 cabin and passing into steerage.</p><p>\u201cMr. Grayson!\u201d She wove through the jumbled crates. He would make everything all right, she knew it. He had to. \u201cMr. Grayson! Gray!\u201d</p><p>A hand snagged her elbow.</p><p>\u201cCome to me at last, have you?\u201d</p><p>It was stifling hot in the compartment, and Sophia was overwrought. At the sound of his sleepy baritone and the reassuring feel of his hand on her skin, she nearly melted. He leaned against the stacked crates, rubbing sleep from his eyes with his sleeve. \u201cWhat is it, sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome quickly,\u201d she said, removing his hand from her elbow and tugging him back toward the stairs.</p><p>At the frantic tremor in her voice, he snapped into seriousness. She yanked on his arm, but he did not move. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he repeated, his eyes searching hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Davy. And Quinn ... he\u2019s going to flog them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Brackett.\u201d</p><p>With a muttered curse, he shook off her grip and charged past her, making his way through the ladies\u2019 cabin and taking the ladder three rungs at a time. Sophia hurried behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is going on here?\u201d Mr. Grayson demanded. The scene looked much as Sophia had left it. Was it possible only a minute had passed? Brackett still held Quinn under his boot, at the point of the marlinespike. Around him, the crewmen stood in a half-circle, sweat streaming from their brows under the midday sun. At the sight of Mr. Grayson, they visibly relaxed. The only one missing was Davy.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mr. Grayson. Good afternoon.\u201d Mr. Brackett greeted him calmly, his eyes hard as stone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent him to fetch the lash. This one\u201d\u2014he shifted his weight to Quinn\u2019s neck\u2014\u201cneeds to learn who his superiors are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no lash on this ship, Brackett. I don\u2019t permit flogging. Never have.\u201d</p><p>Brackett smirked. \u201cSmall wonder, then, that your crew is so worthless. They\u2019re well overdue for their dose of discipline. And if you\u2019ve no lash ...</p><p>well, I\u2019m certain something can be improvised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhoy!\u201d The call came from the front of the ship. The longboat had returned. A few of the sailors began backing away from the scene, toward the prow. They looked toward Mr. Grayson for permission, and he dismissed them with a nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be your captain, Brackett. You may stand down.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson\u2019s voice remained so calm, so authoritative; his posture was relaxed. His coat and trousers hung haphazardly from his frame, in contrast to Mr. Brackett\u2019s orderly rows of buttons, glaring in the sun. He was unarmed, unkempt, unruffled. Yet there was no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind who had the upper hand. Once again, Mr. Grayson had assumed command of a scene without even breaking a sweat.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sophia trembled so violently, her ribs rattled against her stays. She felt an arm take her elbow, steadying it. Swiveling her head, she found Stubb standing beside her.</p><p>\u201cThe boy\u2019s below,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhen he come looking for the lash, I told him to stay out of sight.\u201d</p><p>Sophia swallowed and nodded.</p><p>Mr. Grayson crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cStand down, Brackett. If there\u2019s discipline to be meted out, the captain will handle it.\u201d</p><p>Brackett removed his boot from Quinn\u2019s neck, only to give him a swift kick in the ribs. The sailor groaned at his feet, and the officer\u2019s mouth twisted in a sick smile. \u201cI\u2019m first mate. I don\u2019t work for the captain. I work for you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cNot any longer, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The captain strode across the deck, wiping his brow before replacing his hat. Four sailors followed him, still shirtless from their stint in the longboat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? We heard a commotion.\u201d The captain spied Quinn groaning in pain on the deck and knelt beside him. \u201cGood God. He didn\u2019t fall from the rigging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mr. Grayson nodded toward Brackett. \u201cCaptain Grayson, you should know that Mr. Brackett has been relieved of his duties as first mate of the Aphrodite, effective immediately. How you accommodate his presence on this ship for the remainder of the voyage is yours to decide. I recommend the brig.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Joss looked around at the assembled sailors, his demeanor suddenly grave. He rose to his feet, pulling his cuffs straight. \u201cStubb, tend to Quinn.\u201d He turned to the shirtless sailors. \u201cLevi, O\u2019Shea. Show Mr. Brackett his new quarters in the brig. Gray\u2014\u201d He tilted his head toward Sophia. \u201cGet her belowdecks. And keep her there.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grayson nodded.</p><p>Levi and O\u2019Shea took the snarling Brackett between them, one on either arm, and together they herded him down into the hold. As they passed, Sophia gasped. Levi\u2019s back was a gnarled mass of healed scars, braided one over the other in the middle, branching out toward both shoulders. She wondered, were they the result of his permanent silence, or the cause?</p> <p>\u201cCome, sweetheart. You need to rest.\u201d Mr. Grayson\u2019s hand pressed against the small of her back.</p><p>Sophia shook her head. She couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from the horror that was Levi\u2019s back. Not until he disappeared belowdecks. \u201cI thought you said you don\u2019t permit flogging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Miss Turner went limp in his arms. Gray thought for a moment she\u2019d swooned. But when he looked down at her, he found only thick-fringed eyes gazing back up at him, swimming with confusion and unshed tears. She hadn\u2019t fainted at all. She\u2019d simply fallen against him and trusted him to catch her.</p> <p>Behind him, Joss barked orders to the crew, and to Mr. Wiggins, now first mate. The men scurried back to their stations. Still, the two of them stood there, her back pressing flat and warm against his chest. Gray wrapped his arms about her and steered her toward the companionway. Shoring up her slender frame with an arm about her waist, he guided Miss Turner down the stairs and into the ladies\u2019 cabin.</p><p>And then came the moment to ease her into a chair. But he found he didn\u2019t want to release her. She fit so perfectly against him, and he suddenly allowed himself to feel how very much he\u2019d been yearning to do exactly this. Hold her close. Hold her tight. Not let go.</p><p>Together they leaned against the doorframe. One of them was shaking, and Gray worried it might be him.</p><p>She leaned her head against his arm. \u201cI knew you\u2019d put a stop to it. I tried, but I only made matters worse. But I knew they\u2019d listen to you. They all listen to you. And I knew you\u2019d never allow such a thing to continue.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord, Gray thought. Here he held this woman in his arms while she made him out to be some sort of ... not a saint, exactly, but a man possessing a shred of honor. And all the while she trembled against his body, soft and damp and warm, never suspecting the dozens of ways in which he longed to dishonor them both.</p><p>Would she still allow him to hold her like this, encircled in his arms, her backside pressed against his swelling groin, if she could read his thoughts?</p> <p>If she knew that when she tilted her head to bury her face in his sleeve, she gave him a direct view of the alabaster curve of her neck, the carved ivory of her collarbone, and the exquisite image that would haunt his dreams\u2014the soft, rose-scented valley between her breasts?</p><p>God, what a lecherous bastard he was.</p><p>He\u2019d been ashamed of many things in his life, but never before had he felt so ashamed simply to be a man, a part of this violent, brutish race of creatures who flogged one another, beat helpless boys with marline-spikes, and lusted after unsuspecting governesses while they were overset with emotion. This woman was bred for better things, deserved better things. Better than this ship, this life. Better than a base, craving creature like him.</p><p>\u201cYou should sit down.\u201d He brought his hands to her shoulders and guided her to a chair.</p><p>She sank into it slowly, folding her hands on the table in front of her. Well, and now what? He certainly couldn\u2019t leave her alone in this state. Her eyes were dark hollows in an ashen face; her lips quivered.</p><p>Gray paced the cabin. He couldn\u2019t comfort her without mauling her. He couldn\u2019t go abovedecks and put his crew to rights, because they weren\u2019t his crew to command.</p><p>Impotent. He\u2019d been rendered impotent, in more ways than one. Gray nearly laughed with the realization. It was not a sensation he\u2019d ever thought to experience, in any sense of the word. Coupled with this heat ... he would go mad with frustration. He rubbed his hand under his collar, then made a fist and punched the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to Mr. Brackett?\u201d Her voice was flat, remote.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll stay in the ship\u2019s brig until we dock.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a blank look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a jail,\u201d he explained. \u201cMore of a cage, really. Down in the hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cage? How horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for his own safety, as much as anything. What he did ... it wasn\u2019t any worse than what officers on other ships do every day. But now that he\u2019s no longer an officer, the sailors might be tempted to exact revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you dismiss him from duty, then? Why not let him remain an officer until we reach Tortola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Brackett\u2019s actions had been justified, I couldn\u2019t have kept him in the post. He\u2019s lost all authority with the crew now. My interference assured that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Her voice shrank. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She jumped, and Gray bit the inside of his cheek. Bloody hell. Hadn\u2019t she seen enough coarseness today, without him losing all sense of civility? He forced his emotions back down to a simmer. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. You were right to help. You were right to fetch me.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed, and Gray resumed prowling the cabin. \u201cWhat the devil was Davy doing up there with a marlinespike? That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know. It\u2019s a sailor\u2019s duty.\u201d</p><p>She put her head in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s my fault, too. I\u2019d been talking to him about moving up to the forecastle, and I ... I think he wanted to impress me.\u201d</p><p>Gray choked on a laugh. \u201cWell, of course he did. You ought to take care how you bat those eyelashes, sweetheart. One of these days, you\u2019re likely to knock a man overboard.\u201d</p><p>The legs of her chair scraped the floor as she stood. The color returned to her cheeks. \u201cIf Davy was trying to impress me, it\u2019s as much your fault as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that my fault?\u201d Gray\u2019s frustration came right back to a boil. He hated himself for growling at her, but he couldn\u2019t seem to help it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who humiliated him in front of the crew, with all those questions. You goaded him into saying he ... well, you know what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know what he said.\u201d Gray stepped toward her until only the table separated them. \u201cI know what he said. And don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t enjoy it. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t use those men to feed your vanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy vanity? What would you know about feeding my vanity? You don\u2019t so much as breathe in my direction. At least the sailors speak to me. And if that entire \u2018King of the Sea\u2019 display wasn\u2019t one long exercise in feeding your own vanity, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d She jabbed one finger on the tabletop and lowered her voice. \u201cThose men may flirt with me, but they worship you. You know it. You wanted to feel it. Bask in it. And you did so at Davy\u2019s expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I only teased the boy. I\u2019m not the one poised to break his heart.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s only infatuation. He\u2019s not really in love with me.\u201d</p><p>He pounded the table. \u201cOf course the boy\u2019s in love with you! They all are. You talk to them, you listen to their stories\u2014even Wiggins\u2019s prattling, God only knows why. You draw them little sketches, you make them paintings for Christmas. You remind them of everything they\u2019ve left behind, everything they pray they\u2019ll one day hold again. And you do it all looking like some sort of Botticelli goddess, surely the most beautiful thing they\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. Damn it, how\u2019s a man to keep from falling in love with you?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>Her lips parted, and she drew a quick breath.</p><p>Say something, Gray silently pleaded. Anything. But she only stared at him. What the hell had he just said? Was it truly that bad? He frowned, reliving the past minute in his mind.</p><p>Oh, God. Gray rubbed his face with one hand, then gave a sharp tug on his hair. It was that bad. Damn it to hell. If Joss were here, he\u2019d have a good laugh at his expense.</p><p>\u201cHave you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I what?\u201d Gray prompted, promptly kicking himself for doing so. God only knew what she\u2019d ask now. Or what damn fool thing he\u2019d say in response.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen a Botticelli? Painting, I mean. A real one, in person?\u201d</p><p>The breath he\u2019d been holding whooshed out of him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d His hand gestured uselessly. \u201cI haven\u2019t words to describe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were too clear, too piercing. He swallowed and shifted his gaze to a damp lock of hair curling at her temple. \u201cPerfect. Luminous. So beautiful, your chest aches. And so smooth, like glass. Your fingers itch to touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly, his gaze sliding back to meet hers. \u201cIt isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you care what others will allow?\u201d She took a step toward him, her fingers trailing along the grooved tabletop. \u201cWhat if you were alone, and there was no one to see? Would you touch it then?\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head and dropped his gaze to his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not ...\u201d He paused, picking over his words like fruits in an island market. Testing and discarding twice as many as he chose. \u201cThere\u2019s a varnish, you see. Some sort of gloss. If I touched it with these rough hands, I\u2019d mar it somehow. Make it a bit less beautiful. Couldn\u2019t live with myself then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014\u201d She leaned one hip against the table\u2019s edge, making her whole body one sinuous, sweeping curve. Gray sucked in a lungful of heat. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the rules that prevent you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. No.\u201d</p><p>Silence again. Vast and echoing, like the long, marble-tiled galleries of the Uffizi.</p><p>And then, at last: \u201cIt\u2019s still your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Davy. Of course he wants to prove himself now. How did you expect him to react, asking him all of those questions? Grilling him in front of all the crew, in front of me?\u201d She wilted into the chair. \u201cYou should have known better. You should have done better.\u201d</p><p>There she went again, appealing to his hypothetical sense of honor. Pulling at her neckline as she did it, sending jolts of desire straight to his groin. Confirming he\u2019d no true honor at all.</p><p>\u201cI mean, how would you feel, your whole life exposed like that in front of all those men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men respect me because they know I\u2019ve been through it, too. Just like all of them received the same treatment once. No secrets between sailors, Miss Turner. Unlike some\u201d\u2014he threw her a glance\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve nothing to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Her gaze sharpened.</p><p>Gray nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. So this was her game, was it? Very well. If she wished to question him, he would answer. She was free to learn every vile, brutish thing about him. That would teach her to appeal to some imaginary sense of decency. \u201cBenedict Adolphus Percival Grayson. The same as my father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said there was only one woman permitted to address you by your Christian name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s still the truth. Don\u2019t get excited, sweetheart. I\u2019ve not given you leave to use it. You may, however, call me Gray.\u201d Please, he added silently. She shook her head. \u201cWhat is your age, Mr. Grayson?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am two-and-thirty this coming year. Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom whence do you hail?\u201d</p><p>Gray eased back in his chair. \u201cI was born and raised on Tortola, as you know. The Grayson family tree is rooted in Wiltshire. My grandfather was a gentleman of some standing, and my father was his typically wayward second son. For his sins, which were legion, my father was exiled to Clarendon\u2014that was the name of our plantation\u2014to mend his dissolute ways.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He reclined in his seat, propping one boot on the table between them.</p><p>A smile tugged at her lips. \u201cHow many siblings have you, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, I could not say. My father\u2019s acknowledged children number three. I have one brother, whom you have met, and one sister, whom you have not. We are all of different mothers. So to answer your earlier question, it would seem the West Indies proved an ineffective remedy for dissolution.\u201d He watched her for signs of shock or displeasure. Her brow, however, remained as placid as this godforsaken sea.</p><p>\u201cI know your father is ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYes, dead. Is your mother still living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She died when I was an infant. I\u2019ve no memory of her at all.\u201d</p><p>A single crease scored her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>The words simply rolled off his tongue, uttered with no particular inflection or intent. But Miss Turner snapped to attention. Gray fought the urge to fidget under her scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, a note of defiance in her voice. \u201cI am sorry. It\u2019s a tragic thing, to have no memory of your mother.\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cBetter than having some memory of her, and feeling the pain of the loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you truly believe it\u2019s better?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and tugged at his ear.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Gray put a hand on the armrest and shifted his weight. Perhaps allowing this interrogation hadn\u2019t been such a brilliant idea after all. Miss Turner was supposed to be the one growing uncomfortable, not him.</p><p>\u201cBrown or white?\u201d She propped her chin in one hand and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBread, Mr. Grayson. Given a choice, do you take brown bread or white?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cBrown, if there\u2019s butter. If not, white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAle or grog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAle. Chased with brandy.\u201d Not a bad idea, he thought, reaching into his coat for his flask. He unscrewed the cap and lifted it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever stolen anything, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>He froze, looking at her over the flask. With deliberate slowness, he tipped it back until the fiery liquor spread down his throat. Then he wiped his mouth, recapped the flask, and replaced it carefully in his breast pocket.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and raised one eyebrow, inviting him to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall I begin? With the typical childhood petty thievery?</p><p>Pineapples, chickens, my father\u2019s stickpin ... I could go on for several minutes there. Shall I detail for you all the dozens of ships I\u2019ve boarded, the boatloads of precious cargo I\u2019ve seized? Privateering is sanctioned thievery, perhaps, but theft nonetheless.\u201d He drummed one finger lightly on the tabletop. \u201cI\u2019ve made stealing a way of life, Miss Turner. I could go on about it for hours. How much elaboration do you care to hear?\u201d</p><p>She paused a moment, considering. \u201cYou\u2019re not ashamed to own to it, then. Your thievery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn most cases, no. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen in some cases, you are? What is it you\u2019re ashamed of stealing, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>Gray wrestled with her clear, unwavering gaze. Dare he make the confession? It would serve his purpose well, expose him for the blackguard he was. The girl ought to know just what sort of man she regarded. Then maybe she\u2019d cease looking at him with those trusting eyes, expecting things of him she had no right to expect. Expecting things he had no way or means of giving.</p><p>Dropping his gaze to the floor, he rubbed a thumb across his lower lip. \u201cI stole my brother\u2019s inheritance.\u201d His own voice sounded strange, oddly hollow. His whole body felt oddly hollow. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said. He glanced up to find that her expression held not disdain or shock, as he might have expected. As such an admission deserved. Rather, she looked intrigued.</p><p>\u201cThe pineapples and chickens, the dozens of ships ...\u201d She traced a groove in the tabletop with her finger. \u201cAll these I can easily imagine. But stealing an inheritance ... twice? However did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no pressing engagements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in England, on break from Oxford, summering in Wiltshire at my grandfather\u2019s estate. We received word that my father had died. My grandfather took the news hard. I think the old man always held out hope that his prodigal son would one day make good, return to the fold. When that hope was extinguished ...\u201d Gray cleared his throat. \u201cHe suffered an apoplexy within the week and never recovered.\u201d</p><p>She made a small, crooning noise in the back of her throat. \u201cYou lost your father and your grandfather in the space of one week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My father had already been dead for two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but still. You\u2019d only just learned of it.\u201d She hugged herself. Gray frowned as she stroked her shoulder, inflaming his own long-buried hurt even as she soothed herself. Damn it, she was supposed to be reviling him, not pitying him. And certainly not sympathizing with him. \u201cDo you want me to finish the story or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Go on.\u201d</p><p>He spoke briskly now, as if conducting a business transaction. \u201cMy grandfather left Clarendon to my father. In the event my father was no longer living, the lands were to be divided between my father\u2019s male children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Captain Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He leaned forward over the table. \u201cBut you see, sweetheart, they didn\u2019t know about Joss. I gather my father neglected to mention his half-African by-blow in his annual estate report. The solicitors had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he\u2019s illegitimate ... Would he have stood to inherit at all?\u201d</p><p>He turned his hand palm side up and studied the blunt, clipped edges of his fingernails. \u201cPerhaps not. No way to tell without explaining matters to the executors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t.\u201d Her eyes turned from curious to piercing. \u201cYou accepted the lands, and then you sold them. Without asking your brother.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you divide the proceeds with him, after the fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I bought this ship and had it fitted for privateering. It was all in my name, but I promised him we would split the proceeds after the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. \u201cNo. I gave him what share he earned as first mate, and not a penny more. I took the rest, bought a house in London, and started Grayson Shipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson Shipping,\u201d she repeated. \u201cNot Grayson Brothers Shipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrayson Shipping. The ships, the investment, the risks, the profit\u2014it\u2019s all mine. I am my brother\u2019s employer, not his partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness.\u201d She sat back in her chair, still regarding him intently.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think you are rightly ashamed.\u201d And there it was. The prim face of censure he\u2019d been seeking. A strange sense of satisfaction descended on him. Divine justice, perhaps. Other men, better men, confessed their sins to priests and saints, but Gray had chosen for his confessor this governess. The most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever set eyes on, in all his years of chasing pleasure from one horizon to the next. The only woman to stir this desperate yearning in his breast. And this was his penance\u2014to watch her shrink back into her chair, to see those clear eyes glaze with mistrust as she at last recognized him for the devil he was.</p><p>Yes, this was his due. And she wasn\u2019t finished yet, his petite, austere inquisitor. No, there was so much sin yet to be revealed.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>She gave him a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cConclude the interrogation, sweetheart. You\u2019ve more questions to ask.\u201d</p><p>She stared hard into a corner of the cabin. \u201cAre you married, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not the marrying sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had many sw\u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cMany sweethearts, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Many.\u201d</p><p>She winced, almost imperceptibly, but he felt it like a flick of the lash. Still, she turned to meet his eyes again. Brave girl.</p><p>Ask it, he urged silently. Make the confession complete.</p><p>\u201cAnd how many lovers, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that answer\u2019s not an option.\u201d Sophia smiled and rapped the table with her fist, grateful for the chance to tease. \u201cTruth or eels, Mr. Grayson.\u201d</p><p>He did not smile back. \u201cI tell you most truthfully, Miss Turner\u2014I couldn\u2019t say. I lost count years ago. It\u2019s been fifteen years since I tumbled my first tavern wench. And in those fifteen years, I\u2019ve traveled three seas and four continents, sampling the ladies in every port. If it\u2019s a number you require, then you count them. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked, waiting for that devilish, teasing grin to appear. But it didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t teasing at all.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been under any illusions that he led a life of chastity. But for a shrewd tradesman, who lived his life by numbers and amounts, to lose count ... the actual number must be great indeed. The man sitting across the table from her had bedded countless women, from every corner of the globe. The thought repulsed her and, in some shameful way, thrilled her. But most of all, it disappointed her. Regret stung her somewhere between the shoulder blades, and her spine stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said finally, unable to mask the bitterness in her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re not dead of the pox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a miracle. It\u2019s a combination of caution and sheepgut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to your credit, then. And here you\u2019ve remained seemingly hale and stout, despite fifteen years of such strenuous exertion. A remarkable feat. No wonder you seem so proud of your exploits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d His jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cWith good health, you may have every expectation of de cades of further debauchery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, that\u2019s my greatest fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part? The good health, or the debauchery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe de cades.\u201d</p><p>Sophia studied his face. Fidgeting under her scrutiny, he lowered his gaze and scratched the thick growth of beard along his jaw. She\u2019d been wrong, she realized. He did not take pride in his exploits at all. \u201cWhat about love?\u201d</p><p>He did not look up. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe many sweethearts, the countless lovers ... How many of them did you love, Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p><p>He linked his hands behind his head and stared up at the ceiling. \u201cEvery last one of them, sweet. Every last one.\u201d</p><p>Sophia rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the same as saying none.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and continued to stare up at the ceiling. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Another question perched on the tip of her tongue. Sophia hesitated, then asked it anyway. \u201cAnd did any of them love you?\u201d</p><p>He leveled a cool gaze at her. \u201cOnly the fools.\u201d There was such pride there in his eyes, mingled with such pain.</p><p>Then, suddenly, his fist crashed to the tabletop. Sophia jumped in her seat.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time I asked the questions, don\u2019t you?\u201d He rose to his feet and began pacing the cabin. \u201cI know your name already, Miss Jane Turner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia had the impulse to interrupt, to correct him. But she couldn\u2019t. Guilt pinched in her chest. He\u2019d just bared his life to her. Why hadn\u2019t she the courage to do the same?</p><p>\u201cWhat is your age, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am twenty.\u201d At least that was the truth.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d he repeated, in a tone of dismissal. \u201cOnly twenty. So young. What can you know of the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you would credit. What can you know of me, to draw such a conclusion?\u201d</p><p>He swung around and leaned a hand on the table. \u201cWhat can I know of you, indeed. How much of the world have you seen, then, Miss Turner?</p><p>From whence do you hail?\u201d</p><p>He loomed over her, his bulk and strength intimidating. But the intensity in his eyes was more disquieting by far. \u201cKent.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and stood erect again. \u201cOh, Miss Turner hails from the wilds of Kent, does she? Known for its savage garden parties, Kent. Are your parents living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you siblings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a charming little family.\u201d Sophia began to interject, but he spoke over her. \u201cBrown bread or white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhite bread. But of course. Nothing but the best for Miss Turner. I suppose I can skip the next question, as well. I\u2019m well aware of your taste for rum.\u201d</p><p>Sophia bristled at the malice in his voice, and the brutal way in which his hand sliced the air. \u201cActually, I prefer claret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaret.\u201d He smirked. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry I cannot accommodate your tastes, Miss Turner, to offer you white bread and claret at every meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve no such expectation.\u201d Pressing her hands to the tabletop, she rose to her feet. \u201cWhy are you behaving in this fashion?\u201d</p><p>He leaned over the table, placing his hands flat to mirror hers. \u201cIn what fashion would you like me to behave? I can\u2019t be other than I am, sweetheart. You\u2019ve known from the start, I\u2019m no gentleman. I\u2019m a liar, a thief, a libertine ... and worse.\u201d He leaned closer, and she swayed forward, as if pulled by a thread. His face was but a handsbreadth from hers. Close enough to kiss.</p><p>His gaze fell to her lips, his voice distilling to a rough whisper. \u201cYou say you have no expectation of white bread and claret? Sweet ...\u201d The word swirled over her lips, and Sophia\u2019s eyes fluttered shut. \u201cYou would do well to form no expectations at all.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. He pushed back and straightened until his dark hair swept the cabin ceiling. Sophia retreated slowly, her heart drumming in her breast. A sad, yet satisfied look came over his face as he folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>He meant to push her away. She understood it now. Telling her of the history with his brother, boasting about the countless women. And now, with this ruthless interrogation. This was the same man who had held her so tenderly not a half-hour ago, practically declared love for her in a moment of honest anger. The man who wanted her so fiercely, she could taste it on his breath. The man she desired so much, she ached for him, body and heart.</p> <p>And now he was pushing her away. Using his sordid past to drive a wedge between them.</p><p>Well, Sophia had a sordid past of her own. Her sins might not have been as numerous or as salacious, but they were every bit as black as his. And she was not going to allow yet another man to paint her as some sort of perfect angel, above desire, too pure to touch.</p><p>She skirted the table, closing the distance between them. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, I think we were finished before we began.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, laying a hand on his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve more questions to ask me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked in a half-smile. Unfolding his arms, he caught her hand in his. Sophia wished that the glassy sea would roll beneath them, pitching her into his arms. But the calm held.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to tell me,\u201d he said, tracing her fingers with his, \u201cthat these soft, delicate hands have committed theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what? Ribbons? A bit of lace, perhaps?\u201d He folded her fingers over her palm and returned her hand to her side. \u201cPerhaps a few leaves of paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaper of a sort.\u201d Banknotes were paper, weren\u2019t they?</p><p>\u201cWhat ever your petty sins, sweet, I\u2019m certain I could buy and sell them with the coin in my waistcoat pocket.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea. Lowering her eyes, Sophia pressed her hand to the purse beneath her stays. True, the money was hers in name. But hadn\u2019t it been nearly Toby\u2019s, by rights? Even now, he could be bringing suit against her parents, demanding the dowry she\u2019d denied him when she ran away. What she\u2019d done ... It wasn\u2019t so very different from Mr. Grayson\u2019s deceit. She\u2019d stolen her own inheritance. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at the cost of my sins.\u201d</p><p>But before she could elaborate, he jabbed a finger under her chin, tilting her face to his. Just as quickly, his hand fell away. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled up in her throat. \u201cOf course not. No.\u201d A surge of guilt chased the laughter away. She should have been married, by now. Still, she willed the smile to remain. Her laughter seemed to please him, as did her response. He began to look himself again, and Sophia inwardly rejoiced.</p><p>\u201cHow many sweethearts, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow quirked. \u201cDon\u2019t count the men aboard this ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven without them ...\u201d She gave him a coquettish smile. \u201cStill several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have there been lovers?\u201d</p><p>The disdain in his voice, the smug curve of his lips ... Sophia knew he expected her answer to be a prim denial. He would be wrong. She would not confirm his impression of her as untouched, innocent. He needed to understand that he was not beneath her. Nothing was beneath her, not theft, not deceit. Certainly not passion.</p><p>There was only one way to show him her true nature.</p><p>And that was to lie.</p><p>\u201cYes. One.\u201d</p><p>He drew a sharp breath through his teeth. Sophia turned, taking two steps away. She clenched her fists until her fingernails bit into her palms, willing herself to be calm. After all, this was a lie she\u2019d told many times before.</p><p>\u201cBut you look so surprised,\u201d she began, glancing at Mr. Grayson over her shoulder. \u201cI told you weeks ago about Gervais. My painting master, and my tutor in the art\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe art of passion,\u201d he finished for her. He gave her a look of utter skepticism. \u201cYes, I remember. I didn\u2019t believe you then, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you believe me,\u201d she lied, sweeping across the cabin. \u201cHe was tall and lean and divinely handsome, with jet-black hair and silver eyes and long, sculpted fingers. And he loved me desperately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cDesperately.\u201d Brushing a lock of hair from her forehead, she continued, \u201cOh, but it wasn\u2019t affection that drew us together. It was raw, animal passion.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cAnimal passion? What could you know of animal passion?\u201d</p><p>She flushed under his bold gaze. This bit would not be difficult to fudge. Between the lessons of one wanton dairymaid and her proximity to this intensely attractive man, she\u2019d gathered a thing or two about animal passion.</p><p>\u201cIt began with smoldering glances, exchanged across crowded rooms.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers trailed along the tabletop as she sauntered toward him. \u201cAnd then, little excuses to touch each other. Every brush of his skin on mine ...\u201d</p><p>She grazed a single fingertip against the back of his hand. \u201c... made me shiver with longing.\u201d</p><p>He caught her wrist in his grip. Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d imagine you know how the rest progressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d imagine I do.\u201d He released her wrist, and something flickered in his eyes. The beginnings of belief. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me this is the reason you\u2019re bound for Tortola, to become a governess. You were ruined.\u201d</p><p>Sophia gave a tiny nod. How considerate of him, to do half the lying for her. Her words gained momentum, tumbled forth into the stagnant air. \u201cWe became too reckless. Once Gervais gave me a taste of paradise, nothing could keep us apart. I escaped my chaperone whenever I could, stole out to meet him in the middle of the night. The closets, the carriage house, even a hackney cab\u2014our trysting knew no boundaries. Gervais even came to see me in Kent, during one of our house parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house party?\u201d He wagged a finger at her. \u201cI knew you came from quality. I knew you were not bred to be a governess.\u201d</p><p>She threw him a saucy look. \u201cI was not bred to be a wanton, either. But so I became.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wanton. You.\u201d</p><p>Sophia searched her memory, mentally flipping through the chapters of The Book. Details, she told herself. Details would convince him.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed to meet in the stables. It was too risky for Gervais to be seen near the house. I stole a dairymaid\u2019s costume and tucked all my hair under a straw cap with a wide brim. So long as I kept my head down, no one could recognize me. When I arrived in the stables, he startled me from behind the door. Without a word, he grabbed me up in his arms and carried me into the loft. There he had lit a dozen candles, and strewn rose petals and blankets over a bed of sweet-smelling hay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dozen lit candles in a stable full of dry hay? You\u2019re lucky you survived the experience, sweetheart. You could have been tinder.\u201d</p><p>Sophia raised her eyebrows and stiffened her posture. \u201cOur love was an inferno. I thought I would go up in flames, so glorious was our pleasure that night.\u201d</p><p>He covered his eyes with a hand and laughed, loud and long. \u201cWhat a vivid romantic imagination you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not imagination. I\u2019m telling you the truth!\u201d Panic gnawed at her stomach. If she couldn\u2019t convince him now, she would certainly lose him. His opinion of her would be confirmed, and he\u2019d only think her more na\u00efve than ever. Desperate, she approached him steadily until they stood toe-to-toe. Perhaps physicality could persuade where words could not.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Crossing her arms, she framed her bosom for his appraisal. His eyes took the bait. Then, in a choreographed fit of pique, she whirled away. Men preferred to give chase, Sophia knew. She might be a virgin, but she understood how to draw a man to her side. Her pounding heartbeat filled the humid silence. The room had grown dark. So curious here in the tropics, how night fell like a thunderclap. No lingering dusk, no mystic hour of twilight. Just light, and then dark.</p><p>\u201cRose petals.\u201d His voice dropped, and she counted his slow footfalls as he moved to stand behind her. She felt his breath whispering against her nape, his gaze burning a trail along her neckline. Then he leaned in, hovering inches from her shoulder as he drew a slow, deep breath through his nose. A low, seductive growl rumbled from his throat and reverberated down her spine. \u201cI believe the rose petals.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he brushed a wisp of hair from her shoulder. His finger never grazed her skin, but the sensation of the silken lock gliding over her neck had Sophia quivering. She shut her eyes, feeling the feather-light caress everywhere.</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis Gervais?\u201d</p><p>The last question. She should have been expecting it, but it took her completely by surprise. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d she blurted out, unthinking. She slowly turned to face him in the dark. Mr. Grayson battened his reaction before she could gauge it, but Sophia knew she\u2019d made a misstep. If he\u2019d been thinking of sharing her bed tonight, he was now thinking twice. How ironic, that there was nothing to cool a man\u2019s ardor like the mention of love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what would he ask her now? Their little script was at an end. Sophia waited breathless in the dark, hoping some question, request\u2014or kiss\u2014would fall from his lips.</p><p>The cabin door scraped open, and a lamp threw flickering light between them. He took a step back.</p><p>Stubb shuffled in, struggling under a heavy tray. \u201cHere\u2019s dinner,\u201d he announced, hanging a lamp on a hook above them. \u201cSorry it\u2019s late, but it\u2019s been a busy day.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Grayson nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your meal then, Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought service for two.\u201d Stubb plunked tin plates and serving dishes on the table. \u201cAll passengers are to take their meals in the ladies\u2019 cabin until further notice. Captain\u2019s orders.\u201d The old man glanced at Gray. \u201cThe captain wants you both to stay belowdecks until we get our wind back. He\u2019d said you\u2019d understand, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Mr. Grayson replied. \u201cI understand.\u201d He gave Sophia a guarded look. \u201cBut I\u2019ll leave you to your dinner just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hungry?\u201d Stubb lifted the cover from a serving dish. At the smell of the salted-beef stew called lobscouse, Sophia\u2019s empty stomach complained loudly.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner will better enjoy her meal without my presence,\u201d Mr. Grayson said, backing toward the steerage passage. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019ll hold till breakfast. I find I\u2019ve little appetite this evening.\u201d</p> <p>Then he left. But not before flashing her one last searching, hungry glance.</p><p>Sophia smiled. He was a very poor liar.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Gray\u2019s body complained at him all night long. His empty stomach groused, when he might have filled it at dinner. His joints protested the cramped hammock swaddling him, when he might have been sharing a soft mattress with an even softer companion. And of course there was the ever-present ache of unfulfilled lust in his groin.</p><p>But beyond all this, his mind was in turmoil, and his heart\u2014his heart was unmoored completely. Wrenched free of its anchor and set adrift. He\u2019d no idea how to secure it again.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a virgin.</p> <p>So she claimed.</p><p>Don\u2019t question it.</p><p>At last, with that one bit of information, everything about the girl made sense. The fine clothes, the cultured air, the governess post. The spark in her eyes, and the way she responded to his touch. The way she touched him. She understood passion; she knew what pleasure they could share. Still he passed the night alone.</p><p>Because she offered more than pleasure. She offered her heart. She offered trust. God, she\u2019d practically thrust it upon him, and Gray didn\u2019t want it. He had enough people to look after, and he\u2019d already disappointed them all. It was only a matter of time before he\u2019d fail her, too. Even so, by daybreak Gray had already washed and dressed. He sat on a crate, tapping his boot and fidgeting with his pocket watch until eight bells sounded for the forenoon watch. Breakfast time. He could ignore the needs of his stomach no longer. Neither could he ignore this other gnawing ache inside him\u2014the need to see her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what he\u2019d say to the girl; as little as possible would be best. Gray fetched up a book, tucked it under his arm, and headed for the ladies\u2019 cabin door.</p><p>The aroma of freshly brewed tea greeted him. Miss Turner stood over the table, arranging a half-dozen small pots next to the breakfast tray. After yesterday\u2019s dramatic events and a restless night, it surprised Gray to see her standing there looking so ... normal. Almost domestic. The knot of anxiety in his chest unraveled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Without looking up, she unscrewed the lid off one of the pots and dabbed at its contents with a fingertip.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to poison my tea?\u201d Gray drew out a chair and sat down, plunking his book down on the table and helping himself to a biscuit.</p> <p>\u201cNothing quite so dreadful.\u201d She looked up at him, and the coquettish gleam in her eyes had him coughing around his mouthful of food. Yes, everything was as usual. The mere sight of her, so beautiful, so close\u2014stole his very breath. Which left him completely unprepared for the words she spoke next. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaint me?\u201d Vivid, sensual memories flooded his mind. Her fingers threaded in his hair, her body pressed against his. Gray doubted she even remembered that night, drunk as she\u2019d been. Of course, he couldn\u2019t forget it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you? I need to practice, and it is something to pass the time.\u201d Pushing aside a mug of tea, she began unfolding a small easel.</p><p>\u201cUnless you had some other activity in mind?\u201d</p><p>Gray cleared his throat and lowered his gaze to his book. He had many other activities in mind. \u201cI had planned to read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you still may.\u201d She threaded her arms through the sleeves of a smock and tied it behind her back. \u201cJust allow me enough time to rough in the outline of your features, and then you can read your book while I complete the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain ...\u201d</p><p>She set down a trio of brushes, lining them up from smallest to largest. \u201cI\u2019m running out of subjects, you see. I\u2019ve sketched or painted nearly everyone else on the ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d noticed.\u201d</p><p>She paused, staring hard at the brushes. \u201cHad you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifted to his. \u201cAnd ... ?\u201d</p><p>And what? What could he possibly say? That her sketches filled him with envy and yearning? That they revealed to him hidden qualities in men he\u2019d worked alongside for years, and showed him more than he\u2019d ever wanted to know of her heart? That he\u2019d spurned this same request\u2014and her\u2014 weeks ago, precisely because he dreaded the moment she turned that artist\u2019s eye on him and perceived the true quality of his soul? Irony tugged the corner of his mouth into a half-smile. Let her see it, then. Her supply of black pigment would be exhausted completely. She\u2019d never burden him with that trusting look again.</p><p>He drained his mug of tea and threw it down like a gauntlet. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she propped a canvas on the easel. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be at ease.\u201d She threw him an amused glance. \u201cMuch as I\u2019d rejoice to feel the sea rolling beneath us, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re in any imminent danger of being thrown to the floor.\u201d</p><p>Gray followed her gaze to his hand where it clenched the arm of his chair. Annoyed with his own transparency, he folded his hands across his chest, sliding one boot along the floorboards as he reclined in the chair. \u201cI am perfectly at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it,\u201d she asked, scratching with a pencil as her narrowed gaze alternated between him and the canvas, \u201cthat the son of a dissolute gentleman, raised on a West Indian sugar plantation and educated at Oxford, after inheriting land and an income, decides to make his life at sea?\u201d</p><p>Gray stared at her.</p><p>She ceased sketching and cast him an expectant look, tucking a stray wisp of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want me to talk? I thought I was supposed to remain still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are supposed to be at ease. And reminiscing, I find, usually puts a subject at ease.\u201d</p><p>Not this subject.</p><p>She turned back to her sketch. \u201cDid you dream of becoming a sailor as a boy?\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cNo. I\u2019d never been aboard a ship until I was sent off to Oxford. I was sick and miserable for the whole first week at sea. Couldn\u2019t eat a thing. A stroke of luck, as it turned out, for the sailors caught and ate a tainted fish. Nearly all of the crew fell ill; four of them died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Heavens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered my assistance to the captain. He put me to work, and I just took to it, somehow. By the time we crossed the Tropic, I was setting and furling sails like an able seaman. Between shifts in the rigging, I learned everything the captain had to teach me about windpower and navigation. When we reached England, I asked him if I could stay on, and he made me second mate. Didn\u2019t make it to Oxford for another year and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder that you bothered to go at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly didn\u2019t.\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cBut the war was brewing. And a letter finally caught up with me, saying my father had taken ill\u2014that sobered me. Both Joss and Bel were still underage, and I knew there\u2019d be no one to look after them if he died. Figured I\u2019d best stay put for a while, so they\u2019d know where to find me if they needed me. Oxford seemed as good a place as any. Only finished three terms, as it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your father did die.\u201d Catching the pencil between her teeth, she wiped her hands on the apron of her smock.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She removed the pencil from her mouth and turned her head to stare at him. Her eyes did not meet his, however. Rather, Gray fancied that she studied his ear, or perhaps the line of his jaw. He scratched his neck self-consciously, feeling his whole body heat under her unabashed appraisal.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s when you sold the land,\u201d she said, returning her attention to the canvas. \u201cAnd became a privateer?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut if you were concerned for your brother and sister, why did you not simply go home? Keep running the plantation?\u201d</p><p>Gray exhaled roughly. \u201cFor a host of reasons. But all of them had to do with money. Sugar prices were plummeting; tariffs kept increasing. West Indian plantations were no longer the profitable enterprises they\u2019d once been. We would have been mired in debt within the year.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt never would have worked. If I\u2019d told the executors about Joss, it would have meant months of delay, and I couldn\u2019t be certain he\u2019d even agree to sell. I found a buyer for the land, and I had the opportunity to buy this ship and obtain a letter of marque, so I seized it. And then I seized over sixty ships in the name of the Crown.\u201d Gray couldn\u2019t keep a hint of pride out of his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never regretted my decision. It was the only profitable course.\u201d</p><p>She cast another scrutinizing glance at him, this time in the direction of his hairline. Gray\u2019s own eyes rolled heavenward, as if he could follow the line of her gaze.</p><p>\u201cDoes this occur often, that the ship is becalmed?\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cNot every voyage. But often enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does it usually last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way of telling. Hours. Days. A week.\u201d</p><p>She brushed a stray wisp of hair behind her ear. \u201cA week\u2019s delay? That must affect your profit most adversely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it does.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the skylight beseechingly. This must be hell. He was losing money by the hour, he was made to suffer the unattainable temptation of the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen, and it was bloody hot. Without any fresh breezes to stir it, the air inside the cabin grew increasingly stale as the sun inched higher in the sky. It was barely mid-morning, and sweat was already beading under Gray\u2019s cravat. He looked back at Miss Turner, admiring the graceful, dewy curve of her bare neck as she bent her head. The temperature inside the cabin increased another degree.</p><p>She sat back and tilted her head to one side, studying the canvas. \u201cSurely it wasn\u2019t the only profitable course, privateering. There are so many risks involved, such unpredictability. I mean, you might have married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. That\u2019s what most eligible gentlemen in financial straits do, isn\u2019t it? You came from a good family and had some land to your name... surely you could have found a young heiress or wealthy widow to marry you, and then you might have done as you pleased. After all,\u201d she said, her eyes meeting his, \u201cit\u2019s not as though you lack sufficient charm to woo ladies. And you\u2019re certainly handsome enough, in your own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome enough. In my own way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bent her head again. \u201cOh, stop looking so smug. I\u2019m not flattering you, I\u2019m merely stating facts. Privateering was not your only profitable course of action. You might have married, if you\u2019d wished to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but there\u2019s the snag, you see. I didn\u2019t wish to.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a brush and tapped it against her palette. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You wished to be at sea. You wished to go adventuring, to seize sixty ships in the name of the Crown and pursue countless women on four continents. That\u2019s why you sold your land, Mr. Grayson. Because it\u2019s what you wanted to do. The profit was incidental.\u201d</p> <p>Gray tugged at the cuff of his coat sleeve. It unnerved him, how easily she stared down these truths he\u2019d avoided looking in the eye for years. So now he was worse than a thief. He was a selfish, lying thief. And still she sat with him, flirted with him, called him \u201ccharming\u201d and \u201chandsome enough.\u201d</p><p>How much darkness did the girl need to uncover before she finally turned away?</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Miss Turner?\u201d He leaned forward in his chair. \u201cWhy are you here, bound for the West Indies to work as a governess? You, too, might have married. You come from quality; so much is clear. And even if you\u2019d no dowry, sweetheart ...\u201d He waited for her to look up. \u201cYours is the kind of beauty that brings men to their knees.\u201d</p><p>She gave a dismissive wave of her paintbrush. Still, her cheeks darkened, and she dabbed her brow with the back of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t act missish. I\u2019m not flattering you, I\u2019m merely stating facts.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cSo why haven\u2019t you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained to you yesterday why marriage was no longer an option for me. I was compromised.\u201d</p><p>Gray folded his hands on his chest. \u201cAh, yes. The French painting master. What was his name? Germaine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGervais.\u201d She sighed dramatically. \u201cAh, but the pleasure he showed me was worth any cost. I\u2019d never felt so alive as I did in his arms. Every moment we shared was a minute stolen from paradise.\u201d</p><p>Gray huffed and kicked the table leg. The girl was trying to make him jealous. And damn, if it wasn\u2019t working. Why should some oily schoolgirl\u2019s tutor enjoy the pleasures Gray was denied? He hadn\u2019t aided the war effort just so England\u2019s most beautiful miss could lift her skirts for a bloody Frenchman.</p><p>She began mixing pigment with oil on her palette. \u201cOnce, he pulled me into the larder, and we had a feverish tryst among the bins of potatoes and turnips. He held me up against the shelves while we\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I read my book now?\u201d Lord, he couldn\u2019t take much more of this. She smiled and reached for another brush. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>Gray opened his book and stared at it, unable to muster the concentration to read. Every so often, he turned a page. Vivid, erotic images filled his mind, but all the blood drained to his groin.</p><p>As the sun inched higher in the sky, the crosshatched shadow of the grated skylight crept down the wall of the cabin and began its slow crawl across the floor. Soon the sun was directly overhead, painting the table with a checkerboard of shadows.</p><p>Feeling drowsy and sluggish, Gray hooked a finger under his sweat-dampened cravat and tugged. He stole a glance at Miss Turner over his book. Her pale muslin gown had wilted with the heat, clinging to her form in a most appealing manner. She rotated her neck slowly, stretching with a lithe, sensual grace.</p><p>\u201cIs there any more tea?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took up a handkerchief and pressed it to her brow, then her glistening, flushed d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably, feeling a new source of heat pool in his groin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get after Stubb to bring water. In a minute.\u201d He bent his head and closed his eyes and tried to think of anything cool. Those pretty flavored ices all the fashion in Mayfair, the ones he\u2019d be certain to take Bel to sample. The trout stream in Wiltshire where he\u2019d spent that summer between years at Oxford. Ale, fresh from the cellar in winter. Snow. Gray had a sudden image of Miss Turner standing in an English winterscape, dressed in rich velvet and dusted with powdery white snowflakes. Tiny crystals of ice clinging to her fur-trimmed gloves, her mantle, her hair, her thick fringe of eyelashes. Her pale skin contrasting with plump, flushed lips. An angelic apparition.</p> <p>Except that he couldn\u2019t do to an angel what Gray saw himself doing with this snow-covered siren. He imagined himself licking a snowflake from her cheek, and his tongue curled around the sharp burst of cold. In his mind\u2019s eye he tasted another, and another\u2014and they were sweet. She was a rose-flavored ice, a delicacy beyond anything he\u2019d ever tasted, and he was devouring her, taste by impossibly tiny taste. Snowflake by snowflake. Until he tumbled her back into the snow and bared the creamy mounds of her breasts, the plump berries of her nipples, the juicy curves of her delicious body\u2014and feasted.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Sophia counted six clangs of the bell before Mr. Grayson jolted fully awake. He looked up at her, startled and flushed. As though he\u2019d been caught doing something he shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>Rubbing his eyes, he rose to his feet. \u201cWill I shock you, Miss Turner, if I remove my coat?\u201d</p><p>Sophia felt a twinge of disappointment. When would he stop treating her with this forced politesse, maintaining this distance between them? How many tales of passionate encounters must she spin before he finally understood that she was no less wicked than he, only less experienced?</p><p>Perhaps it was time to take more aggressive measures.</p><p>\u201cBy all means, remove your coat.\u201d She tilted her eyes to cast him a saucy look. \u201cMr. Grayson, I\u2019m not an innocent schoolgirl. You will have to try harder than that to shock me.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in a subtle smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take that under advisement.\u201d She watched as he shook the heavy topcoat from his shoulders and peeled it down his arms. He draped the coat over the back of a chair before sitting back down. The damp lawn of his shirt clung to his shoulders and arms. A pleasant shiver rippled down to Sophia\u2019s toes.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit you anyway,\u201d she said, loading her brush with paint. He gave her a bemused look as he unknotted his cravat and pulled it loose. She inwardly rejoiced. Now, if only she could convince him to do away with his waistcoat ...</p><p>\u201cThe coat,\u201d she explained, when his eyebrows remained raised. \u201cIt doesn</p><p>\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is the color wrong?\u201d The sudden seriousness in his tone surprised her.</p><p>\u201cNo, the color is perfectly fine. It\u2019s the cut that\u2019s unflattering. That style is tailored to gentlemen of leisure, lean and slender. But as you are so fond of telling me, Mr. Grayson, you are no gentleman. Your shoulders are too broad for fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He chuckled as he undid his cuffs. Sophia stared as he turned up his sleeves, baring one tanned, muscled forearm, then the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat style of garments would best suit me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than a toga?\u201d He rewarded her jest with an easy smile. Sophia dabbed at her canvas, pleased to be making progress at last. \u201cI think you need something less restrictive. Something like a sailor\u2019s garb. Or perhaps a captain\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d His gaze became thoughtful, then searching. \u201cAnd even dressed in plain seaman\u2019s clothes, would you still find me handsome enough? In my own way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She allowed his brow to crease a moment before continuing. \u201cI should find you surpassingly handsome. In every way.\u201d She mixed paint slowly on her palette and gave him a coy look. \u201cAnd what of my attire? If you had your way, how would you dress me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had my way ... I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A thrill raced through Sophia\u2019s body. Her cheeks burned, and her eyes dropped to her lap. She forced her gaze back up to meet his. Now was not the moment to lose courage. Nothing held sway over a man\u2019s intentions like jealousy. \u201cGervais once kept me naked for an entire day so he could paint me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cHe painted a nude study of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He painted me. I took off my clothes and stretched out on the bed while he dressed me in pigment. Gervais called me his perfect, blank canvas. He painted lavender orchids here\u201d\u2014she traced a small circle just above her breast\u2014\u201cand little vines twining down ...\u201d She slid her hand down and noted with delight how his eyes followed its path. \u201cI feigned the grippe and refused to bathe for a week.\u201d</p><p>Desire and jealous rage warred in his countenance, yet he remained as immobile as one of Lord Elgin\u2019s marble sculptures. What would it take to spur the man into action? Frustrated, she blew a wisp of hair off her face and nodded in the direction of his arm. \u201cWould you pass me the little pot of red?\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at the scattered cakes of pigment. \u201cWhich one is the red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vermillion. Just there at your elbow. You see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one?\u201d He handed her a pot of Vandyke brown.</p><p>Sophia flung her palette on the table and stretched for the red pigment herself. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wish to help me, just say so. There\u2019s no need to tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, sweetheart. I\u2019m not teasing you at all. I don\u2019t see colors the way most people do, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t see colors?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI see some colors. Just not as many as other people seem to see. You say, \u2018red, green, brown\u2019... they all look the same to me. If a sapphire lies next to an amethyst, I can\u2019t tell them apart. Apparently, I had an uncle who was the same way. Once my tutor stopped beating me for mislabeling my Latin exercises, it\u2019s never troubled me.\u201d He turned his attention back to his book.</p><p>\u201cBut ... but that\u2019s tragic! To go through life without color? Unable to appreciate art, or beauty?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNow, sweet\u2014hold your brush before you paint me a martyr\u2019s halo. It\u2019s not as though I\u2019m blind. I have a great appreciation for art, as I believe we\u2019ve discussed. And as for beauty ... I don\u2019t need to know whether your eyes are blue or green or lavender to know that they\u2019re uncommonly lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has lavender eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d His gaze caught hers and refused to let go. Leaning forward, he continued, \u201cDid that tutor of yours ever tell you this? That your eyes are ringed with a perfect circle a few shades darker than the rest of the ... don\u2019t they call it the iris?\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe iris.\u201d He propped his elbow on the table and leaned forward, his gaze searching hers intently. \u201cAn apt term it is, too. There are these lighter rays that fan out from the center, like petals. And when your pupils widen\u2014like that, right there\u2014your eyes are like two flowers just coming into bloom. Fresh. Innocent.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head, mixing a touch of lead white into the sea-green paint on her palette. He leaned closer still, his voice a hypnotic whisper.</p><p>\u201cBut when you take delight in teasing me, looking up through those thick lashes, so saucy and self-satisfied ...\u201d She gave him a sharp look. He snapped his fingers. \u201cThere! Just like that. Oh, sweet\u2014then those eyes are like two opera dancers smiling from behind big, feathered fans. Coy. Beckoning.\u201d</p><p>Sophia felt a hot blush spreading from her bosom to her throat.</p><p>He smiled and reclined in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know the color of your hair to see that it\u2019s smooth and shiny as silk. I don\u2019t need to know whether it\u2019s yellow or orange or red to spend an inordinate amount of time wondering how it would feel brushing against my bare skin.\u201d</p><p>Opening his book to the marked page, he continued, \u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started on your lips, sweet. If I endeavored to discover the precise shade of red or pink or violet they are, I might never muster the concentration for anything else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned a leaf of his book, then fell silent.</p><p>Sophia stared at her canvas. Her pulse pounded in her ears. A bead of sweat trickled down the back of her neck, channeling down between her shoulder blades, and a hot, itchy longing pooled at the cleft of her legs. Drat him. He\u2019d known she was taunting him with her stories. And now he sat there in an attitude of near-boredom, making love to her with his teasing, colorless words in a blatant attempt to fluster her. It was as though they were playing a game of cards, and he\u2019d just raised the stakes. Sophia smiled. She always won at cards.</p><p>\u201cBalderdash,\u201d she said calmly.</p> <p>He looked up at her, eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cNo one has violet lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She laid aside her palette and crossed her arms on the table. \u201cThe slope of your nose is quite distinctive.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked in a lopsided grin. \u201cReally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She leaned forward, allowing her bosom to spill against her stacked arms. His gaze dipped, but quickly returned to hers. \u201cThe way you have that little bump at the bridge ... It\u2019s proving quite a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He bent his head and studied his book. Sophia stared at him, waiting one ... two ... three beats before he raised his hand to rub the bridge of his nose. Quite satisfactory progress, that. Definite beginnings of fluster.</p><p>\u201cOnce, during one of my lessons with Gervais, I was sketching Michelangelo\u2019s David, from a plate in a book. Only, I could not capture the muscles of the forearm at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim again?\u201d He heaved a bored sigh as he turned another page.</p><p>\u201cGervais stood up\u201d\u2014Sophia pushed back from the table and rose to her feet\u2014\u201cwrenched off his coat, and rolled his shirtsleeve up to the elbow.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand flat on the table, directly in front of Gray.</p> <p>\u201cHe took my hand and dragged my fingers over every slope and sinew of his arm.\u201d As she spoke, Sophia traced the tendons of her planted wrist with her free hand. When she skimmed her fingers up to the hollow of her elbow, she heard his breath catch. Good. More progress.</p><p>\u201cAnd after touching them,\u201d she said, \u201cI had no trouble sketching those muscles at all.\u201d</p><p>Gray snapped his book shut, tossed it aside, and stared up at her in challenge. The dark intensity in his eyes gave Sophia a heartbeat\u2019s pause. Slowly, she stretched one hand toward his face. \u201cNow ... hold perfectly still.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed as she touched one finger to the bridge of his nose. With deliberate slowness, she traced the uneven, bronzed slope with her fingertip. His breathing grew husky. At last she broke the contact. He kept his eyes closed.</p><p>She ran a thumb across his left eyebrow, then drew a bold line from his temple to his cheekbone. His skin was softer than she\u2019d expected, and oddly cool beneath her fingertips. She dragged her fingers down into the rough growth of beard along his jaw, flattening her hand to let the bristles rasp against the sensitive skin of her palm.</p><p>He drew a ragged breath that verged on a groan, but his eyes remained shut. He held perfectly still.</p><p>Something hot and hungry surged through Sophia\u2019s veins. Desire, mingled with the heady thrill of power. She traced the contours of his brow, skimmed over the soft, vulnerable curves of his eyelids. His lashes, long and curved as a child\u2019s, trembled under her touch, and a sweet pang of tenderness swelled in her heart. She followed the circumference of his face, running one fingertip down to the cleft of his chin, then climbing the thin scar slanting to the corner of his mouth. He exhaled roughly, and Sophia felt the heat of his breath swirling through her blood. Emboldened, she slid her thumb along the ridge of his lower lip.</p><p>His hand shot up to capture hers, holding it pressed against his cheek. He looked up at her mournfully, his hair mussed and his breathing labored. Oh, yes. Fluster accomplished.</p> <p>\u201cGray.\u201d She leaned closer, the damp fabric of her shift tangling around her thighs.</p><p>He tensed. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll only hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an innocent, Gray. I know what you want. Can\u2019t you tell I want it, too?\u201d She leaned over to whisper in his ear. \u201cI could show you colors. Colors like you\u2019ve never dreamed. The cool blue of my eyes ...\u201d She blew gently over his neck and watched the tendon there go rigid. \u201cThe golden silk of this hair ...\u201d She wound a stray lock around her finger and brushed it over his cheek.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart ...\u201d</p><p>Sophia hovered above him, bringing her lips within an inch of his. \u201cI could teach you the taste of perfect, luscious, rose-petal pink.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, almost imperceptibly. \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t pursue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? Well, as it happens, I\u2019m tired of being pursued. I\u2019m rather enjoying taking the other role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, believe me, I\u2019m not worth pursuing. And if I ...\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again. \u201cIf I let this happen, I never will be. I gave my word, and for once I want to keep it. I\u2019m a scoundrel, by trade and vocation, and I\u2019m all wrong for a girl like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl like me? But I\u2019m already ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuined? Because you\u2019ve known pleasure? There\u2019s nothing about you that\u2019s ruined. You\u2019re young and beautiful and full of dreams. You\u2019re exquisite.\u201d He touched her face. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes. Such sweet words. How she wished she deserved them.</p><p>His fingers caught a stray lock of her hair. \u201cThis tutor who attempted to ruin you, he was clearly an amateur. But sweet ... to my shame, I\u2019ve had a great deal of practice. I\u2019m trying to go respectable. I\u2019m trying to be a better man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not. And it\u2019s making you miserable.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her free hand to his other cheek, framing his face between her palms. \u201cYou do have the face of a scoundrel ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see me clearly, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what of the man beneath? There\u2019s so much more to you, I know it. I feel it. A passion for life. Such strength ...\u201d Hooking her fingers under his collar, she slid her palm toward his muscled shoulder. \u201cAnd this heart.\u201d Her fingers strayed lower over his chest, grazing the border of his scar. He winced. With a low growl, he pulled her hands away. \u201cSweetheart, I ...\u201d</p><p>He released a gruff sigh, and his face shuttered. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sophia sat up, feeling the sting of defeat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be sorry.\u201d She put a hand on either arm of his chair and balanced above him. If he bent his head, it would rest on the waiting pillows of her breasts. He looked quite aware of that fact. \u201cVery ... very ... sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sophia returned to her chair with a playful flounce, hoping to conceal the manner in which her thighs still quivered and her heart ached. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said lightly, taking up her palette and coating her brush with paint.</p><p>\u201cI will finish my painting. You may go back to your book.\u201d</p><p>She kept her attention focused on the canvas before her. In her peripheral vision, however, she could see that Gray\u2019s book remained closed on the table. She could hear his breathing, slow and thick. Even in this hot house of a cabin, she could feel his radiant male heat burning through her thin muslin gown and chemise.</p><p>The task of appearing unaffected by this open lust grew increasingly difficult. After a few minutes, her arm ached from clutching the palette so tightly. Sophia laid both palette and paintbrush on the table and began to knead the spot where her neck met her shoulder, massaging the sore knot of muscle there. The tendrils of hair against her neck were damp with perspiration.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>Sophia froze. Her heart stopped beating. Surely she hadn\u2019t heard what she thought she\u2019d\u2014\u201cYou heard me.\u201d His chair slid around the table to rest beside hers. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t touch you. So touch yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse roared back to life, and the pounding rhythm of her heart echoed in dull, forceful beats at the apex of her thighs. Sophia shut her eyes. The suggestion was shocking and thrilling and altogether unspeakable. Impossible. She had to think of a response. A scathing set-down to dash cold water over his ardor. Over hers. She had to douse this wild passion coursing through her veins.</p><p>But there was no cold water. Only hot, liquid desire beading on her forehead, trickling down between her breasts. She\u2019d begun this game of bluffing. She could hardly back down now, when losing the game meant losing him.</p><p>As if they moved of their own accord, her fingers left the crest of her shoulder and slowly wandered down the lace-edged slope of her neckline.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The soft hiss of the word slid over her skin like a caress. \u201cYes. Touch them for me.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples puckered instantly, drawing to hard peaks against her chemise. She hesitated, eyes still tightly shut. Her breath heaved in her chest, lifting the top of her breast against her fingers with each inhalation.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweet. Touch them for me. Five-and-twenty days we\u2019ve been on this ship. Four-and-twenty nights I\u2019ve dreamt of cupping those breasts in my hands. I\u2019m aching to hold them, to feel them firm and round and soft under my fingers. God, they\u2019re so soft, aren\u2019t they, sweetheart? Just like your hands, your wrists, your lips. You\u2019re so soft, soft as petals all over.\u201d</p><p>The deep baritone of his voice rumbled through her, each word setting off a tremor in her core. Sophia bit her bottom lip to keep it from quivering. Curling her fingers around the fabric of her dress and chemise, she dragged them over her shoulder and slowly down, until the neckline would stretch no further. She dipped her fingers under the fabric and lifted her breast, liberating the damp, heavy globe from her bodice. Hot air swirled over her nipple. She shivered, imagining it to be his breath. He was silent for a moment that stretched into an age. Sophia kept her eyes clamped shut, dying a slow, quiet death of exposure and shame. What on earth was she doing, exposing her breast to this man? So wanton, so loose. He\u2019d known she would do it. He\u2019d encouraged her just to tease. To regain the upper hand. If she opened her eyes, he\u2019d be smirking at her. Mocking her.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he finally breathed. \u201cYou are so beautiful. So perfect. Smooth and fair and creamy and round. And sweet, oh sweet. It\u2019s as though I can taste you. Touch your nipple for me.\u201d</p><p>Hardly believing what she was doing, Sophia dragged her thumb over the straining peak. White light burst through the darkness behind her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he groaned. \u201cDo it again.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed.</p><p>\u201cAgain. God, I want to lick you there. I want to run my tongue around and around and then pull you into my mouth and suckle you hard. Tug on it, sweet. Yes, just like that. I want to lose myself in that softness and feel your arms around me while I suckle you until you moan.\u201d</p><p>Sophia rolled her nipple between her thumb and forefinger, imagining his strong, rough hands on her. His lips and tongue caressing her, sucking her. Her breath rushed out in a long, low sigh.</p><p>\u201cYes, louder. Moan for me. Let me hear you.\u201d</p><p>Moaning, Sophia cupped her other breast through the fabric of her dress, teasing the taut, hidden bud.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you. All of you. I want to see and stroke every perfect, beautiful inch of you. Your breasts. Your navel. The backs of your knees. Every last toe. I want to taste you all over. Lick that powder you use right off of your skin. I want to know every secret, hidden part of you. I want to know how it is that you smell like a damned rosebush in the middle of the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out to wet her lips. He groaned. \u201cOh, sweet. If you knew what you do to me. I\u2019m aching for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It occurred to Sophia that he might be touching himself, too. Perhaps it ought to have shocked her, that thought. Instead, it drove her to a new peak of excitement. She slid down in her chair, her legs falling apart slightly. Between her thighs, she felt achy and hot. Drenched with sweat and desire.</p><p>\u201cLift your skirts,\u201d came the hoarse command. \u201cLet me see you. I have to see you.\u201d</p><p>Lost in a dark haze of passion, Sophia was past thinking, past shame. Her hands slid from her breasts to the tops of her thighs. She fisted her hands in the thin muslin and slowly hitched the fabric up, baring her ankles. Then her calves.</p> <p>\u201cMore. Higher.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, rucking the muslin up over her knees, smoothing one palm against her sensitive inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet Heaven. Look at you. No stockings, no garters. No drawers, either? Tell me there are no drawers.\u201d</p><p>She arched her spine slightly, her head lolling against the back of the chair. She skimmed her hand higher to bare the smooth expanse of her thigh.</p><p>He released a ragged sigh. \u201cNo drawers, either. I\u2019ll never take you back to England now. This is how I want you, always. Here, in the tropical heat\u2014no petticoats, no stockings, no drawers. Ready for me at any time. And you are ready for me, aren\u2019t you, sweet? You\u2019re so hot and wet. God, how I want to taste you. You\u2019re delicious, even from here.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia\u2019s heart was pounding so hard, she feared it would explode. Her head spun, dizzy with heat. Her mouth fell open. She was panting. She felt shameless and sensual and more boldly feminine than she\u2019d ever felt in her life.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself for me.\u201d His voice took on a new urgency, grew rough and demanding. \u201cYou know the place, I know you do. Touch yourself for me.\u201d</p><p>His voice held her in such thrall, she was powerless to disobey, even if she\u2019d wanted to. But she didn\u2019t want to. She wanted to do everything he told her. She wanted to be here, always, in this sultry tropical fog of desire, and let him do what ever he would with her. Her fingers brushed over the damp nest of curls at the juncture of her thighs, parting the slick folds of her sex to find that swollen, sensitive bit of flesh.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, sweet. Do it for me. I want to taste you there. I want to be in you, feel you tight and clasping around me. I want you moaning for me. Under me. On top of me. I want to have you in every way known to man, and then invent a dozen more. Touch it for me. Imagine it\u2019s me there, touching you. In you.\u201d</p><p>The climax broke through her in a crashing wave. She arched up off the chair, her breath caught in a strangled cry. Plea sure jolted through her again and again, until she went limp in its aftermath, shuddering. A blissful peace washed over her first.</p><p>Followed by awareness.</p> <p>Then shame.</p><p>Oh, God. What had she just done? With shaking hands, she pushed her skirt back down over her knees. She brought one hand to her still-naked breast and the other to her eyes, squeezing them shut tight. But not tight enough. Hot tears leaked through her trembling lashes.</p><p>\u201cOh no, sweet. No.\u201d</p><p>He whispered so tenderly, but the sound of his voice only served as a cruel reminder that he was there. He had seen. The tears came harder, spilling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweet, don\u2019t cry.\u201d His voice was low and close to her ear. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d He paused. \u201cAre you thinking of him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you cry? Surely you\u2019re not embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>Sophia sobbed against her hand.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sweet. Please don\u2019t. Don\u2019t cry, or I\u2019ll cry with you. You\u2019re the most lovely, most perfect thing I\u2019ve ever seen in all my life, and I could weep for the sheer beauty of you.\u201d Rough fingers smoothed the hair from her brow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever be ashamed, not with me.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her hand away from her face. She kept her eyes shut tight as he kissed her fingertips, one by one, then turned her hand over to plant a heartrendingly tender kiss upon her palm.</p><p>Sophia opened her eyes. The ceiling flashed bright above her at first, through a blurry haze of tears. She blinked and sniffed. Never in her life had she felt so vulnerable. The burdensome disguise she\u2019d been wearing the entire voyage\u2014wearing her entire life, it seemed\u2014had been stripped away. No more deceptions, no more fantasies. This was all that remained: a weary, wanton, lonely girl with one hand clasped to her naked breast and the other pressed against his lips.</p><p>She\u2019d bared herself before him, in every way. As she\u2019d never dared reveal herself to anyone. More truth had passed between them in the last ten minutes than any conversation could relay, and still he held her, soothed her. Would his lips still form such tender words and soft kisses, if he knew the complete truth?</p><p>He kissed her palm again. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I\u2019d die before I\u2019d let anything or anyone hurt you. I couldn\u2019t bear to think I\u2019d caused you such distress.\u201d He pressed her hand against his bearded cheek. She felt his lips graze her temple. \u201cSweet,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re safe with me. Always.\u201d</p><p>Sophia turned her head slowly, until her gaze locked with his. His eyes\u2014they were the purest cerulean blue, and fathoms deep. She caressed his cheek with her thumb. \u201cOh, Gray.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>She said his name, and it pierced him. Like a needle-thin dagger that threaded right between his ribs to embed itself in his heart. And like any sudden wound, it caught him completely off-guard. It hurt. It sent him into shock.</p><p>What had just happened? He\u2019d been reading; she\u2019d been painting. They\u2019d argued over paint, discussed colors. He\u2019d teased her until she blushed, and she\u2019d teased him back. She\u2019d touched his face. Oh, how she\u2019d touched him. Then suddenly he was viewing the most erotic display he\u2019d ever witnessed in his life. And that included several erotic displays he\u2019d paid good money to watch.</p><p>He\u2019d said things to her. Wild, depraved fantasies he\u2019d never voiced to any woman without paying her handsomely first. Perhaps a few things he\u2019d never said to any woman at all. And she\u2019d listened, and complied. Willingly. With sensual abandon and such sweet trust, it made his heart ache. He\u2019d said anything and everything that came into his mind, to keep her going. To bring her to that peak of pleasure and watch her while she came. That much was good. Very good.</p><p>But then she\u2019d cried, and he\u2019d said more. He would have said anything, promised her everything to soothe her. Now he stared into her red, weepy eyes, suddenly realizing how very close he\u2019d come to doing just that\u2014promising her everything\u2014and it scared him into a cold sweat. She dragged that soft, soft thumb across his cheek, and his knees actually trembled. Trembled, damn it!</p><p>Gray had no idea what the hell was happening to him, but he knew that it had to be bad. Very bad.</p><p>Her lips were pouty and swollen with passion and just begging to be kissed, long and slow and deep. His groin was still throbbing with the memory of her erotic little gasps, her back arched in ecstasy. Oh, Gray, she said. Oh, Gray, indeed. As in, oh Gray what the holy hell has come over you and what the devil do you intend to do about it?</p><p>He took the coward\u2019s way out. He looked away.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were painting a portrait. Of me.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, following his gaze to her easel. A vast seascape overflowed the small canvas. Towering thunderclouds and a violent, frothy sea. And slightly off center, a tiny ship cresting a massive wave.</p><p>\u201cI am painting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, am I on the little boat, then?\u201d It was a relief to joke. The relief was short-lived.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly, turning back to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m on the little boat. You\u2019re the storm. And the ocean. You\u2019re ... Gray, you\u2019re everything.\u201d</p><p>And that was when things went from \u201cvery bad\u201d to \u201cworse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take credit for the composition. It\u2019s inspired by a painting I once saw, in a gallery on Queen Anne Street. By a Mr. Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurner. Yes, I know his work. No relation, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked back at the canvas. \u201cWhen I saw it that day, so brash and wild ... I could feel the tempest churning in my blood. I just knew then and there, that I had something inside me\u2014a passion too bold, too grand to keep squeezed inside a drawing room. First I tried to deny it, and then I tried to run from it ... and then I met you, and I saw you have it, too. Don\u2019t deny it, Gray. Don\u2019t run from it and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, still rubbing his cheek with her thumb. Grasping his other hand, she drew it to her naked breast. Oh, God. She was every bit as soft as he\u2019d dreamed. Softer. And there went his hand now. Trembling.</p><p>\u201cTouch me, Gray.\u201d She leaned forward, until her lips paused a mere inch away from his. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps that dagger had missed his heart after all, because the damned thing was hammering away inside his chest. And oh, he could taste her sweet breath mingling with his. Her lips were so close, so inviting. So dangerous.</p><p>Panic\u2014that\u2019s what had his knees trembling and his heart hammering and his lips spouting foolishness. It had to be panic. Because something told Gray that he could see her mostly naked, and watch her toes curl as she reached her climax, and even cup her dream-soft breast in his palm\u2014but somehow, if he touched his lips to hers, he would be lost.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d For the second time that day, he pulled her hand away from his face. For the first\u2014and, he suspected with distressing certainty, the last\u2014time ever, he slid his hand from her breast. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The pain in her eyes devastated him. \u201cThen I suppose you\u2019d better leave.\u201d</p><p>The bell clanged through the silence, insistent and ceaseless. An alarm to match the frantic pounding of Gray\u2019s heart. Did the whole ship know the danger he was in?</p><p>But as his consciousness filtered back, he became aware that the dull thunder in his ears wasn\u2019t his pulse. It was real thunder. And the roar of breath rushing in and out of his lungs was drowned out by the howl of distant wind. The ship gave a lazy tilt, and a small cake of pigment rolled the length of the table before crashing to the floor. Then a wild lurch cleared the rest of her paints and had them both grasping the bolted table for balance.</p><p>\u201cAll hands! All hands!\u201d</p><p>Gray pushed back in his chair, glancing up through the ventilation grate. As he rose to his feet, another sudden dip swept the chair out from under him. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Mr. Grayson.\u201d Her voice was weak. \u201cGo. Please, just go.\u201d</p><p>And with one last look in her welling eyes ... God help him, he left. Gray emerged from the companionway to a scene eerily similar to the one on Miss Turner\u2019s canvas. The Aphrodite hurdled over white-capped swells, and a bank of forbidding black clouds clung to the horizon. As he made his way to the helm, seawater dashed over his linen-clad shoulders, reminding him he\u2019d left his coat belowdecks. Regret hollowed out his chest. His coat was the least of what he\u2019d left there. Any shred of courage or decency he possessed. His heart, the shriveled, black thing it was.</p><p>And her.</p><p>Above him, a pair of sailors were deftly reefing the main topsail. Gray envied them. That was what he needed: He needed to work. He needed to perform hard, physical labor until he was numb to the fingertips and blind with exhaustion. He needed to sweat her out of his system. He met Joss at the ship\u2019s wheel. \u201cSeems we\u2019ve got our wind back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Joss said. \u201cAnd then some. I don\u2019t like the look of those clouds.\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the distance.</p><p>\u201cNor the sound of them,\u201d Gray added.</p><p>Joss lifted a spyglass to his right eye, squeezing the left shut. \u201cThere\u2019s a sail approaching to windward. I\u2019ve given orders to lie-to and hail her, see what they can tell us about the squall. Perhaps they\u2019ve just come through it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr around it.\u201d</p><p>Joss lowered the spyglass to give him an enigmatic look. \u201cWhat are you doing abovedecks, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cry went up for all hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a hand. You\u2019re a passenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not be a hand, but I\u2019ve got two perfectly good hands, and if I sit on them a second longer, I\u2019ll go mad.\u201d</p><p>Joss stared at Gray\u2019s open collar, where his cravat should have been knotted. \u201cShe\u2019s really getting to you, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Gray muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I do.\u201d</p> <p>Gray ignored his brother\u2019s smug tone. \u201cDamn it, Joss, just put me to work. Send me up to furl a sail, put me down in the hold to pump the bilge ... I don\u2019t care, just give me something to do.\u201d</p><p>Joss raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d He lifted the spyglass to his eye and began scanning the horizon again. \u201cBatten the hatches, then.\u201d</p><p>Gray tossed a word of thanks over his shoulder as he descended to the quarterdeck and went to work, dragging the tarpaulins over the skylights and securing them with battens. As he labored, the ship\u2019s motions grew more violent, hampering his efforts. He saved the vent above the ladies\u2019 cabin for last, resisting the urge to peer down through the grate. Instead, he first secured one end, then blanketed the entire skylight with one strong snap on the canvas.</p><p>\u201cAhoy! Ahoy!\u201d Wiggins leaned forward over the prow, hailing the approaching ship, its puffed scudding sails a stark contrast against the darkening sky.</p><p>Gray moved to cover the companion stairs, reaching inside the gaping black hole and groping for the handle to draw the hatch closed. Something\u2014or someone\u2014groped him back.</p><p>When the skylight was battened, the cabin went instantly black. Sophia felt the sudden, suffocating darkness, even though her eyes were clamped shut, the heels of her hands pressed flat against them to stem the tide of tears.</p> <p>What was happening?</p><p>She stood up on shaky legs, smoothing her frock over her hips and adjusting her bodice in the dark. Fumbling in the darkness, she felt her way toward the cabin door and opened it. A square of light pierced the darkness overhead\u2014the companionway hatch.</p><p>She moved toward the stairs and placed a foot on the bottom riser. When she reached forward to grab hold of the ladder\u2019s edge, however, her hand met instead with something warm, solid, and strong.</p><p>An arm.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d a voice said. A large hand closed over her wrist. His voice. His hand.</p><p>She nearly wept anew. He was still there. In some absurd, maudlin spike of self-pity, she\u2019d prepared herself to never see him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded, his shadowy face protruding through the hatch. \u201cGet back in your cabin.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but of course he was still there. His mere presence signified nothing, she told herself sternly. It wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d any means of escaping the ship. If he had, he surely would have taken it.</p> <p>Even so, she hadn\u2019t the courage to let him go.</p><p>She used his arm as leverage, hauling herself up the stairs even as the ladder pitched and rolled beneath her. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d The salty breeze whipped loose strands of hair across her face, and she used her free hand to tuck them behind her ear. She gripped his arm with the other.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a storm coming.\u201d Deep lines etched his face. His own hair clung to his brow in thick, wet locks. \u201cYou need to remain below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d she protested, pulling the hair from her face once again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t even raining.\u201d</p><p>He caught her chin in his hand and stared down at her face. For a breathless moment, Sophia thought he intended to kiss her. She thought wrong.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He swiveled her head toward the ship\u2019s bow.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The wind whipped the sound from her lips as quickly as she uttered it. Before them, the sky boiled with towering, greenish-black clouds. If Sophia hadn\u2019t suffered through enough geography lessons to know better, she would have thought they\u2019d sailed to the very end of the earth and were about to tumble off the map into a churning void.</p><p>He turned her face back to his. The threat in his eyes was no less murderous than that of the sky. She\u2019d never seen him look so forbidding.</p><p>\u201cNow go below. And stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming with me?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhoy!\u201d</p><p>Shouts drew their attention to starboard, where a tall ship backed its mainsail in preparation to speak with the Aphrodite. Peering through the spray, she could barely make out the ship\u2019s name painted on its side: the Kestrel.</p><p>The wind accelerated, screaming through the rigging overhead. The ocean\u2019s surface erupted in a thousand white-edged crests, like a sea monster bearing row upon row of menacing teeth.</p><p>\u201cGet below!\u201d Gray steered her back toward the hatch.</p><p>Then the sky cracked open in a flash of white, just as thunder quaked the deck beneath their feet. For a terrifying, endless moment, the world blanked. There was no sight, no sound, only the pungent scent of sulfur and weightless shock.</p><p>With a swift yank on her wrist, Gray twirled her into his chest, wrapping his arm across her torso and forcing her down to the deck. Sophia cowered between the wooden planks beneath her and the human fortress of warmth and strength surrounding her. Protecting her. She took a mental inventory of her limbs, making sure they were all still there. Yes, there were her legs, curled awkwardly into her belly. One arm was pinned beneath her; with her other hand she still clutched his sleeve. She slid her trembling hand down toward his wrist, rejoicing to feel his pulse pound against the crook of her thumb. Her own heart thudded against her ribs. Muffled noises reached her ears\u2014men shouting, wood splintering. But the only sounds that Sophia cared about were these twin rhythms: his heart, and hers. After a few moments, the weight pressing her to the deck eased, and she felt herself lifted to her feet.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, locking her knees as she rested her back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWas ...\u201d Her throat worked. \u201cWas that lightning? Did it strike the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no.\u201d His grip tightened over her wrist. \u201cIt struck theirs.\u201d</p><p>She craned her neck to look up at his face. His features pale and drawn, he stared hard out over the ship\u2019s rail. Sophia followed his gaze. At first she scarcely noticed it, the faint red glow at the tip of the Kestrel\u2019s mainmast. The ship was still some distance away, and Sophia had to squint to make it out. But it was there. Gray\u2019s arm went slack about her, and she took a step forward. The light seemed to disappear for a moment, then sparked feebly and glowed anew, like an ember in a dying fire. But this fire was not dying.</p><p>The captain appeared at Gray\u2019s side. Together, the two men stared up at the red glow. \u201cGray, can you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A tongue of flame spurted from the tip of the mast. Sophia felt Gray\u2019s whole body stiffen. Fire slithered down a length of rope, igniting one tip of the topmost yardarm.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, why don\u2019t they raise the alarm?\u201d the captain asked. \u201cWhere is her crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a blast like that ...\u201d Gray\u2019s voice took on a steely edge. \u201cDead, some of them. Stunned or maimed, at least.\u201d</p><p>A swell tipped the deck, and Sophia stumbled back against his chest. His chin scraped the crown of her head. They fit together so perfectly. Since the day he\u2019d helped her board this ship, she\u2019d fallen time and again into his embrace. To her, the truth was plain. His arms belonged around her. If only he would let her into his heart.</p><p>She turned her head and rested her brow against his shoulder. \u201cGray,\u201d</p><p>she whispered.</p><p>He tensed and pulled back. But he didn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>The captain cupped his hands around his mouth. \u201cPut in the boats!\u201d he shouted toward the men at the bow. \u201cBrace the mainsail aback!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re falling back?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat choice do we have?\u201d The captain scrubbed his face with one hand.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no telling which direction that mast will fall. We can\u2019t risk the Aphrodite catching fire. I\u2019ll put in the boats. If there are any survivors, they\u2019ll make their way overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if they\u2019re injured or trapped in the hold, they won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose to do, Gray?\u201d</p><p>His reply was quiet, but firm. \u201cBoard it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sophia pulled out of his grip and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The captain\u2019s expression mirrored her sense of alarm. \u201cBoard a burning ship? Gray, are you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as though we\u2019ve never done it before. This used to be our livelihood, boarding burning ships. That mast is a fuse. It\u2019ll send the whole ship up in smoke if it\u2019s not cut down before those flames reach the deck.\u201d</p><p>He clapped a hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder, his lips thinning in a tight smile. \u201cCome on, Joss. It\u2019ll be like old times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn old times, any blaze we faced was the result of our own cannonfire. You know a lightning strike can spark fires all through a ship. Even now, there could be a blaze in the hold. If there\u2019s a keg of powder, a cask of rum nearby ... The whole thing could go any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d best look lively, hadn\u2019t we?\u201d Gray strode toward the rail, shouting up at the sailors, \u201cMainsail haul! Bring her around!\u201d</p><p>The men complied without hesitation, and the Aphrodite pivoted, coming abreast of the other ship. Sophia stood transfixed as the flames crawled across the royal yard. The furled sail took fire like a scroll of paper.</p><p>\u201cVolunteers!\u201d Gray lifted a coil of rope from its pin. \u201cWho\u2019ll board her with me? No men with wives or children.\u201d</p><p>Levi appeared at his side out of nowhere, strong and silent as ever. He and Gray exchanged nods of agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d O\u2019Shea swung down from the yardarm and dropped to the deck with catlike grace. \u201cJust like old times, eh, Gray?\u201d</p><p>Gray shot an amused glance at his brother. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>As the distance between the ships narrowed, the three men tested their ropes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go, too.\u201d Davy pushed to the rail.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sophia cried. \u201cGray, you can\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ship could suffer my loss easier than most.\u201d The boy stood tall, rolling the sleeves of his tunic up over his elbows. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve no wife or children, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d</p><p>The four men grabbed hold of their ropes and climbed onto the rail, preparing to swing across the gap of churning sea to board the burning ship. No anxiety showed on Gray\u2019s face, only sharpened focus and grim determination. By contrast, Sophia was consumed with fear. She glanced up. The flames had reached the topgallant now. Dread numbed her entire body, and the bitter gale seemed to howl straight through her, whistling through her ribs and chilling her heart. She remembered the captain\u2019s words. There could be fires throughout the ship ... A keg of powder, onecask of rum, and ...</p><p>And he would be gone.</p><p>\u201cGray!\u201d A gust of wind took her choked sob and flung it out to sea. The captain strode forward, reaching for a coil of rope. \u201cIf you\u2019re determined to do this fool thing, I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gray\u2019s face was hard. \u201cNo men with wives or children.\u201d His gaze darted toward Sophia, then quickly away. If he read the desperate plea in her eyes, he did not acknowledge it. She winced, feeling the meaning of that dismissive glance. What ever she was to him, she was something less than a wife. And he would never allow her to be more. She wasn\u2019t reason enough for him to live. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t want you.</p><p>Something inside her splintered and cracked.

We\u2019ll signal when all\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>He hoisted his body\u2019s weight on the rope, the powerful brawn of his arms and back straining against the seams of his wet shirt. \u201cThe Aphrodite\u2019s yours, Joss. Take care of her for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, I will.\u201d A knowing look passed between them. \u201cI\u2019ll look after the ship, too.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>Gray\u2019s boots hit the Kestrel\u2019s deck with a hollow thud. Once the other three dropped over the rail, he began giving orders. The howling wind forced him to shout.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Shea, take the wheel. Keep her steady, pointed into the gale. Otherwise, she\u2019ll be on her beam ends before we even get a whiff of smoke.\u201d The Irishman nodded and raced to the helm.</p><p>Gray looked to Levi. \u201cFind some axes and start chopping down the mainmast. I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p> <p>His men dispatched, Gray peered up, squinting at the darkened sky rent by a line of bright flame. The fire was halfway down the mast now. With this unholy wind fanning the flames, they had only a matter of minutes before the fire reached the deck. No time to waste.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chop with Levi.\u201d Davy stood at his elbow. \u201cI\u2019m strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gray looked around. Where were the damn axes, anyhow? \u201cI need you to search the ship. See if there are blazes in the hold. Look for injured, or anyone trapped. If you come across anything flammable\u2014spirits, powder, medicines\u2014you\u2019re to heave it overboard immediately, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The boy nodded, his face pale but determined. \u201cAye, captain.\u201d Davy\u2019s voice cracked, and Gray felt a twinge of guilt. He should have insisted the boy stay aboard the Aphrodite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your captain,\u201d Gray called after him.</p><p>\u201cOn this ship, you are.\u201d With a shrug, Davy hurried toward the hatch. Gray strode toward the mainmast, looking for Levi. His boots crunched over something metallic. He stared down at the deck. Nails. Bent, fused together, some gnarled as tree roots. Good Lord, he\u2019d heard of lightning strikes like this\u2014jolts strong enough to rip nails right out of the mast and send them clattering to the deck\u2014but he\u2019d never seen such a thing, in all his years at sea. He hoped he\u2019d never see it again.</p> <p>A misshapen hunk of metal rolled to a stop at his feet, still smoking. Gray kicked the roundish lump. \u201cWhat the devil is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it used to be the bell.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s head snapped up, and he found two bedraggled sailors standing before him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d the shorter of the two asked, rubbing his shoulder as though it ached.</p><p>\u201cAre you unharmed?\u201d Gray eyed the men from head to toe. Tattered clothing hung from their gaunt frames, and their hands were black with tar and soot. The acrid odor of singed hair assaulted his nostrils. The sailors nodded. \u201cJust rattled, is all,\u201d the taller one said. \u201cOthers weren</p><p>\u2019t so lucky.\u201d He tilted his head toward a lifeless heap of rags on the opposite side of the deck. Mercifully, the dead sailor\u2019s face was hidden from view, but a charred hand still clutched the rigging. Gray swallowed hard, tasting bile. \u201cWhere\u2019s your captain?\u201d He brushed past the sailors. \u201cAnd where the devil are your axes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know where the captain\u2019s at,\u201d one sailor answered. \u201cProbably rummin\u2019 in his cabin. I\u2019d like to think the bastard\u2019s dead, but we wouldn\u2019t be that lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for the axes ...\u201d The taller seaman nodded toward the rail, and Gray followed his gaze. A row of wooden hatchet handles stood at attention. Their hatchet blades, however, lay on the deck. Jolted from their handles, still smoking, half-melted ... and completely, utterly useless. Gray swore. Levi came bounding out from the galley, some sort of meat cleaver in one hand and a carving knife in the other. It was all Gray could do not to laugh till he cried. They were going to take down the mast with a meat cleaver?</p> <p>Without a word, Levi handed him the knife and began attacking the mainmast with the cleaver. Well, apparently they were going to try. Gray ran to the standing rigging, using the knife to saw through the ropes that connected mast and ship. If by some miracle Levi managed to cut through the mainmast, it couldn\u2019t fall clear with the rigging intact. The two sailors drew knives from their belts and began to assist. Despite the spray and wind, Gray\u2019s body quickly heated with the exertion. Sweat trickled down his brow, and he dabbed at it with his sleeve between blows. Eventually, he gave up the sawing motion in favor of full-armed swipes of the knife.</p><p>\u201cHow many crewmen?\u201d he yelled at the sailors, hacking away at another rope. \u201cDead.\u201d Thwack. \u201cAlive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s eleven of us. Five were in the forecastle. Don\u2019t know how they fared. Two dead here on deck. A few others got blasted, but they\u2019re still alive. So far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the hold?\u201d His blow landed awkwardly, glancing the rail. Pain erupted in his elbow.</p><p>\u201cRum!\u201d Davy scrambled toward them, juggling a small powder keg. Gray stopped mid-swing and stared at the boy. Terror was etched on his young face. \u201cIt\u2019s rum, Gray. The hold\u2019s full to bursting with it, and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Davy tripped on a coil of rope, dropping the keg. Gray watched it roll back down the quarterdeck, trailing a thin line of powder as it went. Perfect. Just bloody wonderful.</p><p>Gray swung the knife again, fear cramping his side. \u201cIs there fire below?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I saw. But there are wounded men down there. One of them ...\u201d</p><p>Davy\u2019s chest convulsed with a sudden heave, as if he would vomit. \u201cOne of them\u2019s burnt bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoats?\u201d Gray looked to the sailors.</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d</p><p>A wave of heat swamped them as the topsail caught fire, going up in flames like a dry leaf. Gray examined the shallow groove in the mainmast. Despite Levi\u2019s strength, he\u2019d barely managed to score the trunk of pine. It would take far too long to fell it. By that time, the flames would be too low. The fire would reach the deck, ignite the powder, spread to the hold full of rum, and the entire ship would explode like a Bonapartist\u2019s grenade. Bloody hell.</p><p>Levi kept swinging the tiny cleaver, while the rest of the men merely stared at Gray. Davy swallowed and shifted his weight, clearly awaiting direction. \u201cCaptain?\u201d</p><p>The instant that word fell from Davy\u2019s lips, Gray knew several things. He knew he was now the de facto captain of this godforsaken ship. He\u2019d boarded it and taken command, and now he had to stay with it until the end. He knew he could save some of the men, but not all. At this rate, they\u2019d be lucky to get the boat lowered before the rum exploded, let alone bring the injured up from the hold. And he knew he couldn\u2019t leave the wounded behind and live with himself afterward. Which meant he wouldn\u2019t live. He\u2019d never get back to the Aphrodite. Not to his business, not to his family. Not to her.</p><p>He was going to die. Today.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>He ran both hands through his hair, pushing it off his brow, then took the cleaver from Levi. \u201cPut in the boat. Raise the call to abandon ship.\u201d A hunk of charred yardarm dropped to the deck at his feet, forcing him to step back. \u201cAnd be quick about it.\u201d</p><p>The men hurried to lower the jolly boat from the ship\u2019s stern, leaving Gray to stare up at the burning mainmast. The mast danced with flame like a giant candlewick. He made a fist and punched the stubborn column of wood, earning nothing but scraped knuckles and searing pain for his trouble.</p><p>\u201cFall, damn you.\u201d He leaned his shoulder against the mast and pushed, though he knew it a futile effort. Teeth gritted and heels dug into the grooves of the deck, he shoved again. \u201cFall.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>An unfamiliar seaman\u2019s voice rasped through the gale. \u201cAbandon ship! All hands, abandon ship! To the boat!\u201d</p><p>A handful of sailors struggled up through the forecastle hatch, lurching their way toward the stern. If the men noticed a bearded madman attempting to topple the mainmast with his bare hands, they did not pause to spare him a second glance.</p><p>\u201cStop that bloody shouting!\u201d</p><p>The surly, languid curse drew Gray\u2019s attention toward the stern. He watched as a lanky man in a black, brass-buttoned coat staggered out from the captain\u2019s cabin, rubbing his bleary face. Slack-jawed and blinking, he wore an expression that was one part bewilderment, two parts liquor. The captain looked up at the encroaching flames and scowled. \u201cWhat the devil\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. Had the man slept through the whole damned ordeal? He\u2019d lost at least two crewmen and his ship was poised to become an inferno, and this excuse for a commander had the idiocy to curse the alarm that roused him from his stupor?</p><p>The deck lurched, and the drunken captain grabbed a pin for support. With the next roll of the ship, he vomited wildly on his own boots. Gray took two strides toward the helm and cupped his hands around his mouth. \u201cO\u2019Shea!\u201d</p><p>The Irishman caught his gaze across the ship\u2019s wheel.</p><p>Gray indicated the retching officer. \u201cGet him to the boat. And stay there yourself. Tell Levi to start pulling away. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll swim out to you. Now go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye.\u201d O\u2019Shea yanked on the captain\u2019s coat sleeve, practically carrying him toward the boat. They both disappeared over the ship\u2019s rail, and Gray watched the ropes securing the jolly boat reel out and then go slack.</p><p>They were away.</p><p>Gray sagged against the mainmast, feeling the flames above him singe his hair. He was going to die here, alone, leaving nothing to mark his time on this earth but a string of dashed expectations and broken promises. His legacy would fade faster than the wake of a porpoise.</p><p>Something popped overhead, and sparks showered down around him. Ducking, Gray buried his face against his arm. Perhaps, he thought, he could swim for it. There were injured men in the hold\u2014how many? Four?</p><p>Five? No way to save them now. But he could save himself. He could swim back to her. He\u2019d swim miles to her, if that\u2019s what it took. But could he live with himself afterward, knowing he\u2019d abandoned five men to an agonizing death while he swam to safety?</p><p>An image of her loveliness bloomed behind his eyelids.</p><p>Gray decided maybe he could.</p><p>Sliding his back down the mast, he sank to the deck and wrestled to remove his boots.</p><p>The flames had reached the standing rigging now. Above him, the tar sizzled and popped on the surfaces of the ropes, dripping to the deck like a black, sulfurous rain. His first taste of hell? The heat of the flames washed over him.</p><p>And then a familiar voice froze the very blood in his veins.</p><p>\u201cWhat now, Captain?\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. Gray\u2019s head snapped up, and a curse tainted his rough exhalation. It was. Davy. \u201cWhat the hell are you still doing here? You were supposed to leave with the boat!\u201d</p><p>The boy shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Thought you needed me.\u201d</p><p>Gray squeezed his eyes shut and let his booted foot fall to the deck.</p><p>\u201cDavy, I don\u2019t suppose you can swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Captain.\u201d</p><p>Gray swore again. He kicked the mast. Punched it. Stepped back, lowered his shoulder and rammed it with all his strength, all the while releasing a vicious stream of profanity.</p><p>Davy tilted his head and scratched his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bloody right, it\u2019s not working,\u201d Gray shouted at him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die, do you realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there no other way to take a mast down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken dozens of masts down. But from my own damn ship, with the...\u201d As Gray\u2019s voice trailed off, hope sparked in his chest. The idea was pure madness. But better mad than dead. He wheeled to face the bow, a prayer caught in his throat as his eyes swept the deck. Finally, his gaze locked on the object he sought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A six-pounder cannon, hunched low by the rail.</p><p>He strode toward it, the boy hurrying to follow. \u201cDavy, do you know how to fire a cannon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Captain.\u201d</p> <p>After cutting the ropes with his knife, Gray swung the cannon one hundred and eighty degrees and shoved it to the center of the quarterdeck. \u201cYou\u2019re going to learn. Put your thumb here\u201d\u2014he indicated the vent hole at the top, and waited until Davy complied\u2014\u201cand don\u2019t remove it until I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>Gray retrieved the keg Davy had dropped earlier and broke it open with his knife, pouring a good third of its contents into the cannon. No time to measure out the charge. Better to err on the side of excess. Now for the cannonballs. \u201cWe\u2019ll use a double shot,\u201d he explained to Davy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only get one try at this.\u201d Gray reached for the row of shot stored in the bulwark, only to snatch his hand back. The bloody things were still scorching to the touch. And worse. His heart sank as he gave the row an experimental kick.</p><p>The damned things were fused together. A caterpillar of iron. Every profane word Gray had ever heard, read, uttered, or invented spewed forth from his mouth. Don\u2019t panic, he told himself, when Davy blanched. Anything can go in a cannon. Anything metal, and preferablyround.</p><p>The gale howled through the sails, now lacy with flame. The ship gave a sudden lurch; the deck tipped. And the smoking remnants of the ship\u2019s bell rolled to rest at Gray\u2019s feet, like the answer to a prayer.</p> <p>Using the cuffs of his shirt to buffer the heat, he threw the lump of metal into the cannon\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Gray gestured for Davy to remove his thumb. \u201cNow, we need a fuse ...and a spark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shortage of those.\u201d Davy\u2019s straight-faced quip gave Gray a sudden surge of determination. He was not going to let this boy die. Crewmen with his good humor and courage were beastly hard to find. Crouching behind the cannon, he aligned the sights with the base of the mainmast, just below the spreading flames.</p><p>If he missed\u2014or even if he hit his mark\u2014this single shot could have the entire ship exploding into flame and ash. It was a desperate risk, for a desperate situation.</p><p>\u201cStand clear, to the side,\u201d he ordered Davy. \u201cAnd cover your ears.\u201d Gray scrambled to pluck a glowing sliver of wood from the deck. He touched it to the fuse, clapped his hands over his ears, and ducked.</p><p>Boom.</p> <p>The shot ripped from the cannon\u2019s barrel. A cloud of smoke and powder instantly engulfed them. Splinters of wood showered them, some piercing straight through Gray\u2019s shirt and lodging in his flesh. Blinded, deafened, choked, and gagged\u2014Gray simply waited for one of his senses to return and let him know whether or not he\u2019d survived.</p><p>The powder slowly cleared, and through the dissipating cloud, Gray saw the mainmast. Blasted on one side, but still standing. Still afire. Burning brighter still.</p><p>Gray jumped to his feet. \u201cFall, damn you.\u201d</p><p>The wind accelerated, and an eerie creaking sound pierced the air. Slowly, drunkenly, the mainmast splintered at its base and made an ungainly dive into the sea, severed rigging slithering behind it like eels.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Gray slumped back to his knees.</p><p>And then\u2014as if God Himself had heard him and decided to drown his blasphemous soul and be done with it\u2014the skies opened up and vomited rain.</p><p>Stinging sheets of water scoured the deck, pelting them as they huddled by the cannon. For long moments the two of them crouched there, soaking up water like sponges. Gray\u2019s limbs were heavy with shock. At last, Davy sputtered and shook himself like a wet dog, adding a horizontal spray of water to the vertical deluge. \u201cThank God.\u201d His boyish grin broke the ice encasing Gray\u2019s own reaction.</p><p>He laughed. What else could he do? He ought to have died. He was going to live. It was either laugh or weep, and he was already soaked with enough water to float a barrel.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t relax yet. We\u2019re not done.\u201d He put a hand under Davy\u2019s arm and hauled the boy to his feet. \u201cFind any able-bodied men still aboard and form a work chain. The ship\u2019s not out of danger yet. A slow fire might have sparked anywhere in her frame. We have to bring up that rum from the hold and dump it overboard. Then we\u2019ll see to the injured.\u201d</p><p>Davy paused as they moved toward the hatch. \u201cIf we\u2019re throwing the rum overboard ... Can we at least drink some first? I could do with a swallow.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cSo could I.\u201d</p><p>Some time later, Gray swung his shaky legs over the rail of the Aphrodite. Joss hurried to his side. \u201cAny dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. And three more gravely wounded.\u201d Gray raked his wet hair away from his face. \u201cBest to send the longboat for them. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any fire in the hold, but you know as well as I do it\u2019s too soon to tell. These things are known to flare up hours later. We\u2019ve emptied it of anything incendiary, just to be safe.\u201d</p><p>Joss looked up at the sky. \u201cWell, with this downpour, it seems less likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Exhausted, Gray leaned against the rigging and wiped his brow with his forearm. \u201cEveryone all right here?\u201d He tried to keep his voice steady.</p><p>Joss nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s in my cabin, Gray. I think you\u2019d better go to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d want that.\u201d After the way he\u2019d deserted her earlier, he assumed she\u2019d be just as happy never to see him again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been sick with worry, Gray. I had to order her to go below. Even then, she\u2019d only heed my cautions long after the rain doused the blaze. She</p><p>\u2019ll be relieved to see you\u2019re well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just anxious for young Davy.\u201d Still, he couldn\u2019t douse the spark of hope that kindled in his chest. And he couldn\u2019t stay away. Giving Joss an affectionate punch on the arm, he climbed the stairs to the helm and opened the hatch.</p><p>Slowly, he descended into the murky cabin. Although it was still daytime, the storm clouds banked most of the sun\u2019s rays. Gray blinked, scanning the shadows. Then he saw her, silhouetted against the windows at the stern.</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Then, realizing she probably couldn\u2019t discern the gesture in the dark, he cleared his throat and forced out, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ... are you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes began to adjust to the dimness, and he could just make out the soft slope of her shoulder, her arms crossed over her belly. Her hair was loose, falling to her waist in heavy waves.</p><p>\u201cLevi and O\u2019Shea?\u201d she asked, her voice tremulous. \u201cDavy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re safe, too. The fire\u2019s out. It\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing. Gray stood quietly for a moment, shifting his weight. Goto her, a voice inside him urged. Take her in your arms. Beg herforgiveness. Say something; promise her anything. God, what a coward he was. In truth, he\u2019d been only too eager to board a burning ship and risk his life that afternoon. Because it was easier to walk through fire than to face this little governess, and the tempest of emotion she stirred in his heart.</p><p>The silence mocked him. He was on the verge of taking his leave when suddenly she ran to him, flinging her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gray. I was so frightened. But I just knew you\u2019d come back to me. You had to come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d Gray stood shocked and immobile as she clutched his neck, sobbing noisily against his shoulder. His hands dangled uselessly at his sides.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she cried again and again. \u201cThank God you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Her affection overwhelmed him, as did her softness, her tears. Even after all he\u2019d said to her, after all he\u2019d done\u2014she still gave a damn whether he lived or died. It was humbling. Incomprehensible. Wonderful. If he\u2019d known this would be his reward, he would have fallen overboard weeks ago. Finally, he drew a deep breath and wrapped his arms about her, clutching her tightly to his chest. \u201cShhh, sweet.\u201d With a trembling hand, he stroked her hair. The damp locks slid through his fingers like ribbons. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s all over now.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and raised her face to his. He was still murmuring assurances and stroking her hair, and the sight of that perfect face tilted inches from his</p><p>\u2014it caught him completely unprepared. Her beauty hit him like a lightning bolt.</p><p>Her hands skimmed up his neck, tugging his face down to hers. Gray closed his eyes as she brushed a warm, feather-light kiss against his jaw. Another landed on his neck. Then the corner of his mouth. She pressed her cheek to his, and he felt her hot tears mingle with the cold rivulets of rain. His heart squeezed. After the callous way he\u2019d treated her, for her to hold him like this and kiss him so tenderly\u2014it was the truest act of bravery Gray had ever seen. She was offering up her heart, fully expecting him to break it. And selfish bastard that he was, Gray had lost any will to push her away. Maybe ... just maybe, he didn\u2019t need to. He\u2019d just boarded a ship, sprung its mast, destroyed its cargo\u2014the same actions he\u2019d performed time and again in the past, out of greed. But this time, he\u2019d done them for different reasons entirely. Not to take, but to protect.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d taken many\u2014 too many\u2014women in his arms before, with only the most dishonorable of intentions. But this was different. So different. If he could seize a ship with honor ... perhaps he could do this with honor, too. Not to take, but to protect. To cherish. To love.</p><p>She sobbed against his cheek again, and he pulled back. \u201cHush, love,\u201d he whispered, smoothing her hair behind her ear. He cupped her face in his hands and lowered his lips to hers in a gentle kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s all over now.\u201d</p><p>And it was. It was all over now. The fire was out, and the men were alive. And she was here in his arms, where she fit like she was fashioned for his embrace. Weeks of frustrated longing were finally at an end. Years of emptiness, too. It was all over now.</p><p>And Gray ... Gray was finished. Done for. Completely and hopelessly lost in the softest, most tender embrace he\u2019d ever known. He held her face in his hands, brushing light kisses over her lips. Kissing her slowly, carefully, as though he were only just learning about kissing\u2014because he was. Not learning how to kiss, but learning why to kiss. Not in persuasion, not as a prelude to further liberties. Simply to discover the taste of her, delicate and fresh and exquisitely sweet. To tell her things he didn\u2019t dare express in words. To tell her things he had no words to express. He kissed her for no greater pleasure than to kiss, because at that moment, kissing her felt like the greatest pleasure imaginable.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her cheeks, her brow, her eyelids, her hair, interspersing his kisses with little endearments in every language he knew. Then, eyes closed, he rested his forehead against hers and waited. Leaving the choice to her.</p><p>With a little sigh, she melted in his arms, pressing the length of her body to his. Her breasts rubbed against his chest, deliciously warm and soft.</p><p>Desire blazed through him. And suddenly, Gray was right back in the middle of an inferno.</p><p>She popped up on her toes, pressing her lips to his with a fierce urgency. An urgency he shared. The desperate energy that had fueled his race against the flames still ricocheted through his body. Gray felt it humming in his bones and pounding in his blood. And now he poured it all into kissing this woman, lashing his arms around her and lifting her body against his. Crushing her soft belly against his growing arousal.</p><p>Her lips parted beneath his, and he eagerly accepted the invitation. Their tongues tangled, tasted, teased, each of them giving and taking in return. Finally Gray broke away, sliding one hand down to cup her bottom as her fingers twined tightly into his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said between kisses. \u201cFor what I said that night. For leaving you earlier. I never meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, wrapping a leg over his hip and shinnying up his body. Her lips grazed his ear. \u201cI know. Just don\u2019t leave me again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d The word burst out like an oath or a prayer, and God help him, he meant it. \u201cNever,\u201d he repeated, looking straight in her glimmering eyes. Then he sealed the vow with a kiss, deep and desperate and true. \u201cOh, God,\u201d he groaned when their lips finally parted.</p><p>She kissed him again, working her warm, slender fingers under the collar of his shirt to stroke the chilled flesh of his shoulders and back. He buried his face in her neck, inhaling the beautiful scent of her. He\u2019d forgotten how roses smell sweetest after a rain. Trailing light kisses down to her collarbone, he began carrying her toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Gray.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t need to ask it. They both knew what was going to happen. But Gray felt the significance of her words. He might have bedded ladies and whores the world over, but for the first time in his life, he was going to make love to a woman. And not just a woman. His woman. And this idea that should have been so unthinkable, so frightening\u2014to his surprise, Gray found it wildly arousing. They tumbled together onto the narrow bed, and she began pulling his shirt free of his trousers. He rose up on his knees and impatiently yanked it over his head.</p><p>He peered at her frock in the darkness.</p><p>Bloody hell. Stripes.</p><p>Gray started to roll her over, looking for laces or hooks or some other ridiculous device contrived by the devil to thwart men.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNext time.\u201d She wriggled beneath him, drawing her skirts up to her waist. The erotic dance of her hips had him trembling with need. \u201cNext time, we\u2019ll go slowly. We\u2019ll do everything you told me this morning, and more.\u201d She gasped as he palmed her breast through the wet muslin. Her fingers hooked under the waistband of his trousers, and she looked up at him with a bold, smoldering gaze. \u201cBut I need you now, Gray.\u201d</p> <p>With a low groan, he leaned over to suck one pert nipple straight through the layers of shift and frock. She moaned and arched against him, working his buttons loose with one hand, until her fingers slid down into his smallclothes to caress the swollen head of his erection. Oh, God. He needed her now, too. He needed her now, and again later, and perhaps a third time that night. And tomorrow and the next day and every day after that. He was pulsing with need, straining into her touch, and as her fingers curled around him, they both gasped.</p><p>She stroked him gently, so sweetly he wanted to weep for the joy of it. He slid one hand up her thigh to find her hot and wet and grinding against his palm. Next time, he promised himself. Next time, he would take the time to touch her and taste her and learn her responses and watch her beauty unfurl at the peak of passion.</p><p>But she needed him now, and he needed her now, and now wasn\u2019t a minute or even a second later. Now was now. Gray brushed her hand away, positioned himself at her hot, wet entrance, and thrust. She cried out, digging her fingers into his arms so hard he nearly cried out, too.</p><p>Oh, God. She was so tight. Too tight. Fresh tears streamed down her cheeks even as she tried to look brave. And Gray finally understood that elusive, un-nameable sweetness that always lingered about her, beneath the powder and rose water.</p><p>It was innocence.</p><p>His little siren was a virgin.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d His breath hitched in his chest as he struggled for control. \u201cOh, sweet, you should have told me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now.\u201d She swallowed hard, sliding one hand up to cradle his face. \u201cOnly you, Gray. Now and always. Only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>She silenced him with a finger to his lips, then trailed the touch slowly down his chin, down the center of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anyone else. Only you.\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head, uncertain what to believe. Her words were some sort of miracle, and so were her thighs cradling his hips, and her hair fanned out like a shining halo around her head. A fierce, primal joy flooded his chest, to know that she was his, and his alone.</p><p>His to possess; his to pleasure.</p><p>He shifted his weight on his hands, and as he did, he sank another inch into her. They both winced.</p><p>His to hurt.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart, I can\u2019t bear to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said through quivering lips. \u201cHonestly, it feels better already.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was lying. He rocked his hips backward with every intention of withdrawing, but she hooked her legs over his.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped, her body tightening around his in every way imaginable. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me. You promised.\u201d</p><p>He groaned as the exquisite friction pulled him back in. Gritting his teeth to restrain himself, he sank into her slowly. Her eyes grew wide, but she gave him a brave nod of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed as he finally buried himself to the hilt and they were completely, perfectly joined. The feel of her surrounding him, holding him\u2014it was like nothing he\u2019d ever dreamed. He squeezed his eyes shut and rocked again slowly. Back and forth, he gently pistoned his hips, grinding against her. Until she said it again, this time releasing the word in an erotic sigh. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>It took every ounce of willpower Gray possessed not to lose control that instant and simply drive into her again and again. But she\u2019d trusted him to make love to her, not rut with her. She\u2019d trusted him to be her only one. Now and always. So he kept up the slow, steady rocking of his hips. Feeling her body caress his with each small, measured thrust.</p><p>She shut her eyes, and her head rolled back against the pillow. \u201cOh, Gray,\u201d she moaned, arching into his subtle thrusts now with tiny tilts of her hips. He bent to suckle her breast again, licking the soft peak through the rough, wet fabric.</p><p>She clutched his shoulders. He froze, panting above her. His hands fisted in the bed linens as he grappled for control.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she said, a teasing note in her voice. She caressed his shoulders. Her fingers trailed down his chest, and she pressed her thumbs against his nipples.</p><p>Gray let out a hoarse groan. \u201cI can\u2019t ...\u201d His voice trailed off as she craned her neck and kissed his chest. The sweep of her tongue against his neck pushed his restraint to its limit. \u201cSweet, stop. I want to make this good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is good.\u201d Her teeth grazed his collarbone. \u201cYou are good for me.\u201d Her head fell back against the pillow, and she met his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no pain anymore.\u201d</p><p>This time, he believed her. He had to believe her, because his control was in shreds, and nothing but faith remained.</p><p>He drove into her now, thrust after blissful, unrestrained thrust. And when she cried out and clung to his neck, he knew it was with pleasure, not pain. Her core convulsed around him, pulling him toward release in waves of raw, mindless need. Then she cupped his face in her hands and blessed him with a single, sweet kiss.</p><p>And in the end, it was that kiss that proved his undoing. With a hoarse cry against her lips, he shuddered and collapsed, pumping his release into her. The last tremors of pleasure were still rippling through him, and already he wanted her again. Again, now, always, only.</p><p>He settled the length of his body over hers, guarding her between his arms. His rough, gasping breath precluded speech, but they needed no words. There were no words for the transcendent, floating happiness suffusing his limbs and filling his heart. Only kisses. Kiss after deep, heartfelt, unhurried kiss.</p><p>It was some time before Gray\u2019s awareness shifted from the wondrous taste of her soft, generous mouth to the strange, angular object pressing into his belly.</p><p>He propped himself up on one elbow and slid a hand up her hip, past the glorious Tropic where they remained joined even now, up over her belly to the notch between her ribs. His hand closed around a small, cloth-covered bundle strapped to her torso with bands of cloth. He frowned, feeling the solid object with his fingers, trying to learn its shape. Money, he realized. It had to be money. He spanned his fingers over it, testing its size. Bloody hell. It was a great deal of money.</p><p>\u201cGray, I can explain.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>Sophia tensed at the sudden edge in his voice. Surely he couldn\u2019t be angry. Not after the pleasure they\u2019d found, the connection they still shared.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she murmured, stretching her neck to kiss him wherever she could reach. His hard chest, his powerful shoulders bracketing hers. She wanted to thank him, to bless him for the gift he\u2019d given her. Such tenderness, and such pleasure.</p><p>Her mother, her sister, her married friends\u2014in the weeks leading up to her wedding, there had been no shortage of women warning Sophia that her first experience in the marital bed would be painful, awkward, and blessedly quick. The ladies had varying opinions on whether the activity would improve with time, but predictions of an unpleasant wedding night were universal.</p><p>None of them, she thought with a secret smile, had met Gray. The power in his strong body, the passion he aroused in her, all tempered by such patience, the innate tenderness he hid so carefully from the world. There had been pain, yes. But the pain had been chased away by indescribable pleasure, intense and overwhelming, beyond anything she\u2019d ever imagined. And Sophia\u2019s imagination was vast.</p><p>Embers of desire still smoldered under her skin, on her lips, between her legs. She tightened around him, wanting to preserve this moment forever. Lacing her fingers behind his neck, she attempted to pull him down for a kiss.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d he repeated tersely. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She stroked the hair back from his face. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll tell you everything. But for now ... please, just hold me.\u201d</p><p>He swore, his coarse tone scraping against her nakedness. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who I\u2019m holding.\u201d</p><p>He released her abruptly, and Sophia gasped as he withdrew from her body. Somehow it hurt more than when he\u2019d entered her. He rolled away, leaving her uncovered. Damp with rainwater, sweat, and tears. Cold.</p><p>\u201cOf course you know me,\u201d she whispered. No one had ever made her feel so accepted as this man did. She feared no one else ever would. He sat up, turning away and dropping his head in his hands. Sophia rolled onto her side and reached out cautiously to stroke his back. When her fingertip snagged on a sharp obstacle, she winced. \u201cYou have splinters in your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Well, you have a small fortune between your breasts.\u201d</p><p>Sophia struggled to sit up, move closer. \u201cReally, Gray. These must be painful. Let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it be.\u201d He jerked away. Sophia curled her hand and let it fall to the bed. His voice measured, he continued, \u201cYour name isn\u2019t even Jane Turner, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name Turner is ... borrowed. Jane is mine.\u201d And it was truly hers, if only her middle name. That part could not count as a lie. Minimizing the number of her falsehoods seemed of sudden importance.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was.\u201d Perhaps she had been a virgin until today, but her reputation was surely in tatters.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d He shot her a hard look, his eyes awash with anger.</p><p>\u201cYou were a virgin.\u201d</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t understand his ire. Yes, she\u2019d deceived him, but shouldn\u2019t he be happy, that he\u2019d been her first lover? Her only lover, if she had her wish? \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you weren\u2019t ruined. Though you are now, thanks to me.\u201d He swore again. \u201cYou lied to me. You knew I didn\u2019t want to take your innocence, so you tricked me into it. God, what a conniving little thing you are.\u201d</p><p>His words chilled her to the core. Sophia smoothed the fabric of her dress back down, covering her shivering legs. \u201cGray, it was not like that. You have to give me a chance to expl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even a governess, are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She chewed her lip. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. No woman with those assets\u201d\u2014he gestured brusquely toward her breasts and the money strapped beneath them\u2014\u201cneed seek employment. How much is there? Two hundred pounds? Three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He ran his hands through his hair, then curled them around the edge of the bed. \u201cNo one comes by that kind of coin honestly. Who are you then? A thief? A fugitive? Some sort of swindler?\u201d</p><p>All of the above. Sophia clutched the blankets around her, as if they could protect her from his angry words. She knew this was a tangle of her own making, but she\u2019d never dreamed it would be so difficult to make straight. Once he embraced her, she\u2019d imagined, he would happily embrace the truth as well. She\u2019d even expected he\u2019d be amused, to hear the full story at last. But now ... his obvious displeasure suggested otherwise. Fear built within her, swift and treacherous.</p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d she asked, her voice weaker than she\u2019d like.</p><p>\u201cAfter all that we\u2019ve shared?\u201d She slid one leg toward him, until her thigh grazed his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve shared?\u201d He pulled his hand away. \u201cWhat have you shared with me, but lies?\u201d</p> <p>How could he say such a thing? She\u2019d shared everything with him. Her artistry, her most secret fantasies. Heavens, she\u2019d touched herself in front of him. Now she\u2019d given him her virtue, in a moment of passion and tenderness surpassing anything she\u2019d ever known. And he was rejecting that gift, as though it were nothing. Rejecting her.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Hiking his trousers to his waist, he stood and turned to face her. The look in his eyes was not quite revulsion, but rather an expression of utter disbelief. \u201cI told you things. About myself, about my family. I told you things I\u2019ve never told another soul. Now I learn you\u2019re no more than a stranger to me.\u201d He swore again.</p><p>\u201cMust you persist in swearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I must. Damn it, I thought I was done bedding nameless women.\u201d</p><p>Now Sophia was growing angry, too. \u201cI see. And now I suppose you intend to continue?\u201d</p><p>He froze, arm extended to retrieve his shirt. For a long moment, Sophia stared at him. He wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes. Finally, he pulled the shirt over his arms and head, tucking it into his trousers with motions that bespoke controlled fury. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said coolly, buttoning his falls. \u201cAfter what we just did ... it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d Sophia swallowed around the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cThe truth? Or me?\u201d</p><p>He pierced her with an icy look, one boot poised on the ladder leading up to the hatch. \u201cHow can you even ask me that?\u201d</p><p>How can you be so cruel? A sob smothered the question. She hugged her arms across her chest, blinking away tears.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d The slight rasp in his voice tugged her eyes back up. His gaze deepened, made room to hold hers. \u201cRight now, there are dead and dying men up there, and a disabled ship in need of repair. At the moment, they are what matters. Stay here. I will come back.\u201d He mounted the ladder. \u201cWe</p><p>\u2019ll deal with this later.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>Sophia fell back onto the bed, curling into herself like the head of a fern. We\u2019ll deal with this later? How hateful that sounded. How final. She didn\u2019t want to be dealt with. She wanted to be comforted. She wanted to be held. She wanted something she hadn\u2019t felt in so long, she scarcely remembered how to name it\u2014but she dared to imagine she deserved it, just the same. She wanted to be loved.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t come back that night. Her only visitors were Gabriel, who politely ignored her bedraggled, tear-stained appearance when he brought her evening tea and biscuit, and Stubb, who delivered her trunks to the captain\u2019s cabin. Evidently, the ladies\u2019 berths had been appropriated as a makeshift hospital for the Kestrel\u2019s wounded.</p><p>Unfamiliar voices and late-night activity obscured the Aphrodite\u2019s usual nocturnal symphony\u2014bells and creaking wood and the reedy whistle of the breeze. Huddled in the center of the bed, Sophia drifted in and out of shallow sleep, straining her ears to catch any echo of his rich baritone, or the squeaking hinges of the hatch. If Gray did come to her, she wanted to be awake. But she kept watch in vain, and exhaustion finally claimed her with the first rays of dawn.</p><p>When she woke, it was to full daylight. Sophia bolted straight up in bed, her heart pounding. An argument was brewing directly above her, near the ship\u2019s helm. Even with the hatch closed, she could make out not only Gray\u2019s voice, but the captain\u2019s, as well as O\u2019Shea\u2019s thick brogue. And a few unfamiliar voices as well. Although he was not addressing her, the timbre of Gray\u2019s voice was as hollow and unforgiving as a bell struck on a winter morning\u2014just the way she\u2019d heard it last.</p><p>She rose from bed and went to the tiny round looking glass attached to the cabin wall, realizing with wonder that she hadn\u2019t looked in a mirror since leaving England. The image reflected there was greatly altered. Her skin was a shade or two darker\u2014resembling bone more than porcelain\u2014and lightly freckled from the sun. Some of the curves had sharpened to angles; her features caught more shadows now. When she squinted, faint lines pleated at the corners of her eyes, and even when she relaxed her expression, the lines had the audacity to linger. She was still beautiful, Sophia told herself, with no false or undue modesty. But it was no longer a pampered debutante\u2019s face that stared back at her.</p><p>She was a woman now. A fallen woman in truth, alone in the world, responsible for her own choices. She had to pull herself together, be strong. No more tears, she admonished herself, pressing the heels of her hands against her eyes. Gray could not ignore her forever. He would come to her eventually, most likely to hurl further angry accusations. When the time came, she would not weep or make excuses. She most certainly would not beg.</p><p>But by God, she would look pretty.</p><p>She washed her face and dabbed cold tea under her eyes to relieve the puffiness. Rifling through her trunks, she located her hairbrush and dusting powder. At least her hair, which had grown stiff with salt over the past three weeks, had been rinsed clean by yesterday\u2019s storm. Now dry, it tumbled about her shoulders in golden waves.</p><p>She\u2019d washed out her sprigged muslin a few days ago, and it was as clean as it could get. When she reached into the trunk to retrieve the frock, however, her fingers lingered over a bundle at the bottom. Crisp tissue crackled under her touch, sliding over the silk beneath. She was tempted to unwrap the dress, to draw the fine fabric over her limbs and bathe her whole body in elegance as she hadn\u2019t done in weeks.</p><p>She resisted the temptation, reaching for the sprigged muslin instead. That tissue-wrapped dress was her best, and she was not yet sure Gray deserved her best. She was not convinced he even wanted it. Powdered and dressed, her hair neatly coiled and pinned atop her head, Sophia peered into the mirror once again and pinched her cheeks to a high blush before mounting the ladder. The sounds of men arguing had grown louder.</p><p>She pushed open the hatch just a crack. Enough that she could distinguish the violent words being slung about like daggers and peer out at deck level. She recognized Gray\u2019s fine boots immediately, sooty as they were from the fire. He stood close to the rail, at the ship\u2019s stern. The sun was bright this morning; the men cast long shadows across the deck. A gravelly, unfamiliar voice assailed her from somewhere near the ship\u2019s wheel. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you bastard, you\u2019re going to pay for that rum. In gold or goods, I don\u2019t care which.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Mallory.\u201d Gray\u2019s baritone was forbidding. \u201cAnd I apply that title loosely, as you are no manner of captain in my estimation ... I have no intention of compensating you for the loss of your cargo. I will, however, accept your thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thanks? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Now O\u2019Shea entered the mix. \u201cFor saving that heap of a ship and your worthless, rum-soaked arse, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank you to go to hell,\u201d the gravelly voice answered. Mallory, she presumed. \u201cYou can\u2019t just board a man\u2019s craft and pitch a hold full of spirits into the sea. Right knaves, you lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now we\u2019re knaves, are we?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cI should have let that ship explode around your ears, you despicable sot. Knaves, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re such virtuous, charitable gents, then how come I\u2019m trussed like a pig?\u201d Sophia craned her neck and pushed the hatch open a bit further. Across the deck, she saw a pair of split-toed boots tied together with rope.</p><p>Gray answered, \u201cWe had to bind you last night because you were drunk out of your skull. And we\u2019re keeping you bound now because you\u2019re sober and still out of your skull.\u201d</p><p>The lashed boots shuffled across the deck, toward Gray. \u201cLet me loose of these ropes, you blackguard, and I\u2019ll pound you straight out of your skull into oblivion.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Shea responded with a stream of colorful profanity, which Captain Grayson cut short.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Mallory,\u201d he said, his own highly polished boots pacing slowly, deliberately to halt between Mallory\u2019s and Gray\u2019s. \u201cI understand your concern over losing your cargo. But surely you or your investor can recoup the loss with an insurance claim. You could not have sailed without a policy against fire.\u201d</p><p>Gray gave an ironic laugh. \u201cJoss, I\u2019ll wager you anything, that rum wasn\u2019t on any bill of lading or insurance policy. Can\u2019t you see the man\u2019s nothing but a smuggler? Probably wasn\u2019t bound for any port at all. What was your destination, Mallory? A hidden cove off the coast of Cornwall, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>He clucked his tongue. \u201cThat ship was overloaded and undermanned, and it would have been a miracle if you\u2019d made it as far as Portugal. As for the rum, take up your complaint with the Vice Admiralty court after you follow us to Tortola. I\u2019d welcome it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not following you anywhere.\u201d Sophia could hear the scowl in Mallory\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThen what do you intend to do?\u201d Captain Grayson asked. \u201cYour ship is barely seaworthy. You have wounded men in dire need of a physician, and Tortola is the closest port. We could sink the Kestrel, if you prefer, and bring everyone aboard the Aphrodite. But that would mean forfeiting what cargo remains.\u201d</p><p>Someone spat, loudly and wetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not following you anywhere,\u201d Mallory repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not heading in for port, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let you brigands sink my ship. I\u2019m going to repair my vessel and continue on. After I get my compensation, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre ye mad?\u201d O\u2019Shea\u2019s voice rose a half-octave. \u201cYou\u2019d not make the Tropic. You\u2019re one mast and at least four men down. Daft drunkard,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Gray\u2019s voice again. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why the daft drunkard doesn\u2019t want to harbor in Tortola. He knows I\u2019d be entitled to salvage for saving his miserable craft. If he dared bring me into court, I\u2019d walk away with everything. His rum would still be gone, and what\u2019s left of the Kestrel would belong to me. Isn\u2019t that right, Mallory?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Just the light scuffling of bound boots. Sophia advanced one step up the ladder and pushed open the hatch a few inches more.</p><p>\u201cYes, he knows that ship is as good as mine.\u201d Gray\u2019s heavy footfalls underscored each phrase. Nearing Mallory, he continued, \u201cAnd I\u2019m of a mind to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Mallory punctuated his reply with a spit and a curse, both indescribably crude to Sophia\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Joss began, \u201cI\u2019m not certain you can simply\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I assure you, it would be simple. As simple as the sixty-odd other times I\u2019ve commandeered a vessel. What would you have me do, Joss? I didn\u2019t save that worthless bucket of timber just to watch it sink or sail off to its doom. The wounded need a doctor, the Kestrel needs a proper mast. I\u2019m going to take her in to Tortola.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was leaving this ship? Sophia pushed the hatch higher, needing to see more of him. His trousers and shirt hung limp and tattered from his frame. His loose posture was one of exhaustion. But even from her furtive vantage point, she could tell his expression was all seriousness. Her lungs seized. He couldn\u2019t be thinking to leave her again. He hadn\u2019t even dealt with her yet.</p><p>Mallory sneered. \u201cYou miserable, sniveling whoreson.\u201d He spat again, this time in Gray\u2019s face.</p><p>Gray slowly wiped his face on his shredded cuff. The two men glared at each other, the tension between them building, swarming, growing fists. Through the charged silence, Sophia heard the sound of knuckles cracking. Then suddenly, Gray stood down. As he always did, he stole the advantage with a shrug and a lazy smile. If I don\u2019t care about you, that look said, you can\u2019t possibly hurt me.</p> <p>Sophia was growing to hate that look.</p><p>\u201cMallory,\u201d he began on a tone of false conciliation, \u201cby all means, let\u2019s do things the easy way. It would be a shame for this to turn violent.\u201d His voice darkened a shade. \u201cI don\u2019t like violence.\u201d</p><p>He swung around to face Joss. \u201cSend a party of able men to the Kestrel, to start rigging a jury-mast and fitting it with sails. You take the wounded on into port, and we\u2019ll limp behind as best we can. We\u2019ll meet up in Road Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sophia threw open the hatch and stumbled out onto the deck, drowning Mallory\u2019s protest with her own. \u201cGray, you are not leaving me again. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>His face was hard, unreadable as he quickly scanned her appearance.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing on deck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing? What are ...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she noticed the lascivious leer Mallory was dragging up and down her body. Sophia crossed her arms over her chest, disgusted. He was younger than she\u2019d imagined from his voice, and thinner. But no less repulsive.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d he clucked, narrow-set eyes peering at her around a hooked nose. \u201cIf she stays with this ship, I might stop protesting. Can\u2019t say I\u2019d turn down a taste of that tart.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burning, Sophia turned to Gray. To her horror, she watched as his mouth tipped in a smirk. Almost a smile. Curse him, he even chuckled as he strolled back across the deck to face Mallory. Was that how he saw her now, too? As a tart? Just another of his countless paramours? They might as well have been right back in that seedy tavern on the Gravesend quay, when she\u2019d mistaken him for a gentleman\u2014and he\u2019d looked at her and seen only a bit of skirt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Mallory,\u201d he said, striking his habitual pose of arrogant swagger, \u201cI\u2019d like to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor giving me an excuse to do this.\u201d</p><p>Gray swung his fist, putting the full force of his body behind the blow. The punch connected with Mallory\u2019s jaw, sending him reeling against the ship\u2019s rail. Before Sophia could even draw breath, Gray hit him again, this time delivering a solid blow to the stomach. With a choked groan, Mallory doubled over his boots and crumpled to the deck.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t like violence,\u201d Gray forced out, shaking his hand as he stood over Mallory\u2019s writhing form. \u201cBut I\u2019m not above using it.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s knees melted. She clung to the edge of the raised hatch for support. Tears stung her eyes, although she wasn\u2019t at all certain who or what she cried for.</p><p>\u201cPut him in the brig,\u201d Gray said, without diverting his attention from Mallory.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cBrackett\u2019s in the brig. It\u2019s not big enough for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t have this cur aboard the Kestrel. He knows the vessel too well, might find some way to influence the crew.\u201d Gray looked to his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Brackett with me.\u201d</p> <p>Joss nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a few able seamen as well.\u201d He turned to O\u2019Shea.</p><p>The burly Irishman smiled. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re first mate, then,\u201d Gray said. He rubbed the back of his neck as he circled the whimpering figure on the deck. \u201cI\u2019ll need Bailey, for sails and carpentry. And Davy, if you can spare him. Their cook was killed in the blast, so I\u2019ll need someone to manage the stores and pass around biscuit now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d best take a few of the goats, too,\u201d Joss said. \u201cStubb can\u2019t do the milking himself, not with wounded men to tend.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded.</p><p>Sophia choked on a sob. Here he stood readying to leave the ship, making plans to take along sailors and Davy and goats and even that horrid Mr. Brackett ... and ignoring her completely. He hadn\u2019t even cast a glance in her direction since Mallory\u2019s insult.</p><p>She sniffed loudly, wiping away tears with the back of one hand. Fool girl, she chided herself. Hadn\u2019t she vowed just minutes ago that she would not cry?</p><p>\u201cGet below.\u201d The words could only be meant for her, though Gray did not turn his gaze. \u201cPack your things.\u201d</p><p>The captain shot Sophia a worried glance, then addressed his brother in solemn tones. \u201cGray, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. She\u2019d be much safer aboard the Aphrodite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t leave her.\u201d It was hardly a pledge of tenderness or emotion. Resentment hung from his words, making them heavy. Crushing.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Gray repeated. Irony crept over his face, like the shadow of a passing cloud. \u201cI gave my word.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stepped toward him. \u201cGray\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Below.\u201d Cold, demanding eyes finally met hers. \u201cAnd stay there.\u201d</p><p>There was no disobeying that look, nor the blunted steel in his voice. Hands trembling and mind awhirl, Sophia went below.</p><p>And stayed there.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>It was midway through the dogwatch when the cabin door swung open with a rude creak, startling Sophia from her chair. Her stiffened joints protested the abrupt movement, and pain tingled through her limbs. She\u2019d been sitting in that chair for hours.</p><p>\u201cAre your things ready?\u201d Gray asked, by way of greeting. Leaning one shoulder against the doorframe, he looked at the two trunks, packed and fastened shut. Sophia could sense him mentally weighing the baggage. He slumped further, his chest deflating with a slow exhalation. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll have Levi fetch them.\u201d</p><p>Soot and dried blood streaked his face; shadows pooled under his eyes. He still wore the same bedraggled shirt and trousers, with the addition of an incongruently clean and tailored coat. Had it really been only yesterday morning, that he\u2019d asked her permission to remove it? Indeed it had. Will Ishock you, he\u2019d asked, if I remove my coat? The absurdity of such a question now, after all that had passed between them. Drunken laughter bubbled up inside her, but she kept it corked.</p><p>Since that morning, she\u2019d thought up a hundred things to say to him when this moment arrived. She\u2019d narrowed them to a handful of possibilities, depending on his demeanor when he appeared. The cutting retort, the gentle plea, the abject apology and indignant defense ... they all melted like snowflakes on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gray,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must be so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d The word was a ragged sigh, directed at his right boot. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lifted to hers then, his eyes shining with all the vulnerability he was simply too fatigued to mask. She ached to hold him. And from the yearning plainly writ on his face, she could tell he ached to be held. Only pride\u2014and two packed trunks\u2014stood between them.</p><p>He straightened and reached for the smaller of the trunks. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then. It\u2019ll be dark before long.\u201d</p><p>The Kestrel\u2019s jolly boat had been hoisted to the Aphrodite\u2019s rail. It was a small craft, with two plank benches and a single pair of oars, not unlike the tiny rowboat that had conveyed her to the Aphrodite. Once Sophia and her trunks were deposited in the boat, Captain Grayson came by to offer words of farewell. She offered her hand, and he kissed it, making a smooth bow. The gesture surprised her. Sophia thought of him as so reserved and staid, in contrast to Gray. Apparently, the brothers shared a measure of charm, as well as their father\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very kind to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not obliged to go. If you would prefer to remain aboard the Aphrodite, you\u2019ve only to say the word.\u201d</p><p>Gray appeared behind his brother. His look to Sophia sparked with unspoken challenge.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate your concern, but Gray will look after me.\u201d</p><p>The captain smiled. \u201cI\u2019m certain he will. Until Tortola, then.\u201d</p><p>He bowed again and stepped aside so Gray could swing into the boat. The two men brushed shoulders in passing, in what Sophia assumed qualified as an acceptably masculine substitute for an embrace. How grateful she was to be female.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d Sophia asked, as the boat was lowered down to the sea. They sat facing each other on the two planks.</p><p>\u201cAlready aboard the Kestrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the goats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, his voice humorless.</p><p>The boat hit the water\u2019s surface with a splash. A few shouts volleyed between Gray and the men above, and then the boat was loose, drifting quietly with the waves.</p><p>Gray reached for the oars. \u201cWe need to talk. Alone. And we may not have the chance once we\u2019re aboard the Kestrel. I\u2019ll be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll thank you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Captain Mallory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor hitting him, you mean?\u201d He shook his head, looking off toward the horizon. \u201cSave your thanks. I felt like hitting someone. He was convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sophia searched the opposite horizon. Tears welled in her eyes again, much to her frustration.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He pulled hard on the oars. \u201cI never hit people. Look what you\u2019ve done to me. This was supposed to be the voyage I go respectable. Instead, I\u2019m throwing fists, seizing ships, defiling virgins ...\u201d</p><p>Wincing at his harsh tone, Sophia sniffed and shifted sideways on the plank. Abruptly, he dropped the oars and began to wrestle with his coat.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Despite her bruised feelings, she caught the edge of one coat sleeve and held it as his arm slid loose.</p><p>\u201cEasier to row with no coat.\u201d He wriggled free of the other sleeve.</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d She waited for him to meet her eyes. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He folded the coat and handed it to her. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the bundle of wool. \u201cWhat am I to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit on it,\u201d he said, thrusting it toward her. \u201cYou must be ... tender.\u201d His gaze dropped briefly to her lap.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s face burned. She was indeed tender, and the wooden plank was torture beneath her thin skirts, but the presumptive manner of his gesture piqued her pride. She crossed her arms and glared at the proffered coat. \u201cI might have been a virgin, Gray, but I\u2019ve never been a fool. I knew it would hurt, but I wanted it anyway.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cI knew you would hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His face hardened to stone. \u201cDid you now?\u201d He dropped the coat and reached for the oars. \u201cTell me,\u201d he asked on a vigorous pull, \u201cdid you pause to consider those you would hurt?\u201d</p><p>Sophia fell silent. All was silent, save for the oars slicing briskly through the waves. The sun was an orange ember sliding toward the horizon, fizzling through layers of ashy, striated clouds. She inhaled deeply, letting the fresh, salty scent of the ocean fill her lungs\u2014a relief from the brackish odor of bilge.</p><p>She gazed at the man across from her. Her lover. His powerful shoulders worked beneath his shirt as he pulled on the oars. The display of strength and agility, set to a steady rhythm ... memories of their lovemaking assailed her with quiet force. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In some other place, under some other circumstance, they might have been a courting couple. Rowing across a placid lake, caressed by a glowing sunset. From a distance, this could have been the picture of romance.</p><p>But the reality was confusion, and resentment, and pain. Did she feel sorry for misleading him? Sophia considered. She was not sure she could.</p><p>By his own admission, he would not have made love to her had she not. And she could not regret that exquisite pleasure; nor could she regret sharing it with him. She looked at the handsome, strong, charismatic, passionate, exhausted man across from her. Selfish and wicked though she might be, she could not feel sorry that he was now bound to her\u2014that for good or ill, he had not left her behind.</p> <p>Sophia was, however, unequivocally sorry for one thing.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed, and there was a slight hitch in his stroke. \u201cSpare me your apologies. It\u2019s not me I meant to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavy, of course. We\u2019ll be on this ship for a week or more, and that boy\u2019s suffered enough on both our accounts. You\u2019re to let him be, do you understand? No flirting, no sketching. It won\u2019t be easy for him, knowing why you\u2019re aboard.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart lurched. \u201cDavy knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he knows. Everyone knows. There are no secrets on a ship, remember?\u201d He gave her a wary, sidelong glance. \u201cWell, evidently there are some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cWhat more would you have me say?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment. Sophia resisted the impulse to look away. Would he question her in earnest now? Could she find the courage to answer?</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said finally, shaking his head. \u201cI told you, it doesn\u2019t matter. What ever you\u2019ve done, whoever you are ... so long as there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re carrying my child, I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. Of course, the possibility of conceiving had occurred to her\u2014how could it not?\u2014but hearing it spoken aloud was another thing altogether. \u201cSo that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re bringing me along?</p> <p>Because I could be with child?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWhen did you last have your courses?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. No man had ever spoken to her of such things. \u201cJust before we left England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we ought to know soon enough.\u201d The circular motions of the oars slowed, and his gaze burned into hers. \u201cIf you are breeding, I warn you now</p><p>\u2014you will marry me. I\u2019ll not allow you to run off and raise my child God knows where.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. He could not have cut her more deeply had he skewered her with a bayonet. If she was breeding, he would force her to marry him? Because he assumed otherwise she\u2019d \u201crun off\u201d? And if she did not conceive, what then? Did he plan to toss her overboard? Her jaw and hands worked as she tried to match words to her anger. If only she could have painted it instead, with slashes of purple and violent splatters of red-tinged black.</p><p>She finally managed, \u201cI will not be forced into marrying you, or any man. I\u2019ve escaped that fate once before, and I can do it again. I have the means to care for a child, if need be.\u201d She patted the purse strapped beneath her stays. \u201cAnd what does it signify to you, with your prodigious history? You probably have countless bastards, spread across four continents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. My father brought enough bastards into the world, and I\u2019ve never aspired to his example. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always been careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes. Caution and sheepgut, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Until yesterday.\u201d He gave a vicious yank on one oar, turning the boat as they neared the Kestrel. \u201cYesterday was my first time making that mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cHow special that makes me feel. I\u2019m glad to have been your first in some regard, even if only your first mistake.\u201d</p><p>He gave an exasperated sigh. From the Kestrel\u2019s stern, someone tossed down a rope. Gray caught it and began securing it to the boat. \u201cYesterday was a first for me in many ways. I was ... carried away. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t thinking.\u201d Her heart was sinking faster than an anchor. God, could he make this any worse?</p><p>His gaze caught hers and held it. She felt searched, turned inside out. As though he could read some answer in her eyes, if only he looked hard enough. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t thinking, I ...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI suppose I was hoping.\u201d</p><p>Something cinched in her chest, constricting her lungs. She reached out to catch his hand in hers. \u201cWhat about now, Gray? Are you still hoping now?\u201d</p><p>Another rope fell from stern to boat. He reached for it, breaking their contact. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to think of you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sophia drew her knees up and hugged them to her chest, burying her face in her stacked arms.</p><p>He sighed noisily. \u201cSweet.\u201d A light touch fell on her arm. Sniffing back tears, she looked up at him. \u201cDo the hoping for us both, if it makes you feel better. At the moment, I\u2019m just too damned tired.\u201d</p><p>The boat lurched into its ascent, startling a little gasp from her throat. His fingers latched protectively over her wrist. The embrace lasted only a moment, and then he let her go.</p><p>When the boat reached deck level, Sophia helped herself over the rail of the Kestrel. The light thud of her slippers hitting deck announced her presence to the ship at large. O\u2019Shea and the other men turned to her, some offering curt words of greeting or nods. She tilted her head to examine the new jury-mast\u2014a thin pole lashed to the charred, jagged stump of the mainmast. It gave the ship the look of a pruned rosebush, with a slender, green shoot branching out from old growth.</p><p>Davy stood some paces away on the quarterdeck, studiously testing the new mast\u2019s rigging. He did not turn her way.</p><p>\u201cDavy,\u201d Gray called from behind her.</p><p>\u201cAye, Captain.\u201d The youth did not raise his head.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019ve slung your hammock in the steerage compartment.\u201d</p><p>Davy\u2019s glance flicked toward them, and he gave a puzzled, \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to move it to the forecastle at your first opportunity.\u201d Gray rounded Sophia and walked toward the boy. \u201cOn this ship, you\u2019re a sailor. You\u2019ll be expected to do a sailor\u2019s work, and you\u2019ll sleep where the sailors sleep. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Captain.\u201d Davy\u2019s pale cheeks colored. With a quick nod, he went belowdecks. But not before throwing Sophia a wounded glance that drove a spear of pain straight into her heart. This should have been a momentous occasion for him, his promotion to the forecastle; a day of celebration and pride. And because of her, it was ruined. Davy\u2019s wasn\u2019t the first young man\u2019s heart she\u2019d broken. Nor was Gray the first grown man she\u2019d hurt. She\u2019d always been a selfish girl; she had no illusions otherwise. But this was the first time she\u2019d been forced to bear witness to the consequences. She couldn\u2019t run away from this ship as she\u2019d run from her wedding. Neither could she distract herself with thoughts of new ribbons or exhibitions or the Duchess of Aldonbury\u2019s card party Wednesday next. She had a front-row seat for the little tragedy she\u2019d set in motion, and there would be no intermission.</p><p>There was a justice to it, she had to allow.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u201d\u2014Gray laid a hand on the small of her back and steered her down into the captain\u2019s cabin\u2014\u201cwill stay here.\u201d</p><p>Sophia surveyed the cabin. Bed tucked into one corner, cabinets lining the other. In the center, a table and captain\u2019s chair. A thin slice of window spanning the stern. Much the same as the Aphrodite\u2019s, if a bit more cramped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been cleaned and aired for you,\u201d Gray continued, his tone detached.</p><p>\u201cThe linens are fresh, brought over from the Aphrodite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She paced to the center of the cabin and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cThat was thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your trunks brought down. You\u2019re to stay here, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo traipsing about the ship. And you\u2019ll keep this door bolted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I fear for my safety?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBrackett\u2019s confined below; he won\u2019t bother you. The Kestrel\u2019s crew seem pleased with our change of course. But I don\u2019t know these men. And I can\u2019t trust those I don\u2019t know.\u201d He gave her a meaningful look as he turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called after him. He paused in the door. \u201cWhere are you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I sleep, which I imagine will be infrequently, I\u2019ll bed down in the first mate\u2019s berth, just there.\u201d He nodded toward a small door just outside the entrance to her cabin. \u201cBut whether I\u2019m on deck or below it, I\u2019ll never be far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I take that as a promise? Or a threat?\u201d</p><p>She sauntered toward him, hands cocked on her hips in an attitude of provocation. His eyes swept her body, washing her with angry heat. She noted the subtle tensing of his shoulders, the frayed edge of his breath. Even exhausted and hurt, he still wanted her. For a moment, Sophia felt hope flicker to life inside her. Enough for them both.</p><p>And then, with the work of an instant, he quashed it all. Gray stepped back. He gave a loose shrug and a lazy half-smile. If I don\u2019t care about you, his look said, you can\u2019t possibly hurt me. \u201cTake it however you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t. Don\u2019t you try that move with me.\u201d With trembling fingers, she began unbuttoning her gown.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing? You think you can just hike up your shift and make\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get excited.\u201d She stripped the bodice down her arms, then set to work unlacing her stays. \u201cI\u2019m merely settling a score. I can\u2019t stand to be in your debt a moment longer.\u201d Soon she was down to her chemise and plucking coins from the purse tucked between her breasts. One, two, three, four, five ...</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said, casting the sovereigns on the table. \u201cSix pounds, and\u201d</p><p>\u2014she fished out a crown\u2014\u201cten shillings. You owe me the two.\u201d</p><p>He held up open palms. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I have no coin on me. You\u2019ll have to trust me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust you for anything. Not even two shillings.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her for a moment, then turned on his heel and exited the cabin, banging the door shut behind him. Sophia stared at it, wondering whether she dared stomp after him with her bodice hanging loose around her hips. Before she could act on the obvious affirmative, he stormed back in.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d A pair of coins clattered to the table. \u201cTwo shillings. And\u201d\u2014he drew his other hand from behind his back\u2014\u201cyour two leaves of paper. I don</p><p>\u2019t want to be in your debt, either.\u201d The ivory sheets fluttered as he released them. One drifted to the floor.</p><p>Sophia tugged a banknote from her bosom and threw it on the growing pile. To her annoyance, it made no noise and had correspondingly little dramatic value. In compensation, she raised her voice. \u201cBuy yourself some new boots. Damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re settling scores, you owe me twenty-odd nights of undisturbed sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWe\u2019re even on that regard.\u201d She paused, glaring a hole in his forehead, debating just how hateful she would make this.</p><p>Very.</p><p>\u201cYou took my innocence,\u201d she said coldly\u2014and completely unfairly, because they both knew she\u2019d given it freely enough.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019d like my jaded sensibilities restored, but there\u2019s no use wishing after rainbows, now is there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had a point there. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re squared away then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I owe you?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were ice. \u201cNot a thing.\u201d</p><p>But there is, she wanted to shout. I still owe you the truth, if only you\u2019dcare enough to ask for it. If only you cared enough for me, to want toknow.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.

A lace-trimmed handkerchief, embroidered with a neat S.H.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Gray left the cabin and went to work. He worked for days. He worked until he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t feel. His life became flips of the hourglass, clangs of the bell\u2014increments of time too brief to allow anxiety for the future or regrets about the past. It was simply, always now. He concentrated on the task of each moment: the sail that wanted reefing, the brace gone slack. Getting the Kestrel from the crest of one wave to the next.</p><p>All the while, a deep, insidious current pulled on his heart. Resentment, confusion, fear. Uncertainty, in all its most sinister forms. By sheer force of will, he kept it at bay. A mere hint of uncertainty was all it required to taint authority in irrevocable fashion.</p><p>But for all his intensity of purpose, a mere moment in her presence was all it required to scatter his wits completely\u2014he feared, in irrevocable fashion. In the clang of a bell, Gray was undone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The words fired from his mouth, like a salvo of rifle shots. She flinched with each one. But great God, he felt under attack.</p><p>What the devil was she doing in the galley? The galley was not where she ought to be. She ought to be in the captain\u2019s cabin, where she\u2019d remained squirreled away for the past three days. Where he didn\u2019t have to look at this exquisite face, breathe this intoxicating fragrance, suffer these small earthquakes in his chest that left him reeling in his boots whenever she drew near.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serving dinner.\u201d She held out a deep wooden plate ladled with steaming chowder. \u201cAre you always this late to mess?\u201d</p><p>Gray stared at the plate. Then he stared at her. Which was a mistake. Because he was starving, and she looked ... delicious.</p><p>The galley was steamy and hot, as galleys tend to be. A high flush painted her cheeks and throat. Loose wisps of hair frizzled to tight curls at her hairline. Tiny beads of perspiration glittered on her d\u00e9colletage, where her breasts pressed up like twin mounds of risen dough. Her skin glowed, and her eyes ... God, her eyes positively sparkled. Plump lips curved in a self-satisfied, feline smile.</p><p>She had the look, the air\u2014even the scent\u2014of a recently-bedded, thoroughly-pleasured woman. And Gray\u2019s senses were under siege. All the desire that he\u2019d been forcing down for the past three days tore free. It raced hot through his veins, swelled in his groin.</p><p>He resented it, resented this power she had over him. This was why she needed to stay where he\u2019d put her, out of sight.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he growled again. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping,\u201d she bit out, her smile fading to a tight line. Her eyes dulled in the space of a blink, and she slung the plate onto the table. Gray slouched against the door and massaged his temples with one hand. Damn it, he was always the one to erase that smile from her face, douse that sparkle in her eyes. But he needed her to stay in that cabin. He could not look on her, be near her, think of her, and keep the Kestrel afloat at the same time. No red-blooded man could.</p><p>\u201cGo back to your cabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019ll go mad if I spend another day in that cabin, with no one to talk to and nothing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry we\u2019re not entertaining you sufficiently, but this isn\u2019t a pleasure cruise. Find some other way to amuse yourself. Can\u2019t you find something to occupy your mind?\u201d He made an open-handed sweep through the steam. \u201cRead a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only got one book. I\u2019ve already read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the Bible.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He averted his gaze to the ceiling, blowing out an impatient breath. \u201cOnly one book,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat sort of lady makes an ocean crossing with only one book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a governess.\u201d Her voice held a challenge.</p><p>Gray refused the bait, electing for silence. Silence was all he could manage, with this anger slicing through him. It hurt. He kept his eyes trained on a cracked board above her head, working to keep his expression blank. What a fool he\u2019d been, to believe her. To believe that something essential in him had changed, that he could find more than fleeting pleasure with a woman. That this perfect, delicate blossom of a lady, who knew all his deeds and misdeeds, would offer herself to him without hesitation. Deep inside, in some uncharted territory of his soul, he\u2019d built a world on that moment when she came to him willingly, trustingly. Giving not just her body, but her heart.</p><p>Ha. She hadn\u2019t even given him her name.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever planning to talk to me?\u201d she asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you have questions you want to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one. Have you had your courses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ve nothing further to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said meaningfully.</p><p>In truth, Gray wasn\u2019t certain how many answers he wanted, whether she carried his child or no. He knew he preferred silence to lies. It didn\u2019t matter one whit to him who she was, or what she\u2019d done. Whether or not she\u2019d taken lovers before, whether she had six shillings or six thousand pounds. It mattered that she\u2019d lied. That even with her arms around him, her lips pressed to his mouth, her tight, virgin body yielding to his\u2014she had always been holding something back.</p><p>In those dark, solitary watches over the past three nights, it had driven him quietly mad, wondering just how much of her he\u2019d ever seen, ever held. He\u2019d opened himself to her completely, and she\u2019d been lying to him since the moment they\u2019d met. In all those days aboard the Aphrodite, was a single one of her smiles ever truly for him? What fraction of her heart had she revealed to him, in all their conversations? When he\u2019d held her, caressed her, entered her\u2014had he finally reached some layer of her being where the lies ended and the real woman began?</p><p>Gray didn\u2019t even want to ask. Because he already knew the only answer that mattered. How much of her was his? Less than all. And therefore, not enough.</p><p>\u201cSketching.\u201d He croaked the word. Clearing his throat, he continued, \u201cGo to your cabin and draw, or paint. It kept you busy enough before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, no more paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more inspiration. I ... I\u2019ve lost my heart for it, I think.\u201d With a shrug, she turned back to the stove and began stirring lazy figure eights in a bubbling pot. \u201cGray, be angry with me if you must. You\u2019ve a right to be hurt.</p><p>Call me vile names, think all the vengeful thoughts you wish. But you must allow me to do this. I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d She ceased stirring and leveled the ladle at him, wielding it like a sword. \u201cYou\u2019ve eight men on this ship, performing the work of a dozen. I hear everything from that cabin. Do you think I don\u2019t know how hard you\u2019re working? That you\u2019re only resting every third watch, and sometimes not even that?\u201d</p><p>Her voice lost its sharp edge, and she flung the ladle aside before wiping her brow with the back of her wrist. \u201cIf I run the galley, it frees Davy to stand a watch. If Davy\u2019s able to stand watch, you can get more rest.\u201d</p><p>Gray stared at her. He slowly shook his head. \u201cSweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Her voice tweaked. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that when you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I to call you, then? Miss \u2018Turner\u2019? Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to call me Cook.\u201d With an impatient gust of breath, she blew a wisp of hair from her face. \u201cIf I knew how to reef a sail or splice a line, you\u2019d be chasing me down from the rigging right now. I can\u2019t do a sailor\u2019s work, but I can do this. I\u2019ve spent every morning with Gabriel since the Aphrodite left England, and I know how to pound a piece of salt pork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t allow you to do this sort of menial labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to sit idly by and read or sketch in that cabin while you\u2019re working yourself to bones.\u201d She grabbed a smaller spoon from a hook on the wall and thrust it at him, handle-first. \u201cI made you food, and you\u2019re going to eat it.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the spoon. It was that, or accept a spoon to the skull. She kicked a stool toward him. \u201cNow sit down.\u201d</p><p>Gray gave in. He did need rest, and having Davy on deck would be a boon. And, his stomach reminded him loudly, he\u2019d scarcely tasted more than a biscuit in days. He\u2019d avoided her since they boarded this ship, but she\u2019d sensed these things somehow\u2014his fatigue, his hunger. She\u2019d sensed something else as well. He\u2019d been giving orders for three solid days, and he needed a bit of ordering around. Given a choice between eating and working, his duty as captain demanded that work take priority. She left him no choice, so he sat and ate.</p><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t let her get away with it so easily. \u201cIf you\u2019re the cook,\u201d he said between mouthfuls, \u201cI\u2019m your captain. You can\u2019t continue speaking to me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t dressed like a captain.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked down at his homespun tunic and the loose-fitting trousers cinched with a knotted cord. The clothes of a common seaman, borrowed from a sailor now dead. He hadn\u2019t the luxury of fine attire on the Kestrel. With the ship so undermanned, he had to be everywhere\u2014climbing the rigging, down in the hold.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look apologetic. They suit you.\u201d Her gaze glanced off his shoulders, then dropped to the floor. \u201cBut I see you\u2019ve kept the detested boots.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, spooning up another bite of chowder. \u201cI\u2019ve broken them in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I hoped you were keeping them for sentimental reasons.\u201d</p><p>She set a tankard of grog before him, the moment before he became aware of his own thirst. Gray reached for it, shaking his head. A long swallow of watered-down rum added fuel to his resentment. He\u2019d allowed himself to become so transparent to her, while she remained an enigma to him. Her talents fit no logical pattern\u2014sketching, painting, deceit, seduction, thievery ... now the ability to pound biscuit and salted meat into a fair-tasting chowder? It was enough to make him abandon all hope of ever comprehending her.</p><p>Perhaps he never would. But it was another thought that had him hurrying through his food, desperate to put some distance between them. He might never understand her, Gray realized, but he could get dangerously accustomed to this other feeling.</p><p>Being understood.</p><p>\u201cJust hold her steady, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t lean too close, she might kick. Now firmly grasp her ... her ...\u201d</p><p>Sophia was beginning to doubt the brilliance of this enterprise she\u2019d suggested. She cleared her throat and affected a brisk, business-like tone.</p><p>\u201cHer teat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, yes.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, there was a brown-and-white nanny goat blocking her view of Davy\u2019s face, but she could hear the fierce blush in his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake her teat,\u201d he said haltingly. \u201cLike so.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to view the goat\u2019s underside, where Davy\u2019s thumb and forefinger curled around one knobby teat. Cautiously, she reached out to follow suit on her side. At the first brush of her fingers against the milk-swelled udder, the animal gave an annoyed shiver. Sophia snatched her hand back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her frighten you, Miss Turner. You can\u2019t be timid with a goat.\u201d</p> <p>A nervous giggle escaped her. \u201cOh, I assure you, I can. I haven\u2019t your bravery, Mr. Linnet.\u201d</p><p>Her remark fell into the silence like a lead weight. Davy made no answer. Drat. Sophia chastised herself with a sharp tug on her apron. That was badly done of her. It was awkward enough that she\u2019d asked him for milking lessons; to engage him in flirtation was unspeakably insensitive. Still, she needed to learn how to do this. Every hour Davy spent at milking was an hour he couldn\u2019t be standing watch.</p><p>Emboldened by the desire to complete this lesson quickly, she reached out in a flash, capturing the goat\u2019s second teat with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cLike so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss. And now you roll your fingers down, one by one ...\u201d He demonstrated, and a jet of milk hit the tin pail with a sharp trill. Sophia imitated his movements. Nothing happened. She tried again, earning only an impatient shuffle of the goat\u2019s hind legs.</p><p>\u201cTry again, a bit faster this time.\u201d</p> <p>She tried again, pulling harder. Nothing. The goat bleated, in seeming irritation at her ineptitude.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wring it, now. You want to coax the milk out, one finger at a time, see?\u201d He sent a few more squirts of milk pinging into the pail. Taking a deep breath, Sophia began again, painstakingly imitating the rolling pull of Davy\u2019s hand. When a thin stream of white shot from the teat, she could not suppress a small cry of elation. In truth, if she hadn\u2019t feared it would startle the nanny dry, she would have done a little dance. She tried again, with greater confidence. Another spurt of milk came forth.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Davy said, after she\u2019d removed enough yellowish milk from the goat to cover the bottom of the pail. \u201cYou\u2019ve the way of it now.\u201d He continued milking the other teat, and they settled into a quiet, contrapuntal rhythm.</p><p>\u201cDid you do this often at home, then?\u201d She hoped conversation would feel less stifling than silence.</p><p>\u201cOften enough. Every day, when I was a boy.\u201d</p><p>Sophia smiled to herself. No, she supposed he wasn\u2019t a boy any longer.</p> <p>\u201cWho tends them now that you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sisters, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSisters? Are they older or younger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the middle. The eldest, she got herself married already. By the time I see her again, she\u2019ll have a brat of her own, I reckon.\u201d His voice deepened in pitch, as though the prospect displeased him.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you like to be an uncle? Just think of the exotic tales and trinkets you\u2019ll bring home. You\u2019ll be a returning hero. The children will swarm around you like bees.\u201d She imbued her voice with a coy lilt. \u201cAll the girls will be mad for you.\u201d</p><p>He fell quiet again. Frustrated with herself, Sophia gave a harsh yank on the goat\u2019s teat and narrowly missed a swift kick to the thigh. It would seem she\u2019d lost the ability to converse rather than flirt, if she\u2019d ever developed that talent at all. What was her reasoning, precisely? That a man couldn\u2019t possibly hold himself in high esteem without the benefit of her flattery? Or that he\u2019d see no reason to esteem her without it?</p><p>Davy finally said, \u201cSo long as I come home with my wages, I don\u2019t expect they\u2019ll turn me away.\u201d</p><p>She let the soft splashes of milk fill the silence. At length, she asked cautiously, \u201cAren\u2019t you happy for her, your sister who married?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it matters, how I feel about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s your sister. She matters to you.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled on the teat. \u201cThe man she married, he\u2019s too old for her. My father\u2019s the one that arranged it. I think ...\u201d He squeezed out another jet of milk. \u201cI think my father was in the man\u2019s debt, more than he could pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Her dismay must have been evident. Davy\u2019s voice grew robust with defense. \u201cShe weren\u2019t forced into it, mind. She didn\u2019t marry him against her will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not. Just against her heart. I do understand. It\u2019s the way of things for women, sometimes.\u201d After all, it had nearly been the way of things for her. \u201cYou don\u2019t suspect he\u2019ll mistreat her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll treat her fair enough, I reckon. My father wouldn\u2019t have let her go, otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s some comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He shook a few last drops from the goat\u2019s teat, then released it completely. \u201cJust the same, I didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like to see her married to a man she didn\u2019t choose.\u201d</p><p>Sophia continued milking on her side, settling into a hypnotic rhythm. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. She\u2019s your sister. If you care for her, you want to see her well cared for. If you love her, you want to see her loved.\u201d If only she\u2019d been so fortunate, to have a brother to want the same for her.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His voice cracked slightly on the word, and he paused. It must have been a full minute before he spoke again. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, the captain.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stilled. \u201cThe captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray. He\u2019s a good man, Miss Turner. He\u2019ll do right by you.\u201d</p><p>Sweet Heavens, the boy was giving her his blessing. Sophia didn\u2019t know what to say. It would probably wound his pride, to call him the loving brother she\u2019d never had. Certainly, she couldn\u2019t tell him the truth of how matters stood between her and Gray. She didn\u2019t want to deplete the boy\u2019s faith in his captain\u2019s honorable intentions. To the contrary, she dearly wished to borrow it.</p><p>Sniffing, she let go of the goat\u2019s teat and brushed her hand on her skirts.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d He reached under the goat and gave the udder a brisk rub. Then he took the teat closest to Sophia and gave it a twist. A fresh stream of milk shot forth, glancing off the rim of the bucket and splashing her slippers.</p><p>\u201cTake care!\u201d With a little shriek of laughter, she pushed away from the goat\u2019s side. Davy tilted his hand and squeezed the teat again, this time splattering Sophia from crown to chest. Sputtering and wiping milk from her face, she scrambled to her feet. \u201cDavy Linnet,\u201d she scolded, towering over both youth and goat. \u201cYou\u2019re a rascal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d He flashed her a lopsided, innocent grin. Shrugging, he dropped his gaze and emptied the last drops of milk into the pail. \u201cWell, you\u2019re blushing.\u201d</p><p>Sophia made a show of huffing and crossing her arms, but she could not keep the laughter out of her voice. \u201cNever say you\u2019ve learned nothing from me, Davy. You might have shown me how to milk, but I\u2019ve taught you to flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fair bargain, then.\u201d He stood and took the goat by its collar.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. Mind you don\u2019t confuse the two talents. Keep your goats straight from your girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easily done.\u201d Mischief twinkled sharp in his eye. \u201cThe goats don\u2019t blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Gray scowled at the ink spattering his trousers and pooling atop the toe of his boot. This was why captains had cabins. It was nigh on impossible to keep a proper log in the first-mate\u2019s berth, with only the most meager of lighting and this paltry writing surface jutting out from the wall, too narrow to accommodate both logbook and inkwell. And, he concluded as he frowned at the now-emptied latter, it was definitely impossible to keep a log without the benefit of ink.</p><p>He threw open the door of his berth and entered the captain\u2019s cabin, knowing it to be unoccupied. At this hour, she would be preparing dinner in the galley. Flinging the logbook and quill down on the table, he moved to search the built-in drawers for a fresh bottle of ink. He found none.</p><p>\u201cBlast.\u201d</p><p>His eye fell on her trunks, stacked neatly in the corner. Surely she had a supply of ink, and quality ink at that. Without sparing a moment to second-guess the decision, he strode to her trunks and worked open the latches of the smaller trunk. He flipped it open.</p><p>It felt intimate, revealing. As if he\u2019d unlaced her stays. And what treasures awaited him. Sheaves of paper, neatly wrapped in oilcloth and tied with efficient knots\u2014knots that would do a sailor proud. Small bundles of brushes, smelling faintly of turpentine. And rows upon rows of her little bottles of ink and cakes of pigment. Of course, for Gray, the array of colors did not particularly impress. Rather, it was the care and precision with which they were packed that caused a sharp pinch in his chest. In this trunk was everything of delicacy, beauty, and painstaking care. Everything he admired in her, laid open for his examination, with no veneer of lies to obscure his view.</p><p>He looked his fill. He touched each item in the trunk, skipping his fingers from one object to the next. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to lift one out. Until a small, leather-bound book wedged along one side caught his attention. Hooking a fingertip under the spine, he eased the volume up, and a title greeted him: The Memoirs of a Wanton Dairymaid. His shout of laughter rattled the bottles in their straw-buffered rows. So this was the one book she\u2019d selected for the journey? A ribald novel?</p><p>Gray tipped the book into his hand. The binding was strained and the pages swollen\u2014as though the entire volume had been dipped in water and dried. The cover fell open to reveal an elaborate frontispiece, depicting a buxom dairymaid wearing a straw bonnet, voluminous petticoats, and a knowing smile. On riffling the pages, it immediately became clear that the book\u2019s expanded bulk could be credited to the addition of numerous pen-and-ink illustrations.</p><p>He recognized her deft hand and eye for detail immediately. He flipped through the pages, past vignettes of the dairymaid and her vague-featured gentleman engaged in a courtship of sorts: a kiss on the hand, a whisper in the ear. By the book\u2019s midpoint, the chit\u2019s voluminous petticoats were up around her ears, and the illustrations comprised a sequence of quite similar poses in varying locales. Not just the dairy, but a carriage, the larder, in a hayloft lit with candles and strewn with ... were those rose petals?</p><p>I\u2019ll be damned.</p><p>Gray was fast divining the true source of the French painting master\u2019s mythic exploits. More unsettling by far, however, as he perused the book, he noted a subtle alteration in the gentleman lover\u2019s features. With each successive illustration, the hero appeared taller, broader in the shoulders, and his hair went from a cropped style to collar length in the space of two pages.</p><p>The more pages Gray turned, the more he recognized himself. It was unmistakable. She\u2019d used him as the model for these bawdy illustrations. She\u2019d sketched him in secret; not once, but many times. And here he\u2019d nearly gone mad with envy over each scrap of foolscap she\u2019d inked for one crewman or another. His emotions underwent a dizzying progression\u2014from surprised, to flattered, to (with the benefit of one especially inventive situation in an orchard) undeniably aroused. But as he lingered over a nude study of this amalgam of the real him and some picaresque fantasy, he began to feel something else entirely. He felt used.</p><p>She\u2019d rendered his form with astonishing accuracy, given that it must have been drawn before she\u2019d any opportunity to actually see him unclothed. Not that she\u2019d achieved an exact likeness. Her virgin\u2019s imagination was rather generous in certain aspects and somewhat stinting in others, he noted with a bitter sort of amusement. But she\u2019d laid him bare in these pages, without his knowledge or consent. God, she\u2019d even drawn his scars. All in service of some adolescent erotic fantasy. And now he began to grow angry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had been handling the leaves of the book with his fingertips only, anxious he might smudge or rip the pages. Now he abandoned all caution and flipped roughly through the remainder of the volume. Until he came to the end, and his hand froze.</p><p>There they were, the two of them. He and she, fully clothed and unengaged in any physical intimacies\u2014yet intimate, in a way he had never known. Never dreamed. Sitting beneath a willow tree, his head in her lap. One of her hands lay twined with his, atop his chest. The other rested on his brow. The sky soared vast and expansive above, gauzy clouds spinning into forever.</p><p>The hot fist of desire that had gripped his loins loosened, moved upward through his torso, churning the contents of his gut along the way. Then it clutched at his heart and squeezed until it hurt. Somehow, this illustration was the most dismaying of all. So na\u00efve, so ridiculous. At least the bawdy situations were plausible, if sometimes physically improbable. This was utterly impossible. To her, he\u2019d never been more than a fantasy. It occurred to Gray that more secrets might be packed within these trunks. If he sorted through her belongings, he might find the answers to all his questions. Perhaps answers to questions he\u2019d never thought to ask. In spite of this, he let the lid of the trunk clap shut and fastened the strap with shaking fingers. He\u2019d suffered as many of her fantasies as he could bear for one day.</p> <p>It was time to acquaint her with reality.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Reality was hitting Sophia hard. Or rather, kicking her hard, and leaving bruises the size and shape of a goat\u2019s cloven hoof. Reality was making her ache all over, in muscles she hadn\u2019t known she possessed. Her first day as ship\u2019s cook had been novel, amusing. She\u2019d experienced the thrill of competency and earning her own keep. Each fire built, each potato peeled, each squirt of milk into the pail was a small triumph. Just a few days later, she was fully prepared to admit defeat. Manual labor was not romantic in the least, and only dimly satisfying, in the way chewing rock-hard ship\u2019s biscuit satisfied one\u2019s hunger\u2014begrudgingly, and at considerable expense of effort.</p><p>Once she assumed control of her inheritance, she intended to never boil water or tend a goat again. With a bit of prudence, her trust ought to keep her in servants for the remainder of her days. For the remainder of this voyage, however, she would toil or go hungry. And if there was one thing Sophia suspected would suit her less than a life of menial servitude, it was hunger.</p><p>The work suited Gray, though. He\u2019d slipped into the role of Kestrel\u2019s captain faster than he\u2019d filled out a borrowed tunic and trousers. Authority was simply comfortable to him, like a second skin.</p> <p>Despite all that had passed between them, despite his anger and hurt\u2014at some deeper stratum of his being, he was more content than she\u2019d ever seen him. He was pleased to be in command, to be on deck working rather than sitting idly below, and Sophia was pleased to see him where he belonged, living as he was meant to live.</p><p>Because she loved him, so much it hurt. She wanted him to be happy, whether or not that meant being with her. And if she never laid eyes on him again after they dropped anchor, she would carry this picture of him forever: Gray prowling the deck of the Kestrel, all confidence and energy and charisma, coordinating the movement of the sails and rigging as instinctively as he manipulated the fingers on his hand. As for herself, the current picture was one she would endeavor to forget.</p><p>Toting a pail of hard-earned milk, she shouldered open the door to the storeroom to gather biscuit and salt-beef for the evening meal. Weak light spilled into the barrel-crammed space. She stomped hard on the floorboards: once, twice, three times. Then she counted ten and tried to ignore the sounds of rats scattering into the shadows. Heavens, if her mother could see her now. There weren\u2019t enough restoratives in Bath and Brighton combined to counteract the attack of nerves this scene would doubtless inspire.</p><p>When the sounds of scratching faded, she entered the storeroom and turned to rest the milk pail on a waist-high crate.</p><p>A hand clapped on her shoulder.</p><p>Milk sloshed over the side of the pail, dousing her hand and splattering her skirts. A startled cry whooshed out of her as an arm whipped around her waist. Her back collided with a wall of heat and muscle.</p> <p>\u201cIs this what you wanted?\u201d The rough whisper warmed her ear.</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d She nearly fainted with relief. He held her tight against him with one arm, his other hand skimming over the curve of her hip. \u201cGray, what on earth are you doing? You made me spill the milk, drat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go to waste.\u201d Resting his chin on her shoulder, he untangled her fingers from the pail\u2019s handle. Bending her arm at the elbow, he lifted her fingers to his mouth, sucking them clean one by one. His tongue traced each finger and the delicate webs between them, sending gooseflesh rippling down the backs of her legs.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d His fingers interlaced with hers, squeezing them until they hurt. \u201cYour dream lover, lurking in the shadows of the stables, the larder ... the storeroom? Lying in wait for his wanton dairymaid?\u201d</p><p>Sophia froze. Dear God, he\u2019d seen The Book. He nipped at the curve of her neck, and she gasped. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cYou had no right to look through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to put me in it.\u201d She could hear the raw edge of anger in his voice. His fingers still gripping hers, he pressed her own hand to her breast. \u201cBut let\u2019s not dwell on rights, sweet. Not when wrongs are so much more interesting.\u201d</p><p>His hand flexed, digging her own fingers into the flesh of her breast. She felt the soft globe heating in her palm, the nipple firming to a tight knot.</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d She tried for a reproving tone, squirming in his vise-like grip. His arm tightened about her waist, pulling her backside flush with his hips. The hard ridge of his arousal pulsed against the small of her back, hot and demanding. Her feeble attempts at resistance melted. Hadn\u2019t she been waiting days for just this? Longing for him to reach for her, take her in his arms? Yearning for the feeling of his strength surrounding her once more?</p> <p>Gentle or bruising\u2014the precise manner of the gesture mattered little. What mattered was him. His warmth ... his touch ... his mouth ...</p><p>\u201cDid you think of me, as you lay in your bunk at night?\u201d His hand kept kneading her fingers around her breast, chafing her palm against the aching peak. \u201cDid you imagine these coarse hands pawing your body?\u201d He dragged her hand to her other breast, groping impatiently. His lips traced the ridge of her ear, drew on the sensitive lobe with hot, wet suction. The nape of her neck prickled with excitement. Arousal washed through her, sweeping over the surface of her body and rushing together at the apex of her thighs. She closed her eyes and saw red waves of sensation pulse through her with each flick of his tongue against her ear. Then his teeth closed down hard in a sharp burst of yellow. She gave a little cry, half pleasure and half pain.</p><p>\u201cDid you ache for me here?\u201d He pulled her hand down, thrusting it between her legs. Through the layers of shift and skirt, he ground her palm against her mound. She rocked against it, moaning a little. \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d His index finger pressed hers into the soft folds of her sex. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d Another nip at her ear punctuated the question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her breath dragged in and out of her, the air tasting dark and musky.</p><p>\u201cDid you imagine me coming to you, in that berth at night? As you went about your day? Bending you over some obliging surface and hiking your skirts to your waist?\u201d He untangled her hand from her skirts and pinned it to the crate before her, holding it immobile with the weight of his own. The splintery wood bit into her palm. He released her waist, and with his other hand he grasped a fold of her skirts, expertly drawing them up and up. She hadn\u2019t worn stockings or drawers since they entered the tropics, and the brush of fabric against the bare hollows of her knees sent pleasure shivering through her.</p><p>Leaning forward, he bent her at the waist and parted her legs with his thigh. Cool air licked over her inner thighs as he worked his trousers loose, and then his hard length sprang up to wedge snugly in her cleft. He rocked forward, rubbing slowly along the moist, swollen folds of her sex, drawing out the contact in one sweet, torturous, endless caress. She cried out with relief when the tip of him finally grazed that most sensitive bit of her flesh. With his free hand, he swept her skirts up and away from her legs.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he demanded, nudging her forward so her chin bent to her chest.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>She obeyed, looking down to where the ruddy, swollen head of his arousal peeked out from her thatch of tight curls. The sight of their bodies locked together excited her beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you wanted, isn\u2019t it? To look at it, touch it, feel it grinding against you. To satisfy all those schoolgirl curiosities about a man\u2019s body and how it fits with yours. To live out all the depraved little fantasies in that book of yours. This is what you\u2019ve wanted all along, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He pulled back, dragging his hard shaft through her softness until Sophia shuddered with pleasure. He thrust forward again. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped softly. Then louder, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Something like a groan escaped him. \u201cWell,\u201d he breathed against her ear,</p><p>\u201cI happen to have a few depraved fantasies of my own.\u201d</p><p>The words hummed in her ear, sending electric jolts of arousal straight to her core. She whispered, \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s heart thumped wildly in his chest, each beat matched by a pulse in his groin. Damn, but she was so hot, so wet. He dragged against her again, the friction of their bodies producing a liquid sound that was unspeakably erotic.</p><p>He\u2019d meant to stop this here. Or, truthfully, a little ways back. He intended to make her admit that all she\u2019d wanted from him was pleasure, a chance to explore her wanton fantasies. And then he\u2019d planned to walk away, to tell her to find some other man to deceive and discard.</p><p>But he\u2019d forgotten how she felt so good. How she felt so right.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she repeated, her voice husky. When he still hesitated, she added, \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>And he found refusal was no longer within his power. This was what she wanted, he told himself. She wanted to explore passion and pleasure. Why should he deny her, deny himself?</p><p>He released her hand where it lay splayed on the crate. She remained in place, leaning forward at the waist. He settled both hands on her hips, lifting her up and firmly against him, and then he slid his hands up her ribcage, counting one slender rib for every narrow stripe of that damned button-less, hook-less, lacing-free, impenetrable muslin frock.</p><p>\u201cMy fantasies,\u201d he said hoarsely, hooking his index fingers under the neckline at the midpoint of her back, \u201cstart here.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the fabric and rent it to her waist in one swift motion. The striped muslin fell away, revealing her stays and a gauzy chemise beneath. He had her laces undone in the space of a breath. Ripping the chemise was the work of an instant, and then her back was exposed to him, elegant planes and graceful ridges and smooth, creamy skin. He ran his fingers over that silky expanse, watching her flesh quiver beneath his touch.</p><p>\u201cAnd they continue here,\u201d he said, sliding his hands beneath the torn edges of the frock and around her ribcage. Easing her loosened stays aside, he took her bared breasts into his hands. Her breath was a sharp hiss as the soft, warm mounds filled his palms. He groped hungrily, thumbing her hard nipples as he nuzzled the curve of her neck. She worked back and forth against him, stroking her moist, inviting heat over his aching erection. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>He pinched her nipples, rolling them between his thumbs and forefingers. She shivered as he swept his tongue over her neck and down between her shoulder blades. Oh, she tasted so good, both salty and sweet. \u201cThen you moan my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d The word was a throaty plea. His loins answered with a throb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou tell me you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, and no other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly you, Gray, only you.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands from her breasts to her hips and lifted, positioning himself at her entrance. \u201cYou tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped himself, struck by the idiocy of what he\u2019d nearly said: You tellme you love me. What a damn fool thought to entertain. This wasn\u2019t love to her, it was just fantasy and lewd imaginings. A chance to satisfy her youthful lust and curiosity. He\u2019d been twenty once. He remembered what it was to chase pleasure, and he certainly hadn\u2019t confused it with love. He\u2019d never contemplated love at all.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>She rocked backward, taking him into her. Beautiful, searing bliss enveloped him. She was all sweetness and heat and molten sighs, gripping him so tightly he could almost believe, for this moment, that she would never let him go.</p> <p>He clutched at her hips, pulling her closer until they were fully joined. God,</p><p>he was losing himself inside her, and it was too late to pull away. There was nothing he could do. Nothing but take the pleasure she offered and give it in return, and make this so damn good that so long as she lived, no matter how far she went from him, she would never, ever forget. He took her in smooth, powerful strokes that had no end and no beginning, but built on one another\u2014surely, steadily, relentlessly. He reached one hand around to cup her sex, part her gently, and strum the sensitive bud hidden there.</p><p>She moaned. She keened. She arched into his thrusts and took him deeper. And finally he felt the little flutters in her thighs and intimate muscles that told him her peak was near. He raced toward it with her, his cries joining hers as the pleasure consumed them both.</p><p>And then he simply held her, for as long as he dared.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he finally said, withdrawing from her body. \u201cYou got what you wanted, then.\u201d A bitter edge tainted the lingering tremors of pleasure singing through him. \u201cWe both did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we?\u201d She pivoted to face him, and he choked on his breath. How dangerous her beauty was. He thought it might be the death of him. She smoothed the hair off his brow, and he winced at the tenderness in her touch.</p> <p>\u201cGray, if you found my book, surely you must know that this kind of ...</p><p>encounter ... is not all I want. I want so much more. And I want it with you.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, and that picture of the two of them lounging under a willow tree appeared behind his eyelids. He shook his head to dispel it.</p><p>\u201cYou want some fantasy, spun from a girl\u2019s imagination. You want a dream that can never come true.\u201d</p><p>The flush of her cheeks faded as she searched his face. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. That dream can never come true, if you don\u2019t share it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough about my dreams.\u201d She put a finger to his lips, then trailed the touch down his jaw. \u201cWhat is it that you really want, Gray?\u201d</p><p>He seized her shoulders. \u201cI want no more lies. No more wild tales and secret fantasies. I want you to tell me everything. Who you are, where you came from, where you\u2019re going. Everything.\u201d</p> <p>Something softened in those clear, lovely eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for deceiving you, for hurting you. But I was desperate, don\u2019t you understand?</p><p>You were pushing me away, and I cared for you so much. And that was nothing, compared to what I feel for you now.\u201d She pressed her hand to his face. \u201cGray, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this. I want the truth, not excuses.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, withdrawing her touch. \u201cNow there is a falsehood. No one ever wants the truth from me. They just want the pretty package it comes in. If you really wanted to hear the truth, you\u2019d listen. My feelings for you, they\u2019re as true a part of me as my name, or my place of birth. But you never want to hear them. You just keep running away.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, uncertain what to say.</p><p>\u201cAnd of all the people to accuse me of dishonesty\u2014the man who told me I was worth nothing to him but six pounds, eight shillings? The man who ordered me to go to my berth and thank Almighty God he didn\u2019t want me?</p><p>You have no idea how your lies hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cSweet, if I could only take back those words\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. You have to live with them now, just as I do.\u201d Arms twisted behind her back, she adjusted and relaced her stays.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d she asked, cocking her head and narrowing her eyes. \u201cNever mind the lies\u2014you were happy to be my first. I think you were damn near overjoyed to discover I was a virgin. I doubt you ever truly believed otherwise. It was only when you found the money that everything soured.\u201d She jabbed a finger in his chest. \u201cI know precisely what you were hoping that day. You were hoping your pure, innocent virgin had come along, to spread her legs and redeem your sins with her mystical virtue. Well, surprise, Gray. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019ve sins enough of my own to deal with, and I\u2019m not here to save you from yourself.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she left him with no words. She was getting far too good at that. Tightening the cord on his trousers, he released his breath in a bewildered sigh. It was so damned hard to argue with the truth. \u201cSweetheart</p><p>\u2014\u201d</p><p>Holding her dress together with one hand, she threaded the milk pail over her other wrist. \u201cI do have dreams, Gray. Beautiful dreams. And yes, depraved fantasies. I also have a heart. You\u2019re tangled up in all of them, and you can ignore me or run from me, but you can\u2019t ask me to deny my feelings any longer.\u201d</p><p>She stopped and studied him. Then she rose up on tiptoe and planted a kiss on his cheek. It struck Gray as a pitying sort of gesture, but he could not bring himself to spurn it.</p><p>\u201cI know what you want, Gray. I know what it is you really need to hear. When you\u2019re ready to listen, come let me know.\u201d</p><p>Her kiss lingered, long after she\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s amiss,\u201d Gray said, jerking his chin upward. \u201cFore topgallant lift.\u201d</p><p>The Kestrel crewman hoisted a lantern and peered up into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhere, again? Can\u2019t say as I see it.\u201d Then he turned and peered at Gray.</p><p>\u201cIt all looks right as roses to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA line\u2019s gone slack.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, Gray extended a hand.</p><p>\u201cLend me your marlinespike; I\u2019ll see to it myself.\u201d</p><p>The sailor did not argue, but handed over the marlinespike with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the captain.\u201d</p><p>Gray scaled the foremast rigging, climbing hand over hand past the foresail and fore topsail yards. When he reached the topgallant, he made a perch for himself and rested. There was nothing wrong with the line, or the sail. He\u2019d known that before he began climbing. But there was something amiss with him, and he needed the space and distance to examine it. Cool night air buffeted him, rushing through the loose weave of his tunic and blasting the staleness from his skin. It felt almost as good as a proper bath.</p><p>Her question from that afternoon haunted him. What was it that he really wanted? For a self-centered libertine, it had been an oddly long time since he\u2019d pondered that question. For the past two years, he\u2019d poured, bled, and sweated himself into this shipping business. His goals were clear. He wanted Joss to become his partner; he wanted Bel to have her London debut; and he wanted to provide security and a measure of status for their family as a whole. But what did he want for himself? It had been years since he\u2019d allowed himself to spin fantasies of a happy future\u2014not since he was a youth of Davy\u2019s age. Happiness, he\u2019d concluded, was meant for other men: men who lived honorably, kept their promises, built honest fortunes. Men who deserved it. Gray simply took pleasure where he found it, then left it behind. It was mad, and more than a bit dangerous, for a scoundrel like him to dream of lasting joy.</p><p>But now she was dreaming it for him. For them. Na\u00efve, fanciful thing that she was, she genuinely believed they could live happily ever after. None of his angry words or dark confessions had persuaded her otherwise. Remarkable. He\u2019d finally met the one girl he couldn\u2019t disillusion. And so, soaring through the darkness, rocked by waves and blanketed by stars, Gray decided to try an experiment. He shut his eyes and dared to dream.</p><p>He wanted someone to share his life. To share his burdens, his triumphs, his home and his bed. The longing assailed him, nearly flinging him from the mast with its intensity. It was as though a well of yearning existed inside him, deep and limitless, and he\u2019d been keeping it tightly capped for years, lest he fall into it and drown. And now it flooded him, coursed in his veins like his lifeblood.</p><p>He wanted ... he wanted so many things. Simple pleasures. To buy her a dozen muslin frocks to replace the one he\u2019d destroyed today. To feed her succulent fruits and ripe cheeses and slices of roasted meat. To lay his head in her lap and feel her fingers in his hair, and listen to all her fanciful tales and dreams. To share thoughts without exchanging words. To lay with her, be in her, feel her body surround him as often as she\u2019d allow. And a child ... God, how he wanted a child. He\u2019d been fighting that desire for more than a year, ever since he\u2019d cradled his newborn nephew in his arms. It was irresistible in the most base, selfish way, this impulse to create a life. A child would be bound to love and admire him, no matter what he did. A child would be bound to accept his love. A child would bind him to her, forever.</p><p>Somehow it always circled back to her. He wanted her.</p><p>This was the voyage he\u2019d meant to go respectable. He thought he\u2019d lost that chance in the taking of her virtue, then the discovery of her lies and that bundle of gold beneath her stays. The futility of all his struggling had burned a black, smoking crater in his soul. But perhaps that was exactly what he\u2019d needed: a blast to his petrified heart, and this resultant void that only she could fill. Perhaps, at long last, what he wanted and what was right were one and the same.</p><p>All that remained was to convince her. Well, there he had experience on his side. He knew a little something about conquest.</p><p>Gray spent an hour up there in the rigging, soaking up the darkness, gathering bravery from the wind. When the eight bells finally rang, they signified far more than a change of watch.</p><p>He was going to change his life.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Sophia startled awake. By what dim, silvery light the cabin window afforded, she made out the silhouette of a man standing at the foot of the bed. He was tall\u2014so tall his shadow spread up the wall and seeped into the ceiling cracks, like ink. It could only be Gray. She wondered how long he\u2019d been standing there.</p><p>She rose up on her elbow. \u201cWhat do you want, Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Heat swept her from crown to toes. She lay there waiting, suddenly uncertain how to speak or move or even breathe. The small sounds of waves lapping against the boat and canvas snapping in the breeze swelled to a deafening roar.</p><p>He leaned forward, placing one hand on either side of her legs. The bed creaked under his weight. Falling back on the pillow, Sophia let out a small squeak of her own.</p><p>He prowled up her body, moving forward on hands and knees, until he caged her completely. His scent, hot and male, engulfed her. The front of his shirt hung loose, and as he crawled over her, the fabric brushed against her belly, then her breasts. Her nipples peaked instantly. His hand captured her chin, his thumb and fingers framing her jaw. Her pulse beat wildly against his palm. Though his face hovered mere inches above hers, she could barely make out his features. Moonlight glinted off the bridge of his nose and the neat, blunt edge of his teeth. He inhaled slowly, and Sophia could have sworn he sucked that breath straight out of her lungs.</p><p>He was everywhere around her\u2014his strength, his heat, his rum-scented breath. She was powerless to do anything but stare up at him, eyes wide and straining in the dark. Her lips began to tremble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stilled them with his own. A brief, tender kiss that loosened every joint in her body. And now she trembled everywhere.</p><p>Still cupping her jaw, he broke the kiss. A breeze, ribbon-thin and cool as satin, rushed between their lips, only to be chased away by his hot, urgent whisper: \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>This time, his mouth crushed down on hers, insistent and bruising. He lowered himself onto her, and Sophia thrilled to the way her body instinctively molded around his. Her lips parting to suckle his tongue, her breasts flattening under his chest, her thighs gripping his hips as he insinuated his legs between hers. And, oh God\u2014when his hips forced her thighs wide and the hard ridge of his arousal pressed home through the layers of trousers and chemise\u2014she was already softened and wet for him there.</p><p>Because she wanted him, too.</p><p>He ground his hips against hers, and she moaned around his tongue. There was nothing like the feel of this, his body hard and eager and crushed against hers. Knowing that she\u2019d made him this way, driven him desperate with need until nothing\u2014not pride or money or lies\u2014could keep him away.</p><p>He pulled away suddenly, rising up to his knees. His shirt fluttered up over his head, a white sail caught in the moonlight and swept away into shadow. He reached between them, loosening the cord of his trousers. As he worked the knot, the back of his hand brushed against her mound, and Sophia gave a wanton sigh. When he finished, she bent her knees and hooked her toes under the loosened waistband. He leaned over her again, and she slowly dragged the trousers down over his hips, savoring the feel of hard muscle and downy hair under the arches of her feet. She felt his erection spring free and brush against her thigh. They moaned in unison. And that was the final leisurely caress. They moved quickly now\u2014to seize this time, this pleasure, this chance, before it could slip away into the night. He kicked off his trousers, and together they tussled with her chemise, bunching it up to her breasts and tugging it over her head.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she whispered, reaching for him in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d He buried his face in her hair as they tumbled back onto the pillows. \u201cGod, how I want you. I want to kiss you.\u201d He pressed his lips to her ear, her neck, the small notch at the base of her throat. \u201cTouch you.\u201d His hands, rough with fresh calluses, roamed over her breasts and hips, kneading greedy handfuls of flesh. \u201cLick you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shivered at the mere words, and when his tongue made hot, wet contact with her skin, she gasped. A trail of gooseflesh rose up in the wake of his tongue as he traced the slope of her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cI want to suckle you,\u201d he murmured against her skin, sliding down her body to draw her nipple into his mouth. She arched, gasping his name. He pulled gently at first, holding the tight bud firmly between his lips as his tongue flicked lightly over the peak. Sparks danced over her skin with each teasing caress. Then he sucked harder, catching her nipple between his teeth, and pleasure mingled with pain. Sophia twined her hands into his hair, digging her fingernails into his scalp\u2014whether to wrench him away or hold him there forever, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Then he released her nipple, and his rough chin scraped against her breast. She opened her eyes to find him staring up at her, studying her intently in the darkness, as if counting her shallow breaths. Dark-blue eyes reflected tiny silver moons. All the while, his fingers toyed with her other nipple, pinching and rolling it until she bit back a moan.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d he said, the smooth edge of his voice frayed. \u201cI want to taste you. Let me taste you.\u201d</p><p>Hooking one arm under each of her knees, he sank between her thighs. Sophia gasped as he raised his shoulders, pushing her knees to her hips and spreading her legs wide. Her eyes squeezed shut. Never had she felt so naked, so exposed. She gave thanks for the robe of shadow night afforded her.</p><p>The darkness did not hinder Gray. His mouth went straight to her core. Sophia bucked when his tongue delved into the cleft of her sex.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d The rush of his breath caressed her most intimate places. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling slowly, she willed herself to relax. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head again, learning her body with his mouth, seeking the center of her pleasure. How could such tender, gentle exploration give rise to sensations so unbearably acute? His hands tightened over her hips, holding her down while his lips and tongue teased her most sensitive spot. And when his tongue dipped inside her, she cried out.</p><p>The climax burst through her, wave after wave of bliss rippling out from her center. And even as the tremors faded, he kept up his efforts, licking and gently suckling her swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she panted, tugging on his hair. \u201cGray, please.\u201d</p><p>He unthreaded his arms from her legs and kissed his way up her belly before sitting back on his heels. \u201cI want you.\u201d He pushed her knees wide. \u201cI want to know that you will never spread these legs for another man.\u201d He wedged his hips snugly between her thighs and pushed into her, an inch. Sophia whimpered and reached for him.</p><p>He caught her hands in his, interlacing their fingers. Her arms bent at the elbows as he leaned forward, pinning her hands to the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI want to know that no other man will ever have this.\u201d He pushed in a bit further.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t enough. Sophia strained toward him, wrapping her legs over his.</p><p>\u201cGray. Oh, God. More.\u201d</p><p>He thrust into her roughly, his fingers tightening over hers. \u201cI want you to know that you are mine.\u201d He withdrew and thrust again, this time sheathing himself to the hilt. \u201cMine.\u201d Thrust. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s body sang under his tender assault, even as her heart ached. She longed to wrap her arms around him, draw him close. Whisper promises into his ear and hold him until he understood not just that she was his, but that he was hers. He was striving so hard to conquer her, but she knew all he wanted, in his heart, was to be claimed.</p><p>He held her hands in iron grips as he pushed into her, again and again. Sweat beaded on his brow, dripping onto her breasts and her neck. The bed protested his every stroke, and she moaned with it.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d Rasping breaths broke up his words; he punctuated each phrase with a thrust. \u201cI want you ... to be mine. Now. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wrapped her thighs tightly over his hips, embracing him the only way she could. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to fill you with my seed. I want you to bear my child.\u201d His pace quickened; his eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she gasped, feeling a rush of pleasure as he tilted his hips. Now his pelvis ground against hers, lifting her to a higher plane of ecstasy with each deep thrust. Her mouth fell open as pleasure mounted within her, spiraling up and up.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he growled, his fingers tightening over hers. \u201cI want the truth.\u201d</p><p>He froze. Time slowed, teetered on the edge of an abyss.</p><p>\u201cI want the truth,\u201d he repeated, pushing into her again. Then he stopped, completely sheathed in her, the full length of him filling her, pressing hard against her womb. He released her hands and bent over her, burying his face in her neck.</p><p>\u201cGod, sweet, can\u2019t you understand? I want you. All of you. I want to know you, inside and out. I want you to know me. Nothing will change that, I swear to you. You can tell me anything. I\u2019m ready to hear it.\u201d</p><p>With trembling hands, she cradled his head. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not ...\u201d He stiffened in her arms and began to withdraw. Sophia arched her body and clasped him to her, drawing him back in. \u201cOh, God,\u201d</p><p>he groaned, sinking into her again. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d She wove her fingers into his hair and kissed his earlobe. \u201cGray, it\u2019s the truth. I love you.\u201d</p><p>The muscles of his neck went rigid under her fingertips. His hands slid down to cup her bottom, lifting her hips. Oh, and now he was so deep, so solid inside her. The tempo of his thrusts increased, driving her to a helpless crescendo.</p><p>Ragged breaths scorched her ear. \u201cTell me again. Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Faster, now. Urgent. Desperate. She was soaring toward release.</p><p>\u201cTell me more,\u201d he demanded, his teeth scraping her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou love me, too.\u201d</p><p>His lips found hers, and then the truth was there\u2014in this kiss, in their joining, in the exquisite pleasure that shuddered through them both and the hot bursts flooding her womb.</p><p>They collapsed together, damp with sweat and gasping for breath. He lay still only moments before starting again, seeding light kisses along her neck, palming her breast in his callused hand.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he sighed into her hair.</p><p>She tried to check her girlish giggle, unsuccessfully. \u201cGray, it\u2019s dark as pitch. You can\u2019t even see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven in the dark,\u201d he murmured against her skin. \u201cYou are the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever known, even in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, it was tears Sophia fought to suppress. She lost that battle, too.</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ll never leave you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI said it before, and I mean it still. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019ve done in the past, because your future is with me. If I never learn your name, it doesn\u2019t matter. I intend to give you mine.\u201d</p><p>He rose up on one elbow and smoothed the hair from her brow. His smile was a flash of white in the dark. \u201cYou can be \u2018Mrs. Grayson\u2019 to the world, but to me ... to me, you\u2019ll always be \u2018sweet.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I could call you anything else.\u201d</p><p>Sophia swallowed hard. Did he mean what she thought he meant? \u201cAre you certain? I may still get my courses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain. I\u2019ve never been more certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t the marrying sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. And it\u2019s a damn good thing, too, or I\u2019d be off with some inconvenient wife instead of here with you.\u201d His hand drifted down to her belly. \u201cYou could be carrying my child. I want our child. I want a life with you.\u201d</p><p>Hope fluttered in her chest. \u201cGray ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He laid a finger against her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything, unless it\u2019s yes.\u201d</p><p>The silence was unbearable, the darkness palpable.</p><p>Gray kept his finger against her lips, suddenly afraid to move. If he released her and she didn\u2019t say yes ...</p><p>Doubt seeped into his mind, inviting panic to follow. How had he come to care so deeply for this woman, in just a few short weeks? How had he come to care so deeply for anything? And how did he dare to believe he deserved her, deserved this happiness?</p><p>Her lips trembled under his touch; or perhaps his finger trembled against her lips. He felt as though a heavy weight balanced on the fulcrum of his heart. One sigh, one breath from her could topple it. Could crush him. She swallowed, and beneath his fingertip, her lips thinned, separated. A slender crescent of white rent the dark. She was smiling. Don\u2019t hope, he bade his hammering heart. Women smile with regret asoften as not.</p><p>Slowly, he slid his finger downward, releasing her. The world stilled. He felt like a convict awaiting his sentence, absurdly hoping for life imprisonment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Hearing it once was not enough.</p><p>The crescent of white swelled, like a waxing moon. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He clutched her shoulders. \u201cYes,\u201d he prompted again. Hearing it twice was not enough, either.</p><p>She hugged him close, her legs over his hips and her arms linked around his neck. He was still inside her, and she tightened around him there, too. Arousal pulsed in his groin, and he began to thicken once again in her velvet embrace.</p><p>Craning her neck, she kissed him. \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured against his lips, over and over between hungry tastes. \u201cYes, Gray. Yes.\u201d Her head fell back against the pillow. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just like that, he was hard again. God, he would never get enough of this woman. His woman. And miracle of miracles, she hadn\u2019t had enough of him yet, either. Her pelvis rolled beneath his, sending currents of pleasure through him with each clever tilt. She stroked his back, her touch feather-light and cool against his skin.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d He moved his hand between them, stroking her where their bodies joined. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll take care of you. I\u2019ll make you happy.\u201d He prayed it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d she moaned. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Once, twice, a dozen times. Gray could not hear that word enough. He loved her slowly, relentlessly, until she panted and sighed the words, \u201cyes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d so many times they felt like sacred vows. Then he watched her sleep curled up beside him, until dawn painted her nakedness in warm, glowing strokes of light. He\u2019d made love to her four times now, he realized, but this was his first chance to truly look upon her body. She was every inch as lovely as he\u2019d imagined, if not more. He felt a bit guilty, realizing he\u2019d chastised her for sketching his likeness, when he\u2019d been conjuring an image of her nude form nightly for weeks. The only difference was, he hadn\u2019t committed his fantasies to paper. It would take a Renaissance master to capture this beauty. Her hair spilled across the pillow and his outstretched arm, a million threads of the finest silk floss. When she woke, he vowed, he would brush it until it gleamed. He admired the smooth disc of her areola, relaxed in sleep. Then he blew surreptitiously across it, until it ruched to a tight rosette. His gaze wandered lower, to where her navel rose and fell with each breath, like a tiny cork afloat on her slightly rounded belly. An irregular birthmark stood out on the crest of her hip, like a splash of wine on snow. He touched a finger to it, and she stirred.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at that,\u201d she mumbled, rubbing sleep from her eyes. \u201cI know it\u2019s horrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrid?\u201d Despite the pained expression on her face, he had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I can honestly say that there is nothing about you that\u2019s horrid in the least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy painting master would not agree.\u201d</p><p>The bitter taste of envy filled his mouth. \u201cDo you know, that Frenchman of yours had better hope I never meet with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cNot Gervais. Never Gervais. My painting master was an old, balding prig called Mr. Turklethwaite.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s bafflement must have been obvious.</p><p>She went on, \u201cThere was never any Gervais. I mean, you know that I\u2019d never taken a man to my bed, but you must understand ... I\u2019ve never allowed another man into my heart, either.\u201d She kissed his brow, then his lips. \u201cI love you, only you.\u201d</p><p>God. How brave she was. Tossing those words about as though they were feathers. Could she possibly suspect how they landed in his chest like cannonballs, detonating deep in his heart?</p> <p>Struggling for equanimity, he asked casually, \u201cSo when did this other painting master have occasion to see your birthmark?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. But I painted something like it once, on a portrait of Venus. I told him I thought it lent her an air of reality. Oh, how he scolded me. A lady who paints, he said\u2014\u201d She gave Gray a teasing look. \u201cHe would not apply the term \u2018artist\u2019 to a female, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lady who paints, he said, should approach the art as she would any other genteel accomplishment. Her purpose is to please; her goal is to create an example of refinement. A true lady would not paint an imperfection, he said, any more than she would strike a false note in a sonata. Beauty is not real, and reality is not beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. \u201cRemarkable. I believe I despise your real painting master even more than I hated the fictional one. I wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible.\u201d</p><p>She rose up on her elbows, her expression suddenly anxious. \u201cGray, how can you wish to marry me? There\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know. Some of it is ugly indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are mine.\u201d Wanting to reassure her, he laced her fingers with his. \u201cI meant every pledge I made to you aboard the Aphrodite. You are safe with me, and I will never leave you. I came to you with honorable intentions when we made love. I meant to marry you then, knowing no more of you than I do right now. I may not know your history, but I trust that I know your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than anyone.\u201d A little smile coaxed her lips apart, and he kissed them. First sipping gently at her upper lip, then savoring the plumpness of its counterpart below.</p> <p>\u201cAnd do you trust me? You can tell me everything. You do believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, certainly. And I will tell you everything.\u201d A hint of uncertainty flashed in her eyes, however, and she bit her lip. \u201cIn time.\u201d</p><p>Her reluctance wounded him, but Gray forced himself to feign patience. Pressing her further might yield answers, but not trust. He wanted to earn both. \u201cVery well. In time.\u201d</p><p>She toyed with a lock of his hair. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to tell, is all. I\u2019m uncertain where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then. Let us begin with essentials. Are you free to marry me?\u201d He exhaled slowly, in a pointed effort not to hold his breath.</p><p>\u201cOf course. When I come of age, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me your birthday.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThe first of February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be our wedding day.\u201d He traced the shape of the birthmark on her hip. \u201cVery convenient for me, for your birthday and our anniversary to coincide. I\u2019ll be more likely to remember both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would stop touching me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is ugly. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, surprised. \u201cI quite adore it. It reminds me that you are imperfectly perfect and entirely mine.\u201d He slid down her body and bent to kiss the mark to prove the point. \u201cThere\u2019s a little thrill in knowing no one else has seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other man, you mean.\u201d He kissed her there again, this time tracing the shape with his tongue. She squirmed and laughed. \u201cWhen I was a child, I would scrub at it in the bath. My nursemaid used to tell me, God gives children birthmarks so they won\u2019t get lost.\u201d Her mouth curled in a bittersweet smile. \u201cYet here I am, adrift on the ocean on the other side of the world. Don\u2019t they call that irony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe they call it Providence.\u201d He tightened his hands over her waist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, and I\u2019ve found you. And I take pains not to lose what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hip again, then slid his mouth toward her center as he settled between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she protested through a sigh of pleasure. \u201cIt\u2019s late. We must rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I\u2019ve risen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve work to do.\u201d She writhed in his grip. \u201cThe men will be wanting their breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll wait until the captain has finished his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray!\u201d She gave a gasp of shock, then one of pleasure. \u201cWhat a scoundrel you are.\u201d</p><p>He came to his knees and lifted her hips, sinking into her with a low groan.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d he breathed as she began to move with him, \u201cyou would not have me any other way.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Breakfast was late. Quite late, but served with a smile. And because the men were already at their duties, Sophia assumed the task of delivering Mr. Brackett\u2019s meal to the hold.</p><p>Bearing a tin plate of biscuits and a small pot of tea, she descended the long, narrow ladder, past the cabins and steerage, into the very belly of the ship.</p><p>\u201cMr. Brackett?\u201d She paused at the bottom of the stair, uncertain in which direction he lay.</p><p>\u201cCould that be Miss Turner?\u201d His too-courteous voice scraped out from somewhere to the left. Sophia felt anxiety wing through her, but she did not allow it to build a nest. He was confined, she reminded herself. And he would be a fool to attempt any mischief with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought your breakfast.\u201d She walked in the direction of his voice, slowly, allowing her eyes time to adjust to the dim lighting in the hold. Eventually she found him, shackled and chained to a bilge pump. He looked healthy enough, if rather unwashed. The sharp features of his face appeared even more gaunt, and a growth of beard shadowed his jaw.</p><p>\u201cMiss Turner,\u201d he said, clucking his tongue. \u201cYou came aboard this boat a respectable governess, and just look at you now. Grayson\u2019s made you his serving wench.\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cAnd his whore.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s face burned. Her hands shook, and the hard biscuits rattled on the plate. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare speak of him in that manner. You are not fit to scrape the tar from his boots. He is a better man than you could ever aspire to be, and what\u2019s more\u2014he is a better person than I. He has sheltered you and fed you, when for what you did to Quinn and Davy, I would have gleefully thrown you to the sharks. As matters stand now, I shall settle for throwing your breakfast to the rats.\u201d She flung the plate, biscuits and all, into the furthest reaches of the hold. \u201cGood day, Mr. Brackett.\u201d</p><p>Shaking, Sophia made her way up the stairs and stumbled wildly onto the deck.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gray demanded, catching her in his arms. He searched her face and examined her limbs. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, dabbing at her eyes with her fingertips. \u201cMr. Brackett is a vile, hateful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you? I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. You\u2019ll make a liar of me.\u201d She smothered a burst of hysterical laughter with her palm.</p><p>Gray took her by the elbows and led her to sit down. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she insisted, soothed by his presence and strength. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me. We just... had words, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to go down there again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019d let him starve before I ventured down in that hold again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be tempted to do just that\u2014let him starve. But unfortunately, we won\u2019t be at sea long enough.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked up, sniffing. \u201cAre we so close to Tortola?\u201d It wasn\u2019t the end, she reminded herself. Only the beginning. There would be other voyages, whole seas and continents to explore.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cJust a day or two more.\u201d He pulled her to her feet and directed her toward the ship\u2019s rail. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>A school of fish raced the Kestrel, a flurry of silver darts slicing through the foam. She glimpsed them easily through the unclouded waters. The tropical sea looked blue as sapphires from a distance, but clear as glass up close. To Sophia\u2019s astonishment, a few of the fish leapt from the water and sailed through the air on great wing-like fins, before disappearing once again beneath the waves.</p><p>\u201cFlying fish. A sure sign we\u2019re close. And there\u2019s another.\u201d He pointed toward the tip of the foremast, where a large white gull perched serenely.</p><p>\u201cA bird. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been a whole month since I\u2019ve seen a bird.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Gray. \u201cAnd yet, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been only a month that I\u2019ve known you. I can\u2019t decide whether it\u2019s been the longest month of my life, or the shortest.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows gathered in an exaggerated frown. \u201cI can\u2019t decide which pays me the fainter compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d she teased, linking her arm in his. \u201cTo compliment you, I should tell you it has been the best month of my life. And it has.\u201d Truer words, she\u2019d never spoken.</p><p>\u201cOh, nicely managed. My pride is rescued.\u201d Despite his air of nonchalance, his eyes held genuine emotion. They were fully blue today\u2014a rich, azure blue, clear and inviting and endless. Just like the sea. Sophia laughed to herself. How had she missed the obvious? All this time, she\u2019d been puzzling out the color of his eyes. They were always shifting and changing, from green to blue to gray. And now she knew why. They always reflected the sea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he said, \u201cif you keep gazing at me like that much longer, I shall be forced to pack you off belowdecks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I truly gazing?\u201d She fluttered her lashes at him. \u201cI am making a trip to the storeroom soon, you know. But mind\u2014this is the last good frock I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiren.\u201d He gave her a surreptitious pinch on the hip. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the cabin I have in mind for you, and you\u2019re going there alone. You need to rest.\u201d He walked her toward the hatch.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t come rest with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I come with you, neither of us will rest.\u201d</p><p>A current of pleasure shot straight to her center. Then a more practical thought intruded. \u201cBut what of the noon meal? It won\u2019t make itself.\u201d</p><p>At that instant, a flying fish as long as her arm sailed over the rail of the boat and flopped on the deck at their feet.</p><p>Gray looked at the thrashing fish, then raised his eyebrows at her.</p> <p>\u201cSomehow I think we\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, Sophia woke alone in the dark. Her toes groped the floorboards for her slippers, and she wrapped a light blanket over her shift before heading abovedecks.</p><p>Stars greeted her, in divine multitudes. A million lights dancing, winking, shining merrily in the firmament. As though some mischievous seraph were crawling about the floor of Heaven, drilling little holes with an auger to let glory shine through.</p><p>She spied him at the helm, his back to her as he looked out over the Kestrel\u2019s stern, elbows propped on the rail. The crewman at the ship\u2019s wheel politely ignored her as Sophia tiptoed past, through the swaying umbra of lamplight and into the shadows that cloaked Gray. Noiselessly, she pressed her body to his, flattening her cheek against his back. He tensed at the initial contact, then relaxed an instant later. His fingers found hers as she crept one hand around his waist.</p><p>\u201cYou should be sleeping,\u201d he murmured. His amplified voice sounded delicious, traveling through the solid muscles of his back. She felt him, rather than heard him. Felt him everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI was missing you.\u201d And, because she wanted to feel him speak again, she added in a suggestive voice, \u201cWere you missing me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He dragged her hand downward to present her with tangible proof of just how much he missed her. Sophia smiled against his back. He missed her greatly, she discovered, her fingers exploring. This was yearning on a grand scale, indeed.</p><p>He spoke again, sending pleasant tremors through her. \u201cWe\u2019ll make land tomorrow. In the morning, if the wind holds.\u201d</p><p>Now Sophia was the one to tense. He pivoted to face her, drawing her tight against his chest. \u201cNothing between us changes tomorrow.\u201d He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cExcept this,\u201d he said, rubbing her palm over his beard. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019ll do once we reach terra firma is shave. I\u2019m going mad with itching.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, caressing his rough cheek with her thumb. \u201cThen why haven</p><p>\u2019t you shaved all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel this?\u201d He dragged her fingertips over the narrow scar slanting across his chin. \u201cThis is what comes of shaving at sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d She pulled back, blinking in the starlight to make out his features.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you got that scar? You cut yourself shaving?\u201d She could not help but laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad my vanity-occasioned injury amuses you so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you. I\u2019m laughing at myself. That you cut yourself shaving ... it isn\u2019t at all what I\u2019d imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, by all means, laugh. It was pure folly.\u201d He looked out over the waters.</p><p>\u201cMust have happened somewhere near this corner of the ocean, since we were only a day or so out from Tortola. I was coming home from England, after my father had died. I was so worried for my sister, Bel. She was just a child then. We hadn\u2019t seen each other in years, but from the moment she greeted me, I wanted her to feel reassured. I was so anxious to look responsible, capable ...\u201d She heard the wry smile in his voice. \u201cFailing that, at least well-groomed. I was shaving when the storm hit. Lost my balance and fell\u2014sliced open my chin, and blackened an eye, too. Instead of well-groomed and responsible, I showed up looking as though I\u2019d been besieged by pirates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was no less overjoyed to see you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Sophia rested her chin on his arm. \u201cI look forward to meeting your sister. Will she like me, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will love you.\u201d The soft murmur warmed her heart. Then he continued in a teasing tone, \u201cCharity is her life\u2019s work. It\u2019s what Bel does best, devoting herself to the most wayward of souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, she will most certainly attach herself to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d He gathered her closer, then froze. \u201cI\u2019ve just realized something.\u201d</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>\u201cYour little bundle\u2019s gone,\u201d he whispered, walking his fingers down the valley between her breasts. \u201cYou didn\u2019t pitch it overboard?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s beneath the mattress. I didn\u2019t want to feel it between us anymore. But supposing I had pitched it overboard, what then? I do hope you\u2019re not marrying me for my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cSix hundred pounds is no paltry sum ... but no. It\u2019s not enough to persuade a man of my means. If it were six thousand, then you might have cause for concern.\u201d</p><p>And what if it were twenty thousand? Should I be concerned then?</p><p>Sophia rested her head on his shoulder. She knew he was only joking, that her money had no sway over his affections. He might have married for money years ago, if he\u2019d wished. But still, she hesitated to divulge the remainder of her fortune, considering his angry reaction the first time. Neither was she eager to tell him about Toby. How could she tell him that she\u2019d just been betrothed to another solicitous, patient man whom she\u2019d callously jilted and deceived? Gray would doubt her anew, she feared, and Sophia did not know how she would bear it. Better to wait until they were married. He could not doubt her love then.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let everything fall away. Everything but Gray. His thumb drew small, intimate circles on her back, and desire spiraled through her body. \u201cDid you want to go below?\u201d she asked.</p><p>An eager part of him jumped at the invitation, but the rest of him remained still. \u201cIn a bit.\u201d He put a finger under her chin and tilted her face to his. \u201cRight now, I want to kiss my sweetheart under the stars.\u201d</p><p>She kept her eyes open as he bent his head to hers, taking in the silver-blue glow of his skin and the restless shadows the wind dragged from his hair. So handsome, even in the dark.</p><p>His breath caressed her lips first, gentle and warm. Then his lips whispered over hers, just a shade more insistent than breath. He licked lightly at the corner of her mouth, oiling the vulnerable hinge of her lips.</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d he murmured. She swallowed the word, felt it slide from her throat to her belly, and lower ... making her hungry for the warm press of his tongue against hers.</p><p>Oh, but he was a tease. All patient arrogance and devastating care. Instead of taking her mouth, he slid a hand to the back of her neck, cradling her head and tipping it back to elongate the column of her throat. He scattered kisses there, hot sparks that danced along her exposed skin. She curled her fingers into his shirt and the rippling muscles beneath. Above them, strange constellations whirled through the night. His mouth settled possessively over her ear, his breath heating the sensitive shell as his tongue traced its contours.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he whispered into her. \u201cAnd the world is ours. There is nowhere beneath this sky that we do not belong together.\u201d</p><p>His tongue flashed into her ear, and her knees dissolved, leaving her no choice but to fall against him. To depend on him for her strength, her balance, and indeed her next breath, as now\u2014at last\u2014his lips covered hers.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s eyes fluttered shut, and now the stars were inside her. Bright constellations of desire\u2014sparking, burning, whirling through the darkest parts of her being. Glorious. His tongue struck a subtle, coaxing rhythm, mating skillfully with hers. Breasts needy and aching, she pressed her body against his. She wriggled into his embrace until that iron-hard ridge of him nestled just where she needed it. Where they belonged together. He growled, deep in his throat. She relished the feral sound, the lapse in his suave, sensual mastery of her. But she paused only a moment to savor that taste of power before yielding again, eagerly surrendering to the dangerous, unpredictable need she\u2019d unleashed.</p><p>He roamed her body, stroking and tweaking her everywhere she yearned for him. Soft caresses, rough pinches, sharp bites and gentle licks. He knew just where to place them, and in the precise sequence that rendered her panting and molten.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he grunted, clutching at her hips. \u201cNow, we go below.\u201d</p><p>Gray delighted in going below. The little jolt of surprise she gave when he first kissed her there, that instinctive buck of her hips that thrust her heat against his mouth. That naughty little book of hers excluded some rather vital lessons in the art of passion, and he took great pleasure in completing her education.</p><p>And then he took his own pleasure in her.</p><p>Afterward, sweaty and sated, they lay naked atop the linens. Spread out on their backs as if floating, allowing the night air to cool their skin. Blissful exhaustion buoyed him into sleep.</p><p>He roused some time later, when she lit a candle.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve seen one here somewhere ...\u201d</p><p>Gray could barely muster the energy to lift his head. He caught sight of her, dressed in her shift and rummaging through drawers. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d She straightened triumphantly, holding a sharply gleaming object in her hand. A razor, he discerned. \u201cThere\u2019s a strop and a cake of shaving soap, too. I\u2019ll just fetch some water from the galley.\u201d</p><p>Before he could protest, she was out the cabin door, and Gray let his head fall back on the pillow. He must have dozed, because he opened his eyes to find her over him, tugging his head toward the edge of the bed and smoothing her palms over his face.</p><p>\u201cJust lie still,\u201d she whispered, guiding him to pivot his body until the crown of his head rested against her chest. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve a very steady hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it.\u201d She worked sharp-scented lather through the whiskers, and the aroma sliced through the fog of his brain, waking him a bit more.</p><p>\u201cThis time, you shall greet your sister looking resplendent. The picture of respectability; or at least, of good grooming.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as she smoothed the lather down his throat, her touch gliding over his skin. \u201cGood. I shall need all the resplendence I can manage, in order to convince her. Although, I expect your presence will accomplish more in that respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince her of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo come with us, of course.\u201d He paused as she laid the blade to his jaw and dragged it slowly up to his cheek. \u201cNow that her mother\u2019s gone, and Mara, too ... I can\u2019t allow her to continue living there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMara?\u201d She made another slow swipe with the razor.</p><p>\u201cJoss\u2019s wife. Died in childbirth last year.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cHow dreadful. Did the babe survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A boy, Jacob. Bel\u2019s looking after him now.\u201d</p><p>After rinsing the blade, she laid a hand to his cheek, rolling his head to the other side. Again, she began at his ear and worked inward.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could have known my brother before,\u201d Gray continued.</p><p>\u201cBefore Mara died, he was different. Things were different between us. More ... brotherly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrief changes people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve learned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tipped his head back to reach his throat. He steadied his breathing, fighting the urge to swallow as she scraped over his pulse. Grief changespeople. How could it not? He realized now how unfair he\u2019d been to Joss, denying him the time to grieve, the space to change. It was only now that he could understand it, when the very idea of losing this woman forced beads of cold sweat to his brow.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he reached up to squeeze her free hand. \u201cLet us speak of happier things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He heard the smile in her voice. \u201cWhere shall we honeymoon? Will you take me to Italy, to see the Botticellis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take you anywhere you wish. Anywhere under the sky.\u201d</p> <p>A tender kiss landed on his eyelid. Then she fell silent, working toward the center of his chin, dipping the blade in a basin at his side between short, sure strokes. She was concentrating, he realized, working carefully around his scar. At last she set aside the razor, letting it sink into the basin with a soft splash, then dried his face with a cloth.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d Her fingers ran lightly over his face, as if testing for any rough spots she\u2019d missed. She traced the thin scar from his chin to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo if this scar was self-inflicted, occasioned by vanity\u201d\u2014her hand slid down to the scar on his chest\u2014\u201cwhat of this? Not vanity, I think.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, laying one hand over hers. \u201cPure stupidity, that one. But self-inflicted, just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a burn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Silence. His heart thumped against her palm.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d she finally whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he replied, surprised to find it was the truth. How could he expect her to share her own secrets, if he withheld his? \u201cBut it\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have all night.\u201d He cocked his head and frowned up at her. \u201cWhen I went to the galley, I told O\u2019Shea you were ill,\u201d she admitted through a grin.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll not disturb us until they sight land.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled onto his side and propped himself on one elbow, uncertain whether to scold or kiss her. She solved the dilemma by kissing him first, then nestling into the bed beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou need rest,\u201d she whispered, drawing his head to her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBetween keeping watch and keeping a mistress, you\u2019ve scarcely slept in a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my mistress, you\u2019re my future wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not married yet. And don\u2019t spoil my fun. It\u2019s my last chance to be anyone\u2019s mistress.\u201d</p><p>A savage joy swelled his heart. He wrapped an arm about her waist. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>Gray held her in silence, considering the story he meant to tell. It was a story he scarcely understood himself, and he realized he would be relating it for his own benefit more than for hers. \u201cYou will have gathered that Joss\u2019s mother was my father\u2019s mistress. One of his mistresses, at any rate. She was a slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She stroked his hair.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning, my father acknowledged Joss openly as his son. This was after my own mother\u2019s death, and before his bastards numbered so many as to make acknowledging them impractical. We were raised as brothers, during the day. Played together, dined together, took our lessons together. By night I stayed in the house, and Joss went to his mother in her quarters.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s so odd now, to remember how I envied him. He had all the same privileges I enjoyed, with none of the expectations. To me, Joss seemed at home everywhere. It was only much later that I realized the opposite was true.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, he scrubbed a hand over his freshly shaven face. \u201cIt should not have been surprising, I suppose, that he grew to resent me. But it was. When my father talked of sending me back to England, to university\u2014all I wished was to trade places with Joss and stay at home. All he wished was to have the chance to go. We argued all the time, and came to blows more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut such is the way between siblings,\u201d she interjected. \u201cMy sister and I quarreled constantly at that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. In the end, it was another fight that drew the line between us. On his way home from town one night, Joss found himself on the wrong side of some drunken louts. They decided it was time to put my brother in his place, so they beat and branded him.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze in his hair. \u201cBranded him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was done to slaves at one time, burning the owner\u2019s mark into their shoulder. A repulsive practice\u2014not that slavery itself is not a repulsive practice in its own right. Branding has been out of favor on Tortola for generations, but Joss\u2019s attackers decided to resurrect the tradition.\u201d A wave of nausea rolled through him at the memory of his brother lying prostrate in his recovery bed for days on end. The odor of charred flesh giving way to the sickly smell of infection, then the sweet stench of laudanum overpowering all. These parts of the story, he would not share.</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d She resumed stroking his hair.</p><p>\u201cI was due to leave for England before he\u2019d fully recovered. I sat by his sickbed and promised him, when I had my own money I would come back for him and Bel, and we would all have the same luxuries, the same opportunities. We would share everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that make him feel better?\u201d</p><p>Gray smirked. \u201cHe told me to go to the devil. Mind, he was drugged and in pain, but it still killed me. I got roaring drunk, wildly sick, and then roaring drunk again. I didn\u2019t know how to convince him and remind myself that despite everything, we were brothers.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little gasp. Her hand left his hair and went to cover the scar.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gray. You did this to yourself?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a sigh. \u201cNever underestimate the power of liquor and maudlin sentiment on an adolescent boy. I was so stupid. Botched the whole business. It had to be my chest, since I couldn\u2019t very well reach my own shoulder. Didn\u2019t heat the iron long enough, and of course my hand shook like a palm frond in a hurricane.\u201d He pushed her hand aside and traced the blurred, irregular pattern with his own fingertips. \u201cGod, did it hurt. Hurt all the way to England. It reminded me, all right. Reminded me that I should never have left. I felt so damned guilty for leaving him behind, I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to go to Oxford when we arrived. Stayed on that ship for more than a year.</p><p>\u201cWhen I did finally go to England, it only made matters worse. I saw the life my father\u2019s family should have had. Society, wealth, rank, privilege. Not some nigh-on-biblical exile in a land of slavery and pestilence. I wanted\u2014needed\u2014to rebuild the fortune our father squandered. I hadn\u2019t a clue how to atone for his moral failings, much less correct my own. But I knew how to make a profit, and that\u2019s what I did. I wanted to give my brother and sister all the comforts and security they\u2019d been denied.\u201d</p><p>His hand curled into a fist over his heart. \u201cAnd how did I go about it? By breaking every promise I\u2019d ever made. By denying my brother, taking his inheritance, selling his family\u2019s home out from under them, and dragging Joss out on the sea with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo become privateers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did have an unholy good time.\u201d Gray\u2019s lips curved in a cold smile.</p><p>\u201cWe were like boys again, only armed with men\u2019s weapons: cannons, cynicism, anger at the world. France and England and America could blow one another to bits. We were there to collect the spoils. Toward the end of the war, we started planning Grayson Brothers Shipping. We\u2019d set up offices in England, build more ships\u2014bring Bel to London for her schooling and debut. We were supposed to be equal partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, inconvenient thing that it is. Joss married Mara, got her with child. They didn\u2019t want to travel, so I went ahead to England and started building the business, gathering investors. Came back just in time to witness Jacob\u2019s birth, then Mara\u2019s death. Suddenly, Joss wanted nothing to do with the shipping business. Demanded his share of the prize to buy land on Tortola, of all places, and then just give it away.\u201d</p><p>Sophia frowned. \u201cGive it away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Bel\u2019s idea, a sugar cooperative. This is what happens when a girl\u2019s only friends are missionaries. The Quakers and Methodists have been buying up plantations and dividing them into smaller farms, for freedmen to make their own livelihood. The cooperative bit was Joss\u2019s notion\u2014by sharing the cost and labor of refining the sugar, they might be able to eke out a profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. It sounds like a bloody saintly idea. But in practice ... it\u2019s a tremendous risk. And the farming life\u2014it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s poor. It\u2019s less than they deserve.\u201d Gray swore into the night. \u201cAfter all that time, all that work and sacrifice\u2014to end right back where we\u2019d started? I couldn\u2019t let Joss do it. I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd took the money with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll thank me eventually. Mara\u2019s death made my brother too cautious, that\u2019s all. Once he\u2019s been out on the sea long enough, he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>He sat up in bed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if my sister claims she\u2019s happy dressing in rags and playing ministering Quaker. She is going to London for the most extravagant debut the ton has ever seen, and she will wear silk in every damned color of the rainbow. I didn\u2019t spend the past ten years lying, cheating, and stealing just so my brother and sister could continue on in the same miserable exile our father gave us. Damn it, I sold my soul for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d She sat up behind him, draping her arms around his shoulders. \u201cIt</p><p>\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Nothing\u2019s right. I\u2019ve never done a right thing in my life, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes a pair of us then.\u201d Her lips pressed against the spot under his ear. \u201cBut I believe we are right together, don\u2019t you? People like us ... we have no talent for following rules. We can only follow our hearts. I\u2019ve wronged people as well, but is it horribly wicked that I can\u2019t bring myself to regret it? It brought me to you.\u201d</p><p>He took one of her hands and kissed it. \u201cYou\u2019re so young, you can\u2019t know the meaning of true regret. It\u2019s never what you\u2019ve done, love, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve left undone.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against her, sighing into the comforting heat of her breasts. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to Italy, sweetheart, I promise it. To Egypt and India, too, if you like. But it will have to wait until after Bel\u2019s season. I\u2019ve put aside a dowry for her, enough to offset our provenance. We do come from gentry, and her mother was my father\u2019s second wife, so Bel isn\u2019t illegitimate. My aunt\u2019s agreed to help bring her out. And if being the well-dowered niece of a duchess isn\u2019t enough to turn heads, there is the fact that she\u2019s the second-most beautiful lady in the world.\u201d</p><p>Sliding from her embrace, Gray turned to face her. His compliment seemed to have bounced off her puzzled expression.</p><p>\u201cYour aunt is a duchess?\u201d she asked, her brow creasing. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not a royal one. Camille Marie Augusta Glaston D\u2019Hiver, Her Grace, the Duchess of Aldonbury. You\u2019re forgiven for never having heard of her.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to kiss her neck. \u201cTalent or no, it\u2019s time for me to follow the rules. I\u2019ll go to London and play their little game, attend their balls and parties, host a few of my own. Dress head to toe in the latest fashions, whether they suit me or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be unfashionably faithful to you.\u201d He brushed her elegantly sloped nose with one fingertip. \u201cDon\u2019t vex yourself, sweet. We\u2019ll tell everyone you\u2019re the daughter of a West Indian planter. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll have much difficulty adopting the role.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She did not return his smile. \u201cBut Gray ... what if I told you I don\u2019t want to go to London, don\u2019t want to play their little game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d convince you otherwise.\u201d Giving her his best devilish grin, he leaned in to kiss her.</p><p>She put a hand to his chest, stopping him. \u201cWhat if I told you I can\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d He pressed a firm kiss to her lips, shushing her objections. \u201cAnd you will, for me. I must ask it of you. After Bel\u2019s settled and Joss assumes the partnership, then the world is ours to explore. But I have to see this through first, or ...\u201d He stroked her cheek. \u201cOr I\u2019ve done it all for nothing.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment. \u201cNot for nothing, Gray. You did it for them. And no matter what occurs, I\u2019m certain they know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I had that certainty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may borrow mine.\u201d She laid a hand on his cheek, her eyes dewy. \u201cI\u2019m certain they know how much you love them.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he feared she would cry. For a moment, he was mortally terrified that if she did, he would join her.</p> <p>Then she cocked her head, and a knowing smile balanced out her poignant gaze. With a cheerful sniff, she straddled his lap and pushed back on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d The word was a promising murmur as she pushed him back against the bed. \u201cLet me show you how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>The dawn was cruel.</p><p>Sophia watched daylight creep across her beloved, stealing him from her with rosy fingers, one inch at a time. Sitting in the captain\u2019s chair, legs folded under her shift, she regarded Gray as he slept. He lay prostrate on the bed, the linens twisted about his body, one forearm draped over his eyes. It was the same position he\u2019d lain in all night, since their lovemaking sent him into sleep.</p><p>When his seed had filled her, she\u2019d sent up a silent prayer that it would take root. If she conceived, all choice would be taken from her. She couldn\u2019t leave him if she carried his child; she knew he wouldn\u2019t leave her. He would be forced to reconsider his plans in London, but the joy of a child might mitigate his disappointment. Life would write a different ending for them than either had imagined, but it might have been a happy one. If only she\u2019d conceived.</p> <p>She\u2019d held him inside her until she felt his gentle snores lifting his chest under hers. Then, leaving him to his well-earned rest, she rose quietly to perform her ablutions. And that was when she\u2019d begun to bleed. An hour\u2019s worth of silent, racking sobs later, Sophia curled into the chair and attempted to think.</p><p>Whatever was she going to do? How could she begin to tell Gray the truth? Perhaps she might start with that amusing tale of the red-faced bank clerk, how she\u2019d charmed him into releasing five hundred pounds from her trust. She still suspected he\u2019d have a good laugh at that. But then she would have to tell him the source of her remaining one hundred. That it had been won at cards, and a fair bit of it at the Duchess of Aldonbury\u2019s own table. Should she tell Gray she\u2019d been at school with his cousins? Stayed as a guest more than once in their family home? By now, Her Grace would have heard the sordid, albeit false, story of her elopement. She, like every other lady of the ton, would cut Sophia from her acquaintance as a matter of social necessity.</p><p>For Sophia, there could be no pretending, no adopting the role of a West Indian planter\u2019s daughter. Even if she could stomach the thought of further deceit\u2014and she was not certain she could, even for Gray\u2014if ever she returned to London, she would be a pariah. Her ruin would be a contagion to anyone connected with her.</p><p>She knew she ought to tell Gray the truth. But once she did, all the choices would be his. He might insist on marrying her anyway, thereby destroying his sister\u2019s prospects and his family\u2019s tenuous respectability\u2014everything he\u2019d worked so hard, sacrificed so much to attain. Or ... he might let her go.</p><p>Sophia buried her face in her hands. How could she tell him? How could she tell him what an inconstant, dishonest, scheming thing she had been, yet still make a claim on his honor? How could she force him to make this choice, between his love for his family and his promises to her?</p><p>How would she bear it if he chose them?</p><p>The irony of it all. If only she\u2019d have been brave enough to stand up to her parents, to ask Toby to release her from their engagement instead of running away. There would have been scandal, to be sure, but she still would have received the occasional invitation from old friends. And perhaps next Season, she would have attended a ball, a mad crush of a debut, and locked gazes with a tall, broad-shouldered gentleman sporting a roguish smile and an intriguing scar on his chin.</p><p>Perhaps he would have asked her to dance.</p> <p>The sunlight gilded that scar now, as well as the larger one on his chest. How she envied those scars, the indelible marks he bore for love. One for his brother, one for his sister. In some primitive way, Sophia wanted to mark him, too. He might never see it, never know it\u2014but in her heart, he would always be hers.</p><p>Rifling quietly through her trunk, she located an inkwell and a small paintbrush. As she settled beside him on the bed, he stirred ... but did not wake. Instead, he rolled onto his side, away from her. Perfect. Fortunately, Sophia had a deft touch and a steady hand. And Gray was exhausted and sleeping like the dead. She worked quickly, stealthily to create her mark. Just as she sat back to admire her sadly impermanent handiwork, footsteps pounded above and the cry rang out:</p><p>\u201cLand ho!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the Aphrodite,\u201d Gray said, squeezed next to her in the jolly boat as a crewman rowed them toward Road Town. Of course, Gray had insisted she and her trunks be the first items taken ashore. He would not have left her behind.</p><p>He nodded toward his ship, moored on the other side of the harbor.</p><p>\u201cProbably arrived a few days ago now, so they\u2019ll be looking for our arrival. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Bel waiting on the dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she is not there.\u201d The words popped out. She ventured a glance at him, meeting with the expected frown.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought you looked forward to meeting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Sophia lied. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I don\u2019t feel ready, dressed like this. I should like to make a better first impression.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked resplendent indeed this morning, fitted out in a crisp lawn shirt, dove-gray trousers, and a royal blue coat that barely contained his massive shoulders. He must have been saving the outfit for just this occasion, his triumphant homecoming. Sophia felt drab and common at his side, dressed in her beleaguered sprigged frock. She, too, had an item of truly splendid attire she might have worn. But the silk gown remained wrapped in tissue at the bottom of her trunk. If she was truly going to do this</p><p>\u2014tell Gray the whole truth and give him a chance to let her go\u2014well, to look that beautiful hardly seemed fair.</p><p>\u201cShall I introduce you as Jane, then?\u201d He gave her a bemused look. \u201cI can\u2019t even think of you as Jane. It\u2019s the wrong name for you entirely.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s hands curled into fists. He was giving her the perfect opportunity. She might as well do it now. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not my name.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, and his thumb ceased stroking her palm. In an instant, a wall of ice had formed between them.</p><p>Sophia forced herself to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s my middle name. You see, I ... I ...\u201d</p><p>Her courage failed. \u201cMy family always used my middle name.\u201d</p><p>His hard expression melted to a grin. \u201cAnother thing we have in common.\u201d</p><p>He slid an arm about her waist, drawing her close.</p><p>Cursing her cowardice, Sophia leaned against him. Just the thought of it... telling him everything, watching him struggle to choose between her and his dreams ... She felt her bonnet ribbons constricting about her throat, cutting off her air. Desperation tugged at her, urging her to flee. But this was not London. Tortola was so small, so un-crowded, so unfamiliar to her and known to Gray. From the boat she could see the settlement of Road Town rising up from the harbor like an amphitheater, all the largest buildings crowded near the water. People milled about the docks, nearly all of them shades of brown or ebony. How could a female, fair-skinned interloper like her possibly hope to disappear? Where would she turn, if he let her go?</p><p>The Walthams. She had this one connection. Perhaps they were still here. She could claim her acquaintance with Lucy. Better yet, she could claim to be Lucy. She still had the original letter, after all. His confident baritone caressed her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. You\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019m so proud of you, I think my coat will burst from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely here,\u201d she said, wanting to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is, to a newcomer. Though it\u2019s only home for me.\u201d</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t think she could ever greet such a sight with indifference, even after de cades. The lush, verdant island rimmed with white sand, set against a backdrop of azure sky ... it would take her dozens of attempts to render these brilliant colors faithfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, there she is,\u201d Gray said as they neared the dock. \u201cI think she\u2019s grown two inches since I saw her last.\u201d Releasing Sophia\u2019s waist, he cupped his hands around his mouth and called, \u201cBel!\u201d</p><p>A young woman stood on the dock. She wore no bonnet, but shielded her eyes with both hands. At Gray\u2019s salute, she dropped one to her throat and raised the other in a wave.</p><p>From this distance, Sophia couldn\u2019t judge whether Miss Grayson had her father\u2019s ears, but her coloring was vastly different from either of her brothers\u2019. She had olive skin and jet-black hair, so black it reflected a bluish gloss from the sky.</p><p>Heavens, Sophia thought as they docked. Miss Grayson was a true beauty. Hers was an exotic, medieval, operatic beauty\u2014a beauty that radiated from within. The kind of beauty that inspired men to compose odes and wage wars, and inspired ladies to make unkind comments in retiring rooms. No wonder Gray would do anything for her.</p><p>How could Sophia ever withstand comparison to this creature? Drat. She should have worn the silk after all.</p><p>The young lady ran to meet their boat at the end of the dock. Her breathless greeting preempted any introductions. \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d She gulped for air. \u201cThank God you\u2019ve arrived. They\u2019re coming for you, you know. They\u2019ve already taken Joss.\u201d Her hand fluttered like a bird\u2019s wing.</p><p>\u201cDolly, there\u2019s talk of hanging.\u201d</p><p>Dear Lord, had she just said\u2014</p><p>\u201cHanging?\u201d Gray helped Sophia out of the boat, then bounded onto the dock. He took his sister by the shoulders. \u201cBel, calm down. Tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Miss Grayson swallowed hard. \u201cWhen Joss brought the Aphrodite in, that horrid man ... the other captain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMallory,\u201d Gray supplied impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYes, him. He went to the Vice Admiralty court and accused you of attacking him, taking his ship by force. They\u2019ve put Joss in jail, and they\u2019re coming for you.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. A trio of disconcertingly large men strode toward them. \u201cThey\u2019re charging you both with piracy.\u201d</p><p>At the word, Sophia went queasy. The dock lurched under her. She was on solid land now\u2014or solid wood, at any rate\u2014why did it still feel as though she were at sea?</p><p>Gray did not seem perturbed in the least. \u201cI was expecting this. Mallory\u2019s nothing but a lying bilge rat, Bel. I\u2019ll have it straightened out in a minute, you\u2019ll see.\u201d He smiled at Sophia. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ve someone you\u2019ll be glad to meet.\u201d</p><p>Sophia and Miss Grayson barely had time to exchange befuddled looks before the men were upon them.</p><p>\u201cJenkins.\u201d Gray greeted the man in front with a nod. Sophia recognized his posture of effortless authority. \u201cAlways a pleasure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome back, Gray. Good to see you, too.\u201d The man\u2019s gaze shifted to his companions, then back to Gray.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, man? My sister tells me there\u2019s been a misunderstanding about the Kestrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems so,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cGray, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to come with us straightaway. We\u2019ve orders to hold you until the judge has a chance to question you and decide on charges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any charges,\u201d Gray said, chuckling. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be glad to come, just as soon as I\u2019ve seen to my passengers and crew.\u201d</p><p>The man looked uneasy. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be now, Gray.\u201d He made a motion to the two men in back, and they stepped forward, holding a pair of shackles between them.</p><p>Gray took a step back. \u201cSurely there\u2019s no need for chains.\u201d He looked from one soldier to another. \u201cI\u2019m a patriot. I brought more than sixty prizes into this harbor and surrendered them all to the Crown. Burton knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurton\u2019s been gone eight months. The new judge\u2014he\u2019s called Fitzhugh \u2014well, he wants you brought in wearing chains, public-like. Fond of display, this one.\u201d Jenkins shuffled his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the shackles loose. Just come willingly, Gray. Let\u2019s not make it an ugly display.\u201d</p><p>Gray swore with exasperation, but he didn\u2019t resist. Stepping a few yards back, he held out his hands. Jenkins directed the two younger soldiers as they fitted metal bands around his wrists.</p> <p>Sophia touched Miss Grayson\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she whispered, as much to herself as to her companion. \u201cHe\u2019s done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The young lady sniffed. \u201cDolly always finds a way out of these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Dolly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, my brother.\u201d</p><p>Sophia blinked. Was there a third Grayson brother with square-tipped ears?</p><p>\u201cYou probably call him Gray,\u201d the young lady continued, giving her a cautious smile. \u201cMost people do.\u201d</p> <p>Dolly was Gray? Oh dear. No wonder his sister was the sole lady on earth permitted to address him by his Christian name.</p><p>The soldiers began shackling his legs now, working awkwardly to fit the bands around Gray\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cI thought his name was Benedict,\u201d Sophia murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh it is, but that was our father\u2019s name. He\u2019s always gone by his middle name, Adolphus. Dolly.\u201d Miss Grayson turned to her. \u201cYou know my brother quite well, then. Forgive me the lapse in etiquette, we haven\u2019t even been introduced.\u201d She dropped a little curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m Isabel Grayson. Were you a passenger on the Kestrel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I left England on the Aphrodite. Didn\u2019t Joss mention me?\u201d</p><p>Miss Grayson shook her head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much time to speak. But if Dolly says I\u2019ll be glad to meet you, I have a fair guess ...\u201d Suddenly she grasped Sophia\u2019s hand. \u201cYou must be one of Mr. Wilson\u2019s friends, with the West Indian Missions League. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come. We\u2019ve so many plans for the sugar cooperative. And we can take you to the judge. Even if he won\u2019t believe Dolly, surely he cannot discount the testimony of a missionary.\u201d</p><p>A missionary? Sophia\u2019s mind whirled. Of all the preposterous assumptions ... oh, but if only it were true. Then she might have been some help to Gray. But she, a fallen woman, a liar and a thief, walking into a courtroom to speak on his behalf? She could do his cause nothing but harm.</p><p>Oh God. He was better off without her.</p> <p>Finally, the soldiers finished their task. At the sight of her brother in chains, Miss Grayson began to weep.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Jenkins,\u201d Gray muttered, his voice seething. \u201cI\u2019m wearing your shackles. I\u2019ll come willingly. Surely you can spare me a minute first.\u201d At the command in his eyes, the men fell back a few paces.</p><p>Gray turned to his sister. \u201cBel,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthere\u2019s a handkerchief in my breast pocket. Take it.\u201d She obeyed, and wiped her eyes. He smiled down at her. \u201cNow is this any way to greet your prodigal brother? I\u2019d planned to come home a respectable tradesman.\u201d He glanced toward Sophia. \u201cNot just that, but a family man. Instead, I stand before you as a pirate in chains.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but Sophia wanted to cry. Once again, his best efforts at brotherhood had been twisted and distorted by fate. She could see in his expression how it wounded him. The thought of tainting Miss Grayson\u2019s prospects, being the cause of that pain ...</p><p>\u201cJust the same,\u201d he teased his sister, \u201cI\u2019d rather hoped for a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Miss Grayson gave him a tremulous smile and went up on tiptoe to plant a kiss on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. Now don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have this straightened out directly.\u201d His eyes went back and forth between Sophia and his sister. \u201cIn the meantime, the two of you can become acquainted.\u201d He rattled his chains, adding a self-deprecating roll of his eyes. Then he walked a few paces back, toward the men.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s dizziness increased, and the dock seemed to roll beneath her again. She felt as though she would become ill, or fall. And with Gray chained like a criminal, who would catch her?</p><p>She closed her eyes. If she ran now ... he couldn\u2019t catch her. She had to go. If she were a better person, a good person, she might have gathered the courage to tell the truth and accept her fate. She might have even been able to help him. But if she were a good person, she would not have been here in the first place. She didn\u2019t know how to change her colors, any more than a dolphin-fish knew how to change its iridescent scales.</p><p>She knew how to lie. She knew how to run.</p><p>There was only one way she could set Gray free.</p><p>She rushed after him as he ambled down the dock, joking with his captors.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she whispered, clutching his bound wrist.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious, sweet,\u201d he murmured, low enough that only she could hear. \u201cI know these men. I\u2019ve lined their pockets for years. They\u2019re not going to hang me. I\u2019ll have it all sorted out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you will.\u201d She swallowed back a wave of nausea. \u201cBut ... I won\u2019t be here when you do.\u201d He deserved this much, to hear it from her. Just as Toby had deserved the same. Gray was right. She didn\u2019t regret the things she\u2019d done, but what she\u2019d left undone.</p><p>He tensed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to leave.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his eyes wide with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cMy courses came,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not the reason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the reason. It\u2019s not why I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened to anger. \u201cWhat the devil are you saying?\u201d</p><p>Be strong, she told herself. Cut the line cleanly; don\u2019t dangle false hope</p><p>. \u201cI just have to leave. Gray, please don\u2019t make this harder than it is. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>His hand encircled her wrist, like a cuff. \u201cYou\u2019re damned right I don\u2019t understand. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll make it easy. Were you lying to me when you agreed to marry me? When you told me you ...\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cWhen you told me you loved me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I love you.\u201d</p><p>He swore violently. \u201cIt matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Surreptitiously, she wrestled against his grip. She kept her voice low.</p><p>\u201cGray, we can\u2019t be together. We just can\u2019t.\u201d She finally wrenched her arm from his grasp and turned away, her gaze dropping to her feet. He made a motion toward her, but the chains cut it short.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, damn it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She did. \u201cGray, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you leave me, I will follow you. And I will find you. I\u2019ve the fastest ship on the sea, and boundless determination. I don\u2019t lose what\u2019s mine.\u201d His eyes burned into hers. \u201cI will find you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t try. You won\u2019t find me. You don\u2019t even know my name.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. Good. She\u2019d struck a blow.</p><p>Soldiers took him by either arm. Gray tried to shake them off. \u201cI\u2019m not done here, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Gray,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we took you in. Your sister can visit you at the jail.\u201d He gave Sophia a cautious look. \u201cDon\u2019t know about your sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be visiting,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not his sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He winced this time, as if she\u2019d dashed saltwater in an open wound. Tears stung her eyes. She whispered, \u201cGo with them. Don\u2019t let them drag you by the chains. You wouldn\u2019t want Bel to see you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to the lady, Gray.\u201d</p><p>The men pulled him back a step, and Gray\u2019s feet moved under him. He hesitated, still staring cold fury into her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished. I will find you.\u201d Then he turned and let them lead him away.</p><p>Oh, Gray. We were finished before we began.</p><p>Miss Grayson came to her side, crying into her brother\u2019s handkerchief. Together they watched him disappear down the dock. The crowd parted around him as the soldiers marched him into a narrow street and out of view.</p><p>There, it was done. She\u2019d never hold him again. The pain of it threatened to split her in two.</p><p>\u201cWill you be coming with me, Miss ... ?\u201d Miss Grayson asked. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I never did learn your name.\u201d</p><p>Sophia turned to the young woman. The irony twisted in her heart. Hathaway, Turner, Waltham ... She might assume any identity she wished, claim any name for her own.</p><p>Any name, that is, save the one she truly wanted.</p><p>Mrs. Sophia Grayson.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>\u201cJoss. What the devil is going on?\u201d Gray shuffled into the dank cell. The guard released him from his shackles and left, clanging the door shut and securing the formidable lock.</p><p>His brother rose to greet him. \u201cEvidently, we\u2019re pirates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays Mallory, I gather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Joss sank back to a crouch and leaned against the wall. \u201cSwine went for the officers the instant we made port. I should have kept him in the brig until you arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Joss shrugged. \u201cHe kept shouting and spitting. It was damn annoying.\u201d</p><p>He swiped his cuff across his face. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d pay him any mind. Your reputation is worth gold here, quite literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Not any longer, I gather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the judge hears your side of things, he\u2019ll set us free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, he will.\u201d And he\u2019d better do it soon. She thought to leave him, did she? There wasn\u2019t anywhere she could go, on this island or from this island, that he couldn\u2019t follow her. A few hours\u2019 delay, even a few days</p><p>\u2014he\u2019d track her down. And when he did, this time he would demand some answers.</p><p>Gray looped an arm through the bars of the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s Mallory told him? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we attacked the Kestrel without provocation, destroyed her cargo.\u201d</p><p>Joss lifted an eyebrow. \u201cShot down her mast with our cannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blackguard.\u201d Gray made a fist around the bar. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I let him go down with his miserable ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I expect you were enjoying playing the hero too much. Bent on impressing the ladies, you know. How is the lovely Miss Turner, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s chest deflated. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, man, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her to marry me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joss gave a low whistle. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d Gray grabbed the bars with both hands and pushed back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about it, either, but he could hardly keep from doing so. What had frightened her? For all her brave talk, Gray was certain he\u2019d seen fear in her eyes. Was it watching him put in chains that had spurred her to flee? Perhaps she had her own reasons to avoid arrest.</p> <p>\u201cHer name isn\u2019t even Jane Turner,\u201d he said bitterly. \u201cShe\u2019s not even a governess. She\u2019s some sort of conniving little thief with six hundred pounds beneath her stays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Gray shot his brother a look. It was then that he noticed the haggard shadows on Joss\u2019s face, and the bruise purpling beneath his left eye. \u201cNo, let\u2019s talk of other things. How long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards give you that?\u201d Gray gestured toward his own eye. Joss shrugged.</p> <p>Gray released a string of oaths. \u201cWhich one was it? He\u2019ll pay for it with his life, I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down, Gray. And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t go punching yourself in the eye just to even the score.\u201d</p><p>Gray shot him a look. \u201cNot amusing, Joss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, it is. Give me credit for a joke when I make one. It\u2019s nothing, Gray. I\u2019ve had worse. You\u2019ve given me worse. And it\u2019s no more than a man can expect, I suppose, when he\u2019s an alleged pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiracy charges.\u201d Gray cracked his neck. \u201cWhat a joke.\u201d This was the voyage he\u2019d finally gone respectable, and what had it gotten him? Jilted and jailed. No good deed went unpunished.</p><p>A few hours later, the guard sauntered back down the corridor. \u201cYou\u2019ve a visitor, gentlemen. A lovely miss.\u201d</p> <p>An irrational surge of hope rose up in Gray\u2019s breast. She came back, some fool voice whispered. She wouldn\u2019t leave you.</p><p>Light footfalls sounded on the stone floor, and a figure emerged from the darkness. Of course. It was Bel.</p><p>\u201cJoss. Dolly.\u201d</p><p>She clung to the bars, and the two of them joined her from the other side.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jacob?\u201d Joss\u2019s voice was tight. \u201cHow\u2019s my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Joss. A bit taller than he was when you saw him last, and twice as mischievous. A Grayson man, through and through. He\u2019s been asking for his papa.\u201d She sniffed back tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with my friend, Mr. Wilson,\u201d Bel continued. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember him, Joss. He\u2019s the one who used to be a solicitor in London, before he devoted his life to charity.\u201d Her gaze flitted toward the guard and she lowered her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s made some inquiries. He says ... He says your situation doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Joss asked. \u201cSurely once the judge has the story from Gray, he\u2019ll not press any charges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the problem,\u201d Bel said. \u201cIt\u2019s Mallory\u2019s word against Gray\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d Joss said. \u201cAnd every crewman\u2019s aboard the Aphrodite and the Kestrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every crewman. There\u2019s someone ... an officer who just arrived today, who\u2019s taking Mallory\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrackett.\u201d Gray released a groan. \u201cThe bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other crewmen, Mr. Wilson says their testimony could be too easily disregarded, since they might face charges themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of charges could they face?\u201d Joss asked.</p><p>\u201cPiracy, for the crew of the Aphrodite. Mutiny, for the Kestrel\u2019s men.\u201d</p><p>Gray swore under his breath. No, their situation did not look good. \u201cSo we bribe the judge. Every man has his price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d Bel shook her head.</p><p>\u201cBel, this is no time for scruples. This is hanging we\u2019re discussing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it won\u2019t work,\u201d she continued. \u201cMr. Wilson knows something of this Mr. Fitzhugh. He\u2019s ambitious, Mr. Wilson says, eager to make a name for himself and obtain a better post. That\u2019s why he\u2019ll press charges on such slender evidence. He means to make an example of Gray.\u201d</p><p>Joss turned to Gray. \u201cWhy would he make an example of you?\u201d</p><p>Gray clenched his jaw. He knew precisely why. \u201cNot all privateers stopped seizing ships with the end of the war. Some of them kept right on plundering, even without letters of marque. They\u2019re pirates now, with no allegiance to the Crown. It\u2019s a problem for honest merchants. Like me,\u201d he added ironically.</p><p>Understanding lit his brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd the best way to discourage privateers from turning pirate ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs to capture the most successful privateer of them all. And hang him.\u201d</p><p>Gray turned and paced away from the door. \u201cThis Fitzhugh plans to make his career on my neck. Goddamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolly, please don\u2019t curse.\u201d Bel\u2019s voice cracked as she spoke. \u201cWe need God on our side now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems no one else is,\u201d Joss added.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s to be a sort of hearing tomorrow,\u201d Bel said. \u201cThe judge will hear testimony and decide whether he has sufficient evidence to convene a court of piracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA court of piracy?\u201d Joss repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gray said, \u201cin order to charge us, he has to summon representatives of the governor, all the way from Antigua. It\u2019s no small undertaking. He won\u2019t go to the trouble if he\u2019s not certain we\u2019ll hang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Joss said. \u201cIt would seem much hinges on tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything hinges on tomorrow.\u201d If he didn\u2019t walk free tomorrow, she\u2019d be too far away. He might truly lose her. Damn.</p><p>Bel reached for his hand through the bars. Gray accepted the comfort of her small, chilled fingers wrapped around his own.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wilson will try to intercede for you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rest of us will pray.\u201d</p><p>Gray squeezed her fingers. \u201cYou do that.\u201d If Bel prayed, God might actually listen. \u201cWhat of Miss Turner?\u201d The question was out before Gray could stop it.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d A strange look crossed Bel\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t know any Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady from the dock, Bel. What happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Bel frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered, eyes downcast. \u201cShe said someone would be meeting her, and then Mr. Wilson found me, and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she left.\u201d Gray pressed his forehead to the bars. Christ. She\u2019d truly left. She\u2019d truly left him. Until that moment, he hadn\u2019t believed she could do it.</p><p>He must have done something wrong. Perhaps he ought to have demanded her secrets. Perhaps he should have held back some of his. Or maybe ... God, maybe she\u2019d been playing him for a fool all along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bel said. \u201cI suppose she just slipped away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I lied to him,\u201d Miss Grayson said, opening the green plantation shutters to admit a sultry breeze. \u201cI\u2019ve never lied to my brother in my life.\u201d</p><p>Cringing, Sophia sat on the edge of the bed. As if all her own lies to him weren\u2019t bad enough, now she\u2019d gone and corrupted Gray\u2019s sister. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask it of you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was for his benefit. If my name reached the judge\u2019s ears today, he might not believe my story tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could the judge not believe the truth?\u201d</p><p>How, indeed. Sophia\u2019s lies were growing so numerous, even she couldn\u2019t keep them straight. But when she\u2019d assumed Sophia to be a missionary, Miss Grayson had handed her the perfect way to help Gray, as well as the perfect escape. One more day of deceit\u2014in this, her most challenging role yet\u2014and she would be done.</p><p>Miss Grayson sat down beside her. \u201cI suppose it was in service of the greater good. But the look on Gray\u2019s face when I told him you\u2019d gone ... He was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFurious, I\u2019d imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Miss Grayson said, surprised. \u201cNot angry at all, just ... disappointed, I think. His face went very grim. For all his initial resistance to the sugar cooperative, he must be attached to the idea now.\u201d She beamed at Sophia.</p><p>\u201cThat must be your good influence, Miss Turner.\u201d</p><p>Sophia thought it best to change the subject. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your bedchamber, is it? I couldn\u2019t put you out, you\u2019ve been so kind.\u201d</p><p>Gray had not been exaggerating when he described his sister\u2019s kind nature. Indeed, Bel seemed to Sophia some kind of saint. While Bel had visited her brothers in jail, Sophia had been offered a series of small miracles: a bath in fresh, fragrant, heated water; a feast of tropical fruits and risen bread and unsalted meat; a freshly laundered dress; a soft, clean bed in this bright, airy chamber. If Gray had only been with her, Sophia would have felt welcomed into Heaven.</p><p>\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t my bedchamber,\u201d Bel answered. \u201cIt was once my mother\u2019s, but no one has used it in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas your mother been gone so long, then?\u201d From what Gray had told her, she\u2019d thought Bel\u2019s mother had died more recently.</p><p>\u201cShe died a little over a year ago. But we had to move her from this room several years earlier, when she first took ill.\u201d Bel opened a door between the windows, and beckoned Sophia. \u201cCome have a look.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stepped through the door and emerged onto a stone-tiled portico framed by a Grecian colonnade. Beyond the railing, a lush, green valley fell away from the house, the hillsides blanketed with fields. In the distance, two craggy mountains framed a wedge of ocean blue. \u201cHow beautiful,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI can see all the way to the harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a lovely vista. Transporting house hold goods to the top of a mountain isn\u2019t especially convenient, but one can\u2019t complain in the face of such grandeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you move your mother to a different chamber?\u201d she asked. \u201cI should think this vista would cure all manner of ills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, for some. Though in my mother\u2019s case, the risk was too great.\u201d</p><p>She gave Sophia a melancholy smile. \u201cShe suffered an attack of brain fever, you see, when I was just a girl. She survived, in body\u2014but her mind was never quite the same. For the rest of her life, she was prone to fits of... unpredictability. For her safety, we moved her to a room facing the mountainside, below-stairs.\u201d</p><p>Sophia bent and peered down over the rail at the mossy limestone boulders below. It was a long way down. To think, Bel had grown up concerned that her mother would fling herself off this portico? If her own mother stood in the same place, she would think only of hanging draperies. Sophia felt a sudden swell of gratitude for her boring, sheltered childhood.</p><p>\u201cThe land you see below used to be my father\u2019s plantation. Now the family owns only the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you angry, when Gray sold it?\u201d</p><p>Bel turned to her. \u201cBut how would you know about\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened with understanding. \u201cAh, I can guess. My brothers are still fighting?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe did the right thing, selling the plantation. Joss would have done the same. As would I have done, if these matters were ever placed in ladies\u2019 hands.\u201d</p><p>Below them, dusk painted the valley purple with shadow. Sophia gathered the borrowed shawl about her shoulders. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. If Gray and Joss were in agreement then, why do they keep arguing now, over the sugar cooperative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do men argue over anything?\u201d Shrugging, Bel continued, \u201cI wish I\u2019d never suggested using the privateering money. My brothers have drawn such lines over the notion, and now neither will back down. It\u2019s nothing but a source of acrimony. Now the cooperative\u2019s coming to pass anyway, thanks to mission-minded Christians like you, and Mr. Wilson.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia chewed her lip. And when it was revealed that she was not a mission-minded Christian and the cooperative did not come to pass\u2014would Gray and Joss keep arguing then? But she couldn\u2019t worry about that now.</p><p>Bel asked, \u201cAre you sure we should not tell Mr. Wilson you\u2019ve arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sophia blurted out. \u201cNot if he\u2019s advising your brothers. I must seem perfectly impartial, you see.\u201d That was all she needed, for this poor Mr. Wilson to contradict her story\u2014or worse, become entangled in her deceit. Bel stared at her hands, loosely linked on the railing. \u201cHe wants to marry me. Mr. Wilson, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia felt a pang of disappointment on Gray\u2019s behalf. \u201cOf course he does,\u201d she said, forcing a playful tone, wondering how this young woman could be unaware of her beauty and its power over men. Didn\u2019t she know she might marry whomever she pleased? \u201cWhat man would not wish to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps men desire me, but desire is not a foundation for marriage.\u201d Bel crossed her arms over her breasts in a self-conscious gesture. Ah. She was not so unaware after all.</p><p>Sophia asked, \u201cDo you wish to marry Mr. Wilson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He is a kind, decent man, and we share a dedication to charity. We would make a good life together. I don\u2019t love him, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. But then, I don\u2019t wish to marry for love.\u201d</p><p>Sophia laid a hand on Bel\u2019s wrist. \u201cYou deserve to be loved. And that is all Gray wishes to give you. You needn\u2019t marry the first man to offer you companionship and a home. Your brother would gladly provide for all your needs. He wants so desperately to make you happy.\u201d</p> <p>Bel sighed. \u201cHe wants to take me to London, dress me up in silks and jewels, and parade me before the aristocracy\u2014the very people who profit from every instance of human misery on this island. How could that make me happy?\u201d</p><p>Sophia fell silent for a moment, watching the clouds turn vibrant shades of pink and orange in the glow of the setting sun. \u201cI do sympathize with you. More than you know.\u201d</p><p>Of course, she had fled England for much the same reason that Bel resisted leaving her home. Neither of them wanted to be put on display, forced into marriage at their guardians\u2019 behest. But now Sophia understood that Gray\u2019s plans had nothing to do with currying society\u2019s favor and everything to do with his deep love for his sister, and his desire to give her the best life he could. It was impossible not to wonder\u2014had her parents wanted the same for her? Had their misguided, social-climbing machinations truly been born of love?</p><p>Perhaps. But now she would never know.</p><p>\u201cMiss Grayson, please promise me one thing. After tomorrow, promise me you will sit down with Gray and tell him ...\u201d Sophia stopped. She had meant to say, tell him honestly what you\u2019ve told me, tell him all yourhopes and dreams. And then listen to him, allow him to explain hisdreams for you, for the family.</p><p>But really, there was only one thing Gray needed to hear\u2014and then the rest would fall into place. The same words that could have changed everything for her.</p> <p>\u201cTell him you love him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must promise me.\u201d</p><p>Bel smiled. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sophia squeezed Bel\u2019s arm before releasing it. Good. A sense of relief descended on her as evening turned tonight. With that promise, she felt a certainty that tomorrow everything would be set right. So long as Gray knew he had his sister\u2019s unconditional love.</p><p>Now, Sophia just needed to do her part: making sure he lived to hear it. By the break of dawn, Gray knew he was a dead man. One way or another.</p><p>He\u2019d paced the cell\u2019s perimeter all night, his thoughts circling like his feet. She was gone, he knew it. He felt it. It was still within his power to trace her, with ships and men and gold at his disposal. But dead men typically didn\u2019t have those resources.</p><p>What was he going to do? He could argue his case, make a defense.</p> <p>Morally and legally, Gray knew he was in the right. But if Fitzhugh was truly determined to make him an example, the facts mattered little. His fate would already be sealed. And Gray\u2019s fate was not just his, but Bel\u2019s, and Jacob\u2019s, and Joss\u2019s. Could he gamble his entire family\u2019s future on an attempt at freedom, on this slim hope of finding her?</p><p>Crouching to the floor, he nudged his brother awake. \u201cJoss. Joss.\u201d</p><p>Joss stirred and rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want, Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen to me. I\u2019ve been thinking about this all night. When we</p><p>\u2019re in this hearing today, I want you to let me do the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I ever have a choice?\u201d Joss stretched. \u201cI don\u2019t expect either one of us will be offered much opportunity for speech-making. Don\u2019t count on charming your way out of this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning to charm my way out of anything. It\u2019s your skin I\u2019m trying to save. I mean it Joss, not a word. There are papers, already drawn up in England. The business, the ships\u2014if I die, my will leaves it all to you. There are trusts for Bel and Jacob.\u201d Gray let his head fall back against the stone wall and rubbed his temples. \u201cHad it drawn up the same time as the partnership papers. I was hoping you\u2019d sign them this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m awake.\u201d Joss\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cWhat are you on about? Don\u2019t turn martyr on me, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t risk both of us dying, Joss. Don\u2019t you understand? Where would that leave Bel and Jacob?\u201d Gray rose and began to pace the cell with agitation. \u201cOne of us needs to walk out of here alive, for them. I\u2019ve decided to plead guilty in exchange for your freedom, and that of the crew. I\u2019ll say you objected, but I coerced you into engaging the ship. Beyond that ... you never boarded the Kestrel, Joss. They\u2019ve got no evidence against you. So just keep quiet and play along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean play dumb. You mean play the ignorant Negro incapable of thinking for himself.\u201d He drew his knees to his chest and stacked his arms atop them. \u201cIs that what you mean, Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gray stopped pacing. He looked his brother in the eye. \u201cYes, Joss. That\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Joss stared at the floor for a moment. Then he shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, no? You can\u2019t possibly say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I can. And I believe I just did.\u201d Joss stood, brushing his trousers clean as he rose to his feet. \u201cHere, let me demonstrate the possibility again. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather hang?\u201d Gray crossed the small cell in two paces, coming toe-to-toe with his brother. \u201cJoss, you have a child who needs you. A sister who needs you. Hell, I\u2019m your brother\u2014and I need you, too. I need you to take care of them for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I\u2019d never have dreamed you could be this selfish, to sacrifice your own son\u2019s security for the sake of your pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just my pride you\u2019re asking me to sacrifice. It\u2019s my dignity. My humanity, for God\u2019s sake. I\u2019d rather Jacob grow up a pirate\u2019s orphan than the son of a slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never a slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. I want my son to make his own way in the world, with his own wits and courage. What example do I give him if I swear before God and England that I can\u2019t be held responsible for my own actions?\u201d</p><p>Gray turned on his heel and strode to the far corner of the cell. He braced one arm against the wall and covered his face with the other hand, trying to concentrate.</p><p>Damn it all to hell. Joss and his stubborn, foolish pride. Gray had to convince him\u2014someway, somehow. They couldn\u2019t both die. He simply couldn\u2019t allow it to happen. The very idea of Bel and Jacob left alone in the world made his limbs go numb.</p><p>Joss cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to manage my life for years now, Gray. If you\u2019re suddenly in the mood to make a grand sacrifice, do me this favor: For once, let me be my own man.\u201d</p><p>The anger in his brother\u2019s voice stiffened Gray\u2019s spine. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me no choice in any of this. You sold my home out from under me and forced me out on the sea the first time. You knew I wanted to settle here after ... after Jacob was born, but you dragged me back out again. If I\u2019m going to die, at least let me go to my grave with a shred of autonomy.\u201d</p><p>Now Gray was angry, too. \u201cYou love the sea, Joss. I know you do. At least you did, before Mara died and took the best half of you with her.\u201d He saw his brother wince at the mention of his wife. Good. It was long past time they stopped mincing around it. \u201cWe had plans. We were supposed to be partners. You\u2019re the one who went back on his word, decided he\u2019d rather dig in the dirt and indulge this ridiculous scheme of Bel\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a ridiculous scheme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, a sugar cooperative?\u201d Gray scoffed. \u201cOne season, and you\u2019d be bankrupt. And then how is your son supposed to respect his father, the sharecropper? How is anyone going to respect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a better question. Why doesn\u2019t my own brother respect me? You\u2019ve never once trusted me to make my own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you make stupid decisions!\u201d</p><p>Joss glared at him. He took a slow breath before continuing. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because you\u2019re forcing me into a life I don\u2019t want, just to assuage your own guilt. It\u2019s because you\u2019re legitimate, and I\u2019m a bastard. It\u2019s because you</p><p>\u2019re white, and I\u2019m black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Joss. It\u2019s because we\u2019re brothers. Stop trying to make every argument about our disparities. You\u2019re my little brother, and I\u2019ve a God-given right to care about you.\u201d Gray ran both hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe had fun all those years, chasing down packet ships. Things were good between us, until Mara died. We had plans. You reneged on them and made me the villain. Is it really so terrible, that I want something better for you, for our family?\u201d</p><p>Joss blew out a breath. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so damn angry with me? For leaving with all our proceeds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor leaving at all.\u201d Joss stalked to the far corner of the cell. \u201cWhen Mara died, it was hell for me. It wasn\u2019t easy for Bel either. They were close. So Bel and I didn\u2019t leap at the chance to go off to London and leave the only home we\u2019ve ever known. Can you honestly blame us? We were grieving. We needed you, Gray. I needed you. All that huffing and storming you did, about what was best for the family ... Well, your family needed a brother, and you just left.\u201d</p><p>Gray stared at him for a moment and swallowed hard. \u201cI knew you were hurting. Don\u2019t you know it was killing me, to just stand by and watch grief eat you alive? There wasn\u2019t anything I could do, save securing our future, providing a home. Perhaps I went about it all in the wrong way, but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Joss put a hand to his face. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Gray waited until his brother looked up. \u201cJoss\u2014\u201d His voice cracked, and he tried again. \u201cNo matter how old we get, you\u2019re still my little brother. While there\u2019s breath in my body, I can\u2019t allow you to hang. Don\u2019t ask it of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all right for you to ask it of me? You\u2019re not the only one capable of brotherly affection, you know.\u201d Joss crossed the cell and stood before Gray. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, what ever happens. You do understand that?\u201d He put a hand on Gray\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know you\u2019ve always tried to do your best by me, in your own insufferable, arrogant way. You\u2019ve been a decent brother, Gray. And a damn good friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gray swore. He looked to the side, then back at his brother. \u201cFair warning, Joss. If you don\u2019t take your hand off me ... I will have to hug you.\u201d</p><p>Joss laughed. \u201cAfter that speech, I\u2019d be damn disappointed if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gray grabbed his brother in a rough embrace. Joss thumped him on the back as he hugged him close.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this talk about dying, anyway?\u201d Joss asked, pulling away with moist eyes and a sly smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve cheated death before. I reckon we\u2019ve one more life in us yet. Maybe Wilson will come up with something. Or Bel will work a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Gray heaved a rough sigh and slid down the wall until he sat on the floor, legs outstretched.</p><p>Joss joined him. \u201cI mean it, Gray. No more talk of hanging or noble sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Very well, Gray thought. I won\u2019t talk about it.</p><p>\u201cAllow yourself a moment of optimism. It\u2019s not just me and Bel and Jacob you\u2019ve got to live for, you know. There\u2019s a beautiful miss out there somewhere who\u2019d be heartbroken to see you hanged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are beautiful women all over the world who\u2019ll be heartbroken to see me hanged,\u201d Gray said dryly. \u201cBut the only one I care about is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s gone all right. Do you know, she claimed to love me. What a fool I was, to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it so hard to believe?\u201d Joss nudged Gray\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though she\u2019s the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore fool you,\u201d Gray grumbled. He let his head fall back against the stone wall and stared up at the cell\u2019s single window. Slices of bright sky winked at him from behind the rusted iron bars. It hurt his eyes to look at, but the discomfort was preferable to darkness. \u201cTo fall in love now, of all times... after I\u2019ve successfully avoided it all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoided it? To the contrary, I think you\u2019ve conducted a rather thorough search of the globe for it.\u201d</p> <p>Gray thought on this for a minute. Damn, he hated it when Joss was right. It was just as well she\u2019d left. He knew what he had to do today; it would only have been harder, had she stayed. Still, as always, he regretted what he\u2019d left undone. Unsaid.</p><p>\u201cI never told her I loved her. What an ass I am. No wonder she left. I mean, I told her in a dozen different ways, but I never said the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they so hard to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but ... I don\u2019t know. They shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Gray shook his head. \u201cDo you know, that fifteen-year-old boy had the courage to say in front of the whole crew what I couldn\u2019t bring myself to whisper in the dark? He\u2019ll make a fine officer someday, Davy Linnet. Got bigger stones than either of us, I\u2019d wager.\u201d</p><p>Joss snorted. \u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupted in Gray\u2019s chest. God, he was going to miss Joss. He hoped his brother could forgive him one day, for betraying his trust this last time.</p><p>\u201cJoss.\u201d Gray swallowed the lump rising in his throat. \u201cI love you. What ever happens, I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>Joss propped an elbow on Gray\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear it. But I knew that already\u2014never had a doubt in my mind, actually. I\u2019d imagine she knows you love her, too. You\u2019ll have a chance to say the words.\u201d</p> <p>Gray rubbed his temples. What could he say? He had but a few days left in this world, and no hope of seeing her in the next. But he had to keep up the illusion of optimism, for Joss\u2019s sake. \u201cSupposing I did find her? What if I tell her I love her, and she still walks away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you there. There aren\u2019t any guarantees in love. I know as well as anyone how fleeting it can be.\u201d</p><p>Gray winced, knowing that Joss referred to Mara.</p><p>Joss fell silent for a moment, then continued in a low voice, \u201cYou may not be able to hold on to her forever. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret trying. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gray felt tears burning at the corners of his eyes. He sniffed and looked away quickly, searching his mind for something witty and irreverent to say. He was saved the effort when Joss spoke again.</p><p>\u201cThat girl loves you, Gray. We\u2019re going to get out of this, and when we do</p><p>\u2014I\u2019d bet a hundred sovereigns to one, Sophia will be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia?\u201d Gray blinked. \u201cHer name is Sophia?\u201d</p><p>Joss chuckled. \u201cI was right. You didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Gray scratched the back of his neck. \u201cBut how did you? Since when have you known her name?\u201d</p><p>Joss shrugged, his expression composed. \u201cSince sometime yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at Gray\u2019s befuddled silence. \u201cWhen you dropped your trousers to take a piss. It\u2019s painted on your arse.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>\u201cThe Aphrodite hailed us, so we approached. Backed our sail, prepared to speak. Bastards had us right where they wanted us. Before my officer even called out our port of origin, he\u201d\u2014Mallory jabbed a finger at Gray across the courtroom\u2014\u201cwas blowing our mainmast away. You\u2019ve only got to look at my ship to find proof enough of that.\u201d</p><p>Judge Fitzhugh nodded gravely. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s teeth ground like millstones. At this rate, they wouldn\u2019t need a hanging. The effort required to hold his tongue in the face of these scurrilous falsehoods\u2014it was likely to kill him.</p><p>But he had to remain composed. Argument served no purpose now. Whether he dangled at the end of a rope or imploded from sheer irritation, the result would be the same. It all ended here. Here in this stifling chamber with its weathered paneling and scent of decay. In this very room he\u2019d been awarded scores of prizes, stolen his entire fortune from the unfortunate merchants who chanced to cross the Aphrodite\u2019s course. He\u2019d bartered his soul in this court. There was a strange justice to it, that his life should be traded here, too.</p><p>\u201cWell, he boarded the Kestrel,\u201d Mallory continued, sneering at Gray. Beneath the table, Gray\u2019s hand balled into a fist. \u201cHim and his men. He had me bound in ropes, took command of the ship, and raided my cargo.\u201d</p><p>Fitzhugh cocked an eyebrow. \u201cAnd all this with no provocation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsover.\u201d</p><p>Gray tightened his fist until his knuckles cracked. Behind him, the crewmen of the Aphrodite and Kestrel grumbled loudly in protest. With a sharp look over his shoulder, he quelled the dissent.</p><p>Next to him, Joss nudged Mr. Wilson. \u201cLying bastard. Ask him about the storm,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe fire. The rum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Gray cleared his throat. \u201cHe\u2019ll only spin more lies. And this court isn\u2019t interested in the truth. No more than it was when we brought in ships we\u2019d seized. Judges in this court care only for the prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no prize at stake here,\u201d Joss argued.</p><p>\u201cOh, there is. It\u2019s just not a ship.\u201d</p><p>The judge finished his questioning of Mallory, then turned to Gray. \u201cMr. Grayson, please stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss,\u201d Gray murmured. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have forced you into taking the Aphrodite. It\u2019s my fault you\u2019re here, and I\u2019m going to fix it. Take the money, do what ever makes you happy. Sell the ships, plant sugarcane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d Joss whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t do something stupid, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Grayson,\u201d Fitzhugh called out, impatient. \u201cYou will stand.\u201d</p><p>Gray whispered to his brother, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything stupid. For once, I\u2019m doing something right.\u201d He pushed back his chair and stood, bringing himself to eye level with the judge seated at the elevated bench. Fitzhugh couldn\u2019t have been much older than Joss. Sallow, thin, and sweating profusely from under his wig, he appeared ill-adjusted to the tropical climate. He had the look of a boy in a man\u2019s attire\u2014a boy who\u2019d been on the losing end of many a schoolboy brawl. Presumably in an attempt to appear older, or perhaps wiser, he affected an overly stern mien that belonged to a caricature. But it was the look in Fitzhugh\u2019s eyes that amused Gray. Anticipation, laced with awe. No doubt the judge had heard tales about him; Gray\u2019s privateering success had been a matter of local pride.</p><p>Gray didn\u2019t expect the measure of reverence in Fitzhugh\u2019s gaze would work to his advantage, however. Rather, he suspected it would make the judge all the more eager to see Gray brought low. He was the seafaring equivalent of the school bully, and this was Fitzhugh\u2019s chance to finally beat one down.</p><p>Just to provoke him further, Gray spoke first. \u201cThis is an informal hearing, I understand. This court has no power to convict on charges of piracy.\u201d</p><p>Fitzhugh\u2019s eyes narrowed within their round wire frames. \u201cNot alone, Mr. Grayson. It does, in concert with the governor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would be most displeased to be summoned from Antigua without sufficient cause.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Fitzhugh replied, \u201cThat is the purpose of this hearing today, Mr. Grayson. To establish sufficient cause.\u201d The judge scowled at him, and Gray nearly laughed. For all his facial acrobatics, Fitzhugh had already ceded control of their conversation. The courtroom was Gray\u2019s to command.</p><p>He relaxed his posture and allowed himself a grin. \u201cYou look familiar to me, Mr. Fitzhugh. I believe we must have met at Oxford?\u201d</p><p>The judge harrumphed. \u201cI sincerely doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Not an Oxford man, then. Cambridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Edinburgh. I suppose now the war\u2019s over, the Admiralty\u2019s relaxing its standards?\u201d Gray studied him. \u201cStill, your face is so familiar to me. Did we meet in Town? At White\u2019s, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Fitzhugh\u2019s mouth thinned to a line. \u201cNot that it\u2019s of any relevance, but I am certain we have never been introduced, Mr. Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a member of White\u2019s then? Pity. Well, I must be mistaking you for someone else.\u201d He watched a flush seep out from beneath Fitzhugh\u2019s wig.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, I\u2019ve been friendly with every judge to pass through this post in recent years, and I see no reason you should be different. I trust we may speak as gentlemen, seeing as how this is an informal proceeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand your predicament, Mr. Fitzhugh. A great deal of wealth changed hands in this courtroom once. Plenty of excitement, during the war. A judge could build a reputation on it, not to mention a fortune. But now... what sort of matters come before you? Insurance claims? Difficult to distinguish yourself with those cases. Your superiors are likely to forget about you completely. You may find yourself in this post for the remainder of your days.\u201d He chuckled at Fitzhugh\u2019s chagrined expression. \u201cOh, don\u2019t despair. With luck, a fever will take you before you die of boredom.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rippled through the courtroom. The judge rapped his gavel until the assembly hushed. \u201cMr. Grayson. You stand before this court accused of piracy, a hanging offense. You will refrain from making speeches and allow me to pose the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m to be hanged, where\u2019s the benefit in decorum?\u201d When the next wave of laughter faded, Gray lowered his voice and approached the bench. Contempt glimmered in the judge\u2019s eyes. Good. He\u2019d be only too eager to see Gray dead. \u201cI know what you want, Fitzhugh. I\u2019ll give it to you. I\u2019m prepared to plead guilty to all your charges. You can build your career on my grave, claim your promotion, and return to England. I still doubt they\u2019d allow you in White\u2019s. But the questions, and the charges, begin and end with me. Do we understand each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll plead guilty. To piracy.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll put on a show if you like, to make things interesting. In the end, you\u2019ll have your hanging. But only one. Once I\u2019ve admitted fault, you\u2019ll call an end to this \u2018informal proceeding,\u2019 and everyone else in the room walks free.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fitzhugh smiled. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your word. And if you cross me, by God I swear I\u2019ll hunt you down in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word. Do I have yours?\u201d</p> <p>Gray gave him an easy grin. \u201cMy word as a gentleman.\u201d He stepped back from the bench and addressed the courtroom. \u201cEverything Captain Mallory testified is the truth.\u201d</p><p>An outcry rose up among the men. Fitzhugh banged his gavel to no avail, until Gray motioned for silence.</p><p>It took great effort to ignore the look of betrayal in Joss\u2019s eyes. But ignore it he did.</p><p>\u201cI hailed the Kestrel as a friendly vessel. I boarded the ship without permission. I took command of her crew. I shot her mast down with a cannon. And I destroyed a large part of her cargo.\u201d Gray ticked off the facts on his fingers. \u201cAll truths. If those actions make me a pirate, then I\u2019m a pirate.\u201d Gray spoke over a chorus of objections. \u201cAnd neither I, nor the honorable Mr. Fitzhugh\u201d\u2014he swept the room with a meaningful glare\u2014\u201ccare to hear any argument to the contrary. Do you follow me?\u201d</p><p>He looked his men in the eye\u2014O\u2019Shea, Quinn, Levi, Stubb, and all the others, right down to Davy\u2014until they absorbed his meaning and the obedience he demanded. He kept his jaw firm, shoulders squared, gaze unwavering. Not even a blink. The bravado came to him easily enough, when the actual dying was weeks away. There would be time enough later for trembling. Then he would be alone.</p> <p>He turned back to face the bench. \u201cNow then, Mr. Fitzhugh, you have your pirate. Do you suppose we can conclude these proceedings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well ...\u201d Fitzhugh coughed. \u201cIn light of your testimony, Mr. Grayson, which is supported not only by Captain Mallory\u2019s account but by that of your own first mate, Mr. Brackett, I find sufficient cause to hold you on a charge of piracy, a crime against the Crown. Arrangements will be made for your trial.\u201d</p><p>The room was silent, save for the cackling laughter of Mallory. \u201cGrayson, I</p><p>\u2019m going to dance on the day that you swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he swings, I swing with him.\u201d Joss rose to his feet.</p><p>Gray drilled his brother with a glare. \u201cJoss, no.\u201d Sit down, damn you.Think of our sister. Think of your son.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the captain of the Aphrodite.\u201d Joss\u2019s voice rang through the courtroom. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for the actions of her passengers and crew. If my brother is a pirate, then I\u2019m a pirate, too.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s heart sank. They would both die now, he and his idiot of a brother. Joss walked to the center of the courtroom, the brass buttons of his captain\u2019s coat gleaming as he strode through a shaft of sunlight. \u201cBut I demand a full trial. I will be heard, and evidence will be examined. Logbooks, the condition of the ships, the statements of my crew. If you mean to hang my brother, you\u2019ll have to find cause to hang me.\u201d</p><p>Fitzhugh\u2019s eyebrows rose to his wig. \u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me.\u201d</p><p>Gray groaned at the sound of that voice. He didn\u2019t even have to look to know that Davy Linnet was on his feet. Brave, stupid fool of a boy.</p><p>\u201cIf Gray\u2019s a pirate, I\u2019m a pirate, too,\u201d Davy said. \u201cI helped him aim and fire that cannon, that\u2019s God\u2019s truth. If you hang him, you have to hang me.\u201d</p><p>Another chair scraped the floorboards as its occupant rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAnd me.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. O\u2019Shea now?</p><p>\u201cI boarded the Kestrel. I took control of her helm and helped bind that piece of shite.\u201d The Irishman jutted his chin at Mallory. \u201cSuppose that makes me a pirate, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Fitzhugh\u2019s eyes lit with glee. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>Over by the window, Levi stood. His shadow blanketed most of the room.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNow, Levi?\u201d Gray pulled at his hair. \u201cSeven years in my employ, you don\u2019t say a single goddamned word, and you decide to speak up now?\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell, now they were all on their feet. Pumping fists, cursing Mallory, defending Gray, arguing over which one of them deserved the distinction of most bloodthirsty pirate. It would have been a heartwarming display of loyalty, if they weren\u2019t all going to die.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Gray recognized Brackett\u2019s voice. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing but lawless brigands, just as I said!\u201d</p><p>Fitzhugh banged his gavel over and over, as though he were cobbling together a new bench up there. \u201cSilence!\u201d His voice cracked with the shout.</p><p>\u201cSilence, all of you! I will have order!\u201d</p><p>Eventually, a lull in the mayhem occurred\u2014not precisely a pause, but rather a collective drawing of breath, that the yelling might continue. The judge took advantage of the moment, leaping to his feet and indiscriminately throwing his gavel into the crowd. This proved a far more effective use of the implement. The screech of pain from Mallory ripped through the chaos, and all swiveled to face its source.</p><p>\u201cAnyone\u201d\u2014Fitzhugh\u2019s breath heaved, and his wig was askew\u2014\u201cwho participated in the unlawful seizure of the Kestrel will be condemned as a pirate and made to pay with his life. I\u2019ll hang the whole lot of you, you miserable, bloody louts!\u201d</p><p>This, Sophia took as her cue.</p><p>With a parting squeeze of Miss Grayson\u2019s hand, she stepped into the courtroom. Lifting her voice, she called out, \u201cThen you will have to hang me, too.\u201d</p><p>Ah, now it was silent. Only silk and crinoline had the temerity to whisper as she advanced to the center of the courtroom.</p><p>My, how she\u2019d missed this. Making an entrance.</p><p>Sophia smoothed one gloved hand over her rose silk skirt, guiding it around the furniture. How glad she was now, that she had surrendered trunk space to vanity and brought this gown with her. Extravagant beauty did come in useful, in emergencies such as these.</p><p>She felt the men\u2019s stares on her as she glided through the crowd, chin lifted, carriage erect. It was tempting to meet their gazes, favor each of her friends with a warm smile. She resisted, however, saving her practiced debutante\u2019s blush for the only man who mattered.</p><p>The pale, gawping man in a wig.</p><p>\u201cYour honor,\u201d she said sweetly, holding her skirt out with one hand as she made a smooth curtsy.</p><p>\u201cWho ... who are you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia saw at once Mr. Fitzhugh would serve perfectly. Young and pale; rather unattractive and exceedingly awkward. A man with little confidence or experience where ladies were concerned. Gentlemen of his sort were easily led, easily deceived.</p><p>But then, deceit was not her purpose any longer. Today she would finally tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cI am Miss Sophia Jane Hathaway, of Kent. And, from what I understand of these proceedings, it would seem that I am a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, miss. A pirate?\u201d</p><p>Sophia toyed with the neckline of her bodice. \u201cYou did say that anyone who participated in the seizure of the Kestrel would be hanged as a pirate?\u201d</p><p>The judge swallowed, then nodded.</p><p>She moved her hand up to stroke the delicate skin of her throat. \u201cMy Heavens. Then you shall have to hang me, too. Perhaps my execution will not advance your career as some others\u2019 would, but this is of little consequence in the pursuit of justice. Am I right, your honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied, incongruently nodding in agreement. His gaze jerked up from her throat to her eyes. \u201cEr ... that is to say ...\u201d</p><p>Sophia cocked her head and frowned. \u201cYou will need to question me, I presume? Obtain my testimony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>When the silence proved no questions were forthcoming, she offered,</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should simply begin at the beginning?\u201d</p><p>He sighed gratefully. \u201cThat would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>And now\u2014only now\u2014she allowed herself a glance at Gray. She\u2019d done her best to resist looking in his direction, even though his presence had pulled at her like a magnetic force from the moment she\u2019d entered the room. She felt precisely where he was, understood exactly how many degrees she must turn her neck to meet his gaze.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t counted on how difficult it would be to turn away. There were a hundred emotions churning in his eyes\u2014questions and accusations, and pleas and promises, too\u2014and now her own eyes welled with tears. Stop this. You have a whole life ahead of you to cry. With a bracing sniff, Sophia turned back to the judge. \u201cMr. Grayson has given you an accurate, yet incomplete account of events.\u201d She pulled out an embroidered handkerchief and hastily dabbed at her eyes before pressing it to her d\u00e9colletage. \u201cI hope your honor will permit me to acquaint you with more of the truth.\u201d</p><p>Just not quite all of it.</p><p>\u201cAs I told you, my name is Sophia Jane Hathaway, though the men in this room know me as Jane Turner. My father, Mr. Elias Hathaway, is a gentleman of considerable wealth and modest consequence. I traveled under an assumed name because I left England without his permission. Or knowledge.\u201d Guilt pricked at her heart. The anxiety her family must have endured. Perhaps by now they believed her dead.</p><p>Fitzhugh squinted at her through his spectacles. \u201cYou were running away?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was to be married, you see. To a man I did not love.\u201d</p><p>It was clear in the judge\u2019s expression that he did not see. \u201cYou were to be married against your wishes. So\u2014logically\u2014you absconded, unescorted, with the aid of these brigands, to the West Indies.\u201d He glared at Gray.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I shall add kidnapping to the charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! You misunderstand.\u201d Sophia chewed her lip. Why was telling the truth so much more complicated than lying? She hardly knew how to explain the reasoning that had taken her from \u201cI cannot marry Toby\u201d to \u201cI must board a ship bound for Tortola.\u201d At the time, it had made some sense to her, in her desperation. Now she saw what anyone in his right mind could see: that she should have simply broken her engagement.</p><p>But then, as now, the truth had been so much more difficult than a lie.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, neither Captain nor Mr. Grayson knew my true identity. I led them to believe I was a governess, en route to a new post.\u201d Sophia took a step closer to the bench, placed one gloved hand upon the lip of wood and leaned toward him in confidence. Fitzhugh fidgeted with his wig, clearly both unnerved and flattered by her nearness. Very good.</p><p>She made her voice breathy and reverent. \u201cYour honor, I sense that you are a man of principle, and ambition. I believe you can understand this, that I sought some greater purpose to my existence. I wanted to experience real life, find my true passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d He swallowed. \u201cFind your ... er, passion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She smiled beatifically. \u201cMr. Grayson showed it to me.\u201d</p><p>A low murmur rippled through the courtroom. Sophia ventured a quick glance at Gray. Gone were the accusations and questions in his gaze; all that remained to him was blank confusion. Well, that and his roguish good looks. But to her, everything was finally clear. She\u2019d wanted to experience real life\u2014but how could she, until she ceased running away from it? This was her life, and no one else\u2019s. This was her story to tell, her picture to paint.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fitzhugh,\u201d she said, \u201cmay I tell you about the seizure of the Kestrel? I watched it all from the deck of the Aphrodite that day.\u201d At his nod, Sophia continued. \u201cThere was a terrible gale. The clouds were churning and green as the sea, and just as the two ships approached, the sky cracked with lightning. It struck the Kestrel\u2019s mainmast, setting the tip afire. With no regard for their own safety, Mr. Grayson and a few of his bravest men boarded the ship to help. Their aim was to aid the Kestrel\u2019s stunned crew in cutting away the mast before the flames reached the deck. But there was no time, and with a hold full of smuggled rum, the ship was certain to explode.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fitzhugh hung on her words, though his eyes seemed fixed to her bosom. \u201cAnd ... ?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Grayson sent all able men away in the boat, save Mr. Linnet.\u201d She searched out Davy\u2019s smooth face in the crowd. \u201cAnd together they shot down the mast with the Kestrel\u2019s own cannon, dousing the fire in the sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d the judge whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs it not?\u201d Pride brought a smile to her face. \u201cIt was the truest act of valor I have ever witnessed. Mr. Grayson saved many lives that day. Including the life of Captain Mallory, who now has the malicious cowardice to accuse innocent men of piracy rather than lose his own ship as salvage.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia leaned closer. \u201cDo you know, Mr. Fitzhugh, that Captain Mallory would have denied his injured crewmen medical attention, when a port was only a few days\u2019 sail away? This is why Mr. Grayson seized the Kestrel, sending his own ship ahead with the wounded. If that be an act of piracy, then he is the most honorable pirate to ever live. And as I also joined the crew that seized the Kestrel, I am proud to declare myself a pirate, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou joined the crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I became ship\u2019s cook. They were undermanned, you see.\u201d Sophia loosened one glove and removed it, revealing her calloused, knife-scored hand. \u201cYour honor, I am a gentlewoman. I have never performed such labor in my life, but I was glad to do it to help these men. My life changed the day of that storm. I shall never be the same again.\u201d In more ways than youwould suspect, she thought with some amusement. But the statement was the truth.</p><p>She turned to Gray, who wore a half-smile of his own. It was a comfort to know they still shared something, if only a private joke.</p><p>\u201cEven now, this innocent man would sacrifice himself to save his brother and crewmen from the hangman\u2019s noose. Mr. Grayson\u2019s courage and fortitude are an example to me,\u201d she said, dabbing at her eyes with the handkerchief. \u201cThey should be an example to us all.\u201d</p> <p>Oh come now, Gray\u2019s smirk chided her. Don\u2019t take it too far.</p><p>\u201cAn example ...\u201d Fitzhugh spoke in a slow tone of discovery. \u201cOf honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a liar!\u201d Mr. Brackett pushed to the front of the room, carving his way through the assembly with his blade-thin nose and sharp elbows. \u201cShe\u2019s a liar and a whore. They\u2019re lovers, she and Grayson. Her whole story is a falsehood, fabricated to save his miserable neck.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s heart seized. The crowd held its breath. Please don\u2019t ask it, she silently implored the judge. It felt so good to finally stand before Gray, these men, the world, and tell the truth. Could she bring herself to deny him now, even to save his life? Please, just don\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hathaway?\u201d The judge adjusted his spectacles and peered at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat, precisely, is the nature of your relationship with Mr. Grayson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy ... relationship?\u201d Turning away, Sophia closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again. I\u2019m sorry, she mouthed to Gray. He gave her a barely perceptible nod, his expression hard. He was wiping all emotion from his face, expecting her denial.</p><p>She had to say it; she had no choice. \u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>Surprise melted the ice in his gaze. Soon his eyes were shining with approval. Approval, and love.</p><p>Her heart soared. For this one moment, they loved each other, and the rest of the world could go hang. \u201cI love him,\u201d she repeated, simply because she could. Because it was the truth.</p><p>Now the truth was out, suspended in the humid silence\u2014a sketch of it, at least. It still remained within Sophia\u2019s ability to shade it. Collecting herself, she took advantage of the stunned pause. \u201cAs is my Christian duty, your honor. To say I felt anything less for him would be not only a falsehood, but a sacrilege.\u201d</p><p>The judge scratched his wig.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brackett protested. \u201cShe\u2019s a liar, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I speak only the truth. What motive do I have to lie?\u201d</p> <p>Sophia tugged on her glove, working her fingers into the slender tips.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I have come to care deeply for many of the men in this courtroom. But anyone who would insinuate that I give this truthful testimony in hopes of resuming some relationship with Mr. Grayson, friendly or otherwise, would be mistaken. I esteem the man, your honor. I admire him greatly, and his example of honesty and courage has altered the course of my life. But beyond today, I do not expect to ever meet with him again.\u201d</p><p>Gray took a step forward. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia froze him with a look. \u201cYes, Mr. Grayson, I mean that my mission here has already been completed.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, clearly baffled. Adorably so.</p><p>\u201cSince leaving England, I have resolved to never marry,\u201d she said, directing her statement at the judge, \u201cbut to devote my fortune to charity. I have twenty thousand pounds, you see\u2014or I shall have in a matter of days, when I reach my majority. It was to have been my dowry, but this very morning I have pledged it toward the purchase of Eleanora plantation from Mr. George Waltham, to establish a sugar cooperative for freedmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sugar cooperative?\u201d Gray and Fitzhugh spoke as one.</p><p>There. Now Gray and Joss had nothing further to argue over, no years-old dispute to drive them apart. They could start over, sit down and discuss their future with open minds and open hearts. It was likely too late for Sophia\u2019s own family, but she could not pass up this chance to heal theirs.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wilson and Miss Grayson can provide you with any evidence you may require on that matter.\u201d She folded her handkerchief. \u201cAs for me, I fear I must be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing?\u201d Again, Gray and Fitzhugh spoke in unison, and each glared at the other, clearly annoyed.</p><p>\u201cNow that my mission has been completed, I must return to England. I have given only earnest money, you see, some six hundred pounds. The rest of the transaction must be completed in London. And I ... I must return to my family, though I do not know how they will receive me. After this adventure, I doubt I shall be received by even my closest friends. Most certainly not by the likes of Mr. Grayson\u2019s family.\u201d He had to understand this, the reason she must leave.</p><p>\u201cMr. Grayson\u2019s family?\u201d the judge asked.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? Your honor, he is the nephew of a duke. I played cards with his aunt, the Duchess of Aldonbury, every third Wednesday.\u201d She gave Gray a cautious look. \u201cHer granddaughter, Lady Clementina Morton, was at school with me. I was even so fortunate as to be a guest in their home, your honor, but that is not a plea sure I shall ever have again. Her Grace is a lady of elevated rank and limited forgiveness. Were I the ambitious sort, Mr. Fitzhugh, I should not wish to cross her.\u201d</p><p>The judge blanched to the color of parchment.</p><p>Sophia busied herself with the cord of her reticule. \u201cNo, I shall be ruined in society\u2019s eyes, though my conscience is clear. I must go home and throw myself on the mercy of my family. If they spurn me ...\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I shall become a governess.\u201d</p><p>A sense of satisfaction filled her. Yesterday, she\u2019d planned to lie\u2014to walk into this courtroom and pretend to be the sort of honest, selfless woman who could have helped Gray\u2019s cause. Now she had given everything\u2014her fortune, her reputation, her future\u2014to make it the truth. Not just to save Gray</p><p>\u2019s life, but to redeem hers.</p><p>What a fool she\u2019d been, always blaming the world for not seeing the person beneath the vast fortune. The truth was, she\u2019d spent her life afraid\u2014hiding behind wild lies and fantasies\u2014because she hadn\u2019t believed in herself, in her own value.</p><p>That all ended today. Here, in this courtroom, the truth was worth something. She was worth something. The world was welcome to shun her now. For the first time in a long while, Sophia liked herself. She would have no regrets.</p><p>She turned a slow circle, letting her gaze linger on each of her friends one last time. \u201cI sail for Antigua immediately, where I understand I may board an English frigate.\u201d Her gaze settled on Gray. \u201cSo this is good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded. Of course, now that he understood everything\u2014how her past would inevitably poison his family\u2019s future\u2014he was letting her go.</p><p>\u201cFarewell, then. Unless ...\u201d She addressed Fitzhugh with perfect innocence. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t really mean to charge us all with piracy?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>Sophia smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>Whether one strolled the park or traveled the globe, the journey home invariably seemed shorter than the journey abroad. It felt only a matter of hours before the Polaris crossed the Tropic, although Sophia knew days had passed. Very little fanfare had accompanied the occasion: a bit of singing among the sailors, a collection of shillings in a tarred cap, to which she contributed from her dwindling purse.</p><p>Perhaps the subdued celebration could be credited to the scarcity of passengers aboard the frigate. She was accompanied only by the ship\u2019s supercargo, and the widow and two grown sons of an Antiguan planter. However, Sophia thought it more likely that the character of the captain, the perpetually dour Captain Herring, was to blame. As herrings went, he seemed to be of the kippered variety.</p><p>No, the Polaris was not the Aphrodite, nor even the Kestrel. And for this, perhaps Sophia ought to have been grateful. In an atmosphere of camaraderie and merriment, her melancholy might have drawn notice. But if anyone took note of her remote behavior or persistently moist eyes, it was only to suggest a remedy for cold.</p><p>If only there were a cure for heartache.</p><p>On fine afternoons like these, she spent long hours staring out over the sea. She had no more paper or canvas; even her little trunk of paint and brushes had been left behind. But it soothed her, blending pigments in her mind to capture the ever-shifting colors of the waves: today, a base of Prussian blue, tinted with cobalt green. The same shade would be reflected in his eyes, if Gray were there with her. She could almost imagine he was. Almost.</p><p>Sophia shook her head, dismayed. It would seem she\u2019d finally discovered the limits of her vivid imagination.</p><p>Still, whenever a sail appeared on the horizon, a ridiculous hope bloomed in her heart. She peered out over the waves, anxious to glimpse the profile of the ship, the style of its rigging. Any square-rigged ship spurred an irrational acceleration of her pulse. When a closer view\u2014or the ship\u2019s disappearance over the curve of the earth\u2014proved it was not the Aphrodite, she would chide herself for her foolish tears.</p><p>He knows the truth now, she told herself. He understands everything.And he has let you go.</p><p>When a sail appeared this afternoon, her ordeal was mercifully brief. The ship sighted at their stern quickly revealed itself to be a schooner, its large, triangular sails jutting up from the sea like a row of shark\u2019s teeth. As the ship drew closer, unease spread through the crew like a contagion.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like it,\u201d the first mate said. \u201cThe way she\u2019s bearing down on us, as if she were in pursuit. If they want to speak, why don\u2019t they fire a signal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat colors is she flying?\u201d the captain asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a Baltimore-built ship, to be sure. Could be privateers, though, sailing under a Venezuelan flag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot flying any colors that I can see,\u201d the officer reported, squinting into his spyglass. \u201cShe\u2019s heavily armed, riding high on the waves. Can\u2019t be much cargo to speak of in that hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPirates.\u201d The captain let out a string of oaths. Not particularly imaginative ones, but uttered with conviction nonetheless. Sophia drifted toward the stern, drawn by the sight of the jagged sails slicing toward them.</p><p>\u201cShe has the advantage of the wind, Captain. Gaining fast. Still no colors, but I can almost make out the name of the craft. Hold there ... she\u2019s tacking to the wind. Ah.\u201d He lowered the spyglass. \u201cNamed the Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave a queer flip. No. It couldn\u2019t be. Surely it was merely oneof life\u2019s cruel coincidences. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShall I send up the alarm, Captain? Ready the cannon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sophia cried.</p><p>The captain and officer turned on their heels to face her.</p> <p>\u201cI ... I believe I may know this ship, sir.\u201d She looked to the first mate.</p><p>\u201cMight I borrow your spyglass?\u201d</p><p>She took it from his hand without waiting for permission, then fitted it to her eye and looked sharp toward the horizon. There it was, the schooner. Through the narrow lens, she stared down the ship\u2019s prow. Scanning the sails, the rigging, the deck. The jib blocked her view, drat it. There, they tacked the sails and the ship pivoted slightly. She could almost make out the figure of a man on the quarterdeck.</p><p>Beside her, the first mate shifted his weight. \u201cBeg pardon, miss, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi!\u201d A towering figure came into focus. It had to be Levi, so impossibly large. She directed the spyglass up to the rigging, searching ... searching... Quinn. There was no doubt in her mind. The man had hams where his fists should be.</p> <p>A shot boomed across the waters, and Sophia jumped. \u201cNo,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t fire! They\u2019re not pirates.\u201d She swiveled to face the first mate.</p><p>\u201cThat is ... they may be pirates, of a sort. But I promise you, they\u2019re no threat to this ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was only their signal shot, miss.\u201d The first mate called over to the captain. \u201cDo we wish to speak with them, sir?\u201d</p><p>The captain grumbled, \u201cWhether we wish it or not, it appears they\u2019re determined to speak with us. Square the yards and come about, then.\u201d</p><p>The whole ship began a slow, creaking pirouette, and Sophia went dizzy with anticipation. Had he truly come for her? She supposed Levi and Quinn could have taken employment with another ship. Perhaps Gray wasn\u2019t even aboard. Despite her best efforts to remain calm, she could not help pinching a blush to her cheeks and smoothing back stray locks of hair. If only there were time to change her gown.</p> <p>The officers strode toward the bow of the ship now, and Sophia hurried after them. The forecastle was crowded with curious sailors, obstructing her view of the clipper as it drew near.</p><p>\u201cAhoy!\u201d a seaman called out. \u201cThe English frigate Polaris, ten days out from Antigua, bound for Portsmouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhoy, yerself!\u201d It was O\u2019Shea\u2019s rough brogue. She\u2019d never heard sweeter music. \u201cThis be the clipper Sophia, of no particular country at the moment. Seven days out from Tortola, bound for ... well, bound for here. Captain requests permission to board.\u201d</p><p>Gray. It had to be Gray.</p><p>The officers of the Polaris exchanged wary looks.</p><p>\u201cOh, for Heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Sophia pushed forward to the ship\u2019s rail and cupped her hands around her mouth, calling, \u201cPermission to board granted!\u201d</p><p>A cheer rose up from the other ship\u2019s deck. \u201cIt\u2019s her, all right!\u201d a voice called. Stubb\u2019s, Sophia thought.</p><p>Oh, but she hardly cared who was on the other deck. She cared only for the strong figure swinging across the watery divide as the two ships came abreast. Turning back toward the center of the ship, she pushed her way through the sweaty throng of sailors, desperate to get to him. Her foot caught on a rope, and she tripped\u2014</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t matter. Gray was there to catch her.</p><p>And he was still wearing those sea-weathered, fire-scarred boots. No doubt for sentimental reasons.</p><p>\u201cSteady there,\u201d he murmured, catching her by the elbows. She looked up to meet his beautiful blue-green eyes. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gray.\u201d She launched herself into his arms, clinging to his neck as he laughed and spun her around. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>And he was. Every strong, solid, handsome inch of him. Sophia buried her face in his throat, breathing in his scent. Lord, how she\u2019d missed him. She pulled away, bracing her hands on his shoulders to study his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you came after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you actually left.\u201d He lowered her to the deck, and her hands slid to his arms. \u201cI thought you were bluffing with that bit. I\u2019d have never allowed you to go.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a word in that courtroom that wasn\u2019t true. I didn\u2019t want to lie to you anymore, Gray. Even if we can\u2019t be together... I just couldn\u2019t leave without telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says we can\u2019t be together?\u201d His brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cSurely you must understand. I\u2019m ruined, most thoroughly. You\u2019ve worked so hard to regain your family\u2019s place, you have such hopes for your sister. If you marry me, all those plans will be ruined, too. I couldn\u2019t ask it of you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fell to his lapel, and she lowered her voice. \u201cUnless ... I could stay on as your mistress, perhaps. If we kept the arrangement quiet, it would not reflect on Bel. It\u2019s what the ton will expect of me, now that I\u2019m a fallen woman.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and lifted her face. \u201cDon\u2019t ever speak of yourself that way.\u201d His voice was fierce; his gaze, intent. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ever refer to yourself as my mistress again. I will have you as my wife, or nothing.\u201d</p><p>She let her hands fall to her sides. \u201cThen I suppose it will have to be nothing.\u201d</p><p>Gray swore. \u201cDo you honestly believe I\u2019ve chased you out to the middle of the ocean for nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about your aunt, your connections? Your sister\u2019s prospects\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe only prospects Bel cares about are the prospects of ministering to flea-bitten orphans, of which I\u2019ve assured her London has plenty. She\u2019d only agree to come with me after I promised not to give her a debut. If she marries at all, she\u2019ll likely marry some Quaker, or maybe a pitiful war invalid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself.\u201d Gray nodded toward the deck of his ship. Yes, there she was. The dark-haired young lady gave a friendly wave. Sophia suddenly became aware of how many people were watching them, on both ships. She cleared her throat. \u201cAnd what of your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoss? He\u2019ll be bringing the Aphrodite to England, once he takes care of her cargo. After that, he\u2019s thinking of studying law. I\u2019ll manage the shipping business, Bel will have her charities. The family will be together; that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMr. Wilson\u2019s agreed to manage your sugar cooperative, in case you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>Hope fluttered in her chest. \u201cAre you sure you want to marry me? I\u2019m quite destitute now, you realize.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cLook at that ship. That clipper cost me a queen\u2019s ransom, even with the Kestrel thrown in the bargain. But it was the fastest ship to be had.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cForget money. Forget society. Forget expectations. We\u2019ve no talent for following rules, remember? We have to follow our hearts. You taught me that.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her to him, drawing her hands to his chest. \u201cGod, sweet, don</p><p>\u2019t you know? You\u2019ve had my heart in your pocket since the day we met. Following my heart means following you. I\u2019ll follow you to the ends of the earth if I have to.\u201d He shot an amused glance at the captain. \u201cThough I\u2019d expect your good captain would prefer I didn\u2019t. In fact, I think he\u2019d gladly marry us today, just to be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday? But we couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows lifted. \u201cOh, but we could.\u201d He pulled her to the other side of the ship, slightly away from the gaping crowd. Wrapping his arms around her, he leaned close to whisper in her ear, \u201cHappy birthday, love.\u201d</p><p>Sophia melted in his embrace. It was her birthday, wasn\u2019t it? The day she\u2019d been anticipating for months, and here she\u2019d forgotten it completely. Until Gray had appeared on the horizon, she hadn\u2019t been looking forward to anything.</p><p>But now she did. She looked forward to marriage, and children, and love and grand adventure. Real life and true passion. All of it with this man. \u201cOh, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease say yes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSophia.\u201d The name was a caress against her ear. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and pulled away. \u201cI\u2019ve been remiss in not telling you. You can\u2019t know how I\u2019ve regretted it. But I love you, Sophia Jane Hathaway. I love you as no man ever loved a woman. I love you so much, I fear I\u2019ll burst with it. In fact, I think I shall burst if I go another minute without kissing you, so if you\u2019ve any mind to say yes, I\u2019d thank you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia flung her arms around his neck and kissed him. Hard at first, to quiet the fool man; then gently, to savor him. Oh, how she loved the taste of him, like freshly-baked bread and rum. Warm and wholesome and comforting, with just a hint of spice and danger. \u201cYes,\u201d she sighed against his lips. She pulled back and looked into his eyes. \u201cYes, I will marry you.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened about her waist. \u201cToday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday. But you must let me change my gown first.\u201d Smiling, she stroked his smooth cheek. \u201cYou even shaved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day since we left Tortola.\u201d He gave her a rueful smile. \u201cI\u2019ve a few new scars to show for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m glad. And I don\u2019t care if society casts us out for the pirates we are, just as long as I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll be cast out, exactly. We\u2019re definitely not pirates. After your stirring testimony\u201d\u2014he chucked her under the chin\u2014</p><p>\u201cFitzhugh decided to make the best of an untenable situation. Or an unhangable pirate, as it were. If he couldn\u2019t advance his career by convicting me, he figured he\u2019d advance it by commending me. Awarded me the Kestrel as salvage and recommended me to the governor for a special citation of valor. There\u2019s talk of knighthood.\u201d He grinned. \u201cCan you believe it? Me, a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I believe it.\u201d She laced her fingers at the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve always known it, although I should curse that judge and his \u2018citation of valor.\u2019 As if you needed a fresh supply of arrogance. Just remember, what ever they deem you\u2014gentleman or scoundrel, hero or pirate\u2014you are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am.\u201d He kissed her soundly, passionately. \u201cAnd which would you prefer tonight?\u201d At the seductive growl in his voice, shivers of arousal swept down to her toes. \u201cYour gentleman? Your scoundrel? Your hero or your pirate?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI imagine I\u2019ll enjoy all four on occasion. But tonight, I believe I shall find tremendous joy in simply calling you my husband.\u201d</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers. \u201cMy love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>LONDON, FIVE WEEKS LATER</p><p>Sophia did not expect anyone to come calling today. They\u2019d made their quiet arrival at Gray\u2019s town house just a few days ago, and the only two letters she\u2019d posted\u2014one to her mother, the other to her sister\u2014had thus far gone unanswered. It was too soon to hope for a reply.</p><p>Yet there Hurst stood in the doorway, a card on his salver. \u201cA caller for you, ma\u2019am. Lady Lucinda Trescott, the Countess of Kendall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is you!\u201d Lucy angled around the manservant, pushing her way into the salon. \u201cI heard you were back, but I couldn\u2019t believe it until I saw for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Kendall.\u201d Astonished, Sophia rose to her feet, as did Bel. \u201cAllow me to introduce my sister-in-law, Miss Grayson. However did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we to be so formal then? Must I call you Lady Grayson?\u201d With a polite nod to Bel, Lucy crossed the room and caught Sophia in an exuberant hug. \u201cJeremy heard word of your husband\u2019s commendation. That\u2019s how I knew you were here.\u201d She surveyed Sophia from head to toe. \u201cNow tell me, wherever have you been?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo visit your cousins, actually.\u201d Sophia\u2019s attention shifted to the strange bump obstructing their embrace. \u201cLucy, you\u2019re with child!\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Lucy pulled Sophia\u2019s hand against her rounded belly, placing her own hand on Sophia\u2019s flat stomach. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not. At least, not discernibly.\u201d</p><p>No, not discernibly. Sophia smiled, keeping her suspicions to herself.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lucy said, \u201cthat will disappoint the gossips.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of gossip, Sophia cringed. \u201cLucy, you shouldn\u2019t even be here. A countess can\u2019t be associated with such scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScandal? Your husband\u2019s to be knighted. They\u2019re making him out to be Lancelot, Robin Hood, and Lord Nelson all rolled into one. You\u2019ll be guests of honor at every table in London.\u201d Lucy craned her neck to peek into the corridor. \u201cWhere is this living legend, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray? He\u2019s at his shipping office.\u201d Sophia directed her friend to a chair. \u201cBut even if he is to receive a commendation, surely I will not be welcome at those dinner tables. I\u2019m ruined, most thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you broke your engagement?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I eloped with a fictional Frenchman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Gervais?\u201d Lucy laughed. \u201cOh, no one knows about that. Your parents told everyone you\u2019d taken ill and been sent to the seaside to recover. There may have been a few rumors to the contrary, but the fact that you fell into mad, passionate love with a heroic sea captain corroborates the tale quite nicely. You did fall into mad, passionate love with him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded, numb with disbelief. Could it be true? Her parents, her sister, her jilted betrothed, her friends ... they had all kept her escape secret?</p><p>\u201cOh, I knew it!\u201d Lucy clapped her hands. \u201cYou must tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another day.\u201d Sophia cast a glance at Bel.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Lucy whispered, following her gaze. \u201cThe story is that good, is it? Well, I suppose it will keep for another visit.\u201d She gave Sophia an appraising look. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been ruined, I must say it suits you. You look very well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd breeding suits you. You are radiant.\u201d</p><p>Lucy made a dismissive wave, but the assessment was true. While Sophia would never have called her friend a great beauty before, she merited the term now. The pregnancy rounded off Lucy\u2019s sharp angles, and her dark-brown hair positively gleamed. The maid entered, bearing a tray laden with tea service and refreshments.</p><p>\u201cIsabel, would you be so good as to pour?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>While the young lady busied herself with teacups, Sophia drew her chair closer to Lucy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHow is Toby?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he never said a word about Gervais, when he had every motive to humiliate me publicly and demand restitution. Was he horribly hurt when I left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich answer are you hoping to hear? That he has endured great agony for love of you, or that he has forgotten you already?\u201d Lucy laid a hand over Sophia\u2019s. \u201cHe has suffered, but I believe his pride incurred a deeper wound than his heart. Regardless, he is too good to humiliate anyone or make demands. He and Felix searched all England for you. You had us quite anxious, you know.\u201d</p><p>Guilt pinched in Sophia\u2019s chest. \u201cHow you all must hate me.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy squeezed her hand. \u201cHow grateful we all are to have you safely home. I\u2019m certain your family will feel the same. How could they complain? They\u2019ll have a title in the family now, just as they always wanted.\u201d</p><p>Bel interrupted their conference, a teacup and saucer balanced in either hand.</p><p>\u201cMiss Grayson,\u201d Lucy asked, accepting her teacup, \u201care you to have a debut this Season?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Bel handed the other cup to Sophia.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should reconsider.\u201d Sophia perked, thinking of the possibilities. \u201cWe had thought a formal presentation imprudent,\u201d she told Lucy, \u201cgiven my situation. But if the scandal has truly been contained ... Bel might look as high as she wishes. She could even marry a lord, should she so desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to marry a lord,\u201d Bel protested.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Lucy reached for a teacake. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as amusing as it sounds. People have such wearying expectations. Ever since my husband took up his seat in Lords, it\u2019s been one thing after another. I\u2019m always being asked to subscribe to Lady Thus-and-so\u2019s charitable society or purchase vouchers for some benefit musicale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Bel sipped her tea, looking pensive.</p><p>\u201cJeremy gives me more money than I know what to do with, so naturally I support them all. But worse, people are continually asking my opinion on lofty topics ... as if I understand tariffs or navies. I try to smile and change the subject, but they insist on assigning me a ridiculous amount of influence, simply because my husband\u2019s stared down a few fusty members of Parliament.\u201d Lucy took a bite of cake. \u201cWhat ever you do, don\u2019t marry a lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat interesting advice.\u201d Bel put down her teacup.</p><p>Sophia touched Bel\u2019s wrist. \u201cWe\u2019re only teasing. You shall marry for love. Your brother would not have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is so, than I doubt I shall marry at all,\u201d Bel said. \u201cMy heart is already so full, with devotion to my family and passion for God\u2019s work. There cannot be room for romantic love, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heart is not the only organ involved.\u201d Lucy gave Sophia a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I could be persuaded to marry,\u201d Bel continued, \u201cif I could find a man of consequence and principle, who possessed a keen sense of justice and shared my passion for charity ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you do find such a man,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cBut, Bel ... to have a happy marriage, two people must share a passion for something other than charity.\u201d</p><p>Bel looked up. \u201cTruly? Like what?\u201d</p><p>Lucy broke into laughter, and Sophia could not help but join her.</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Bel insisted, looking from one to the other. \u201cTell me what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Grayson, never fear,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWe will expand your education.\u201d She looked to Sophia. \u201cYou do still have The Book?\u201d</p><p>Sophia choked on her tea. Under no circumstances would she permit Gray\u2019s sister so much as a glance at that book\u2014not after the way she\u2019d illustrated it.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she hedged, avoiding Lucy\u2019s inquisitive look, \u201cyou see, it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The house keeper saved her, thank goodness.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon, my lady. There\u2019s an urgent matter requiring your attention.\u201d Mrs. Prewitt gave a cryptic nod and disappeared into the corridor.</p><p>With relief, Sophia muttered her excuses to Lucy and Bel as she rose to her feet. By the time she reached the hallway, however, the house keeper had disappeared. Frowning, she wandered toward the rear of the house. Perhaps there was some problem in the kitchens, or with the coal delivery?</p><p>As she passed the door to Gray\u2019s study, a familiar, muscled arm shot out into the corridor, catching her by the waist.</p><p>Laughing, she stumbled into the room, quickly finding herself caught between cool walnut paneling at her back and the hot, solid wall of man before her. Ever since their wedding\u2014or since the Kestrel storeroom, more likely\u2014Gray seemed to find it an irresistible challenge, to catch her unawares in an unlikely location and pull her into a feverish embrace. Sophia had no wish to discourage the habit, but this wasn\u2019t the ideal time for a tryst.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she chided between kisses, \u201cwhat are you about? The house keeper said there was an urgent matter requiring my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so there is. I require your attention. Most urgently.\u201d His hands slid to her bottom, and he lifted her easily, pinning her to the wall with his hips. The beaded ridges of the wainscoting dug into her spine. \u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019ve used this room yet,\u201d he murmured, nibbling at the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m entertaining,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he said, grinding against her. \u201cHighly entertaining.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sighed with pleasurable frustration. \u201cI mean, I have a guest. Lady Kendall\u2019s in the salon, with Bel.\u201d She levered her arm against his chest, carving out some space between them. \u201cAnd I thought you were at your shipping office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well ...\u201d Mischief gleamed sharp in his eyes. \u201cI decided to go riding instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiding? To where?\u201d</p><p>Relaxing his grip on her bottom, he slid her downward until her toes met the floor. \u201cOut to Kent.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. There wasn\u2019t any reason for him to go to Kent, not unless he meant to visit\u2014</p><p>\u201cGray, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d His expression turned to seriousness. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, sweet. I know you wrote to them, but ... I felt I owed your father that much, to pay a call and face matters straight on. It\u2019s the man\u2019s way, you understand.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a lump of anxiety forming in her throat. She wouldn\u2019t have asked him to call on her father, but she understood why he had. It wasn\u2019t just the man\u2019s way, it was the honorable thing to do\u2014and therefore, she knew Gray couldn\u2019t have done otherwise. He truly was the best of men.</p><p>With unsteady fingers, she smoothed the lapel of his coat. \u201cDare I ask how you were received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarily, at first. Then somewhat belligerently.\u201d His eyebrow quirked. \u201cBut my reception improved markedly, once I extended the invitation to a dinner party with my aunt.\u201d</p><p>A rueful smile curved Sophia\u2019s lips. Yes, that would be her parents\u2019 reaction. They\u2019d dine with the Devil himself, if a duchess were in attendance. \u201cThey are dreadful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIsn\u2019t everyone\u2019s family? I doubt your father and I will ever be great friends, but we did discover one interest in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Strong fingers cupped her chin. \u201cWe both want to see you happy. We both love you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Sophia did not trust herself to speak. Relief and joy swelled within her, until there was room for nothing else.</p><p>His lips brushed hers in a gentle kiss. \u201cAm I forgiven, for not telling you first?\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes. Forgiven, cherished, treasured, adored. Loved, beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she said coyly, tracing the line of his jaw with her fingertips. \u201cSo long as you will extend me the same forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cHave you been keeping secrets again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d Smiling, she took his hand and pressed it meaningfully against her gently rounded abdomen. \u201cA very, very tiny one.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
