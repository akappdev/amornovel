After everything we\u2019ve been through, she didn\u2019t even call or leave me a note. My thoughts keep drifting back to the day after we kissed on the bridge and afterward how she told me that she loved me. I\u2019d gone over to her house the next morning, ready to talk about it\u2014talk about us\u2014hoping she hadn\u2019t changed her mind overnight, after she\u2019d sobered up.</p><p>When I climbed up that tree and ducked into her room, all I found was an empty bed. She was gone and that was worse than just dealing with an Ella in denial over her feelings for me. I knew she loved me even if she wouldn\u2019t admit it, and I could handle that if it meant she was still in my life. But having her gone, missing from my life, having no idea where she was, was like losing my arm\u2014or my heart. And right now, I feel like I\u2019m verging on that that place again.</p> <p>The cab driver is moving at a snail\u2019s pace down the road that leads to the secluded neighborhood Ella and I have been living in and it\u2019s driving me crazy. He actually looked at Lila, Ethan, and me like we were the ones who were insane when we\u2019d hopped into the cab and I told him to drive as fast as possible, not worrying about the speed limit.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you drive any faster at all?\u201d I ask, thrumming my fingers on top of my legs. \u201cWe\u2019re barely moving.\u201d</p><p>He shoots me a dirty look through the rearview mirror. \u201cI\u2019m driving the speed limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s okay,\u201d I say, leaning forward toward the plastic window dividing the front of the cab from the back.</p><p>\u201cMicha, relax.\u201d Lila touches my arm, trying to calm me down. Her blond hair and red dress are damp from her jump with Ethan off a cliff into the ocean. They were having fun while we waited for Ella to show up. We all should be having fun. But now I\u2019m being stood up.</p> <p>Stood up. Shit.</p><p>I slam my palm against the plastic, losing my cool, something I rarely do, but all I keeping thinking about is that she ran. Again. \u201cI swear to God, you need to press down on that gas pedal or else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha,\u201d Lila hisses, her blue eyes firm on me as she grabs my arm and jerks it away from the plastic window while the cab driver narrows his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not helping.\u201d</p><p>I rake my fingers through my hair and then undo the top button of my shirt because it\u2019s suffocating me. Lila hits redial on her phone, trying to call Ella for the hundredth time, but it goes straight to her voicemail. Ethan\u2019s hardly said anything, but I know what he\u2019s thinking\u2014that I should have expected this. Except that\u2019s the thing he doesn\u2019t get. Yes, Ella does this kind of stuff a lot but it\u2019s because she\u2019s either scared or confused or hating herself. It\u2019s what she\u2019s done since we were kids. I know this, just like I know that no matter what, we\u2019ll end up together.</p><p>Finally, the cabbie pulls up in front of the small single-story house I\u2019ve shared with Ella since earlier this year. I don\u2019t even bother waiting for the car to come to a complete stop before I shove open the door. I toss a few bills through the slot in the window and stumble over my boots as I step out onto the curb. Ethan shouts at me to settle the hell down, but I shrug him off and jog across the lawn, stomping over the flowers tracing the path to the front door.</p><p>I remember when we first came to look at the house. My mom knew a Realtor in San Diego and she said she could hook us up with a cute house we could rent for dirt cheap, due to the fact that the owner was an old woman who bought it back when houses were affordable. Ella and I had taken our time wandering around looking at the small bedrooms, the narrow but decent kitchen, and the wide backyard. I could tell Ella was pretending that she was uninterested, but I could see it in her eyes that she loved the house.</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d I\u2019d asked, nudging her with my shoulder as she stared at the yellow shutters decorating the front of the house.</p><p>She\u2019d nonchalantly shrugged, but bit her lip, which meant she was trying to suppress her enthusiasm. \u201cIt looks like a house.\u201d</p><p>I moved up behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist, stifling a smile as I dipped my mouth toward her ear. \u201cA house you could see yourself living in?\u201d</p><p>She dithered and then amusement laced her voice. \u201cWell, me yes, but you I\u2019m not so sure. Maybe we\u2019ll have to find another place for you. Or better yet, you could always live in the garage.\u201d</p><p>I pinched her ass and it made her squeal. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re not picturing all the many places in it that I could fuck you,\u201d I whispered hotly in her ear.</p><p>She shuddered and I knew right then that it would be our first home. We moved in a week later and everything has been going good for the last sixth months. I\u2019ve been working on recording an album in a small studio near here, playing in concerts with a lot of musicians who are similar to me, playing anywhere we can just to get the chance to play while Ella works at an art gallery and goes to school, wearing my engagement ring on her finger. She seemed happy and even content when we decided it was time to actually have the wedding. I\u2019ll admit I would have rather had it back home where my mom could come to it, but Ella and I decided we\u2019d have the wedding here, just she and I, and tell everyone later because it seemed to make Ella more at ease about the idea of getting married. It wasn\u2019t really a big deal to me, not to have anyone there but Ella, me, Ethan, Lila, and the minister. I mean, I haven\u2019t talked to my dad since I gave him my blood and marrow, so I wouldn\u2019t have even invited him to begin with. But I know my mom\u2019s going to flip when she finds out we got married without her... or she would have flipped anyway. Now I\u2019m not so sure there\u2019s even going to be a wedding.</p><p>Shaking the damn thought from my head, I make my way to the house. I unlock the front door and hurry inside, scanning the living room for a sign that Ella\u2019s bailed. Everything looks normal, but then again, when she ran the first time, she barely took any of her stuff.</p><p>I go to the back door and check out the grassy yard and deck, but both are empty. My hope is dissipating as I walk past the empty bathroom and into our bedroom, pressure in my chest building at the thought that she\u2019s gone. She left me. Shit. But when I push the door open, I jump back, shocked by the sight of her. She\u2019s sitting on the bed, overwhelmingly gorgeous in a white-and-black wedding dress, her legs pulled up to her chest, her chin resting on her knees, her auburn hair pinned up in tangled curls. The bottom of the dress is pulled up over her feet, revealing that she\u2019s wearing black combat boots, not heels like a lot of girls would. It almost makes me smile because I couldn\u2019t picture her looking more perfect and more like herself if I tried.</p> <p>But when she looks up at me, her big green eyes filled with so much sadness, it rips the approaching smile off my face. I don\u2019t say anything as I make my way to the unmade bed, maneuvering over the pile of discarded clothes, sketchings, and my guitar, and then I sit down beside her. Reaching forward, I sweep strands of her auburn hair out of her eyes and tuck them behind her ear, then trace a line with my finger up and down her cheekbone. I wait for her to speak first, because I don\u2019t know enough about what\u2019s going on in her head to know what the right thing to say is.</p><p>We sit for what feels like forever, staring at each other, and the longer it goes on the more nervous I get about what she\u2019s going to say when she finally does speak. I hear Ethan and Lila walk up to the door, talking under their breath, but the sounds of their voices quickly fade as they leave right away, like they sense that we need to be alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Ella says, finally breaking the silence. She lets out a deep sigh as she peers up at me through her eyelashes, biting her bottom lip.</p><p>I fight the urge to close my eyes against the sting in my heart. \u201cWhat happened? I thought...\u201d I cup her cheek with my hand, telling my unsteady voice to shut the hell up. \u201cI thought we both wanted this.\u201d</p><p>Her bottom lip springs free as she releases it, and then she lifts her chin off her knees and sits up. \u201cWe did... I do... It\u2019s just...\u201d She releases a frustrated breath and flops her hands against the mattress.</p><p>Pressure releases in my chest and confusion takes its place. \u201cI don\u2019t get it... You didn\u2019t show up and you wouldn\u2019t answer your phone... I thought you...\u201d I have to battle to stay composed because it\u2019s one of my biggest fears: that she\u2019ll run and leave me. It\u2019s probably pathetic, but I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t need anyone else bailing out on my life, especially not Ella.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Micha,\u201d she utters with wide eyes. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t talk to you until I thought of the right thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me about what?\u201d My voice cracks with fear and I clear it.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you about the wedding.\u201d She looks around like she\u2019s hunting for an escape route, but ultimately her eyes land back on me. \u201cI talked to your mom the other day\u2014she called me asking if I knew anything that you wanted for your birthday, and she also wanted to know if we were coming home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows in surprise. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s nice I guess... but what does that have to do with skipping out on our wedding?\u201d</p><p>She gives a disheartened sigh. \u201cShe asked if we\u2019d set a date yet for the wedding yet. I didn\u2019t know you hadn\u2019t told her we were just going to get married here, without anyone.\u201d</p><p>My fingers stiffen on her cheek. \u201cDid you tell her we were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m a pro at lying.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh. \u201cNot really, but we can pretend for now.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, her lips twitching to smile. \u201cStop making jokes. I\u2019m trying to be genuinely serious and honest right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... serious and honest?\u201d I question with doubt, grinning amusedly at her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s weird.\u201d She pauses, her chest nearly busting out of the top of her dress with each ragged breath. \u201cI think...\u201d She shifts her body, tucking her legs underneath her as she gets to her knees. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d Her eyelashes flutter as she stares at the sunlight through the window. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to say this,\u201d she mutters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I scoot forward on the bed, shoving the bulky material of her dress out of the way and getting close to her. \u201cPretty girl, whatever it is, you can say it. You can say anything to me. You know that.\u201d I just hope to God it\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking. That she\u2019s changed her mind. That she doesn\u2019t want to get married.</p><p>She tilts her head and our gazes meet. \u201cI know, but it doesn\u2019t make it easier for me to say it. You know it\u2019s hard for me to say how I\u2019m feeling.\u201d</p><p>I stroke the inside of her wrist with my thumb. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d I\u2019m trying to remain calm, but it\u2019s hard. She\u2019s scaring the shit out of me, especially since I have no idea what the hell she\u2019s trying to say. I thought we had all this behind us. The day she put that ring on her other finger was the happiest day of my life and I thought I\u2019d have many more happy moments with her to come, but now I\u2019m worried I jumped to conclusions.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s really hard for me to admit what I want sometimes,\u201d she continues, squeezing her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI know it is,\u201d I say. \u201cBut like I said, you can tell me anything, even if it\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids lift up, her pupils shrinking as they hit the light. \u201cI know and I think... I think we should just...\u201d Her hand trembles in mine as her words rush out of her. \u201cI think we should go home and have a normal wedding with our families.\u201d She presses her lips together and holds her breath.</p><p>I remain motionless, fighting to keep my laughter in, because I know it\u2019s going to piss her off, but eventually it gets to me and it slips out. \u201cOh my God.\u201d I nearly choke, wrapping my arm around my stomach. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha.\u201d She pinches my chest through my shirt. \u201cStop laughing. I\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I know you are.\u201d I continue to laugh and the longer it goes on, the more irritated she gets, until finally she gathers her dress and scoots toward the edge of the bed to leave. I quickly circle my arms around her waist and draw her back down on the bed. She flops onto the mattress and I fold my body over hers, fighting through the bulky fabric to get close to her. As I press up against her, she tries to squirm out from under me, pressing her hands against my chest, but I pin her arms to the side of her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, Micha,\u201d she says hotly, but I can tell she\u2019s working really hard to stay angry with me. \u201cI was trying to tell you how I feel and you laughed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I did and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I suppress my laughter the best I can. \u201cBut you\u2019re too fucking adorable for your own good.\u201d</p><p>She scowls. \u201cI\u2019m not adorable and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you tell me things like you want to have a wedding with our families and are nervous about it, you\u2019re fucking adorable.\u201d I dip my head down and gently kiss her cheek. \u201cI love you and we can get married wherever, however, and whenever you want, just as long as we get married and you never ever stand me up again.\u201d</p><p>She pouts out her glossy bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I just panicked.\u201d</p> <p>I nip at her bottom lip because it\u2019s too delicious to resist. \u201cNext time, please just talk to me. Or at least send me a text.\u201d I kiss her again, then put a small amount of space between our bodies so I can look her in the eye. \u201cA simple S.O.S or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she says, but still seems anxious.</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all that this is about?\u201d</p><p>She swiftly nods. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s something in her green eyes I don\u2019t like, a familiar look that used to dwell there when we were growing up. Sadness, combined with fear and worry. I open my mouth to press her about it, but she arches her back and brings her mouth to mine. I distractedly kiss her, slipping my tongue deep into her mouth as all thoughts of abandonment and fear momentarily fade away.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the best ending to getting stood up on my wedding day. If only I could convince myself that there will be no more bumps in the road, but I worry about the look in her eyes and going home to get married. I\u2019m worried about Ella. Even though things have been really good between her and her father and brother, sometimes during her phone conversations with them, one of them ends up bringing up the past and I know it upsets her. They\u2019re not trying to be hurtful. In fact, I have to give her father props for how much he\u2019s changed, although it still pisses me off that he ever let things get that bad. Let his daughter feel the blame for her mother\u2019s death to the point where she thought about taking her own life.</p><p>But he\u2019s been better about stuff and I remind myself that if Ella can have a nice version of her dad now, then she should have it. And she\u2019s been doing well, too, but she sometimes still struggles with depression and her fear of commitment. And I worry that it\u2019s the fear of commitment that is behind what just happened. That she\u2019s just stalling because she\u2019s not ready to marry me. And that maybe she really doesn\u2019t want to marry me.</p><p>Chapter 2</p> <p>Ella</p><p>I\u2019m trying to stay as calm as possible over the fact that I\u2019m about to permanently seal my future, admit that I actually have a future, and give part of me to someone else. I\u2019ve never been a fan of thinking far into the future, of thinking about what will happen when I get older, where I\u2019ll be. I avoid these kinds of thoughts mainly out of fear of what I\u2019ll see\u2014who I\u2019ll become\u2014and most of the time I just don\u2019t think I really deserve a future. But I don\u2019t want to be that girl who\u2019s so terrified of her past, who she is and the things she\u2019s done, that she can\u2019t move ahead in life. I don\u2019t want to be stuck motionless in a world crammed with self-loathing. I want to be strong, be someone who\u2019s worthy of love, who does things for the people they love.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d arrived at that place, but then the box showed up in the mail yesterday, sitting on my doorstep like an omen, from some guy named Gary Flemmerton, a name I don\u2019t recognize, but what I did recognize was what was in the box\u2014stuff that belonged to my mother. My thoughts got jumbled. I ended up doing something stupid. I stood Micha up at our wedding, not because I don\u2019t love him. I do. So, so much. But I\u2019m confused. About the box. About what\u2019s inside it\u2014the journal my mother wrote, her drawings, photos of her. It was her life, stuffed in a box, revealing things I never knew about her, like things that she drew or wrote.</p><p>I should be happy I got to discover some of her past. But for some reason discovering this just painfully brought up the past and it made me question my future. I started thinking about where I was going in life. Where will I be in five years? Will I be mentally healthy? Where will Micha and I be in our lives? Will we still live in San Diego? Will he still be playing music? Will I be working in an art gallery or selling my art? Will he still love me? Will we be happy? Will we have kids? The last thought is scary. I\u2019ve never pictured myself as a mom and the only memories I have of my mom are the ones where I\u2019m taking care of her. I don\u2019t want to do that to my own kids, make it so they take care of me.</p><p>On top of the panic over my future, I started feeling guilty that we were having a wedding without Micha\u2019s mom at it. I could picture her getting upset, especially since she was the one who pushed us to get engaged. Micha would end up feeling bad, because that\u2019s what he does when someone feels hurt. Plus, there\u2019s this one other thing... something that I know sounds crazy, but I sort of want my mom nearby but the only way it\u2019s possible is to have the wedding in Star Grove where she\u2019s buried.</p><p>My mind was made up by the time Micha came back to the house but seeing him sort of unwound all the confused knots inside me. I\u2019m still trying to sort through my thoughts, but I decide to take it one step at a time. After I get out of my dress and put on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, I start packing up my stuff to go back home to Star Grove to have our wedding. I put the box with the journal into a large duffel bag to read later when I think I can handle it, along with my mother\u2019s sketchings and the wedding band I bought Micha.</p><p>\u201cI think we should get married on Christmas,\u201d Micha announces as he exits the closet with a bag in his hand. He took his tux off and put it in the black bag so we can drop it off at the rental store. He now has on a pair of faded jeans, a black T-shirt, his black leather watch, and boots. As sexy as he looked in the tux, I prefer him this way because he looks like my Micha. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect day,\u201d he adds, setting the black bag down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d I say, pressing the fluffy wedding dress into the bag while trying to zip it up. It\u2019s actually Lila\u2019s dress. She leant it to me after we snuck into her parents\u2019 house and took it out of her closet. I also got to meet her mother during our little trip and the woman seems like a real bitch. I remembered the time Lila showed up at my house crying and it all started to make sense why she showed up that night at my house in Star Grove over a year ago in tears. But it\u2019s been a few days and she\u2019ll barely talk about it and I\u2019m not the kind of person to force people to have heart-to-hearts. \u201cBut do we really want to share our anniversary day with another holiday?\u201d I ask</p><p>\u201cI like that you\u2019re thinking in advance.\u201d Micha drops his duffel bag on our bed and prods me with his elbow to move out of the way. Seconds later, he has the bag zipped up and the dress securely inside it. \u201cBut still, Christmas also marks the anniversary of when we got engaged.\u201d He looks down at the ring on my finger. \u201cIt\u2019ll be one year since I gave you that.\u201d</p><p>I lift my hand up in front of me and the black stone glimmers in the light, which highlights the scratches, marks, and dings. The beauty. Perfection. The meaning. \u201cI like the idea of a Christmas wedding I guess, just as long as we don\u2019t have to have tacky Christmas decorations, like Santa\u2019s and reindeer or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have whatever kind of decorations that you want,\u201d he says as he drapes the black bag with the tux over his shoulder and then collects our bags. \u201cJust as long as you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too easy on me.\u201d I lower my hand to my side and smile, even though my nerves make my stomach roll. \u201cBut it\u2019s a deal. A Christmas-day wedding with no Christmas decorations.\u201d</p><p>He looks happy as he embraces and kisses me and then we go outside into the cool ocean air and put our bags next to Micha\u2019s 1969 Chevelle SS. He then runs back inside to get his keys because he left them on the counter. I stare at the inflatable Santa across the street waving at me, or maybe it\u2019s just the wind blowing him around. There\u2019s hardly a breeze here though, and nothing compared to the winter wonderland I\u2019m willingly about to go back to. Star Grove. My hometown. The place where I broke apart and was put together again. The place that holds so many memories, both good and bad. I hope it\u2019s worth it. I hope nothing bad happens. I hope this trip will finally hold only good.</p><p>For some reason, I\u2019m doubtful and the longer I stand there in the driveway, staring at the Santa, the more anxious I get. Finally Micha comes out of the house with Lila right behind him, heaving her suitcase down the steps and up the path. Micha kisses me when he reaches me, then unlocks the trunk and sets Lila\u2019s suitcase inside.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to ask your dad to walk you down the aisle?\u201d Lila asks cheerfully as I hand Micha my suitcase.</p><p>Micha looks at me curiously, waiting to hear my answer as he drops my bag into the trunk.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an aisle.\u201d And I don\u2019t want my dad to walk me down it. Yeah, I don\u2019t mind him at the wedding, but I don\u2019t want him to be the person who guides me to the finish line when he wasn\u2019t that great for most of the journey.</p><p>Lila places her hands on her hips and narrows her blue eyes at me. \u201cOh, there\u2019s going to be an aisle. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Micha laughs as he tosses Lila\u2019s suitcase into the trunk. \u201cI think she means business, pretty girl.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to tell him to shut up when Ethan exits the house with his bag in his hand, squinting against the sunlight. \u201cAre you two sure you don\u2019t want to just drive down to Vegas and elope?\u201d he gripes as he approaches us, then chucks Micha his duffel bag. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to see my mom or dad or Star Grove\u2014I\u2019ve been enjoying my space from both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, come on. Let them be. They deserve a beautiful wedding not an elopement in a tacky fake church.\u201d Lila glides her hand up the front of his chest, stands on her tiptoes, and kisses his neck. Then she whispers something in his ear as she plays with his hair.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit they make a cute couple, especially now that Lila has this whole grunge thing going. Her blond hair is chin length and streaked with black that matches Ethan\u2019s hair. She\u2019s wearing jeans and a tank top that aren\u2019t name brand like everything she used to wear when we were living together. Her style goes well with Ethan\u2019s laidback look: his plaid shirt and faded jeans and a pair of sneakers that he\u2019s probably owned since he was sixteen. And Lila\u2019s average height allows her to nestle her head against Ethan\u2019s chest comfortably. Looking at them with the sunlight and my house in the backdrop, I find myself wishing I had time to draw them.</p><p>After a lot of kissing and whispering in Ethan\u2019s ear, Lila convinces him to stop complaining and he begrudgingly agrees that Vegas is a ridiculous idea and that Micha and I should get married in Star Grove.</p><p>\u201cA week is not a lot of time to prepare a wedding,\u201d Lila declares, pulling her sunglasses over her eyes. \u201cNot a real one with decorations, flowers, dresses, tuxes, and guests. God, I wish we had more time to plan this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wish you wouldn\u2019t take any time to plan it,\u201d I say, and when she frowns I sigh. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just not into wedding stuff.\u201d I round the car to the passenger side of the Chevelle, trailing my finger across a few dings and chips in the black paint that were put there when Micha intentionally crashed it into the snow bank.</p> <p>Micha opens the driver door and steps back so Ethan can climb into the backseat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what kind of wedding we have,\u201d he says, \u201cjust as long as Ella\u2019s there with me. In fact, we don\u2019t even need dresses and tuxes. We could even be naked and standing in my backyard and I\u2019d be okay.\u201d He winks at me over the roof of the car. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re together, I\u2019ll be happy and being naked would just be an added bonus.\u201d</p><p>This makes Lila giggle as she ducks her head and hops into the backseat with Ethan. I push the seat back, get in the car, and shut the door, then pull the visor down to block the sunlight.</p><p>Micha adjusts the driver\u2019s seat before he closes the door and starts the engine. \u201cSo is everyone ready for this?\u201d He looks around at the three of us, but when his eyes finally land on me I know he only really cares about my answer.</p><p>It takes me a second to answer and he notices my hesitation and his expression starts to fall. But even though my throat feels dry I manage to say, \u201cOf course.\u201d My voice trembles a little.</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d Giving me a small but slightly forced smile, he backs down the driveway and drives toward the highway, toward home where all of this started. Where Micha and I first met, first talked, first played, kissed, fooled around, danced, said I love you.</p><p>Where Micha and I began.</p><p>We drive down the dark, desolate highway for hours, the moon a bright orb against the black sky and the trees on the side of the road only outlines. Music is playing from the speakers and Ethan is snoring in the backseat with his head against the headrest while Lila leans against him. I have my sketchpad opened on my lap and a pencil in my hand.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be working on my portfolio over Christmas break for graduation in May. I\u2019m not even sure exactly what I\u2019m going to do when I graduate with my associate degree, but it\u2019ll have something to do with art. Honestly, if I had my way, I\u2019d spend all day with Micha, listening to him sing, while I draw things that mean something to me\u2014things that move me. I wouldn\u2019t want to draw so I could sell my art. Yes, it would be an added bonus, but doing it as a job would take some of my passion for creating away.</p> <p>Right now all the pages in my sketchbook are blank or have unfinished pictures on them because I wasn\u2019t feeling it and stopped. It\u2019s supposed to be full of pieces that mean something to me, that will make people experience emotion, tell a passionate story from the heart. I can\u2019t seem to find my angle and everything I start ends up feeling forced.</p><p>I wonder if my mom had this problem.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m trying to decide whether to tell my mom or not that we almost went through with a wedding without her,\u201d Micha says, slipping his fingers through mine, and the contact jerks me from my thoughts and I gasp, startling him and myself.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou seem distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine... and I vote no.\u201d I set my pencil down and close my untouched sketchbook, since it\u2019s too dark to draw anyway, and put it down on the floor beside my feet. I rub my tired eyes, then slant my head to the side and watch the stars in the sky stream by in various illuminating colors, trying not to think about the journal tucked away in my bag in the trunk. My mom\u2019s journal and drawings. My mother who won\u2019t be at my wedding. I want to scream at myself because it shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal. She was hardly around when I was alive so what does it matter? Yet for some reason it does.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, pretty girl?\u201d Micha glances at me and there\u2019s a tease in his tone. \u201cAre you afraid she\u2019s going to get upset?\u201d He releases my hand to sweep strands of his blond hair out of his aqua eyes that are so strikingly beautiful even the darkness can\u2019t conceal it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never afraid,\u201d I assure him as he returns his fingers to mine, bringing me instantaneous warmth. \u201cI\u2019m just worried she\u2019s going to get upset and cry and then things are going to get awkward.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles softly, and then delicately kisses my knuckles, causing my heart to flutter. \u201cSo you\u2019re only worried about things getting awkward, huh?\u201d The ring looped through his bottom lip grazes my skin as he moves his mouth away, and then he puts his hand to the shifter with our fingers still entwined. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else bothering you at all? Like the fact that you\u2019re going to have to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them why you love me?\u201d</p><p>I gape at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur wedding vows,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you forget?\u201d</p><p>I look at the window to hide my guilty face. With the box arriving on my doorstep yesterday and the panic of actually getting married, I\u2019d completely forgotten about the vows. Micha had thought it\u2019d be a great idea to write our own vows and I\u2019d agreed because it was only going to be him and me, Lila, Ethan, and a minister. I knew there was no way I could write anything as poetic as Micha would. The boy is amazing with lyrics and letters and words in general. Me, not so much, especially when it comes to writing about the heavy stuff like my feelings. I really suck at self-expression, unless it\u2019s through art. I wonder if I could get away with just holding up a few drawings of him?</p><p>\u201cYou did forget, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Micha starts laughing again, looking so happy it hurts my heart, because I should be that happy. And I am, for the most part, but there\u2019s still stuff bothering me, like the journal, the vows, my future, what the hell I want to become of my life.</p><p>I smash my lips together and meet his gaze. \u201cI might have let it slip my mind, but not because I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but still...\u201d I sigh. \u201cI\u2019m such an asshole.\u201d</p><p>He laughs even harder, one hand gripping the steering wheel as he merges into the other lane. \u201cYou\u2019re not an asshole.\u201d He skims his fingers across the bumps of my knuckles with his thumb. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have to write our own vows if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m perfectly content with just marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sappy sometimes,\u201d I tease, and then take a shaky breath. \u201cBut I want to do the vows.\u201d It\u2019s such a lie but I want to make him happy\u2014he deserves to be happy. And this is something I can do to give that to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cocks an eyebrow. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m absolutely sure.\u201d I sound kind of choked, but I don\u2019t think he notices. I feel bad, but at the same time I can\u2019t help how I feel. I\u2019m never really sure about anything. I get anxious when it comes to huge decisions and that makes me hesitate every single time. If I had my way, it wouldn\u2019t be like that, but sometimes things are out of our control when it comes to who we are.</p><p>\u201cVows it is then.\u201d He smiles and it makes me sad. I want to be as happy as he is. I really do. But sometimes it seems like it\u2019s impossible, no matter how hard I try.</p> <p>I fall asleep somewhere between the exit ramp and the bridge that stretches over the lake that\u2019s at the edge of Star Grove, the one I almost jumped off of the night before I ran away to Vegas. By the time I open my eyes again, we\u2019re pulling up to Micha\u2019s old house, which is next door to mine. The sun is ascending from behind the mountains that surround our little town and snow blankets the lawns around us. It\u2019s freezing here, and the sidewalks and driveways are all glazed in ice. Silver, green, and red Christmas lights twinkle on some of the nearby houses, but most of the front yards in this neighborhood are decorated with broken-down cars, boxes, trash. There\u2019s a younger guy who I\u2019m pretty sure is selling drugs on the street corner, and a guy yelling at his wife as she storms down the sidewalk in her pajamas.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Micha mutters, and then yawns, stretching his lean arms above his head.</p><p>I cover my mouth as I yawn. \u201cYou should have let me drive a little. You seriously look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am seriously tired,\u201d he says, silencing the engine. \u201cAnd I plan on getting some sleep just as soon as you take a shower with me.\u201d He flashes me a grin and then pulls the keys out of the ignition. \u201cThat\u2019ll wear me out and I\u2019ll be able to fall right to sleep afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, shut the fuck up,\u201d Ethan grumbles, making a disgusted face. His black hair is flat on one side where his head was against the window and he has his tattooed arms around Lila as she sleeps with her head on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t give us crap,\u201d I tell Ethan, unbuckling my seat belt. \u201cI\u2019m officially scarred for life after yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened yesterday?\u201d Micha asks as he cracks open the door and cold air rushes into the car.</p><p>Ethan shoots me a dirty glare, but I ignore him. \u201cI came home from work,\u201d I tell Micha, \u201cand heard some very disturbing noises coming from the guestroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Micha says and then flinches when I punch him in the arm. \u201cWhat? If it\u2019ll make you feel better we can make a whole bunch of noise in the shower and pay them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d Ethan pleads grumpily as he stretches his free arm above his head. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough from you two to last me a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is getting really awkward,\u201d Lila mumbles with her eyes still shut. \u201cCan we all just pretend that we haven\u2019t heard each other have sex... or phone sex?\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s my cue to get out of the car since she\u2019s referring to the time Micha and I had phone sex while I was still sharing an apartment with Lila while Micha was on the road. As I step out into the snow, Micha laughs and Ethan cracks a joke underneath his breath. Ignoring them, I slam the door and wind around to the back of the car, leaving my tracks in the snow.</p><p>Thankfully, I thought ahead and wore my lace-up boots and a pair of jeans, otherwise I\u2019d be freezing. I don\u2019t have a jacket on, though, and my hair\u2019s pulled up in a ponytail so my neck\u2019s exposed to the icy air. I wrap my arms around myself and wait for Micha to come open the trunk as I stare at my house next door.</p><p>I can tell my dad\u2019s been out and about because of the fresh tire tracks going up and down the driveway and the fact that his Firebird is parked near the back steps, the windows defrosted. Beside the car is the tree that Micha used to climb up almost every night to sleep with me. I used to hate the tree because I climbed up it the night my mom died, but now, looking at it, I can\u2019t help but smile because it was the thing that brought Micha to me many times.</p><p>\u201cBaby, where\u2019s your jacket?\u201d Micha asks as he struts around to the back of the car, slipping off his own jacket.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s in my suitcase.\u201d I force my attention away from my house and onto him as he hands me his jacket and I distractedly slip it on. He\u2019s so God damn gorgeous it\u2019s distracting. I wish I could just draw him all the time. He\u2019d probably let me if I asked, telling me he belongs to me and I can do whatever I want with him.</p><p>I absentmindedly rub my thumb across the ring on my finger as I feel the reality of the thought. That we belong together. Him and me. Forever.</p><p>He looks down at my ring and then takes my hand and reaches out to sketch his finger around the diamond band twisted in knots that encase a black stone. \u201cI\u2019m still surprised how well you\u2019re handling this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Being engaged?\u201d I shiver from the cold, or maybe it\u2019s from his touch.</p> <p>A pucker forms at his brow as he glances down at the ring on my finger. \u201cOver the fact that we\u2019re going to get married...\u201d He looks over at my house. \u201cHere, with everyone.\u201d</p><p>My muscles tense, but I joke to lighten the tension building inside me. \u201cGive me a few days and we\u2019ll see if you still think I\u2019m handling it well. You might not even want to marry me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as I do that we\u2019re going to get married.\u201d His eyes darken with desire as his voice deepens. \u201cJust like we both know that I\u2019m going to fuck you when we take a shower in just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>His voice sends tingles all over my body, a flurry of hot sparks. \u201cI swear to God, sometimes you are the horniest person in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m just a guy who\u2019s completely attracted to his beautiful fianc\u00e9e.\u201d He leans in to give me a kiss on the lips, before popping the trunk.</p><p>I grab my bag and slide the handle over my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re always over complimenting me. You know that?\u201d</p><p>He swings the duffel bag over his shoulder and looks like he\u2019s resisting an eye roll. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll stop when your head gets too big, but I doubt that\u2019ll ever happen.\u201d He picks up a large bag and chucks it over the roof of the car to Ethan, who catches it against his stomach with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cJesus, a little warning would be nice,\u201d Ethan says as he slides the handle of the bag over his arm.</p><p>Micha grabs Lila\u2019s suitcase and extends the handle, lowering the bag down to the snowy driveway. \u201cYou guys are staying here, right?\u201d Micha calls out to Ethan, slamming the trunk shut.</p><p>Ethan shrugs, looking at Lila, who shrugs too. \u201cI was planning on it.\u201d He drapes his arm around Lila\u2019s shoulder and she cuddles against his chest as they hike through the snow for the back door, leaving Micha and me to finish unloading the trunk by ourselves. \u201cYou know I like your place more than my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because my mom lets us do whatever the hell we want,\u201d Micha points out.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Ethan calls out.</p><p>We follow them to the side door of the house that\u2019s right in front of the garage where Micha used to work on his car all the time and I would hang out with him because it was the only place I felt at home.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lila, this thing is heavy,\u201d Micha remarks as he drags Lila\u2019s suitcase in the snow behind him. \u201cWhat the hell did you pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal stuff,\u201d Lila says, looking offended.</p><p>Ethan opens the back door and steps into the kitchen. \u201cShe overpacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lila protests, bumping her elbow into Ethan\u2019s side as she steps into the house. \u201cI\u2019m a lot better than I used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Ethan agrees, following her in and letting the screen door bang shut.</p><p>\u201cIs your mom home?\u201d I ask as Micha lifts the suitcase up the steps.</p><p>He shrugs, opening the screen door. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He pushes the suitcase into the kitchen while holding the door open with his elbow. \u201cShe might have had to work the morning shift, though, or she might be out with Thomas.\u201d</p><p>I hitch my finger through the handle of the bag. \u201cBut you told her, right? That we were coming?\u201d I step inside the kitchen and into the warm air, stomping my boots on the mat just in front of the threshold. \u201cAnd why we were coming?\u201d I sound so nervous. Damn it. I need to chill out.</p><p>Micha shakes his head as he shuts the door. \u201cI thought we could do it together.\u201d</p><p>My eyes skim the small kitchen I ate many meals in while I was growing up. If I hadn\u2019t, I probably would have starved. \u201cSounds good, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He pauses near the kitchen table. \u201cUnless you\u2019re not okay with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d I tell him, attempting to push through my nerves. I can do this. It\u2019s not that scary. You\u2019ve been living together for six months. Hell, you pretty much lived with him since you were four. \u201cWe should do it together.\u201d</p><p>He nods, but his aqua eyes are still fixed on me, like he\u2019s trying to read my soul. I kind of wish he could so he would tell me what it says, because sometimes I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>After a few intense moments of staring at me, he gives me a smile and then grabs hold of my hand. He steers me around the narrow counter area and toward the hallway that leads to his bedroom. Lila and Ethan head to the other end of the house where there\u2019s a small guest bedroom Ethan used to crash in all the time while we were growing up.</p><p>Micha kicks his bedroom door open and I can\u2019t help but smile as vivid memories rush back to me: the room where we grew up, where we spent many nights together, where he proposed to me. They\u2019re beautiful memories and they remind me of why I\u2019m going to marry him. I hold my breath for a moment as the thought slams straight into my chest again, like it did right before I was supposed to go to the wedding. My heart rate picks up as I glance at the window, thinking how easy it would be for me to run. I\u2019ve done it once and I could do it again, but deep down in the bottom of my heart, buried below my anxiety, I know I don\u2019t want to. I suck a slow breath through my nose and exhale out my mouth. Relax. I need to stop panicking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His bed isn\u2019t made and has probably been that way since the last time we were here a year ago. Drumsticks and a guitar are on the floor in front of the open closet and hanging on the wall are his favorite band posters, along with some of my drawings. Old clothes are piled on a chair near the window that looks out to the side yard of my house and to the leafless tree that extends to my bedroom window. His room still smells like him, too, as if the scent of his cologne is embedded in the carpet fibers. I\u2019ve always loved the smell, a simple scent bringing me instant comfort even in the darkest times. I wonder if I just stand here and breathe it in over and over again if it can help me forget what\u2019s in the bag that\u2019s secured over my shoulder.</p><p>Micha chucks his bag on the unmade bed and turns to me, rubbing his hands together. \u201cReady for our shower?\u201d he asks with a devilish grin.</p><p>I drop my bag onto the floor. \u201cYeah, just give me a second to get my clothes out. They\u2019re all buried beneath the wedding dress.\u201d</p> <p>He crosses his arms and gives me an apprehensive look. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019ve been acting really distracted and now you\u2019re acting like you don\u2019t want to be around me.\u201d</p><p>I plaster on the most generic smile. Deep down I know he probably can read right through my bullshit. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d I place my hands on his shoulders and kiss his scruffy cheek. \u201cBut if you really want to know, I have some naughty little nighties in my bag that I don\u2019t want you to see, otherwise you\u2019ll make me try them on for you and they\u2019re for after we get married.\u201d</p><p>He cocks his head to the side, assessing me as he unzips his jacket. \u201cSince when do you wear nighties?\u201d He shucks off the jacket, balls it up, and tosses it on the dresser.</p><p>\u201cSince Lila made me go into Victoria\u2019s Secret and buy them.\u201d Which isn\u2019t entirely a lie. That actually did happen, but I do feel like a jerk for not coming straight out and telling him about the journal and drawings.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m really starting to like Lila. She\u2019s such a good influence on you,\u201d he says cleverly and then kisses me deeply, slipping his tongue into my mouth before pulling away. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the shower in five minutes, I\u2019m coming back here naked to get you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I tell him and he heads out the door with a clean red T-shirt and jeans in his hand. As soon as the door shuts, I exhale loudly as I move my bag onto the bed. My fingers shake as I unzip it, and then I dig past the dress to the bottom of the bag and remove the box addressed to me, the return address from a Gary Flemmerton in Montana, but that\u2019s not who it\u2019s from, at least not according to the note inside the box, which was written by mother\u2019s mom\u2014my grandma. And it makes no sense, because I\u2019ve never talked to her before, yet she took it upon herself to write me a note and send me some stuff of my mother\u2019s. It\u2019s weird, yet at the same time it\u2019s got me thinking things I don\u2019t want to think, like maybe I could meet her, but then again, do I really want to let more people in my life?</p><p>The note\u2019s pretty simple and when I take it out of the box and read it again, I have the same reaction: confusion.</p><p>Ella, I know you don\u2019t know me and I\u2019m so sorry about that. There were things that you probably don\u2019t understand, or maybe you do. Maybe Maralynn told you about me. Maybe she didn\u2019t. But regardless, I was going through the attic, cleaning it out, and found some of her old stuff. I thought that you\u2019d like to have it. I was going to keep it myself, but it\u2019s just too painful. If you don\u2019t want it, you don\u2019t have to keep it. I just thought you might like it.</p><p>Then she signed her name in flawless cursive handwriting.</p><p>I\u2019d only ever met my grandmother once and that was at my mother\u2019s funeral. We didn\u2019t say anything to each other and my father didn\u2019t talk to her. It makes no sense why she\u2019d give me her phone number like I\u2019d been the one avoiding her all these years. She could have come up to me at the funeral and said something, but instead she sat across from my dad, my brother, and me in the barely occupied church while the minister preached about life after death. I think she might have smiled at me once, but I wasn\u2019t completely sure at the time, nor did I care, because I was in a place where guilt was possessing my heart and mind. Plus, from what I knew about my grandmother, she wasn\u2019t a very nice person.</p><p>I\u2019d heard my mom talk about her maybe only five times and from what she told me, she was a horrible mother who treated her daughter like shit and who disowned my mom when she announced she was going to marry my dad. I guess my grandmother hated my dad and thought he wasn\u2019t good enough for her. That pretty much sums up everything I know and I\u2019ve never talked to her to be my own judge. I\u2019m not sure if I want to. The woman has been a shadow in my life. Then again pretty much everyone was a shadow in my life except for Micha. Micha has been my light in my dark life. I smile to myself, noting that I should put that in the vows.</p> <p>My expression instantly sinks as I realize that eventually I\u2019ll have to write a page of heartfelt words and have to read them aloud, pour my heart and soul out to strangers. And when it\u2019s all done, Micha and I will be husband and wife. I\u2019ll have him forever and he\u2019ll have me. Just thinking about it, my pulse increases and my heart slams against my chest. It\u2019ll be just him and me forever, through thick and thin, through light and darkness. Knock it off. You love him.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to freak out at the infinite future barreling at me, and I struggle to shake it off and concentrate on the box instead. I wedge my fingers through the opening in the top and remove the thing I\u2019d been looking at when I\u2019d been debating whether to go down to the cliff to get married. It\u2019s a black leather book, the cover faded, and inside is my mother\u2019s handwriting, stating her thoughts and feelings, her soul poured out across the many pages.</p><p>I open the journal as I sink down onto the bed. \u201cFor all of you who think you know me, you don\u2019t,\u201d I read aloud, running my fingers along the faded script. That\u2019s just the first page, and even reading it again puts goose bumps on my arms. It\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve read and it seems like far enough, yet it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ve always wanted to get to know my mom better, the mom who didn\u2019t lie, didn\u2019t have panic attacks, the one who smiled, laughed, told jokes. Did she lie in these pages? Should I care so much? What\u2019s done is done. She\u2019s gone, and reading her journal isn\u2019t going to bring her back. Yet I do care.</p><p>\u201cElla.\u201d The sound of Micha\u2019s voice startles the living daylights out of me and I jump, slamming the journal shut.</p><p>He\u2019s standing in the doorway, completely naked just like he warned me he would be. Lean muscles carve his stomach and cursive letters tattoo the side of his rib cage in black ink, the first lyrics he ever wrote, which he swears he wrote for me: I\u2019ll always be with you, inside and out. Through hard times and helpless ones, through love, through doubt.</p><p>Setting the notebook down on my lap, I cover my mouth. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018oh my God you\u2019re naked\u2019 me.\u201d He enters the room and his muscles ripple with his movements, causing heat to pool inside my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat if Lila and Ethan saw you?\u201d I ask, lowering my hand to my lap.</p> <p>\u201cThen they saw me,\u201d he replies, his eyes fastened on me as he shuts the door. \u201cI told you I\u2019d come in here naked and get you if you weren\u2019t in there in five.\u201d He rotates his wrist, pretending to check a watch that he\u2019s not wearing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been five.\u201d</p><p>I cross my legs because just seeing him like that makes me want to lie down on the bed and spread my legs open so he can slip inside me. \u201cWell, I was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you will be in a few minutes.\u201d A grin flashes across his face but then it vanishes when he notices the box next to me and the journal on my lap. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip guiltily. I haven\u2019t told him yet, because I know he\u2019ll worry about what it\u2019ll do to me. Still, I\u2019m not going to lie to him now that he\u2019s asked. \u201cIt came in the mail yesterday. It\u2019s a box full of stuff... my mom\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen and his lips part in shock. \u201cWhat? Who\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>I tap the top of the box with my finger. \u201cWell, it says from a Gary Flemmerton, but the note inside is... well, it\u2019s from my grandmother... my mom\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Didn\u2019t your mom say she was mean?\u201d he asks cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sort of.\u201d I smooth my hand over the journal with my chin tipped down. \u201cBut sometimes my mom lied about stuff.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his weight and sits down on the bed beside me. Then he hooks a finger under my chin and elevates it so I\u2019m looking at him. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he asks, looking at me with concern and making me feel at home, at peace, okay with everything, even the bad stuff.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just yet,\u201d I tell him and when he starts to frown, I add, \u201cNot because I don\u2019t want to, but because I haven\u2019t even looked through all the stuff yet to know what I want to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go through it now? With me?\u201d he asks with understanding.</p><p>\u201cNot right now.\u201d I suck in a slow breath at the idea of reading my mom\u2019s thoughts, concerned what they\u2019ll reveal, what they won\u2019t reveal. Who was she? Was she like me once? \u201cBut I will... I just need to process stuff one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>He nods, but still seems uneasy as he moves his finger away from my chin and puts his hand on his lap. \u201cSo who\u2019s this Gary guy? And why did he send it to you all of a sudden out of the blue? And why did he send it for your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, but here\u2019s the note.\u201d I pick up the scrawled piece of paper from out of the box and hand it to him so he can read it for himself. After he skims over the note he looks even more perplexed as he sets it aside on the nightstand. \u201cSo she was just cleaning out the attic and thought, Hey, maybe I should send the granddaughter who I\u2019ve never talked to a box of her mother\u2019s stuff? Or have this Gary guy send it for her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe Gary\u2019s her boyfriend or something?\u201d I lift my shoulders and shrug. \u201cI have no idea because I\u2019ve never talked to her before.\u201d</p><p>Micha glances at the note again, strands of his blond hair falling into his eyes as he shakes his head, worrying just like I knew he would. \u201cThis is really weird. I mean, how did they even get our address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d My mouth sinks to a frown as I look out the window at my small two-story house just next door, the one I grew up in, with the one that is filled with painful, sad memories. There\u2019s snow falling and landing on the roof, which is missing half of the shingles. \u201cMaybe from my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but wouldn\u2019t he have said something to you about giving it to her?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I aim a doubtful look at him because that doesn\u2019t sound like my dad at all. \u201cEven though my dad\u2019s been better, he still gets weird about the past and my mom... Besides, I haven\u2019t talked to him in, like, a week.\u201d I swallow the massive lump lodged in my throat. \u201cBut I\u2019ll go ask him in a while.\u201d</p><p>Micha practically beams at me like he\u2019s so proud that I\u2019m doing the mature thing and not running away from the problem. It makes me realize that I am and that I shouldn\u2019t be running away from marrying him, even though my initial instincts are screaming at me to bail out. It\u2019s been in me practically forever. Run when things get too deep, too emotional, too complex. I\u2019ve run a lot, but I\u2019ve been good lately and I want to keep doing well.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d he asks with compassion in his eyes.</p><p>I nod, tucking loose strands of my hair behind my ears. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>His smile broadens. \u201cYou remember those words very carefully. You\u2019re going to need to say them again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I repeat with a playful grin as I bump my shoulder against his and it makes his smile stretch to his eyes. \u201cI do. I do. I\u2014\u201d He swiftly slides forward and his lips silence me. At first it\u2019s a slow, warming kiss, but the longer it goes on the fierier and more passionate it gets. Suddenly his fingers are grabbing onto the bottom of my shirt and then he tugs the fabric up over my head. Chucking it aside, his lips crash back into mine again as he gets to his feet, pulling me with him. Then he picks me up in his arms and I can feel his hardness pressing up between my thighs as I secure my legs around his midsection. It feels so good and my body ignites with heat and eagerness and suffocates all the bad thoughts in my head. As he carries me across the hall, I don\u2019t even care if Lila or Ethan walks out and sees us. All I care about is being with him.</p><p>When he steps into the bathroom, music is playing from his iPod in the dock on the counter and the shower is on, the mirror fogged up from the heat and steam. The humidity in the air instantly clings to my skin as Micha bangs the door shut with his foot, sealing us in the sweltering room without breaking the kiss. He mutters an \u201cI love you\u201d over the lyrics of \u201cThe River,\u201d by Manchester Orchestra, and I utter the same thing back as he devours me with his hands and mouth. The feel of his lips, the soft sound of the lyrics, and the dampness of the steam absorbs into my skin and floods my veins with lust, need, and hunger. They flood me with love.</p><p>God, I feel so loved sometimes I forget how to breathe.</p><p>Maybe I should put that in my vows, too.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Micha</p><p>God, she\u2019s come so far, sometimes I can\u2019t even believe she\u2019s the same person I grew up with. The Ella I used to know would have run like hell if something like that journal showed up on the doorstep, but this Ella is handling it beautifully. Even though I love her no matter what\u2014runner, Stepford wife, or crazy and impulsive\u2014my heart grows more in love with her with each day, for the person she was, is, and the people we are together as a couple. Soon to be husband and wife. I just pray to God we get to that place. Deep down I know we will; it\u2019s just that I\u2019ll feel so much better once she says \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>My hands travel all over her body, feeling the flawlessness of her skin, her smooth stomach, her perfect neck, and then I taste her lips as my tongue explores every inch of her mouth. She tastes fucking amazing, like cherry lip gloss and peppermint.</p><p>I pull away with one of my hands pressed to her lower back, and the other gripping her thigh that\u2019s hitched around my hip. \u201cWhat do you taste like?\u201d I ask as her eyelids flutter open.</p><p>\u201cHuh... what...\u201d She breathes dazedly, like she barely has any idea of where we are. \u201cGum... I think... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou taste like cherries and mint.\u201d I lick her lips with my tongue and then set her down on the floor. \u201cIt tastes good.\u201d</p><p>She unlaces her boots and kicks them off as I unbutton her jeans and jerk them down her long legs. She\u2019s wearing a pair of black lacy panties that cover half of her sexy ass and I run my finger along the little pink bow that\u2019s sewn on the front of them. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen these before,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she says, breathless. \u201cLila made me buy naughty lingerie.\u201d She tugs the elastic out of her hair and auburn locks slip out of the ponytail and fall to her shoulders in waves, damp with the moisture from the shower.</p> <p>I reach behind her to unhook her bra and the straps immediately fall off her shoulders. Her breasts spring free, her nipples perking as they hit the air. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d I leisurely take in the sight of her long legs and amazing body.</p><p>She shakes her head, like she always does whenever I give her a compliment, but before she can protest, I bend down and suck one of her breasts into my mouth, silencing her.</p><p>Her neck arches and her head falls back as she knots her fingers through my hair, moaning. \u201cMicha...\u201d She drifts off as I massage her nipple with my tongue while my hands wander to her panties. Hitching a finger in the top, I tug them down and she meets me halfway, kicking them off when they reach her knees. I return my mouth to her nipple as I slip my fingers up her bare thigh, not stopping until I\u2019m inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh God...\u201d Her knees start to buckle, her back pressing against the edge of the counter. I move my fingers inside her as my mouth makes a path back and forth between her breasts, sucking her nipples into my mouth and tracing circles with my tongue. Her hand glides up my back, gently scratching lines on my skin, and when she reaches my shoulders, she grips tightly, holding on to me.</p><p>I continue to kiss her breasts and feel the inside of her with my fingers as she veers closer to the edge, but eventually I crave more. Drawing my mouth away from her nipple and pulling my fingers out of her, I trail kisses down her stomach and her hands fall from my shoulders as I get down on my knees. She gasps as I bury my face between her thighs and slip my tongue inside her, my hands on her hips, gripping at her flesh. I taste her until it drives us both mad and her body tightens and her back arcs. She gasps in bliss as she clutches onto the counter for support.</p><p>By the time she returns to reality, I\u2019m rock hard and desperate to be deep inside her. A groan escapes my mouth as I stand up, licking my lips before I seal my mouth to hers. Then I blindly steer us toward the shower, fumbling around until I find the curtain and pull it back. I break the kiss only to get us in the shower, and then once we\u2019re under the showerhead, I go straight back to kissing her. Warm water rivers down our bodies, our skin soaked as our hands explore each other. We kiss until we can\u2019t breathe, until my heart is slamming inside my chest, until she\u2019s trembling uncontrollably, and then I delve my fingers into her hips, pick her up, and with one hard thrust I slip deep inside her.</p><p>She sucks in a breath, her arms looping around my neck and her legs wrapping around my waist, so she\u2019s fully opened up to me. I pull slightly out of her and then sink into her again with my hand braced against the shower wall. With each rock of my hips, she clutches onto me tighter, her back bowing, her breasts pressing against my chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispers against my lips, shutting her eyes, our bodies moving rhythmically.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I say, holding onto her as we both come apart together.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Ella</p><p>I\u2019ve opened Pandora\u2019s box and there\u2019s no turning back. After I got out of the shower, I started working on my portfolio some more, but I became really frustrated when I couldn\u2019t get the creative juices flowing, so I decided to read my mom\u2019s journal and now I can\u2019t seem to stop. We\u2019ve been at Micha\u2019s house for only a day and I\u2019m halfway through the damn thing, the house too empty and quiet to distract me from reading every last word my mother wrote.</p><p>Micha found out that this morning his mom was with Thomas and now she\u2019s working the night shift at the diner so she won\u2019t be home until morning and Micha and I decided we\u2019ll talk to her when she gets home, announce the news. Micha and Ethan wandered off a couple of hours ago to the grocery store to restock the cupboards that weren\u2019t full enough to feed their \u201chungry man bellies.\u201d Their words not mine. And Lila\u2019s taking a shower.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table, wearing one of Micha\u2019s shirts and a pair of jeans. It\u2019s chilly due to the fact that Micha\u2019s mom always leaves the heat low to save money. It\u2019s part of Star Grove life though, half the town is in poverty because a plant shut down a long time ago. We did it at my house, too, sometimes leaving the heat off intentionally and sometimes unintentionally when I forgot to pay the bill or there wasn\u2019t enough money to pay it.</p><p>I have a cup of coffee in front of me, along with the journal. The first ten pages are fairly normal, talking about prom and her love for art, although her words are a little mopey. I never even knew she liked to draw but from the few drawings in the box, it looked like she had talent. It\u2019s kind of nice to read about her like that, but then things start to get dark and the warm, fuzzing feelings I was having getting to know that artistic side of my mom shift into chills, especially when I get to the part about my dad. At first she seemed excited to be dating him. Like, really excited to the point where she almost seemed high. But then the excitement went quickly downhill, reminding me of all those times when she seemed okay and then suddenly she wasn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not sure who I am anymore. I feel like I\u2019m lost all the time. When I look in the mirror, the person I see isn\u2019t the person I used to be. Instead of eyes, I see two empty holes. Instead of a mouth, I see lips sewn together. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me. What changed in me. What made me feel like my skin is molting off as I turn into a different person who can\u2019t even walk anymore without a lot of effort. If I had my way, I\u2019d sit in bed forever.</p><p>Until I died.</p><p>But I can\u2019t do that now. I have a responsibility. A child growing in my belly and a man who will be my husband in just a few weeks. It\u2019s terrifying and not the life I think I want. But there\u2019s nowhere else to go and really any other alternative is just as bleak as the one before me. Any future is, and sometimes just having one is frightening.</p> <p>The entry was written when she was eighteen, right before she married my dad. She was pregnant with my older brother, Dean, something I didn\u2019t know. Her thoughts are terrifying, especially since I\u2019ve recently been contemplating my future and where kids fit into the mix. But I don\u2019t get it. My dad once told me that she used to be happy in the beginning, but if that\u2019s the case, then when was he talking about? When was the beginning? Because in the journal entry she\u2019d known him for only six months and she already seemed to be falling into the dark hole of despair that I\u2019m very familiar with, no matter what I do or try to change about my life. In the end, I have depression. It\u2019ll always be with me\u2014with Micha and me. I\u2019ve known this for a while and yet I\u2019m still going forward with him, always crossing my fingers he never regrets it.</p><p>But what if he does?</p><p>I take out a drawing that\u2019s folded up in back of the journal along with a photo of my mom on a bed with her chin on her knees and her hair falling into her green eyes that look exactly like mine. She\u2019s smiling, but there\u2019s something off about the snapshot, like she\u2019s forcing herself to look happy, or maybe that\u2019s just what she looked like when she was happy. It\u2019s hard to tell sometimes and most of the time when I knew her, she just looked lost. She doesn\u2019t look lost here, but she doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s someone who\u2019s got everything figured out. I wonder if that\u2019s what I look like?</p><p>The drawing is of this vase with a single rose inside it and the petals are cracked and wilting, piling up around the bottom. It hurts my heart looking at it, because as an artist, I can guess what place her thoughts were at when she drew it because I\u2019ve been in that place.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Ella, you did not ball up your wedding dress and shove it in a duffel bag.\u201d Lila huffs as she stomps into the kitchen with an overflowing armful of fabric and a rolled-up magazine. She\u2019s wearing a holey pair of jeans and a plain pink T-shirt, her blond and black hair damp. \u201cSeriously, why would you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I quickly shut the journal, regretting having opened it in the first place. Maybe I wasn\u2019t ready to read it. Maybe I should just let the past go. I\u2019d been doing so well and I\u2019ve even been off my medication. But I want to understand her. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about it when I stuffed it in there.\u201d</p><p>Lila lets the bottom of the dress go, but holds onto the top, examining the fabric. \u201cIt\u2019s all wrinkled now.\u201d She scrunches her nose at the front of the dress as she fiddles with one of the black roses on it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to, like, have to hang it up in the bathroom and steam the wrinkles out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom should be all steamed up from your shower.\u201d I bring the brim of the mug to my mouth. \u201cSo you could hang it up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was already steamed up from your shower.\u201d She rolls her eyes and then laughs off her irritation. \u201cYou two and showers... I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you really should,\u201d I say, unable to restrain a smile as thoughts of Micha and his hands and tongue overtake me. The dark thoughts the journal instilled in my head evaporate like the steam coming from the mug, although I\u2019m fairly sure they\u2019ll be back if I continue to read it. \u201cYou\u2019re really missing out.\u201d</p><p>She drapes the dress on the back of the chair and sits down across the table from me. \u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll have to try it sometime with Ethan.\u201d</p> <p>Quiet settles between us as she opens up the magazine she was carrying and I realize it\u2019s a wedding magazine. We\u2019ve been friends for almost two and a half years now and it still feels like we hardly know each other sometimes. Perhaps it\u2019s because of my lack of being able to talk deeply about things or because it seems like we both like to carry our secrets.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Ethan,\u201d I start, setting the mug down on the table. \u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, restraining a grin as she flips a page of the magazine. \u201cGood, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, like, love him?\u201d I make a mocking swoon face. I never had any girlfriends when I was growing up. Instead I was mostly surrounded by Micha and his friends or my brother and his friends, so sometimes acting girly is weird.</p><p>Lila lowers her hand onto the table and then crosses her arms. \u201cI think I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr know? Because I heard you both know.\u201d</p><p>Her brows furrow. \u201cDid Ethan tell Micha that we said I love you?\u201d</p><p>I nod and take another sip of my coffee. \u201cThey do that sometimes, you know. Tell each other their secrets like a couple of girls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, they are friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey should tell each other stuff.\u201d</p><p>I nod and wonder if I should tell her about my fear of writing and saying my vows, since I can\u2019t discuss it with Micha. She could help me figure stuff out. Maybe. Although I don\u2019t think she could help me with the fear of getting married, which might be behind the reason why I can\u2019t write my vows.</p><p>Before I can say anything, though, she suddenly rises from her chair with a big grin on her face. \u201cI almost forgot. I got you a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My expression falls. No one\u2019s ever given me presents except Micha and I\u2019m not really a fan of getting them.</p><p>\u201cFor your wedding, duh.\u201d She rolls her eyes like I\u2019m being absurd and then heads back to the guest room. A few minutes later, she returns with a big pink gift bag in her hand. \u201cHere you go, bride-to-be,\u201d she singsongs and then hands it to me. \u201cI was going to give it to you yesterday, but... well, you know. Things happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I set the bag down on the table. \u201cThat really wasn\u2019t about my panicking about getting married. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She plops down in the chair and props her elbow on the table. \u201cThen what was it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff.\u201d I\u2019m hesitant, and when she presses me with a look, I decide to let her in on my life just a little, especially since I recently learned her parents haven\u2019t always been that great to her either. \u201cI\u2019m just worried about stuff in the future.\u201d</p><p>She slumps back in the chair. \u201cWell, that\u2019s normal, Ella. Everyone worries about their future, especially when they\u2019re about to get married and are starting a future with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right. I should probably just try to relax.\u201d But even when I say it, it doesn\u2019t seem possible. Relax. Sure, it\u2019s easy when I\u2019m in Micha\u2019s arms or he\u2019s inside me and everything else around me\u2014life\u2014feels nonexistent. But alone without his comfort I\u2019m hyperaware of the things that lie inside me, the dark things that could overwhelm me with sadness at any moment\u2014I could lose myself at any moment.</p><p>We sit quietly as fluffy snowflakes melt against the windows and leave thin trails of water on the glass.</p><p>Eventually Lila sits up and attempts to look happier. \u201cOkay, enough with the sad. You need to open my present.\u201d</p><p>I make a wary face at the gift bag and then open it up. There\u2019s decorative paper inside and a box sealed with a bow. I set it down on the table, then untie the bow and lift the lid. The first thing I come across is a blue garter trimmed with white lace. I take it out and put it around my wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou know that doesn\u2019t go there, right?\u201d Lila teases, sitting up in the chair. \u201cAnd it\u2019s your something blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very traditional of you,\u201d I say playfully and Lila smiles as I move onto the next item, a silver bracelet with a heart charm on it.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s your something borrowed,\u201d she informs me. \u201cYou have to give it back to me when the wedding\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d I tell her, even though it\u2019s not really my style. But I appreciate it\u2014her making the effort. \u201cBut I thought the dress was my something borrowed?\u201d</p><p>She shoves the magazine aside and crosses her arms on the table. \u201cNah, you can keep the dress and consider it your something old. It doesn\u2019t hold anything but painful memories for me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d she assures me and then gestures at the box. \u201cTake the next thing out. It can be your something new.\u201d</p><p>I direct my attention back to the box and remove a much smaller box inside it. Inside, there\u2019s some red, lacy fabric, which I take out and hold up. \u201cJesus, this is skanky,\u201d I say wiggling my fingers through what looks like nipple holes.</p><p>She giggles. \u201cSkanky but fun.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, stick my hand into the box, and pull out a sequined thong. \u201cIs this the bottom part or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever you want, I guess,\u201d she says with humor in her voice. \u201cIt could even be for Micha.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh and drop the thong onto the lacy fabric. \u201cThis is like a sex kit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, examining her nails. \u201cI went into this really questionable store with sex toys and lingerie and told the clerk to pick out the best newlywed gifts.\u201d</p><p>I slip the garter off my wrist and add it to the pile with the thong. \u201cSo you have no idea what\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue except for the garter and the bracelet\u2014I added those myself. But I\u2019m dying to find out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, now I\u2019m really intrigued.\u201d I reach in and remove the next item, a feather duster with a really long handle. \u201cWhat is this for?\u201d I run my fingers along the feathers and then shiver. \u201cIt tickles.\u201d</p><p>She giggles, twirling a strand of her short hair around her finger. \u201cI think that\u2019s the point,\u201d she says and I extend my arm across the table and tickle her face with it. \u201cHey, what the hell?\u201d She laughs as I pull it away. \u201cThat\u2019s not for me and I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to tickle faces with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be for you. You and Ethan could totally use it.\u201d I set the feather duster on top of the pile and reach for the last item, which is in another box, a long narrow one.</p> <p>\u201cYou really want to go down that road?\u201d she questions. \u201cThe one where we talk about our sex lives.\u201d</p><p>I shrug as I open the top of the smaller white box, and then tip it to the side and batteries fall out. \u201cYou used to tell me all the time about the guys you hooked up with.\u201d I pick up the batteries, scrunching my forehead.</p><p>Her expression plummets and she abruptly becomes uncomfortable. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not hooking up with some guy. I\u2019m hooking up with Ethan and in the past you two didn\u2019t always seem like the best of friends.\u201d She snatches the batteries from me with inquisitiveness in her expression and this weird look crosses her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been better though lately, and besides, regardless if Ethan and I are getting along, you can talk about stuff with me,\u201d I tell her as I stick my hand into the narrow box. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to hear all the details...\u201d I trail off as I take out the item inside it. \u201cWhat in the love of God, Lila. I mean, I knew this was a sex kit, but really?\u201d</p><p>Lila\u2019s face turns bright red as she busts up laughing, her shoulders hunching forward. \u201cI was sort of wondering if that was what was in there when the batteries fell out.\u201d</p> <p>I hold up a pink vibrator with this weird front part attached to it, biting my lip not to laugh. But Lila continues to laugh as she extends her arm across the table and takes the vibrator out of my hand. Then she pops the batteries inside the bottom, twists a nob, and it starts to hum. Laughter escapes both our lips as she drops it on the table and it begins to shake.</p><p>\u201cImagine how good it will feel,\u201d she says, tears slipping through her eyes, her whole body trembling with laughter.</p><p>Still laughing, I ask, \u201cWas the cashier who put this all together a guy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy,\u201d she says, poking the vibrator with her finger to steer it away from falling off the table. \u201cA total creeper appar...\u201d she drifts off as the back door swings open. Snowflakes flurry in as Micha and Ethan come strolling inside, tracking snow and carrying a few plastic bags of groceries.</p><p>Micha takes one look at the vibrator, the pile of lacy and sequined fabric, and the feather duster and the bags immediately fall from his hands as he explodes with laughter. \u201cWhat the hell did we miss?\u201d He grips onto the countertop for support as his knees buckle.</p><p>Ethan stands by the backdoor, looking lost, like he can\u2019t quite figure out what the hell we were doing.</p> <p>Lila overlaps her fingers as she leans back in the chair. \u201cWe were playing a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a game?\u201d Ethan wonders and the confusion is replaced by a wicked look. \u201cSee who could stick it farther up their\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lila cuts him off as she picks up the vibrator and chucks it across the room. It zips past his head and hits the door, still humming. \u201cDo not finish that sentence, Ethan Gregory.\u201d</p><p>We all settle briefly into an awkward silence and then everyone spurts out in laughter. We continue to laugh until Micha scoops the vibrator up and turns it off. The humming stops and he puts it down on the table in front of me, winking at me as he backs up to where he dropped his groceries.</p><p>\u201cSo we were thinking of having a party,\u201d he announces as he piles the bags onto the kitchen counter.</p><p>I make a face as I put the vibrator, lingerie, and feather duster into the bag. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He picks up a box of cereal out of the bag. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like a bachelorette slash bachelor party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to have those separately?\u201d I ask, pushing the bag aside.</p> <p>\u201cAnd with strippers,\u201d Lila adds, and Ethan gives her a strange look as he slips off his jacket and hangs it up by the back door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we could do that but I\u2019d rather have a party with you,\u201d Micha says. \u201cAnd you can always strip for me later when it\u2019s over. That\u2019s much better in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI,\u201d Ethan says with a frustrated sigh as he sets the bags he was carrying on the counter. Micha rolls his eyes at him and then turns to me. \u201cSo are you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a party?\u201d I ask. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d he questions, as he puts the cereal box into the cupboard. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. A party sounds fine.\u201d I get up from the chair and walk across the kitchen to him. I cross paths with Ethan as he heads for Lila. He whispers something in her ear and then the two of them wander off toward the guest room, Ethan muttering that they\u2019ll be back in a few.</p><p>I start helping Micha unpack the groceries, putting cans of food into the cupboard. \u201cWho are you planning on inviting to this party of yours?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shrugs as he opens the fridge to put a gallon of milk away. \u201cJust the people we used to hang out with. The ones still living around here anyway.\u201d</p><p>I close the cupboard and lean against the counter. \u201cWhich is probably pretty much everyone,\u201d I mumble and then internally sigh. \u201cAre you going to play at this party?\u201d</p><p>He kicks the fridge door shut and goes back over to the bags. \u201cDo you want me to play at this party?\u201d</p><p>I stare down at the floor. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and I continue to stare at the linoleum floor until his boots appear in my line of vision, and then I angle my chin back to meet his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask as he aims a suspicious look at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what?\u201d He positions himself in front of me, his jacket still speckled with wet spots from the falling snow outside. \u201cThis is bothering you and I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bothering me,\u201d I start to protest but he targets me with a warning look. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this will be the first party we\u2019ve ever been at as a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd from my knowledge, a lot of the people who came to these parties... the female ones...\u201d I search for the right words that won\u2019t make me sound like a jealous asshole, but there aren\u2019t any so I decide just to be blunt. \u201cYou fucked.\u201d</p><p>He winces, but then quickly composes himself. \u201cI know, but that\u2019s in the past. What matters is that I\u2019ll be fucking you at the end of the night, over and over again. In fact, I\u2019ll be fucking you every night for the rest of your life.\u201d He gives me a flirty smile and I swat his chest with my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says innocently, trapping my hand against his chest. \u201cWould you rather me say \u2018make love\u2019?\u201d He brushes his thumb across the ring on my finger. \u201cBecause we can do that, too.\u201d With one swift movement, he slides his palm down my side, grips my hip, and spins me around. Pushing down on my lower back, he presses up against me as I grip onto the counter for support.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really up to you.\u201d His breath caresses my ear before he draws his mouth away to nibble on my earlobe.</p><p>I shudder and his chest collides against my back as he laughs. \u201cOf course if we make love then the vibrator isn\u2019t going to be much use,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift from Lila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks fun.\u201d His voice comes out gravelly.</p><p>\u201cFun for me or for you?\u201d I joke.</p><p>His hair tickles the back of my neck as he leans his head against me, sucking in a slow breath. \u201cKeep it up, pretty girl, and you\u2019re going to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for.\u201d I bite my lip in anticipation, waiting for him to react.</p><p>He misses a beat and I feel him shift his hips. \u201cI swear to God, you\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d His lips touch the back of my neck, feather soft, and then he rubs his hips against me, before stepping away and I turn around and we return to putting the groceries away.</p><p>I notice him glance at the closed journal on the table a couple of times, but he doesn\u2019t say anything about it. Eventually, I decided to answer the question I know he wants to ask but isn\u2019t going to because he knows it\u2019s better for me to bring it up.</p><p>\u201cI read some of it,\u201d I admit as I stand on my tiptoes to put a can of beans on the top shelf.</p><p>\u201cAnd how was it?\u201d he casually asks as he rummages through the last bag of food.</p><p>I hop up onto the counter, letting my legs dangle over the side. \u201cIntense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHer thoughts were just dark and I found out that she was pregnant with Dean when she decided to marry my dad.\u201d</p><p>He positions himself in front of me and urges my legs open so he can step in between them. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I nod, pressing my knees against his side. \u201cAnd she was scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf being a mom?\u201d His hands clamp down on my thighs.</p><p>\u201cAnd having a future.\u201d Tears sting at my eyes. The words are striking a nerve. A painful, aching nerve, buried deep inside my heart. I massage my hand over my chest, trying to get the crushing pain out.</p><p>Sensing my panic, Micha quickly wraps his arms around me. The second I\u2019m in his arms, I feel better, lighter. He hugs me as I breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. I bury my face in his chest and he supports my weight like he always does. Always.</p><p>\u201cAre you really sure you want this for the rest of your life?\u201d I mutter against his chest.</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, Ella May.\u201d He kisses the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ve known that since the day we met.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tears subside as I look up at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve known you wanted the crazy girl next door to be your wife since you were four?\u201d</p><p>He nods, holding my gaze. \u201cMaybe not as a wife, but I knew from the moment I saw you that I wanted you in my life forever.\u201d</p><p>Tears make their way back up, this time not out of panic but from the overwhelming abundance of emotions I feel for him. God damn it, it\u2019s so intense. Too intense. Feelings built over years and years of history, starting with the moment we first met.</p> <p>\u201cYou were always there for me,\u201d I say. \u201cNo matter how much of a pain in the ass I was.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cAnd even though you won\u2019t ever admit it, you were there for me, too, every time I needed you.\u201d</p><p>I want to disagree with him, but I don\u2019t because it\u2019d ruin the moment. \u201cJust you and me against the world,\u201d I whisper as tears drip from my eyes and down my cheeks.</p><p>He fixes a finger underneath my chin, slants my head back, and leans in to kiss me. \u201cAlways and forever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p> <p>Micha</p><p>Four years old...</p><p>I love spending time with my dad, especially when he works on cars \u2019cause it\u2019s the only time when he really talks to me and does stuff with me. He\u2019s working on the Challenger while I play with my toy car, driving it really fast back and forth across the Challenger\u2019s bumper.</p><p>\u201cMicha, can you hand me that wrench?\u201d my dad says with his head tucked underneath the hood. It\u2019s a really old car that he\u2019s working on fixing up, but it seems like it\u2019s taking him forever. I don\u2019t know why he just doesn\u2019t drive it the way it is now. I think it looks pretty fun and all the sides are different colors.</p><p>I jump off the bumper and dig around in his toolbox near the back end until I find the wrench and then I walk to the front and hand it to my dad.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he mutters and goes back to working on the engine.</p> <p>I get a juice box out of the cooler, lean against the fender, and stare at the next-door neighbors\u2019 house. It looks a lot like mine, but there is a lot of trash and car parts are everywhere and it looks like nobody ever cleans up.</p><p>I\u2019m about to head back to the trunk when the door swings open and the girl who lives next door steps outside. She looks like she\u2019s going to cry, but she looks like that almost every time I see her. She\u2019s got hair that\u2019s the same color as our red mailbox and every time I talk to her, her eyes remind me of leaves. Her name is Ella and she always has tears in her eyes. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because her mom is yelling at her all the time or because they make her take out the trash every day. Whatever it is, she always looks like she\u2019s gonna burst into tears. I asked my dad once why the neighbors were always yelling and he said it\u2019s because they are a messed-up family.</p><p>I grab another juice box out of the cooler and wave to her as I step out of the garage. She doesn\u2019t wave back, but she\u2019s usually shy at first, like she thinks I\u2019m the boogieman or something. With her head tucked down, she wipes the tears out of her eyes and walks down the steps. She doesn\u2019t have any shoes on and the cement has to be hot under her feet.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ella,\u201d I say again, walking up to the fence between our houses.</p><p>She stands at the corner of her house with her arms crossed, staring at the ground. She barely talks, and half the time, even when she\u2019s talking, she looks down at her feet or the ground or at the trees.</p><p>I hear her mother yelling in the house, telling Ella she needs to come clean up the dishes. My mom says I\u2019m too young to help with the dishes, even though my dad says I should be helping out more.</p><p>Ella keeps wiping her eyes with her hand as her mom yells from inside the house and I wonder if she\u2019s hiding from her mom. Finally, the yelling stops and Ella dares to look at me.</p><p>I hold up one of the juice boxes, offering it to her, hoping she\u2019ll come over to my house for once. \u201cDo you want one?\u201d</p> <p>She looks at me for a really long time and then she slowly walks toward me. She pauses at the grass, looking like she\u2019s scared to come closer, so I reach my arm over the fence. She stares at the juice box, then runs up and takes it.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Micha,\u201d she says quietly, stepping back as she pokes the straw into the juice box.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I tell her, as she starts slurping on the straw.</p><p>I feel bad for her. I don\u2019t think her parents take care of her because she always seems really thirsty and hungry every time I offer her a snack. I\u2019ve tried to get her to come over and play a few times, but she always says she can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMicha, get in here,\u201d my dad calls out from the garage and he sounds really mad. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>Ella instantly steps back, her eyes widening. \u201cBye, Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come over,\u201d I call out and hold my toy car through the hole in the fence. \u201cThis is my favorite one, but I\u2019ll let you play with it.\u201d</p><p>She eyes the car and then glances back at her house. \u201cI think my mom might get mad at me if I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can just come over for a little bit,\u201d I suggest. \u201cThen when your mom comes out looking for you, you can climb back over the fence. Besides it\u2019s really fun watching my dad work on the car.\u201d</p><p>She glances back and forth between the house and the car in my hand and finally she hurries back toward her house. I think she\u2019s going back inside, but instead she grabs a plastic box that looks like the thing I keep all of my toy cars in. She drags it over to the fence and steps up on it. She takes a gulp of her juice box and then she hands it to me and I step back as she climbs over the fence. She falls down on her knees as she lands and cuts one of her knees a little.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She nods, looking like it doesn\u2019t hurt at all as she wipes the dirt off and stands back up. She grabs the juice box and toy car from me and I smile as I walk back toward the garage with her, happy I finally got her to climb over the fence.</p><p>Ella</p><p>Six years old...</p><p>I like my next door neighbor Micha a lot. At first he was kind of scary because he was so nice and no one\u2019s ever been that nice to me before. But now he\u2019s not too scary. He always shares his juice and cookies with me at school and when Davey Straford pulled my hair and told me I was icky because I had holes in my clothes, Micha shoved him down and told him he smelled like rotten eggs.</p><p>The teacher got mad at him and then his dad got mad at him when we got home from school. He couldn\u2019t play with me for three days \u2019cause his mom and dad said he was grounded, but it\u2019s been three days and now I can go over again.</p><p>It\u2019s a really hot day, so I get two Popsicles out of the freezer before I head over. My shoes have got holes in the bottom of them again so I don\u2019t even bother putting them on. My mom yells at me to take out the trash as I walk out so I have to go back and haul it out of the trash can. She\u2019s always yelling at me to take out the trash and do the dishes. It makes me sad sometimes because I get tired, but my dad says she\u2019s sick and my brother and I have to be nice to her and help her out because he has to go out at night to \u201cclear his head and take a break.\u201d</p><p>The garbage bag\u2019s really heavy and leaves this gross slimy stuff on the kitchen floor as I drag it out, slide it off the steps and toss it into the bigger trash can. I put the lid on and skip down the sidewalk and then climb over the fence.</p><p>The sprinklers are on and the grass is all wet and kind of muddy, but I splash in it anyway, getting the bottom of my jeans wet and some mud gets stuck in my toes. I skip up the sidewalk, making footprints on the cement all the way to the side door of Micha\u2019s house</p><p>I\u2019m about to knock on the door when I hear someone crying from inside the garage. The door is open and Micha\u2019s dad\u2019s Challenger isn\u2019t inside and it\u2019s always parked in there, so it\u2019s weird. Micha\u2019s dad is always working on it and getting mad at it. When I get inside the garage, I find Micha sitting where the car used to be parked, with his back turned to me. It sounds like he\u2019s the one crying, which makes no sense. Usually I\u2019m the one crying and Micha is the one smiling.</p><p>\u201cMicha,\u201d I say and the crying stops.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t play today, Ella,\u201d he says quietly and it looks like he\u2019s trying to wipe tears away.</p><p>I walk around in front of him, but he won\u2019t look up at me, so I sit down on the floor. He tucks his arms onto his lap and I can only see the top of his head, because he\u2019s looking down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cMicha, what happened?\u201d I ask, the Popsicles cold in my hand.</p><p>He shakes his head and then his shoulders begin to shake as he starts crying again. \u201cMy dad took the car and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d I tell him, not understanding why that\u2019s making him cry. My dad leaves in his car all the time.</p><p>He shakes his head and looks up at me. Micha\u2019s eyes are this really pretty blue color that I saw on these beads once that I used to make a bracelet in school. His eyes are really wide and shiny right now like the beads and he looks so sad. It kinda makes me feel like crying, too.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not coming back,\u201d he tells me and tears roll down his cheeks and fall onto the ground. \u201cEver. My mom said he ran away and he\u2019s never coming home.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say to him. My dad ran away once, too, at least that\u2019s what my mom told me, but then he came home that night and my mom said it must have been because he couldn\u2019t find anywhere else to go. But sometimes she tells stories that I don\u2019t think are true.</p><p>I scoot closer to Micha, not sure what to say to him, so instead I hold out a Popsicle. He keeps crying as he looks at it and then he finally takes it from my hand. He peels the wrapper off and I peel mine off and then I sit there with him while he cries because it always makes me feel better when he sits with me when I\u2019m upset. Eventually his tears stop, long after the Popsicles are melted in our bellies and Micha finally gets up and wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. I get to my feet, too, and I search for something to say.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do something?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glances at me, still sad, but then he nods. \u201cYeah, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I smile and take his hand. \u201cWhatever you want to do,\u201d I say. He\u2019s usually doing stuff for me, but today it should be about making him happy.</p><p>He considers something and then there\u2019s the slightest sparkle in his eyes. \u201cHow about hide-and-go seek?\u201d</p> <p>I nod and then we play until the sun goes down, turning a sad day into a decent one because we\u2019re together.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Micha</p><p>Later that day, I rap my hand on the doorway as I walk into my bedroom. Ella is lying on the bed on her stomach with the journal opened in front of her. I really wish she\u2019d stop reading that thing. As much as I know it\u2019s good for her to have something that belonged to her mom, I can see in her eyes that whatever\u2019s in there is bringing her down. She hasn\u2019t been on her medication for a while and hasn\u2019t talked to a therapist in a few months, at least that I know of. She\u2019s been doing fine and I want her to stay that way, but I also don\u2019t want to be the asshole who tells her to quit reading her dead mother\u2019s journal.</p><p>So I keep my mouth shut and instead check her out. She\u2019s beautiful, her auburn hair pinned behind her head, wavy curls framing her face, and she\u2019s wearing a black-and-red dress that hugs her body and black stilettos on her feet.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so fucking hot,\u201d I say, adjusting myself as the urge to slam the door and take her from behind tries to overpower me. But people have started to arrive at my house for the party, so I control myself.</p><p>Ethan is letting everyone in but he wasn\u2019t too happy about the party to begin with, although I have no idea why because he used to enjoy parties back when we were younger. It was our thing and we probably threw more at my house then we actually went out to, since my mother never cared just as long as we cleaned up afterward. I had to laugh at Ethan when we were driving and chatting about what\u2019s been going on in our lives for the last six months or so. I guess when he and Lila go back to Vegas they\u2019re packing their stuff and hitting the road to try and live out his dream of being a mountain man. It\u2019s strange because Lila doesn\u2019t seem like the type, at least when I first met her, but now she seems different. She seems less preppy and I hate to say it but at first I thought she came off as a spoiled rich brat. But she\u2019s not though. She\u2019s actually really nice.</p><p>Ella glances up through her long eyelashes, her gaze skimming over my black jeans, my studded belt, and my Pink Floyd T-shirt, and then she bites her lip. \u201cYou look good, too.\u201d She closes the journal and sits up. \u201cTrying to impress anyone in particular?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and kick a shirt out of the way as I stroll into my room. \u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I might know that.\u201d She looks down at her hand as she flexes her fingers in front of her and the diamonds and black stone of her engagement ring sparkle. \u201cBut unlike me, you don\u2019t have a ring on your finger branding you as taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always give me my ring,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019ll wear it.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head, climbs off the bed, and tugs the bottom of her dress down, a dress that looks a lot shorter now that she\u2019s standing. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re not going to see that until the wedding.\u201d She pauses, putting her hands on her hips. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway. If any girl hits on you, I\u2019ll just kick her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my feisty girl.\u201d I give her a deep kiss and then hold up a finger as I get an idea. \u201cI got it.\u201d I back toward the door. \u201cYou go out and start having fun and I\u2019ll take care of the ring problem.\u201d</p><p>She looks perplexed but follows me out of the room. She joins the small group gathered in the living room as I head to the door. I slip on my jacket as I step out onto the porch and into the snow. Christmas lights flash from the house across the street and I can hear the thumping of music from somewhere down the street. I trot down the stairs and hurry into the garage, flipping the light on. I pull a box down from the top shelf and set it on the counter. As I\u2019m sifting through the car parts, my phone rings from my pocket. When I take it out, my producer\u2019s name, Mike Anderly, flashes across the glowing screen. I press talk and put the phone up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to be calling,\u201d I tell him, balancing the phone against my ear as I rummage through the box.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I couldn\u2019t wait until morning to call you and tell you the news,\u201d he says, sounding way happier than he normally does. Usually, he\u2019s all business and kind of cranky.</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d I pick up the metal ring from the box, smiling at my clever idea.</p><p>\u201cThat you got on the tour.\u201d</p><p>I nearly drop the ring. \u201cThe Rocking Slam Tour?\u201d I ask. It\u2019s the tour I\u2019ve been trying to get on for months, the one that has a ton of my favorite bands, musicians I idolize. The one where I\u2019ll have to be on the road for three straight months.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be the one,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cSo get your ass over here so we can celebrate.\u201d</p><p>My mouth turns downward. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m in Wyoming, getting ready to get married. I told you this last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I forgot.\u201d He sighs. \u201cWell, hurry and get that taken care of so you can get back here and celebrate. You leave in just a few weeks anyway and we have to finish recording.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cYeah... I\u2019m not sure I can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, you\u2019re not sure you can go!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get you on this tour for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really think it was going to happen, and now I\u2019ve got stuff going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it did and you\u2019re going,\u201d Mike says sternly.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying that I need to talk to Ella first. She needs to be okay with my being gone for that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if she says she\u2019s not?\u201d he asks, astounded. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t go.\u201d It hurts to say it, but it\u2019s the truth. She\u2019s more important to me than anything, and if she doesn\u2019t want me to be gone during our first few months of marriage then I won\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple.</p><p>Music starts playing from inside the house and I quickly slip the metal ring on my ring finger, which will hopefully alleviate some of Ella\u2019s worry. \u201cLook, I gotta go. I\u2019ll call you in a week when I get back in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not say no,\u201d he grumbles and I hang up the phone before he starts ranting, something he does a lot.</p><p>Tucking my phone into my back pocket, I go back inside the house, wondering how Ella is going to react to the news. I can see her pretending like she\u2019s okay with it but deep down not really wanting me to go. She hides her feelings well so if I\u2019m going to do this I need to make sure she\u2019s completely and utterly okay with it. Any doubt and I\u2019ll stay. Besides, as much fun as the tour would be, our little life in San Diego is good and why ruin a good thing?</p><p>Because being part of this tour is my dream.</p><p>Frowning at the thought, I shut the back door behind me as I step inside the kitchen. Ethan is sitting on the table, drinking from a red plastic cup and Lila is laughing at something he says while she pours herself a drink over at the counter. There\u2019s another couple chatting in front of the kitchen sink. I used to go to school with them, but I can\u2019t remember their names. I wave to them when they say \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d and then I head for the living room.</p><p>\u201cBottoms up.\u201d Ethan lifts his cup as I pass by him, toasting to something, and then he throws his head back and guzzles the drink.</p><p>\u201cAre you wasted already?\u201d I ask. \u201cBecause you\u2019re supposed to play the drums in, like, ten minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says, but his bloodshot eyes suggest otherwise. \u201cI\u2019ve got this. Besides, I can play the drums when I\u2019m drunk perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha, do you want me to make you a drink or pour you a shot?\u201d Lila calls out with a bottle of orange juice in her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I tell her, scooping up a beer from the cooler near the doorway. \u201cI have to stick to beer.\u201d</p><p>She nods knowingly as she sets the juice down on the counter beside the row of vodka, tequila, and Bacardi bottles and a stack of plastic cups. Ever since Ella called me out on my asshole drunken behavior about a year ago, I take it easier on getting trashed, usually sticking to only a few beers. It was hard at first, but now it\u2019s comfortable.</p><p>I pop the top off as I stroll into the cigarette-smoke-filled living room, letting the wonderfully potent smoke settle in my lungs. Even a couple of years after kicking the habit, minus a few slipups, it still gets my mouth watering.</p><p>Earlier, Ethan and I shoved the couches aside to make room for his drums, which we picked up from his house during our drive back from the grocery store. My old guitar is leaning against a taped together microphone stand. There\u2019s also an amp and a bass guitar in the corner beside a small plastic Christmas tree decorated with red and sliver ornaments and tinsel. I haven\u2019t figured out who\u2019s going to play the bass yet, but I put it up there just in case. I know a lot of people who play the bass and it\u2019d be nice to have a good sound even if it\u2019s just a party. I sort of feel like I\u2019m saying good-bye in a way because in a few days I\u2019ll be married, my life with Ella will finally start, and this life can hopefully become a memory of everything we shared that got us to that point.</p><p>I start to go over to my guitar when I spot Ella sitting on the back of the sofa with a red plastic cup in her hand. A tall, scraggily looking guy whose name I think is Brody is standing in front of the sofa, staring at her legs and cleavage while yammering about something. I walk over to her and hop up on the back of the sofa beside her. Then I drape my arm around her shoulder. I know I\u2019m being territorial and I know she\u2019d never do anything with anyone but it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to let some guy look at her like he could eat her up. He\u2019s lucky I don\u2019t punch him. Ella\u2019s mine and he needs to walk the fuck away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, where\u2019d you go?\u201d Ella asks me as Brody gives me an uneasy look and then walks away without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cTo get this,\u201d I reply, holding up my fingers.</p><p>She takes my hand and runs her finger over the metal ring. \u201cDid you seriously put an O-ring on your ring finger?\u201d</p> <p>I dazzle her with my most charming smile, the one I know makes her stomach somersault. \u201cNow everyone knows I\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>She takes a sip of her drink and then licks her lips. \u201cSuch a shame. I was looking forward to kicking all the girls\u2019 asses who hit on you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you were,\u201d I mumble as I lean forward and lick a drop of alcohol off her lip. \u201cBacardi, huh?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and angles her head back to take a large swallow. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have fun tonight. Get a little drunk.\u201d</p><p>I eye her over warily. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like that. Drunk Ella can sometimes be mean. And horny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d She restrains a smile as her hand clamps down on my thigh, squeezing hard. \u201cI\u2019m not a mean drunk.\u201d</p><p>I waver as I sip my beer. \u201cI can remember a certain tantrum over a lost poker game. One where you drunkenly threw a chip at me.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes. \u201cOnly because you were being smug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmug because I won and got to see you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I\u2019ll get drunk enough tonight that you can see me naked. Just as long as you quit saying I\u2019m a mean drunk.\u201d She hops off the couch and my arm falls from her shoulder. \u201cAnd by the way, you can be the same way when you get drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHorny and mean.\u201d</p><p>I raise my beer up and point a finger at it. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m sticking to these.\u201d I slide my feet off the couch and stand up. \u201cSo what song do you want me to play tonight?\u201d</p><p>She taps her finger against her lip and there\u2019s a playful look in her green eyes. She\u2019s already buzzed, which means I\u2019m going to have my hands full tonight. \u201cHow about the one tattooed on your ribs? The one you said you wrote for me but I\u2019ve never heard you play before?\u201d</p><p>I automatically touch the side of my rib where the tattoo of the lyrics is hidden underneath the fabric of my shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve never sung that one out loud for anyone. And I\u2019m not ready to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d I pick at the damp beer label. \u201cBecause I wrote it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d She frowns, confused. \u201cThen play it for me now.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the room packed with rowdy and drunk people. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s personal.\u201d Because it means so much to me and the last thing I want to do is sing it to a room full people when I haven\u2019t even sung it to her. Besides, I\u2019m a little nervous to sing it for her because it\u2019s intense.</p><p>She gives me the most lost look and I sigh, because I know I\u2019m acting strange. \u201cIt\u2019s just that when I wrote it, the lyrics kind of threw me off because it was the first time... that I realized I thought of you... like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we both know how you feel now,\u201d she says, looking at the metallic O-ring on my finger.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I stroke her cheekbone with my fingers. \u201cAnd when I play it for the first time, I want it to be just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike later tonight,\u201d she asks, hopeful.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe on our honeymoon,\u201d I tell her and smile when her jaw drops. \u201cWhat? Did you think I didn\u2019t have anything planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the wedding has been pushed back.\u201d She cranes her neck and looks over her shoulder as more people enter the living room. \u201cSo if you had one planned, then how\u2019d you move it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had it planned for a few weeks after yesterday, when we were supposed to get married.\u201d I suddenly realize that if I go on tour my honeymoon plan has gone to shit. And I saved money to book it, skipping out on eating fast food and instead bringing my lunch\u2014shit like that to get extra cash. A three-day cruise, which is a simple, normal kind of honeymoon and perfect for us since we didn\u2019t really do simple or normal for most of our lives.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d she wonders, intrigued, tucking in her elbow when a guy who I think is named Del walks by wearing a Santa hat and singing \u201cWe Wish You a Merry Christmas,\u201d drunk off his ass and completely off key.</p><p>\u201cNo way. It\u2019s a surprise,\u201d I say, ushering her toward the front of the room when Ethan waves me over. Standing beside him is Jude Taylorsen, a pretty good bass player so I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re ready to roll. \u201cI have to go play now.\u201d</p><p>She clutches the cup as she stands in the crowd. It\u2019s getting louder and smokier by the second. I know if it gets too packed in here furniture is going to get broken. I didn\u2019t use to mind, but now I feel guilty and I make a mental note to kick everyone out before it gets to that point.</p><p>\u201cAnd play that one song,\u201d she shouts out as I back up toward where Ethan is chatting it up with Jude. \u201cThe one you played at the coffeehouse when I first came back from Vegas.\u201d</p><p>I smile charmingly at her. \u201cThe one where you got all possessive on me?\u201d</p><p>She sticks out her tongue. \u201cKenzie is a skank and a bitch. You should be grateful I saved your ass from that.\u201d</p><p>I press my hand to my heart. \u201cYou were jealous. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me, but her lips itch to turn upward. \u201cI was a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were.\u201d I wink and start to turn around.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you want, you can play the cover for that song that was playing in the bathroom earlier,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the song?\u201d I question, looking back at her from over my shoulder. \u201cOr like the memory the song\u2019s linked to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she says simply and throws her head back to down her drink. The curves of her cleavage peek out of the top of her dress and I shake my head, knowing I\u2019m not the only guy in the room staring at her. But then I smile, knowing I\u2019m the only guy in the room who gets to be with her.</p><p>She lowers the cup from her mouth and gives me an accusing look, like she knows I was just staring at her breasts. I blink my gaze off her and head over to the microphone. I set my beer down on the floor next to the wall, pick up my guitar, and slide the strap over my shoulder, running my fingers along the initials I carved in the back. I got the guitar when I was thirteen at a yard sale for, like, five bucks. It was my first guitar and even though it took a bit to get the hang of it, I loved playing it. There\u2019s something about music and lyrics that helps me express myself, even when it\u2019s hard.</p><p>I was playing the first time I realized I had feelings for Ella, feelings that ran much deeper than just friend feelings. She was in the crowd dancing solo like she did a lot, her hands in the air, her hips rocking to the beat. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her and I found myself wishing I was down there with her, touching and kissing every inch of her. It was that night I went home and wrote the lyrics that I eventually got tattooed on my ribs because it was the kind of moment filled with emotion and the lyrics I created about her needed to be marked on me forever.</p><p>It was the moment I realized I loved her, even if I wasn\u2019t fully aware of it at the time, but only because I didn\u2019t fully understand love yet. Looking back, though, I know the moment I penned the words there\u2019d never be anyone else.</p><p>Ella was my one and only.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Ella</p><p>I refuse to be the sad Ella tonight and dwell on things that aren\u2019t making me happy, like my mom, her dark thoughts and fears\u2014my dark thoughts and fears. I\u2019m not going to think about my future either or the fact that I can\u2019t seem to even get my portfolio started. Tonight it\u2019s about having fun and watching Micha play, one of my favorite things in life. I am not going to sink down into a pit.</p><p>Micha starts out with the song he sang in the coffeehouse, just like I asked him to do. Sweaty bodies nearly suffocate me as I sway back and forth to the music. Lila\u2019s standing beside me, gazing at Ethan pounding on the drums like he\u2019s the love of her life. She\u2019s wearing a sleeveless blue shirt and jeans, along with a pair of my boots.</p><p>\u201cYou look starstruck,\u201d I shout over the music, fanning my face with my hand, my skin already getting damp with sweat. Even though it\u2019s cold as death outside, there\u2019s so many people packed in the small living room, the body heat alone makes it desert hot in the house.</p><p>She shrugs, her eyes fastened on the front of the room where the guys are playing. \u201cI think I am.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and then capture her hand, feeling the alcohol smother any amount of anxiety surfacing. Lila laughs as I spin her around, holding my drink in my hand, ignoring the guy who shouts at me when I accidentally ram my elbow into his gut. Lila grasps onto her drink as she twirls around, trying not to spill any. I keep spinning her until the music stops and Micha\u2019s voice flows over the room.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this next one was requested by the only person I\u2019ll take requests from.\u201d He winks at me and some girl shouts out that she\u2019ll do whatever he wants if he sings a song for her.</p><p>I turn around, scanning the crowd for the culprit and find her at the back of the room. A tall, curvy girl with dark hair, giving me a condescending look as she takes a sip of beer. Kenzie, the waitress from the coffeehouse. Go figure.</p><p>\u201cI think someone wants their ass kicked tonight,\u201d I state, targeting her with a look. She went to school with me and knows what I\u2019m capable of. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten into a fight, but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve forgotten how.</p><p>Lila claps her hands and jumps up and down. \u201cOh my God, we should totally take her on together.\u201d She turns to me with a smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019ll hold her back and you pull her hair.\u201d</p><p>I gape at her. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who wants to find out what it\u2019s like to get in a fight.\u201d She beams, making fists. \u201cCome on, Ella, be my Mister Miyagi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhoa, you\u2019re acting weird and I like it.\u201d I tap my finger against my chin thoughtfully. \u201cWell, first off, you don\u2019t pull hair. That\u2019s a girl\u2019s way of fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if you fight like a guy then you win. Element of surprise. It totally throws them off.\u201d</p> <p>Lila bobs her head up and down, eyeing Kenzie as she takes a swallow from the red cup in her hand. \u201cI could see how that would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works perfectly almost every time,\u201d I assure her. \u201cAnd if you really want to get mean you can kick\u2014\u201d I\u2019m cut off by the low beat of the drums, guitar, and base mixing together in perfect unison. I turn around and face the front of the room, no longer giving a crap about Kenzie. She can say whatever she wants. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to anyone who matters.</p><p>Micha strums his long fingers across the guitar as he stands in front of the microphone. His eyes are locked on me, the silver O-ring on his wedding finger glistening in the inadequate light of the living room as he sings the song that was playing while we were in the shower earlier. The lyrics bring fresh memories flooding back and I swear to God I can feel the heat of the steam and the scorching trail his hands left all over my body.</p><p>I watch him play, longing to touch him and for him to touch me. I put the plastic cup up to my lips and swallow another mouthful of Bacardi, feeling the burn of it along with the heat on my skin, realizing that Micha was right. That I do get horny when I\u2019m drunk because all I can think about right now is him being inside me like he was in the shower.</p><p>When his lips part to sing the chorus, I shut my eyes and let the lyrics and sultry sound of his voice spill over my body. I\u2019m gone. The people around me no longer exist. It\u2019s just me and Micha and his beautiful voice. I remember the first time I heard him play, sitting in his room on this beanbag chair he had, watching him play and sing on his bed without a shirt on with this intense look on his face, like the words he sang owned him.</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d he\u2019d asked after he\u2019d stopped strumming the strings.</p><p>I\u2019d shrugged, pretending that the sketchpad on my lap wasn\u2019t holding a drawing of him on the bed. That I didn\u2019t just draw him, making lines and shades that mattered. That he mattered enough to me that I took the time to draw him. I felt so lost at the moment, hearing him sing like that as I stared at a drawing that wasn\u2019t just a drawing. I was lost but in the most wonderful way.</p><p>\u201cIt was okay, I guess,\u201d I replied nonchalantly, adding a few shadings around his eyes because they were too beautiful not to have extra detail on them.</p><p>\u201cJust okay?\u201d He cocked his eyebrow as he held the guitar on his lap. He looked a little upset about my answer and it made me feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was beautiful,\u201d I said softly as I stared down at my drawing, uncomfortable at how intimate the moment was because I didn\u2019t use the word beautiful. Just like I didn\u2019t draw pictures of people unless it was an assignment for school.</p><p>I waited for him to say something, even though I wished he wouldn\u2019t. But he never said anything, finally just playing the same song again. I\u2019d smiled down at my drawing because even though I knew it wasn\u2019t possible, I swear to God he could read my mind and eventually I\u2019d started working on my drawing of him again while listening to him play. I\u2019d always loved music, but hearing it from his mouth warmed my soul in a way that I never knew was possible.</p> <p>I shake my head from the memory. Maybe there\u2019s another sentence to put in my vows. Although, all these notes are getting a little personal and I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll dare read them out loud. Panic claws at my throat and I start to open my eyes to go get another drink, but then Micha reaches the intense part of the song and I don\u2019t want to leave the moment. I want to dance, get lost again like the first time I heard him play. So I keep my eyelids closed and sway my hips, shaking my head back and forth, my hair flying everywhere. I\u2019m in heels and it\u2019s a struggle to maintain my balance, but I don\u2019t care even when I stumble a few times. Just like I don\u2019t care that I\u2019m rocking out in a room full of people who are absorbed in beer and trying to find someone to hookup with and who are probably looking at me like I\u2019m a weirdo. I\u2019ll take being a weirdo over not enjoying this moment. I\u2019ve forced myself not to enjoy too many moments in my life. I need more enjoyment. Maybe it\u2019s the alcohol in my system that\u2019s making me think these things or maybe I\u2019m just being my old self. Or perhaps I\u2019m just being me. Whatever it is, I roll with it, dancing to the tempo of the music. Lila laughs at me and when I open my eyes she\u2019s dancing, too.</p><p>We continue through the entire song and I keep swaying my hips with my hands above my head, even when the music stops and voices rise around me. Moments later the stereo clicks on and the sound suffocates the chatter. \u201cNew Low,\u201d by Middle Class Rut, starts vibrating through the speakers and I know it will only be seconds before I\u2019m no longer dancing solo in a room full of people.</p><p>Right on cue, Micha\u2019s long arms wrap around my waist and he guides me back against his body. I know it\u2019s him because of the overpowering scent: his cologne mixed with mint and beer and something intoxicatingly wonderful that belongs only to him. I deeply inhale it in, moving with him as we grind our bodies together to the beat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so God damn sexy,\u201d he says, breathing into my ear and giving it a little nip. \u201cDo you know how hard it is to stand up there and play while you\u2019re down here doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d I ask innocently as his hand sneaks up the back of my dress and cups my bare ass.</p><p>His brow arches. \u201cWhat panties are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself. \u201cA sequined thong.\u201d I whirl around and press my body up against him, enjoying myself way too much.</p><p>His hand slides down my back and he crushes my body into his until there\u2019s no space left between us. I roll my hips against him and he lets out a husky growl. Unable to control myself, I throw my arms around him, stand on my tiptoes, and kiss him, urging his lips apart with my tongue. He kisses me with equal intensity as I suck on his lip ring, stroke the inside of his mouth with my tongue, and bite at his bottom lip.</p> <p>\u201cGod damn it, pretty girl, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d He groans a deep, throaty groan that makes my thighs tingle and I slip my hand between us, rubbing him hard. \u201cBaby, easy. There are people...\u201d He trails off as I move my fingers to the top of his jeans. I know I\u2019m drunk and horny just like he said earlier, but I don\u2019t care. I know what I want. Him.</p><p>When I start to undo the button of his jeans, he jerks away, his aqua eyes glazed, his expression blazing with desire that matches my own. He doesn\u2019t say a word as he entwines our fingers and then pulls me with him as he maneuvers through the crowd for the kitchen, shoving people out of the way with his elbow.</p><p>He scoops up two beers as we pass the cooler and hands me one. Ethan is standing beside the cooler, dripping with sweat from playing the drums, his shirt off and his tattoos showing. Lila is behind him with her head on his back as she traces her fingernails up and down his skin.</p><p>Micha gives him a chin up and says, \u201cIn an hour kick everyone out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you...\u201d Ethan blinks at him and then pulls a face as he glances between Micha and me as Lila giggles. \u201cAll right, will do.\u201d</p><p>I pinch Micha\u2019s ass because I can and he incoherently mutters something. Then he\u2019s tugging me with him as he crosses the kitchen and moves toward the hallway. We go into his room and he kicks the door shut behind us. When he turns to face me, his lips immediately cover mine, his fingers digging roughly through the fabric of my dress.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like beer,\u201d I murmur with a drunken giggle as I kiss him back, fiddling with the bottom of his shirt as we back toward his bed with our beers still in our hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd you taste like Bacardi,\u201d he mutters against my lips, and then suddenly he\u2019s pulling away. \u201cWait, how wasted are you?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cFirst of all, even if I was wasted, it wouldn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t take advantage of me when I\u2019m yours,\u201d I say and this lustful look flares in his eyes. \u201cAnd second of all, I\u2019m not that wasted. I\u2019ll remember everything we did in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like your logic.\u201d He takes the unopened beer from my hand and sets it down on top of the dresser along with his. \u201cBut are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all the convincing he needs. With one swift tug, he jerks my dress over my head so forcefully that he tears the corner of the fabric and sends the pins in my hair flying through the air.</p><p>He pulls a \u201cwhoops\u201d face, but I cover his mouth with my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dress.\u201d Then I crush my lips against his, his lip ring searing hot against my mouth as my hair falls down and brushes against my shoulders. Minutes later, all our clothes are on the floor and we\u2019re lying on his bed, him on his back and me straddling him. He thrusts his hips up to me halfway as I slide down on top of him. His eyes shut as I grip onto his shoulders and I gasp when he sinks farther into me. My hair falls loosely down my back as I slant my head back and shut my eyes. Gripping onto my hips, he rhythmically thrusts inside me over and over again. Our bodies bead with sweat as my mind drifts further away. Helpless energy channels through me and I dig my nails into his flesh, needing something to hold on to. Finally he takes my hands and I grasp on to him until I come apart. I cry out his name and every single worry I had disappears and all that\u2019s left is the blissful contentment that only Micha can make me feel.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Micha</p><p>I\u2019m lying in my bed, thinking about how to tell Ella about the tour when Ethan kicks everyone out of the house. Darkness has settled into my room and the noise and voices slowly dwindle until the house becomes silent. I sit up, but only to turn my iPod on, selecting \u201cI Can Feel a Hot One,\u201d by Manchester Orchestra, then lie back down. Ella is naked beside me, flat on her stomach, her hair scattered all over her back, the sheets pulled up halfway over her body as she sleeps soundlessly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moonlight flows through the window and across her lower back, highlighting the infinity mark tattooed in black ink. It matches the one on my arm perfectly and sometimes I wish I could remember the night we got them, remember what we\u2019d been thinking when we made the permanent decision. What lead up to the moment when we thought, Hey what the hell, let\u2019s go get matching tattoos that mean forever and eternally. What was going through our minds? What was going through Ella\u2019s mind? I lightly trace the curving lines on her back and I feel her shiver beneath my touch.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d I ask, my fingers wandering lower, to the top of her ass.</p><p>She nods her head, her eyes still closed. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep when you\u2019re touching me like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about like this?\u201d I roll over to my side and lean down to kiss her lower back. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d I ask, suppressing my laughter when she shivers.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s worse, but it\u2019s okay. You can keep kissing there if you want to.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself and then place another kiss on her back, sliding my tongue over her skin. She squirms so I do it again, then rest my head on her back, place my hand on her side, and my fingers fold around her ribs.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember any of that night at all?\u201d she murmurs against the pillow.</p><p>\u201cAny of what night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe night we got the tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you when we woke up on the park bench that I didn\u2019t remember a thing and the memories never came back to me. It\u2019s just one of those kinds of nights that I think will be a blank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve always wondered if you were just telling me that you didn\u2019t remember because you worried that I\u2019d get weird about whatever happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as much as that sounds like something I\u2019d do, I honestly can\u2019t remember a single thing,\u201d I say. \u201cOther than, one minute we were drinking a lot out in my backyard while a party went on inside and the next thing I knew we were waking up on the park bench, your shoes were missing, and my arm was burning like a motherfucker. I\u2019d seriously like to know how I managed to convince both of us to do it. And how I managed to get you to do something so permanent,\u201d I tell her and she grows quiet, the sound of her breathing mixing with the slow paced song. The longer she remains silent, the more I start to worry. \u201cElla May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her voice is high and full of nervousness.</p><p>My palm glides down her side to her hips. \u201cHave you been lying about not remembering any of that night?\u201d</p> <p>She pauses, her body tensing. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve already told you a thousand times I can\u2019t remember a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty girl, I think your lie\u2019s showing.\u201d I tickle her side and she buries her face in the pillow, shaking her head. \u201cYou do remember something, don\u2019t you?\u201d I press my chest against her back and lean over her shoulder, dipping my mouth to her ear. \u201cJust tell me. I won\u2019t be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t be mad,\u201d she says, rotating her head to the side so her face is away from the pillow. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be smug, which is worse and why I\u2019ve kept it a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be smug,\u201d I say enticingly. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will too, Micha Scott,\u201d she argues. \u201cI know you too well not to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make you roll over and tell me.\u201d I push away from her a little and skim my finger down her back to the center of her legs. She jumps, startled, as I start to put my finger inside her.</p><p>\u201cMicha.\u201d She narrows her eyes through the dark as she flips over onto her back and bolts upright, the moonlight hitting her bare chest. \u201cThat was a low move.\u201d</p><p>I sit up, pulling her legs over my lap as I turn to the side and relax against the wall. Then I situate her on my lap, so her ass is positioned over my cock. \u201cJust tell me,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to be smug but I want to know.\u201d</p> <p>She sighs and then puts her head against my shoulder. \u201cFine, but only because I love you.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her forehead, breathing in her words, never getting tired of hearing them. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>She sighs again and then she splays her fingers across my stomach. \u201cYou remember how we decided that everyone at your house was annoying and that we just needed to have a party of our own so we took a bottle of Bacardi and snuck outside?\u201d</p><p>I nod, resting my chin on top of her head. \u201cEveryone was always annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you always had the parties.\u201d She draws a pattern across my stomach and then up to my chest. \u201cAlmost every weekend after you turned sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was bored and liked the distraction.\u201d I shiver from her touch\u2014she\u2019s the only girl who\u2019s ever gotten me to shiver.</p><p>She walks her fingers up my stomach and stops them over my heart, pressing her palm flat against it. \u201cThe distraction from what?\u201d</p><p>I place my hand over hers and trap her hand in place. \u201cFrom you.\u201d</p><p>She tenses and so do I because I know what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you slept around so much?\u201d she asks quietly.</p><p>I shut my eyes, knowing she can feel the acceleration in my heart rate. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always told you I was just passing time until you came around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but did you really have to sleep with everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with everyone\u2014not even close,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd I was sixteen and horny and everyone I hung around with was having sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was because of peer pressure?\u201d she questions, doubtful. \u201cBecause that doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and sigh, releasing her hand. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really because of anything and that\u2019s kind of the point. I was young and bored and in love with my best friend and if I tried to do anything at all that went past the friend boundary, she\u2019d get upset. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself half the time, and honestly, Ella, I felt like shit most of the time about the stuff I did, not just with other girls but with you.\u201d I pause, giving her room to say something and when she doesn\u2019t, I continue. \u201cDo you remember that time when I made you go racing with me and when I won I kissed you because I got a little overly excited?\u201d</p><p>She hesitantly nods with her hand still positioned over my heart. \u201cI almost punched you in the face, but only because it was a reflex. I wasn\u2019t used to people touching me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were so pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I was confused.\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She hesitates. \u201cAbout me and you and what I was feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what were you feeling? Because I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d Even though I have her now, I still love hearing about our past and the fact that sometimes I wasn\u2019t the only one suffering in silence.</p><p>She turns her face toward me so her breath warms my chest, her lips grazing my skin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like what you were feeling?\u201d I touch my lips to her forehead.</p><p>She wavers for a moment and then nods. \u201cI did. A lot. And that was the problem.\u201d</p><p>I smile as I stare over her head at the window where Christmas lights glow through the darkness outside. There\u2019s a set of silver ones on the tree that leads to Ella\u2019s room, the one I used to climb up all the time just so I could be near her. \u201cThank you, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor telling me that. It\u2019s nice to hear that it wasn\u2019t always me,\u201d I say. \u201cNow will you please tell me about the tattoos?\u201d</p><p>She grimaces and then moves her head back to look me in the eyes. \u201cIt was my idea to go get them,\u201d she admits.</p><p>My jaw nearly drops. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes at herself and then sits up, swinging her leg over me so she\u2019s straddling my lap and her nipples brush against my bare chest. \u201cWe were drunk and you dared me to kiss you so I did. And then I stupidly suggested that it would be super funny if we did something to mark the moment and then decided it should be tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just willingly went with you?\u201d I ask, not with skepticism because it does sound like something I\u2019d do.</p><p>She nods as her palms glide up my shoulders and then she links her arms around the back of my neck, her soft nipples grazing my chest. \u201cYou took me over to Jason\u2019s house and asked him to put infinity marks on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d I inquire, my fingers finding her waist.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cAnd then that\u2019s where things get a little hazy.\u201d</p><p>I consider what she said and it makes me happy. \u201cSo this entire time you were the reason I have this on me.\u201d I raise my arm with the infinity mark on it.</p><p>She sketches it with her finger. \u201cDoes it make you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it kind of makes me very, very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it proves that you might have loved me all along.\u201d</p><p>She wets her lips with her tongue and then leans into me, so close that when she blinks, her eyelashes brush against mine. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t know it at the time,\u201d she whispers against my lips, \u201cI think you\u2019re right and I\u2019m glad I finally figured it out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Ella</p><p>Even though I can feel it in my bones that I should stop, the next morning I read some more of my mother\u2019s journal. The part I\u2019m reading was written a little before her wedding and she doesn\u2019t seem happy about it at all. She seems depressed and sad and everything a soon-to-be wife shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I can do it. Go down to the courthouse and make it official. I\u2019d rather claw my eyes out. If my mother had her way, I wouldn\u2019t go through with it. She says Raymond is no good, that he\u2019ll ruin my life, and that I\u2019m not fit to be a mother or a wife right now especially with what I\u2019ve been going through... the drastic mood swings, the ups and downs. She\u2019s probably right, but then again I feel like my life is already ruined, whether I\u2019m married and a mother or not. Besides, I really do think I might love Raymond. Maybe. But sometimes the mere thought of taking another breath seems like the biggest chore in the world. I wish I could stop breathing. I wonder if it\u2019s possible for someone to be able to hold their breath long enough to die. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe I should try.</p><p>I look over at the picture of her and the drawing of the flower in the vase. When did she draw this and when was the picture taken? When she wrote this? Before? After? Why am I obsessing over it so much? Just let it go.</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you ready for this?\u201d Micha asks as he loops his leather belt through the top of his worn jeans.</p> <p>Tensing, I close the journal, noting that he hesitantly glances at it. \u201cYeah, as ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He fastens his belt, then reaches for the cologne, glancing at the journal again as I climb off the bed. \u201cAre you going to ask your dad about the journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess now is as good a time as any.\u201d I\u2019m wearing a black and purple plaid shirt and jeans that are tucked into boots. I comb my fingers through my tangled hair and reach for my deodorant that\u2019s in my duffel bag. \u201cI just hope he doesn\u2019t act all weird about it.\u201d</p><p>Micha sets the cologne back down on the dresser beside a pile of his old guitar picks. \u201cWhy would he act weird about it?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, removing the cap from my deodorant. \u201cBecause it has to do with my mom, and what if he wants to read it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen let him read it.\u201d</p><p>I wipe some deodorant on my armpits and then toss it back into the bag. \u201cYeah, but it says stuff... about him... not nice stuff either, at least not great stuff about how she felt about marrying him.\u201d</p><p>His throat bobs up and down as he swallows hard, raking his fingers through his hair. \u201cYeah, maybe you shouldn\u2019t then.\u201d He pulls open the top dresser drawer and begins digging through it like he\u2019s looking for something when there are only a few old T-shirts in there.</p><p>I touch his arm lightly. \u201cMicha?\u201d</p><p>He stiffens under my touch. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you more than I\u2019ve wanted to do anything else in my life,\u201d I say, turning him so that he\u2019s facing me, even though he\u2019s got his head tipped down. \u201cAnd yes, I know that sounds super cheesy, but it\u2019s true so...\u201d I trail off as he leans in toward me.</p> <p>\u201cEven after everything you\u2019ve been reading?\u201d he asks, his hand cupping the side of my neck.</p><p>I nod and his mouth covers mine. I part my lips as his tongue devours me in a deep, passionate kiss, his fingers knotting through my hair, tugging at the roots, forcing my head back. When he pulls away he looks high on the kiss, eyes glazed, pupils wide, and I love him for it.</p><p>\u201cThere is something I want to talk to you about,\u201d I tell him, because I know it\u2019s time to ask questions that need to be asked. To have the talk about where we\u2019ll be in a few years, what our plans are for the future. \u201cBut let\u2019s do it after we tell my mom and your dad that we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks, his fingers unraveling through my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I say. \u201cBesides, if we don\u2019t get this whole wedding announcement thingy out in the open there isn\u2019t going to be a wedding, at least one that people can go to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going to have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t. Even when I was little, I never imagined getting married. In fact, when I thought about it, I thought about how much I didn\u2019t want it. I watched my mother and father fight too much, be miserable, fall apart, our household always on the verge of cracking until one day it shattered completely. But I\u2019ve changed. And it doesn\u2019t matter where it takes place or what I\u2019m wearing. I just want Micha there with me and I\u2019m good. \u201cIn your backyard?\u201d I suggest. \u201cI mean, a lot of stuff happened in the backyard.\u201d</p><p>His sucks on his lip ring, contemplating. \u201cYeah, a lot of things did, but a lot of things happened at our spot, too, so how about up by the lake. It\u2019s where we first said we loved each other, even if you don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t it be cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d</p><p>He has a point, but I still frown at the floor, my heart knotting in my chest as I remember the night on the bridge and how I almost jumped into the water. How Micha saved me. How I kissed him afterward to silence the three words I knew he was going to utter, words I can\u2019t get enough of now. I remember turning to leave, ready to bolt from him and my feelings, and then the rest of the night is only broken pieces in my mind because of the mixture of adrenaline and anxiety in my body, along with the pills I took from my mother\u2019s stash. Rain drops splashing against the asphalt. Puddles covering the ground. Water like black ink. Silver lightning blazing across the midnight sky. Micha\u2019s intoxicating warmth. \u201cYou never did tell me exactly what happened.\u201d I glance up at him. \u201cWould... would you tell me what happened? I want to know what happened the night I first told you I loved you.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me for what feels like an eternity, assessing me as he contemplates what I\u2019ve asked. Then instead of walking out of the room like I fear, he pulls me down onto the bed with him and wraps his arms around me. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll always give you whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Two and a half years earlier...</p><p>Micha</p><p>Rain hammers down from the sky and slams against the charcoal asphalt, soaking my jeans and T-shirt. Lightning zaps across the sky and thunder booms, reverberating through the metal beams around and above the bridge. My lips are numb from the cold air, Ella\u2019s kiss, and the fact that she\u2019s walking away from me.</p><p>\u201cElla May, don\u2019t you dare run away from this,\u201d I yell as I jog after her, my boots splashing against the puddles.</p><p>She\u2019s having a hard time walking, veering from left to right as the rain drenches her jeans, shirt, and hair. The beams of the headlights from my car parked in the center of the bridge light up the darkness and makes her looks like a shadow. \u201cMicha, just leave me alone. Please.\u201d She trips over her feet and falls to the ground. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from the pills she took, if she\u2019s been drinking, if it\u2019s the combination of the two, or the simple fact that she\u2019s having a panic attack.</p><p>I speed up and wrap my arms around her waist. As I help her to her feet, she wiggles her arms and tries to jab me with her elbows, attempting to shove me away.</p><p>\u201cJust let me go!\u201d she cries and I hear a sob in her voice. It splits my heart into pieces because she never cries. Ever. The pain she\u2019s feeling... God, I can\u2019t even think about it. \u201cPlease just let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say as I support her weight in my arms and help her back to my car. \u201cI\u2019m never going to let you go. Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d</p><p>Holding on to her with one hand, I maneuver the passenger door open as rain continues to drown us. I put my hand over her head and help her duck down into the car. Once she\u2019s sitting in the seat and the door is shut, I feel slightly better, the crushing weight in my chest lighter. Not gone, but lighter than when I pulled up and found her standing on the edge of the bridge.</p><p>I blink through the rain as I look over at the beam Ella was balancing on and then at the dark water below. \u201cGod damn it!\u201d I curse and kick the tire as I yank my fingers through my wet hair. How did everything turn this shitty? How could a beautiful, smart, wildly wonderful girl be handed so many shitty fucking cards. She\u2019s spent most of her life taking care of her parents, and then her mother takes her own life and her father blames her. Why does she have to deal with this? Why can\u2019t something good finally happen to her?</p><p>I have no idea how to handle this, but I know I have to try. Forcing my feet to move around the front of the car, I get into the driver\u2019s seat and slam the door. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking cold in here,\u201d I say, cranking up the heat as my wet clothes soak the leather seat.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look at me, keeping her forehead against the window and her hands lifelessly on her lap as rain drips from her hair onto her cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t feel anything,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>My heart sinks inside my chest and I have to take a slow breath before I speak. \u201cBaby, put your seat belt on.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, her eyes shutting. \u201cI... can\u2019t...\u201d She sounds exhausted, on the verge of passing out.</p><p>I lean over and reach across the front of her. When I grab the seat belt, she doesn\u2019t budge even when I pull it over her chest. As I\u2019m buckling her in, she abruptly shifts her weight toward me. The seat belt clicks into the lock as she rests her forehead against mine, her skin as cold as the rain outside.</p><p>\u201cYou almost... you almost said you love me...\u201d Her warm breath hits my skin as her eyes stay shut.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I swallow hard, but I\u2019m still afraid to move and break the connection between us. Water drips down my forehead, across my lips, and runs from my hand as I move my fingers away from the buckle and to her hip.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever said that to me before,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, my fingers shaking as I hold onto her.</p><p>Her shoulder turns inward and presses into mine as she slumps more of her weight into me. \u201cDid you... did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>I slowly nod without leaning away, causing friction between our foreheads. \u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicha I...\u201d she starts and my chest aches for her to say it. Just say it please. But then her forehead is leaving mine and she\u2019s moving back toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m really tired,\u201d she whispers, slumping her head against the window again.</p><p>I gradually inhale and then release, trying to steady my erratic heart. It takes more than a few breaths to get me to where I can even speak again. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not home,\u201d she utters. \u201cSomewhere else... I hate home...\u201d</p><p>I turn forward in my seat and watch the raindrops crash down against the hood and windshield. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere that will make me happy,\u201d she says and flinches when thunder booms.</p><p>Placing my hands on top of the steering wheel, I shut my eyes. Some place that will make her happy? I\u2019m not sure a place like that exists at the moment, but I have to try. Opening my eyes back up, I shove the shifter into reverse and back up off the bridge. When I reach the end, I put it into drive and crank the wheel, turning the car around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The road is flooded with puddles and the windshield wipers are cranked on high as I drive away from the bridge. Every time the thunder and lightning snaps, I jump, but Ella stays still, nearly motionless. When she does move, it\u2019s only to mess around with the iPod. She skims through the song list forever, her fingers fumbling over the buttons. She keeps shivering but when I ask her if she\u2019s cold she shakes her head. Finally she selects a song: \u201cThis Place Is a Prison,\u201d by The Postal Service. Then she slouches back in the seat, leans her head back against the headrest, and stares at the ceiling as the song plays through the speakers.</p><p>I continue to drive until I reach the side road that weaves out to a secluded area surrounded by trees and nestled near the edge of the lake. The road is a muddy mess and I\u2019m worried that we\u2019re going to get stuck. But somehow I manage to make it to our spot, the one Ella and I always go to be alone\u2014to be with each other. I park the car so it\u2019s facing the dark water and leave the headlights on. The water ripples against the raindrops as the wipers move back and forth across the windshield.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d I finally say, not staring at the lake.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I should have jumped,\u201d she says emotionlessly.</p><p>Something snaps inside me and I lose it. \u201cNo, you fucking don\u2019t!\u201d I ram my fist against the top of the wheel and she jumps, lifting her head up, and stares at me with wide eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dead, so stop saying it.\u201d My voice softens as I reach over and tuck strands of wet hair behind her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re just confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she protests. \u201cI know exactly what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d But I can tell she doesn\u2019t by the glossiness of her eyes, the vastness of her pupils, and the fact that she\u2019s struggling to keep her eyelids open. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here anymore, Micha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d I choke, cupping her cheek.</p><p>She swallows hard, her eyes scanning mine. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I thought you knew exactly what you were thinking?\u201d I say, not sure if I\u2019m going about this the right way, but it\u2019s the only way I know how.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that I don\u2019t want to feel this.\u201d She slams her hand over her chest, a little too hard. Her eyes are wildly big, filled with fear and panic as her chest heaves for air. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel all this pain and guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mother wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d I place a very unsteady hand over hers, worried I\u2019m going to fuck this up. I\u2019m stunned by how rapidly her heart is beating, thrashing against our hands. She\u2019s probably got so much adrenaline pouring through she\u2019s lightheaded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what my dad and Dean say,\u201d she whispers, pulling her hand away and forcing mine to fall from her chest.</p><p>\u201cYour dad and your brother are fucking assholes,\u201d I tell her firmly, leaning over the console. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter what they think\u2014no one else matters but you and me. Remember, you and me against the world.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids shut and then flutter open again. \u201cYou\u2019re always saying that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I mean it. I don\u2019t care about anything else. I could lose anyone else and make it through. But not you, Ella May. I can\u2019t do this without you.\u201d</p><p>A few tears fall down her cheeks. \u201cI hate myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla, God damn it, don\u2019t say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouts, jerking away from me and huddling against the door. \u201cI fucking hate myself! I do! And I wish you\u2019d just see what I really am. You\u2019re always seeing more in me than what there really is...\u201d She drifts off as more tears spill out and she scans the outside of the car, the trees, the water, the rain, like she\u2019s contemplating running. \u201cIf you\u2019d just let me go, you\u2019d be happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I ball my hands to keep from touching her because I know it\u2019s going to set her off more. \u201cI...\u201d I blow out an uneven breath, knowing that what I\u2019m about to say is going to change everything, even if she won\u2019t remember it in the morning. I will. I can\u2019t go back from it and honestly I don\u2019t fucking want to. \u201cI fucking love you. Don\u2019t you get that?\u201d I unclench my hands and stretch my arm over to her, grabbing her arm as she shakes her head. \u201cI love you.\u201d My voice softens. \u201cAnd no matter what happens, with you or me\u2014with us\u2014I\u2019m always going to love you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders start to heave and she gives in to my hold, allowing me to pull her over the console and onto my lap. Then I wrap my arm around her and cradle her head against my chest as she sobs into my wet shirt. I smoothe my hand down her head, each sob tearing at my heart. I stare out into the rain, watching it splash against the lake, feeling so helpless. I wish I could take all of her pain and guilt away. She doesn\u2019t deserve this\u2014she doesn\u2019t deserve anything. What she does deserve is someone to love her unconditionally, which I\u2019ve been trying to do for a while, if she\u2019d just let me. I need to find a way.</p><p>\u201cMicha.\u201d The sound of her strained voice jerks me back to reality.</p><p>When I glance down at her, she\u2019s looking up like she\u2019s lost and has no idea where she is as she clutches onto my shirt. I know she\u2019s probably going to fall asleep soon and when morning rolls around there\u2019s a good chance she won\u2019t remember any of this.</p> <p>I trace a finger underneath her eyes, wiping the tears away. \u201cYeah, baby?\u201d</p><p>She takes a deep breath and then she\u2019s pulling on my shirt, forcing me to get close to her. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispers and then she presses her lips against mine. She kisses me briefly, but it\u2019s enough that I feel it all the way through me. I clutch on to her as I kiss her back with every ounce of emotion I have in me, wishing it could be just like this all the time. But just as quickly as it all began, it stops as she leans away and settles back in my arms. Moments later, she\u2019s asleep.</p><p>I listen to the rhythm of her breathing and the longer I sit there holding her, the fiercer my heart beats, and no matter how hard I try to keep them back, eventually tears escape my eyes. My head falls forward against the steering wheel and I cry quietly through the sounds of the rain. Crying for her. For the life she was handed. Because I\u2019m so in love with her it hurts me to see her like this. Because I know when morning comes, there\u2019s a good chance she won\u2019t remember this.</p><p>Because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose her forever.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Ella</p><p>When Micha finishes telling me what happened, I lay quietly on the bed with him, my head right over his heart. It\u2019s beating faster than it normally does and I wonder if he\u2019s feeling what he felt that night. The fear I put in him and whatever else was going through his head at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember any of that,\u201d I say, looking up at him. \u201cI think it was the combination of the pills and my... my anxiety. Things sometimes get blurry when I go to that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, staring down at me. \u201cLike I said, I knew that night there would be a good chance you wouldn\u2019t remember any of it. I just thought that I\u2019d never see you again after it happened.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretches between us as I struggle to remember and he struggles to forget.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell him because it\u2019s the only thing I can think of to say. There are no words that could possibly even begin to explain to him how bad I feel for putting him through that and for me doing it to begin with. It still hurts to even think about it, how I was about to throw everything away\u2014everything I have with Micha now. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>He moves me with him as he sits up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry for something that happened a few years ago\u2014something that wasn\u2019t even in your control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning away was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I thought so at first, but now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely true. I think sometimes in life shit happens and people have to do what they can to move past it.\u201d The corners of his mouth tug upward into a sad smile. \u201cFor you, that was running away and for me... with my father, it was deciding it was better to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I came back.\u201d I tuck my legs under me and kneel up between his legs. \u201cWell, I came back for summer break because I had to, but now I\u2019m back, for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His fingers spread across my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s called healing, Ella May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it is,\u201d I agree. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t let your father back into your life, even if he tried.\u201d</p><p>His thumb grazes my bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019ve got everyone I need in my life. My mom. You. Even Ethan and Lila. That\u2019s more than a lot of people have.\u201d His hand leaves my lips and he threads his fingers through mine so the O-ring on his finger is pressed against my engagement ring. \u201cBesides, I have you forever. And one day we\u2019ll have our own family and that\u2019s what will matter in the end.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what kind of face I make, but he definitely notes a shift as I move to the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, sitting up straight and sliding his long legs over the edge of the bed and his feet onto the floor.</p><p>I wanted to prepare myself for this talk, about our future, where we\u2019re going, but now it\u2019s kind of unavoidable because he said our own family... Shit. Does he mean kids and everything? \u201cI\u2019ve actually been meaning to talk to you about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Having you forever, or having a family of our own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cThe last part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout having a family.\u201d He speaks slowly and cautiously like he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to scare me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sort of...\u201d I struggle to talk about a subject that makes me feel so uneasy. \u201cI mean, where are we even going?\u201d</p><p>He looks puzzled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following you, pretty girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre we...\u201d God, this is so difficult. \u201cWhen you say family, are you... are you talking about having kids?\u201d</p><p>He considers his next words wisely. \u201cNot having kids right at this moment, but having them in the future, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if... what if I said I didn\u2019t want to have kids?\u201d I bring my feet back onto the bed and sit cross-legged.</p> <p>He scratches his scruffy jawline as he brings his feet up on the bed and faces me, crisscrossing his legs. \u201cIt all depends on why you don\u2019t want to have them, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do want to have them?\u201d I\u2019m a little surprised that he doesn\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><p>His eyes search mine and then he definitively nods. \u201cNot right now, but eventually way down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I said that way down the road I couldn\u2019t see myself as a mother.\u201d I chew on my lip nervously. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>He slips his fingers through mine and holds both of my hands. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you see yourself as a mother?\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes and pull one of my hands away to gesture at myself. \u201cI think it\u2019s sort of obvious.\u201d</p><p>He looks genuinely perplexed. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of who I am.\u201d I struggle for words. \u201cBecause of my problems. Because I don\u2019t even know what being a mother entails. I mean, I had a few good moments growing up, but other than that I pretty much took care of my mother instead of the other way around.\u201d</p><p>He wiggles his fingers from my hand, grabs my knees, and drags me closer to him. \u201cExactly, which is why I think you\u2019ll make a great mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong,\u201d I disagree. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019ll make me a very confused mom.\u201d</p><p>His hands glide from my knees to my thighs and his fingers jab into my skin like he\u2019s afraid to let me go. \u201cNo way. As much as I hate it, you took care of everyone in that household. You cooked. Cleaned. Paid the bills. Helped your mom take her medication. Stayed home and took care of her while your father went out to the bar every night acting like a teenager. At sixteen, Ella May, you were more responsible than a lot of thirty-year-olds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did stupid stuff, too,\u201d I remind him. \u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting all the fights I got into, all the roofs I jumped off of, the many times I made you drive reckless and tested the boundaries of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to breathe somehow.\u201d</p><p>I think about what he said, squirming because all this positive talk about me is making me uneasy. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously freaking me out right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth. You\u2019ll make an awesome mom if and when that time comes around.\u201d</p><p>I eye him over with skepticism. \u201cAnd what if it doesn\u2019t? What if I say there\u2019s just no way I can do it? What if I say that I just want to spend the rest of my life drawing and listening to you sing? Just you and I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess it\u2019ll be just you and I growing old together,\u201d he says with a trace of a smile on his lips. \u201cAnd I can live with that, too. I can live with anything just as long as you fucking marry me.\u201d And with that, he gets to his feet. \u201cThis weekend. No more messing around.\u201d He sticks out his hand and I take it, nodding.</p><p>He pulls me to my feet and we walk toward the door. \u201cAlthough, I must say that we would make beautiful babies together.\u201d He flashes me a cocky grin and I roll my eyes. \u201cImagine one with your hair and my amazing eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too cocky for your own good. Besides, I\u2019d rather they had your hair and my eyes. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the color.\u201d My face twists in disgust I grab a few strands. \u201cAlthough I love your eyes, too. Maybe she could just have your hair and eyes.\u201d</p> <p>His brow crooks up as he starts to pull the door open \u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my tongue, realizing my slipup. \u201cDid I say \u2018she\u2019?\u201d I feign dumb.</p><p>He nods and there\u2019s a sparkle in his aqua eyes as we step out into the hallway. \u201cSo you\u2019d want a girl?\u201d</p><p>I fight for oxygen and then seal my lips. If I could picture myself with a kid, I picture it as a little girl, all punked out with blond hair and blue eyes. I\u2019m not ready to admit that aloud yet, though. \u201cCan we just go tell your mom about the wedding?\u201d I ask, trying to sound neutral, but my voice comes out more off pitch than I intended. \u201cBefore Lila and Ethan let it slip out.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me for about five seconds longer and I wonder whom he sees. The girl he met when he was four? Or the one who ran away when she was eighteen? Or this new one who thinks about weddings and babies? \u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he finally says and starts down the hall.</p><p>He\u2019s always saying that and I tug on his arm, stopping him. \u201cWhat about what you want for once?\u201d</p><p>He pauses, searching my eyes for God knows what. \u201cI have everything I want right here,\u201d he says simply, and I can tell he means it.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Micha</p><p>The whole baby talk with Ella was a little weird, but it needed to be talked about, I guess. I\u2019d never thought that much about it, but having kids wouldn\u2019t be so bad, down the road of course. It\u2019s not like I worry I\u2019d turn into a shitty father like mine. I think I was always a bit more like my mom than him and I\u2019m glad. But I want to make sure that Ella and I are both in the right place if we decide to have them.</p><p>I meant everything I said. Either way, kids or not, I\u2019ll be happy as long as I\u2019m with her. But I think now I really need to talk to her about my future in music and the tour coming up. I should have probably told her right after the baby talk since we were talking about our future. It would have been a good time, but I was scared and nervous of what she would say\u2014or what she wouldn\u2019t say. Music is my passion, my emotional outlet in really hard times, and Ella knows this and I know she\u2019ll be supportive, but what I don\u2019t know is if she\u2019ll come with, and if she does, will she be doing it because she wants to or because she thinks it\u2019s what I want? And if she doesn\u2019t, then that means I have to give it up\u2014give up my dream. And knowing that makes me want to avoid it as long as possible.</p><p>With the tour and our future still lingering in my mind, we enter the kitchen with our fingers linked, the fresh aroma of coffee in the air. I feel like I\u2019m seven years old again and Ella and I are telling my mom how we broke our next-door neighbor Mrs. Millerson\u2019s garden gnome because we wanted to see if it was a real gnome. Mrs. Millerson had caught us and told us we had to get her a new one. We thought we were going to get yelled at but thankfully my mom always went a little easy on me due to the fact that my dad bailed out and she\u2019s always had a soft spot for Ella.</p><p>But now instead of telling my mom about the broken gnome we\u2019re telling her that we want to have a wedding in five days and how we almost got married without her. My mom flips out at first, more than I thought she would, but her anger turns to excitement when I remind her that yeah, we were going to get married without her but we decided not to.</p><p>Thomas, my mom\u2019s boyfriend who\u2019s a little younger than her, is in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal at the table while all this goes on. He looks a little more cleaned up than when we last saw him, at least he\u2019s wearing a clean T-shirt and jeans without holes in them. My mom is still dressing like she\u2019s younger\u2014her shirt has all this flashy diamond shit on it and there\u2019s some on the trim of her pants. But I don\u2019t say anything about it. I get that she\u2019s happy and even though I still think Thomas is an idiot, especially when he drips milk on the front of his shirt, he seems to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re really going to do this?\u201d my mom asks with a grin on her face as she pours a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I ask, exchanging a confused glance with Ella, who shrugs, as confused as I am.</p><p>My mom shakes her head at me as she sets the coffeepot down on the counter near the sink. \u201cGet married.\u201d</p><p>I press back a smirk. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was a we thing.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, like I\u2019m a silly little child, and walks past us, making her way across the kitchen to the fridge. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean we as in all of us.\u201d She opens the fridge door and takes out a gallon of milk. \u201cI meant we as in you and Ella.\u201d She beams at Ella as she pours milk into her coffee. \u201cThe daughter I never had. God, this is going to be so much fun.\u201d</p><p>Ella steps back, tensing, shying away because my mom\u2019s enthusiasm is scaring the shit out of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be so much fun?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cPlanning your wedding.\u201d My mom glances at Ella and me as she puts the milk back into the fridge. \u201cYou two are going to have the best wedding. I\u2019m going to make sure of that.\u201d</p><p>I pull Ella toward me and circle my arms around her waist, trying to ease her panic. \u201cYou know you have only five days to plan it and then we have to return home, right?\u201d I tell my mom.</p><p>My mom clasps her hands together and glances over her shoulder at the snowflakes drifting down from the cloudy sky. It\u2019s early afternoon but with the lack of sunlight it looks like it\u2019s late in the day. \u201cFive days is perfect.\u201d She returns her attention to us. \u201cI can do a lot in five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re all broke,\u201d I remind her, pressing Ella\u2019s back against my chest. She\u2019s being really quiet and it\u2019s making me nervous. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s all the wedding talk that\u2019s freaking her out or the fact that we just had a baby talk.</p><p>\u201cI have some money saved up.\u201d My mom collects her cup of coffee from off the counter. \u201cAnd besides, you can have a nice wedding without spending a whole lot of money.\u201d Her eyes land on Ella. \u201cDo you have a dress already?\u201d</p><p>Ella shakes her head and then blinks at my mom distractedly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dress, sweetie.\u201d My mom looks at me questioningly from over the top of her cup as she takes a swallow. \u201cDoes she have one yet?\u201d</p><p>I lean over Ella\u2019s shoulder to catch her eye and I\u2019m startled by the layer of water in her eyes. There\u2019s something wrong and I need to find out what. \u201cYeah, she has one,\u201d I say to my mom and then grab Ella\u2019s hand and lead her toward the hallway, calling over my shoulder. \u201cMom, we\u2019ll be right back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ella absentmindedly follows me. Once I get her into the hallway and out of my mother\u2019s gaze, I stop us and whirl her around to face me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, examining her watery eyes.</p><p>She stares over my shoulder at a few framed pictures of my mom and me hanging on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p> <p>I place my hand on her cheek and force her to look at me. \u201cIt is something; otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be about ready to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d Tears bubble in the corner of her eyes and her voice cracks. \u201cIt\u2019s just that... God, this is so stupid.\u201d She rubs the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing you say is stupid,\u201d I assure her, wiping a stray tear away with my thumb.</p><p>She frowns doubtfully at me. \u201cEven when I told you that I was pretty sure we could push to one hundred miles per hour when there was a foot of snow on the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, we all have our drunk moments,\u201d I say, recollecting the night she\u2019s talking about. How she was a little drunk and a little excited over the fact that some dude told her she had a nice ass. She would never admit that was what was making her all cheery, but I could tell it was and it was fucking annoying.</p> <p>\u201cGo faster,\u201d she\u2019d begged from the passenger seat with her head against the dashboard as she watched the night sky through the window. \u201cGo, like, a hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I\u2019d replied, shifting into a lower gear as the engine grumbled. The road was dangerous going twenty-five, the car barely able to keep any sort of traction as we slid up the vacant street, heading home.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Micha Scott.\u201d She sat up and ran her fingers through her hair. She had on a leather jacket and a black shirt underneath it that had a low collar and I could see the curves of her breasts. The sight made me hard, which pissed me off because another guy had put a smile on her face. \u201cJust try it. If things get too crazy, you can stop.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, ripping my gaze from her cleavage. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk and thinking stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not very nice.\u201d She\u2019d pouted. I hated when she pouted because she looked ridiculously sexy and it made it difficult to deny her anything she was asking for, even if it meant us getting killed. She propped her elbows onto the console and leaned over, putting her face only inches away from my cheek. \u201cCome on, just do it. For me.\u201d She had this amused, drunk look on her face. She was too gorgeous, perfect, beautiful for her own good. If I could, I would have told her that. Told her how amazingly perfect she was and how I could spend thousands of hours writing lyrics about how beautiful she was and it wouldn\u2019t even begin to describe it.</p><p>My eyes may have been on the road but all my attention was on her. \u201cPretty girl, I\u2019m not going to kill us, no matter how hard you beg.\u201d</p> <p>Her lip popped out even more as she slumped back in the seat. \u201cFine. Don\u2019t have any fun.\u201d Propping her boots on the console, she\u2019d slouched back against the seat. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why you keep calling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, pretty girl?\u201d I smiled amusedly as she nodded with a frown, her eyelids drifting shut as exhaustion took her over. I took a chance, telling her the truth, knowing that she probably wouldn\u2019t remember it by morning. \u201cIt\u2019s because I think you\u2019re beautiful, but I can never get away with calling you beautiful without you kicking my ass, so I settled for a more milder version of the truth.\u201d I sighed as she passed out, her knees slumping to the side and falling off the dash and onto the floor. Then her head lowered down against the console and she wiggled it to the side until it was pressed against my ribs and her hair was on my lap. Smiling, I slowed down the car and took my time getting home. The night actually turned out to be pretty fucking perfect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot more stupid moments than you.\u201d Ella\u2019s voice jerks me from the memory.</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt that,\u201d I argue, bracing my hand on the wall beside her head. \u201cAnd I doubt that whatever you\u2019re going to tell me is going to sound stupid.\u201d</p><p>She rubs her hand over her face, leaving red lines on her skin. \u201cPart of the reason...\u201d She clears her throat. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about mom stuff. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... about getting married... without a mom around.\u201d She wavers. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason why I wanted to get married here. So we would be close to her.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks into my stomach. Through all of this, I\u2019d never even thought about that. About how she must be feeling about her mom not being around for all of this.</p> <p>\u201cSee, I told you it was stupid,\u201d she says with a heavyhearted sigh. \u201cI should just keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not stupid. Not at all.\u201d I pause, considering my next words carefully because they\u2019re important. \u201cDo you want to have it somewhere near the cemetery?\u201d</p><p>She quickly shakes her head. \u201cNo, I like by the lake. It\u2019s just nice knowing she\u2019s in the same town. God, this is so weird. I\u2019m talking about her like she\u2019s still alive.\u201d Her voice quivers at the end and she looks away, avoiding eye contact with me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d With my hand, I turn her head back toward me. \u201cNothing about wanting your mother near you is weird, whether she\u2019s alive or not.\u201d</p><p>She smiles sadly, but it\u2019s nice to see her smile while we\u2019re talking about her mom, even if it\u2019s a sad smile. \u201cWell, I still want to have it at the lake,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd my dad will be there, so I guess it won\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dean and Caroline?\u201d I ask. \u201cShould we invite them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaroline\u2019s pregnant so I\u2019m not even sure she could and it\u2019s super short notice,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d I give her a quick kiss on the lips and then step back. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to invite them, then fine. But, I mean, you do get married only once, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her lips creep into a malicious grin. \u201cOh, I plan on getting married a lot. At least ten to twenty times. You\u2019re just my practice husband.\u201d She playfully nudges me with her shoulder.</p><p>I embrace her and catch her off guard as I tackle her to the floor like I used to when we were kids. My hand snaps out before we hit the carpet and I catch her weight. Then I hold my body up slightly away from her so I don\u2019t crush her.</p><p>\u201cMicha.\u201d She laughs, her legs opening up so my body falls in between them. Her fingers span across my shoulder blades as I press on her lower back, our legs entangled. \u201cGet off me. We\u2019re too old for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I say. Heat radiates between our bodies and her hair is sprawled around her head and across the carpet, and the tears that were in her eyes moments ago are gone. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be too old for this. Ever. I will still tackle you when we\u2019re ninety years old.\u201d</p><p>She stares up at me for a moment, her expression unreadable, her pulse hammering through her fingertips. \u201cYou make me happy,\u201d she says in a shaky voice.</p><p>It may seem like such a simple statement, but for Ella to admit she\u2019s happy is a huge, major, life-changing event and gives me hope that everything will end up okay.</p><p>\u201cAnd vice versa,\u201d I say and then kiss her.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Ella</p><p>Telling Micha\u2019s mom was a piece of cake. Well, except for the part when I told Micha my strange thought process about having the wedding in Star Grove because I\u2019d feel closer to my mom. That was a little weird. But Micha being... well, Micha, he made me feel okay about feeling that way. Lighter. Which is good, because there\u2019s a chance that after I tell my dad, not just about the wedding but about my grandmother and the box she sent me, the lightness may shift to graveness.</p><p>Micha goes over to my house with me, our fingers entwined like we\u2019re kids about to tell something really bad to our parents. But we\u2019re not kids and getting married isn\u2019t a bad thing, but sometimes talking to my dad can turn that way. Although it hasn\u2019t in a while. He\u2019s actually been really nice and chatty lately.</p><p>When I enter the house, I nearly drop dead on the floor because it\u2019s clean. There are no alcohol bottles littering the yellow and brown countertops. He\u2019s bought a new kitchen table, too, a new-used kitchen table anyway. It\u2019s white and has a bench on one side and two chairs on the other. The floor is still stained, but it has recently been swept and mopped, the air smelling like Pine-Sol mixed with cinnamon. There aren\u2019t any past-due envelopes on the counters or table. I remember the last time I was here how the house was going to get foreclosed but he managed to get it out of it, working overtime and paying the amount past due.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Micha says as he turns in a circle, rubbing his jawline as he examines the kitchen. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve entered an episode of The Twilight Zone.\u201d</p><p>I let go of his hand and cross the kitchen to the table, picking up a decorative ceramic rooster. The head pops off and it starts to make a loud rooster noise as I glance inside. \u201cOh my God, there\u2019s homemade cookies in it.\u201d</p><p>Micha laughs as he strolls up behind me. \u201cYou sound so adorable.\u201d He sweeps my hair to the side and his lips caress the back of my neck. \u201cGetting excited over cookies.\u201d</p><p>I take a cookie out, put the rooster head back on, and then set it back down on the table. \u201cSo what? The only cookies I ever had when I was growing up were Oreo cookies.\u201d I bite down on the homemade chocolate chip cookie and turn around to face him. \u201cAnd you would always make us share those and then would take the half with all the filling. You always gave me whatever I wanted except when it came to those damn cookies.\u201d</p><p>He steals a big bite of my cookie. \u201cWhat can I say? I may love you but I love frosting just a little bit more.\u201d He swallows the cookie and then opens his mouth to steal another bite but I stuff the entire cookie into my mouth, lifting my eyebrows, giving him an arrogant look.</p><p>Arrogance rises on his face too and then he covers my mouth with his, slipping his tongue between my lips, trying to steal bites of chewed-up cookie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jerk back, laughing, and making a repulsed face. \u201cYou are so gross,\u201d I say, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand.</p><p>He licks his lips and then grins. \u201cI win.\u201d</p><p>I stick out my tongue, which has gooey chewed-up cookie on it. \u201cThat is what you just ate.\u201d</p> <p>His tongue slips out over his lips again. \u201cAnd it was so, so good.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but can\u2019t stop smiling, and then I roll my eyes at myself because I\u2019m turning into one of those girls who gushes around their boyfriend... fianc\u00e9... soon-to-be husband. Reality suddenly slaps me in the face and my eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m going to be Ella May Scott.\u201d I breathe, not sure whether I\u2019m panicking or just surprised.</p><p>Micha\u2019s mouth sinks to a frown, the arrogance dissipating. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because he just realized that too or because of my alarmed statement. I open my mouth to say something, but then my dad enters the kitchen and my words get stuck in my mouth.</p><p>Despite the clean sight of the kitchen, my dad still looks grungy and rough around the edges. He\u2019s wearing an oversized plaid jacket over a holey navy-blue shirt and his jeans have paint on them, along with the boots he\u2019s wearing because he works as a painting contractor now. His face is unshaven and he looks a little heavier than the last time I saw him a year ago but his eyes are clear, not bloodshot, and while he does smell like cigarette smoke, it\u2019s not mixed with the smell of booze.</p> <p>He stumbles over his boots when he sees me standing in front of the table and then catches himself on the door frame. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d He takes a good look at me as he blinks. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I thought you couldn\u2019t make it home this year for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>I huddle closer to Micha, almost as a defense mechanism. Even though I know my dad is doing much better, I can\u2019t entirely forget the past. When he was drunk. When he blamed me for my mother\u2019s death. When he wouldn\u2019t even look at me because it hurt him too much.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we had a change of plans,\u201d I tell him as I feel Micha\u2019s fingers brush my own.</p><p>My dad lets go of the door frame and steps up beside the counter. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad, Ella,\u201d he says awkwardly, a trait that is very common whenever we\u2019re around each other. He massages the back of his neck tensely, glancing around the clean kitchen. \u201cIf I would have known you were coming, I\u2019d have stocked up the cupboards and stuff with food or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re actually staying over at Micha\u2019s house anyway.\u201d</p><p>My dad\u2019s gaze flickers back and forth between Micha and me. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Silence draws out between us and I can\u2019t help but think about what my mom said in the journal about him. How she wasn\u2019t thrilled to be marrying him. How her mother didn\u2019t want her to marry him. How depressed she was. Did he know about all this? Because he once told me things weren\u2019t always bad, that things used to be good between them. Was it because my mom hid her depression and dark thoughts from him? Is that how I am with Micha since I can\u2019t seem to talk to him about my fears of getting married and having a future?</p><p>Finally Micha clears his throat and jabs me in the side with his elbow.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d I shake my thoughts out of my head. \u201cI actually have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>My dad looks bewildered as he leans against the counter and folds his arms. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember how I told you a couple of weeks ago that Micha and I were getting married?\u201d I rub my finger along the stones of the ring, trying to calm the nervousness in my voice. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m nervous, other than that I\u2019m worried that my dad is going to say or do something that will ruin the amazingness I\u2019ve been feeling lately. I think it\u2019s just scars from my past that are causing the worry, but they\u2019re still there.</p><p>My dad nods. \u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we were going to get married in San Diego, but we decided to come back and have the wedding here,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThis weekend actually, on Christmas day.\u201d</p><p>His eyes enlarge and then travel down to my stomach. \u201cElla, you\u2019re not...\u201d He shoots Micha a dirty look as he stands up straight and looks around the kitchen, avoiding eye contact with both of us, appearing uneasy even for him. \u201cYou\u2019re not...\u201d</p> <p>As it clicks what he thinks I throw my hand over my stomach. \u201cWhat? No. I\u2019m not... I\u2019m not pregnant. God.\u201d I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d think that. I\u2019ve been careful not to let that happen and have been on the pill for a year now.</p><p>He frowns, looking unconvinced. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Micha chuckles under his breath and I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d I hiss, but laughter threatens its way up my throat, too. I know it\u2019s not funny, especially since I found out that my mom and he got married because she was pregnant with Dean, yet it is. He\u2019s acting like a dad and it\u2019s hilarious because I\u2019m twenty years old and this is the first real time I\u2019ve seen him come even remotely close to playing the part.</p><p>\u201cI promise she\u2019s not pregnant, Mr. Daniels,\u201d Micha says, shooting me a quick grin. \u201cWe just decided it was time.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Daniels? I mouth at him. Really?</p><p>Micha nonchalantly shrugs and gives me an innocent look, mouthing, What?</p><p>My dad\u2019s gazes flicks back and forth between Micha and me. \u201cBut you\u2019re... you\u2019re so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo were you and... mom,\u201d I point out with hesitancy because it goes against what I\u2019m trying to prove, but he doesn\u2019t know that I know about mom being pregnant when they said I do.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but...\u201d My dad trails off, staring at the back door. \u201cThat was different, though... things between your mom and me... they were complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was pregnant.\u201d I reveal that I know the truth, unable to keep it in any longer. When his eyes snap wide, I add, \u201cMom\u2019s mom... my grandmother sent me a box of her stuff and it had this... mom\u2019s journal in it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause where I can hear everyone breathing and a car revs its engine from somewhere outside.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t from your grandmother,\u201d my dad says with a heavy sigh, unfolding his arms. \u201cWell, it was, but she didn\u2019t mail it to you. Her lawyer did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer lawyer?\u201d Micha and I say at the same time.</p><p>My dad nods, looking very uneasy. \u201cShe actually passed away about a month ago and I guess there was this box found in the nursing home with your name on it. The lawyer handling her will called me up, looking for you so he could send it to you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s dead? I\u2019m a little shocked and I feel strangely saddened, which is weird because I never spoke to the woman. But still she was my grandmother.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to react because I didn\u2019t know the woman at all, yet it makes me sort of sad, knowing I\u2019ll never get to know her. I\u2019d even considered it for a brief second, when I\u2019d read over her note in the box, and now the possibility is gone.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give me a heads-up?\u201d I ask my dad and Micha protectively scoots closer to me, like he can sense something bad is about to happen.</p><p>My dad reaches for his cigarettes in his jacket pocket. \u201cBecause it\u2019s hard to talk to you about that stuff... especially about stuff like death and certain people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd about your mother... because it was a box of her stuff and I wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d react or how I felt... feel about it.\u201d</p><p>My mouth makes an O as my dad opens the pack, plucks out a cigarette, and plops it into his mouth. He pats down his jeans for the lighter and finds it in his back pocket. Once he gets the cigarette lit and inhales a soothing cloud of smoke, he looks more relaxed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a touchy subject for both of us.\u201d He reaches across the counter for an ashtray near the sink. He taps the cigarette on the side and then holds it in his fingers, smoke filtering through the room and erasing the delicious cinnamon scent. \u201cBut my... therapist says I should start working on talking about it more, especially with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a therapist?\u201d I\u2019m surprised. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>He looks over at Micha with reluctance, then sticks the end of the cigarette into his mouth and takes another drag. \u201cFor a month. My sponsor thought it\u2019d be a good idea.\u201d His phone rings from inside his pocket and he holds up his finger. \u201cJust a second,\u201d he says as he retrieves his phone. He checks the screen and then answers it, walking out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGod, are all the Daniels seriously messed?\u201d I mutter under my breath. \u201cHe\u2019s seeing a therapist, too? First my brother, then me, and now my dad. It could be like the family motto: enter my family and your head\u2019s going to get messed up and you\u2019ll have to have a shrink put it back together again.\u201d I peek over at Micha.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think it,\u201d he warns. \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy and you\u2019re not going to ruin my life. You\u2019ll only ruin it if you leave me.\u201d</p><p>His words remind me that I\u2019m not that person anymore, the one who pushes people away. I need him and he needs me. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I promise.\u201d I blow out a breath. \u201cBut can you give me a minute?\u201d I ask him. \u201cI think I need to talk to my dad alone.\u201d</p><p>He seems reluctant. \u201cAre you sure? Because I don\u2019t mind hanging around even if it means enduring your dad\u2019s awkwardness.\u201d</p><p>I nod and give his hand a comforting squeeze. \u201cI just want to ask him a few things about my mom and I think he\u2019ll answer more easily if it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>Micha remains still for a few seconds longer and then, nodding, he backs away, holding onto my hand until we\u2019re far enough away that our fingers slip apart. \u201cIf you\u2019re not back in, like, an hour,\u201d he says, opening the back door and letting snow and a chilly breeze gust in, \u201cthen I\u2019m coming back for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMicha, what do you think\u2019s going to happen?\u201d I joke. \u201cIt\u2019s just my dad.\u201d</p><p>He intensely holds my gaze, making a point without saying it. There have been many times where painful, hurtful things have happened between my dad and me.</p><p>\u201cAll right, see you in an hour,\u201d I promise and he steps outside, drawing his hood over his head as he shuts the door.</p> <p>I pull out a chair and sink down into it, then steal another cookie from the rooster jar. I\u2019m stuffing the last bit of it into my mouth when my dad walks in, clutching his phone.</p><p>He glances around the empty chairs. \u201cWhere\u2019d Micha go?\u201d</p><p>I swallow the cookie and brush the crumbs off the table. \u201cHome for a little bit, so you and I could talk about some stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do need to talk.\u201d He sits down, then glances at the rooster on the table without the lid on. \u201cI see you found the cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but who made them?\u201d I wonder curiously. \u201cYou?\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head as he puts the lid back on. \u201cNo, Amanda did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Amanda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman I met while I was staying at the alcoholism treatment center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she another recovering alcoholic?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pushes his sleeves up and rests his arms on the table. \u201cShe was the secretary there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say. \u201cSo... are you, like, dating her?\u201d</p> <p>He scratches his head. \u201cUm... sort of... I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, at a loss for words. It\u2019s weird he\u2019s dating because he\u2019s my dad and the only person I\u2019ve seen him with is my mom, but then again their relationship was beyond rocky. \u201cIs she the one who cleaned the house?\u201d</p><p>His hand falls from his head to the table. \u201cNo, I cleaned it. Why?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cJust wondered. It looks nice.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a look, like he wants to say more, but then he changes the subject, relaxing back in the chair. \u201cSo what was in the box?\u201d he asks rigidly. \u201cI know it was stuff that belonged to your mother, but what exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s journal and a few other things, like drawings and photos.\u201d I pause at the sudden increase of my heart rate. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she liked to draw.\u201d</p><p>He stares down at the table with a sad look on his face. \u201cShe did when she was younger,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut she stopped not too long after we got married.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so hard to be talking about this aloud, asking him questions, but I force myself to continue because I want to know\u2014understand. \u201cWhy did she stop?\u201d</p> <p>When he glances up, his eyes are little watery. \u201cBecause she stopped enjoying it and so there was no point, at least that\u2019s what she told me.\u201d</p><p>I trace the patterns of the wood in the table, staring down at them, because I can\u2019t look him in the eye with what I\u2019m about to say. \u201cYou told me once, when I was... when I was dropping you off at the recovery clinic, that things weren\u2019t always bad. But when was that? I know her bipolar disorder progressively got worse, but even from the start it always felt like mom was sad all the time.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent for a while and I worry I might have upset him. But when I look up at him, he\u2019s just staring at me like I\u2019m a person, not a painful reminder of the woman he once loved, which is how he used to look at me all the time.</p><p>\u201cThings were never one hundred percent normal when it came to your mom,\u201d he says, his voice strained. \u201cBut in the beginning she had way more ups than she did downs. And her... episodes... they were few and far in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she ever happy?\u201d</p><p>Again it takes him a moment to answer. \u201cShe was happy sometimes. I think anyway. It was so hard to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was it so hard to tell?\u201d Deep down, though, I think I know the answer. Because sometimes it\u2019s hard to be happy or to even admit that you\u2019re good enough to be happy, that you do deserve it, so you refuse to feel it, fight it. It\u2019s my own thought process sometimes and I hate it, but I\u2019ve also learned to deal with it... I think.</p><p>He smiles, but it\u2019s a sad smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way she was, Ella May. And I really want to believe she was happy, even though she didn\u2019t show it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s weird hearing him call me that and it throws me off and I let a question slip out that I probably shouldn\u2019t. \u201cWhy did you love her?\u201d I ask and then pull a remorseful face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad. You don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, more water building up in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can ask me things. I\u2019m doing better with... stuff.\u201d He pauses, deliberating, and then his breath falters. \u201cI loved her because in the beginning she was erratic and impulsive and she could make life really surprising and... unpredictable. \u201d He stares over my shoulder, lost in memories and for a brief moment he almost looks happy. Then he blinks his eyes several times and the look disappears before he turns his attention back to me. \u201cI think she was happy when she had you. And Dean.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s lying, but I don\u2019t really care if he is or not. He might just be saying it to make me happy and I\u2019ll take it. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He seems like he wants to say more, squirming and popping his neck, like he has nervous energy flowing through him. \u201cElla, I don\u2019t want to make you mad but I... I really wish you\u2019d think about waiting to get married.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He rubs the back of his neck and leaves his hand there with his elbow bent upward. \u201cYou\u2019re so young... and should live your life before you tie yourself down to grown-up stuff.\u201d He lets his arm fall to his side.</p><p>It takes me a moment to speak, because there are a lot of mean words that want to push their way up my throat. Like the fact that I was tied down by grown-up stuff since I was four. Bills. Cooking. Cleaning. Taking care of people. That stuff is not new to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t mean it. I back toward the door, zipping my jacket up. \u201cAnd, Dad... thanks for talking about Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he replies. \u201cI should have talked about her more, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I agree with him, but I don\u2019t want to say it because it\u2019ll only hurt him, ruin this whole weird, good father/daughter vibe we have going. I open the back door and the wind blows inside, dusting snow across the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Ella,\u201d he calls out as I\u2019m about to step out into the snow and the glacier-cold breeze.</p><p>I pause and glance over my shoulder. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need any help... I mean, with the wedding and stuff if you decide to do it... I\u2019m here if you need me,\u201d he says, shifting his weight.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I tell him, confused because he wants to help and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m used to. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know, but I think Micha\u2019s mom\u2019s on top of a lot of stuff. She\u2019s super excited.\u201d</p><p>He looks a little bit disappointed and I open my mouth to say more, but I can\u2019t think of anything else to say so I wave, walk outside, and shut the door behind me. I feel somewhat bad because he seemed upset about my declining his help, but at the end of the day Micha\u2019s mom was more of a parent to me than either of mine. Micha and she were my family since I was four, not my dad, my mom, or Dean. It was just his mom and Micha, but mainly Micha. He was my past and he is my future.</p><p>I pause as I\u2019m about to hop over the fence, the snow knee deep and soaking through my jeans as I have a revelation that slams me square in the chest. From the day Micha begged me to climb over the fence for the very first time, we\u2019ve been inseparable, except for the time I ran away to college. He took care of me. He loved me. He showed me what love was. And I think deep down, even though I couldn\u2019t admit it a couple of years ago, I secretly hoped that he\u2019d be in my life forever\u2014that I\u2019d end up with him. That I\u2019d still be hopping over the fence to see him when I was twenty years old with his ring on my finger. That fifty years down the road I\u2019d still be with him, sitting on a porch swing, drinking lemonade or whatever it is old couples do.</p><p>It makes my heart thump in excitement and terror because I think it\u2019s time to let go of the dark things that haunt my past, let things go that I might not want to, so I can move forward into a future with a simple fence, juice box, and a toy car.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Micha</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want me to do this?\u201d I ask Ella, staring down at her mother\u2019s journal on my lap.</p><p>She nods as she digs through her bag on the floor. \u201cYeah, I only want to know if you find anything happy.\u201d She peers up at me, wearing only a red-and-black bra and matching panties. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then I don\u2019t need to read it. But if you do, then I want to read it just so I can hear about the happy part of her I never got to see.\u201d</p><p>I massage the back of my neck, nervous about reading something so private. \u201cOkay, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She straightens her legs and stands up with a black dress in her hand. \u201cBut only if you feel comfortable doing it.\u201d</p><p>I want to say that I\u2019m not but there\u2019s no way that I\u2019m going to. Not after she came into the house yesterday after talking to her dad and announced that she was ready to move forward without finishing the journal because she wanted to let go of the past. I\u2019m not even sure where the declaration came from, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to do anything that will ruin it. \u201cI\u2019m down for a little reading, I guess.\u201d I move the journal off my lap and onto the bed, then lean forward and grab the edge of the short, tight dress she\u2019s about to put on. \u201cJust as long as you tell me where the hell you\u2019re going wearing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Lila out to dinner,\u201d she answers. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with the dress?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s smaller than most of my shirts,\u201d I tell her, jealousy ringing in my voice. \u201cYour ass will be hanging out of it.\u201d</p><p>She snatches the dress away from me. \u201cIt will not,\u201d she insists, bending over and stepping into the dress. \u201cBesides, Lila said specifically to wear this one.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my feet as she shimmies the tight fabric over her body and slips her arms through the thin straps. It hugs her body perfectly but the bottom barely covers her thighs. \u201cWhy?\u201d I question.</p> <p>She tousles her fingers through her hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. You\u2019ll have to ask her. All she\u2019d tell me was that it was a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m going to,\u201d I assure her and then leave the room to go find Lila.</p><p>She\u2019s in the kitchen with Ethan, bags of red and black candles and matching flowers, ribbons, and other decorative shit scattered all over the countertops and table in front of them, along with wrapping paper and tape and a bag full of Christmas present bows. Lila, Ella, and my mom spent half the day shopping and Ella had come home looking worn out but with a bag full of wedding decorations and I guess a few presents for Christmas. She never was the shopping type and I\u2019m guessing that Lila and my mom had more to do with the overabundance of wedding decorations and presents than Ella.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d I say to Lila as I scoot out a chair and join them at the table. She\u2019s got Ethan tying ribbons, and even though he doesn\u2019t look happy, he\u2019s still doing it, which is kind of funny.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word,\u201d Ethan warns as he ties a piece of black ribbon into a bow. \u201cTime and time again I\u2019ve watched you do stupid shit for Ella and haven\u2019t said a word.\u201d</p> <p>I rotate a candle in my hand. \u201cNo, you said a lot of words that annoyed the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and then drops the bow, looking at Lila. \u201cCan I be done with this?\u201d He flexes his fingers like he has a cramp. \u201cI can\u2019t even feel the tips of my fingers anymore.\u201d</p><p>Lila snips the end of a red piece of ribbon with a pair of scissors. \u201cNo way. We have about a hundred more to go.\u201d She sets the ribbon and scissors down. She\u2019s wearing this dark blue dress that has sparkly stuff all over it. It\u2019s not as tight as Ella\u2019s but it is equally as short, if not shorter. \u201cSo what\u2019s your question, Micha? And if it\u2019s about your Christmas present from Ella, I\u2019m not going to tell you what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cAnd what are you talking about? Ella and I don\u2019t get each other presents.\u201d Except for last year when I gave her the engagement ring, but that was different.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not in the past,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cBut she did this year.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Does that mean I have to get her something? And if so, then what? I shake my head. I\u2019m getting sidetracked. I shove the candle aside and fold my arms on top of the table. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was going to ask you. I want to know where the hell are you taking Ella tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Lila shrugs as she reaches for another roll of ribbon. \u201cOut to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d she replies, unraveling a bit of ribbon around her hand.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s dressed like a whore,\u201d I say bluntly, attempting to throw her off.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t faze her. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going to look like a whore. She\u2019s just dressing up to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to dinner, though. You don\u2019t need to be dressed like that to go to dinner,\u201d I say and point at her dress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with how I\u2019m dressed?\u201d She bats her eyelashes innocently. \u201cI\u2019m just wearing a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to agree with Micha on this one,\u201d Ethan chimes in, cracking his knuckles. \u201cI don\u2019t like the dress at all.\u201d</p> <p>Amusement dances in Lila\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou liked it the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, when I was the only one seeing you in it,\u201d he says, extending his hand toward the heap of ribbon Lila unraveled.</p><p>Lila grins as she pushes her chair away from the table. \u201cOh, you two and your jealousy.\u201d She pats Ethan on the top of the head. \u201cIt\u2019s so adorable.\u201d She strolls behind him and kisses the top of his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see if Ella\u2019s ready,\u201d she singsongs and Ethan checks her ass out as she walks away and leaves the room, calling over her shoulder, \u201cAnd Micha, feel free to make yourself useful and start tying bows.\u201d</p><p>I gape at Ethan. \u201cIs she being serious?\u201d</p><p>He cuts a piece of red ribbon. \u201cYeah.\u201d He drops the scissors onto the table. \u201cBut it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell is it my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the one who wouldn\u2019t just drive to Vegas and elope.\u201d</p><p>I reach over the table and pick up a roll of ribbon. \u201cThat sounds more like your kind of marriage than mine.\u201d</p><p>He nods in agreement. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, still though. We wouldn\u2019t have to be sitting here, tying ribbon like a couple of whipped pussies.\u201d</p><p>I fiddle with the ribbon, stifling a laugh. \u201cSo what am I supposed to be doing?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he shows me how to tie the ribbon and then we sit at the table tying bows for the next twenty minutes until Ella and Lila walk into the kitchen. Ella stops just short of the table and crosses her arms. Her hair is loose at her shoulders in waves, her eyes are lined with black, and her lips have a tint of pink to them. She has heels on that have straps that wind up her ankles, and between the shoes and the short dress her legs look nearly endless.</p><p>\u201cWell, look at you two,\u201d she says with hilarity in her voice. \u201cAll crafty and tying bows.\u201d</p><p>I rotate in the chair and scan her amazingly perfect body, picturing how later her long legs will be wrapped around me. \u201cYou better watch it, Ella May, or you won\u2019t have any ribbons at your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, tugging the bottom of her dress down.</p><p>Lila pokes her in the back. \u201cHey, I thought you liked the ribbons.\u201d</p><p>Ella pulls an apologetic face. \u201cNo, I said out of all the silly, frilly decoration stuff you guys were throwing at me, the red and black ribbons were the least annoying.\u201d</p><p>Lila frowns disappointedly. \u201cSo you don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>Ella sighs. \u201cNo, I do. Sorry, I\u2019m not being very nice right now. You\u2019re helping me and I should be more grateful.\u201d</p><p>Now Lila sighs. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. If you don\u2019t like the ribbons then you don\u2019t. We can do something else.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shoots me a funny look and then reclines back in the chair with his arm draped over the top of it. \u201cYou know, if I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d think it was you two who were getting married.\u201d</p><p>Lila\u2019s heels click against the floor as she walks over and gives him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s time for you to get back to your bow tying,\u201d she says as she walks toward the back door and Ella follows her.</p><p>As Ella\u2019s passing by me, I snag her elbow and pull her back, drawing her down so her head lowers and then I put my lips beside her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t get into any trouble please.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head to look at me. \u201cWhen have I ever gotten into any trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to ramble off the list,\u201d I reply, \u201cthen I will, but it\u2019ll probably take the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>She attempts to restrain a smile as she scowls at me, but then it slips through and she kisses me deeply. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to get into any fights,\u201d she says, backing away, a little breathless from the kiss. \u201cOr any other trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd try not to wreck my car,\u201d I call out as Lila opens the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting them take your car?\u201d Ethan asks, looking at me like I\u2019m insane.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWhat else are they going to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be better off walking,\u201d he mutters, and then yells out to Lila and Ella, \u201cDon\u2019t drive drunk or shove any dollar bills down dudes\u2019 pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to a strip club,\u201d Lila retorts, but then giggles as she retrieves her jacket from the coat rack.</p><p>Ella puts on her leather jacket, covering up a little bit and making me feel slightly better about the dress. She opens her mouth to say something but Lila snatches her arm and yanks her outside, slamming the door. Thomas and my mom went out for dinner and the house is really quiet as Ethan and I sit in silence, taking in what just happened.</p><p>\u201cDo you kind of feel like their bitches?\u201d he asks, turning around in the chair with ribbon in his hand.</p><p>I stare at the pile of ribbon and candles on the table. \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d</p><p>We exchange a look and then simultaneously push away from the table and get to our feet.</p><p>\u201cSo the question is,\u201d Ethan says as he grabs his jacket off the back of the chair, \u201cdo we want to go to a bar or go somewhere noisy, like a party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could always follow them,\u201d I joke as I walk over to the coat rack beside the back door. \u201cPlay creep stalkers for the night.\u201d I grab my jacket and slip it on, pretending like I\u2019m joking but deep down I\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t like the idea of Ella going out dressed like that, in this town. Not only is she too beautiful and sexy for her own good, but she\u2019s also got history in this town, with people who either overly like her or with people who loathe her. And if the feisty Ella makes a grand appearance, especially the drunk one, a lot of shit could happen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Ethan agrees, responding to my joke, looking serious. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we just start walking?\u201d I ask as I open the door.</p><p>It\u2019s late, the black sky is clear of clouds and the stars are shining. Lights twinkle from next door and reflect off the ice covering the yard.</p><p>Ethan zips up his jacket. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We step outside and hike down the driveway through the snow, then make a left toward town. The snow on the sidewalk crunches under our boots and our breath fogs out in front of us. It\u2019s freezing, but it\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve walked around late at night in below-zero temperatures. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m waiting for you to panic,\u201d Ethan unexpectedly announces, kicking a chunk of ice out of the way.</p><p>I stuff my hands into my jacket pockets. \u201cPanic over what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver getting married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I panic?\u201d</p><p>He gapes at me. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going to be with one person for the rest of your life, and that for the rest of your life decisions are going to be based on what\u2019s best for not just you but for you and her. You can\u2019t just do whatever you want anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever really been with anyone else though?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean relationship-wise.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cNo, I guess not, but still. It\u2019s such a huge responsibility and there seems like there should be a little panic involved, even if it\u2019s for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cAt least if it\u2019s the right person.\u201d</p> <p>He takes in my words with a perplexed look as he stares at the ground. Finally he shakes his head and then looks up. \u201cAnd what happens if Ella tells you that she doesn\u2019t want you going on that Slam Tour or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t go,\u201d I say. I told Ethan the other day, while we were cleaning up the house the morning after the party about my dilemma, because I needed to get it off my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d just give up your dream?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens, like, five years down the road when you look back and regret it?\u201d</p><p>I kick the tip of my boot at the snow. \u201cWhy are you pushing this so hard? I mean, I know you\u2019re not a fan of Ella, but it\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to talk me out of marrying her, which will never happen.\u201d</p> <p>He abruptly halts near the edge of the curb and I slip on the ice as I slam to a stop beside him. My hands go out to my sides and I quickly regain my balance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you not to marry her,\u201d he says with a frown. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you that since you\u2019re going to marry her, you need to talk to her about the tour and make the decision together whether or not you\u2019re going to go. Otherwise you\u2019re going to get married in a few days without talking about something major and that could lead to problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so weird, sometimes,\u201d I tell him, pulling my hood over my head. \u201cYou give relationship advice all the time, yet I\u2019ve never seen you in a relationship except for with Lila, but somehow your advice makes sense.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, staring at the single-story brick home across the street that is covered in flashing red and green lights. \u201cI watched my parents do the wrong things for years and years, so I know what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he says as we cross the street. \u201cNow, whether or not my advice is the right way to go, I really have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I hop up onto the curb, stuffing my hands back into my jacket pockets. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, but I can tell he\u2019s glad I said I would, for whatever reason. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he says, changing the subject. \u201cI think we need to have a bachelor party tonight. It seems wrong that we\u2019re not having a real one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re forgetting what the strip bars look like around here,\u201d I say to him unenthusiastically. \u201cRemember when we decided to go to one right after we graduated.\u201d I shudder at the thought. \u201cI think I\u2019m still a little scarred over the things I saw.\u201d</p><p>His face contorts in revulsion. \u201cYeah, how could I forget?\u201d As we round the corner of the street, heading east, he adds, \u201cBut we could go get drunk, just for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d He sticks out his fist. \u201cWhat do you say? You want to get trashed down at the pub one more time?\u201d</p> <p>I pound fists with him. We haven\u2019t hung out in a while, ever since I moved, so I don\u2019t get many chances to hang out with him. \u201cYeah, why the hell not. One last time, for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at the many times Ethan and I snuck into the pub with our fake IDs. We always had a lot of fun and it hits me that we\u2019ve sort of moved on from that stuff. It\u2019s kind of sad, but at the same time, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve moved on from this town, moving forward in our lives, because not a lot of people around here do.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Ella</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you brought me here,\u201d I shout over the chest-bumping music, fanning my hand in front of my face because it\u2019s hot and smells like sweat and old cheese mixed with beer. There are strings of Christmas lights coiling around the ceiling beams and they sparkle across our faces, giving our skin a pink glow.</p><p>Lila pivots in her stool, her eyes skimming the dance floor. \u201cWell, I asked around and everyone said this was the place to go to have a little fun.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I pick up my drink. \u201cOh, Lila Dila, fun in Star Grove is not the same as California fun or even Vegas fun.\u201d I rotate in the stool, motioning my hand at the crowd of rough-looking people, most dressed in old jeans, plaid shirts, T-shirts, boots. We aren\u2019t the only ones dressed up, but girls wearing fancy dresses are few and far between. And there\u2019s no flashy lights or d\u00e9cor, just low lighting due to a few lightbulbs being out, round tables and mismatched chairs, and peanut shells and wrappers on the floor. The music is coming from a stereo, not a DJ, but the good thing is the drinks are cheap.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to give you one last hoorah before you tie the knot in a few days,\u201d she says, sipping on the straw that\u2019s in her margarita as the bartender, a middle-aged guy with thinning hair and a mustache, eyes us down. He\u2019s been doing it since we walked in, checking us out, but so far it\u2019s been easy to ignore him. \u201cI was trying to be a good maid of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we all ready do that back in San Diego the night before the wedding?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhen you took me out for drinks at that club?\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows at me. \u201cThe wedding that never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I say. \u201cBut we still had our hoorah.\u201d</p><p>She slurps the rest of her drink before reclining back in the stool and setting it on the counter. \u201cYou can never have too many last hoorahs.\u201d She frowns as she sits up straight. \u201cWe\u2019ve barely seen each other in the last six months and now we\u2019re hardly going to see each other anymore after you get married.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not the heart-to-heart kind of girl but she\u2019s making me feel bad. \u201cLila, we\u2019ll still be friends no matter what. And you\u2019re dating Micha\u2019s best friend. We\u2019ll see each other more than you think.\u201d</p><p>She rearranges a few strands of her hair back into place. \u201cNo, we won\u2019t. You\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll move on, probably have babies, and I\u2019ll still be living in Vegas, trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I hear,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI heard that you and Ethan have a big road trip planned.\u201d</p><p>She seals her lips as she watches the dance floor. \u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you sound so unconvinced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Shit happens, you know. Things sometimes change.\u201d</p><p>I take another swallow of my drink. \u201cIs there something going on between you and Ethan? Are you fighting or something?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t worry about all the things that can go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike life.\u201d She turns toward me, crossing her legs. \u201cNot all of us have the perfect relationship, although I can\u2019t say that what Ethan and I have is bad. It\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not like I have a ring on my finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d I say, and she rolls her eyes at me. I throw my head back and guzzle the rest of my drink, feeling the burn of the vodka as it slides down my throat. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t have the perfect relationship.\u201d I put the glass on the bar. \u201cNeed I remind you I stood Micha up just a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you had a reason, right? Because you were worried about your future.\u201d The way she says it with suspicion makes me wonder if she doesn\u2019t believe my reasoning.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd because of other stuff... things I don\u2019t like to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stuff? Is there something else you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>I twirl a strand of my hair around my finger, feeling uncomfortable. I can tell Micha personal things about me but he\u2019s my best friend, fianc\u00e9, my everything, which sounds so cheesy but it\u2019s true. I wonder if I should put it in the vows.</p><p>The burn of the alcohol rushes through my veins and I begin to think maybe it\u2019s time to talk to Lila about stuff. She\u2019s usually good about giving advice and maybe she can direct me on what to do. But I don\u2019t want to talk about my mom and the box\u2014I talked enough about that with my dad. But there is something else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having trouble writing my vows,\u201d I admit.</p><p>She props her elbow on the countertop as her eyebrows knit. \u201cYou guys are writing vows?</p><p>I nod. \u201cIt was Micha\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>Lila drums her fingernails on her knee. \u201cYeah, I assumed as much.\u201d She pauses. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re having such a hard time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not a writer,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd because... well, because I hate expressing my emotions to an empty room let alone to people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we already kind of know how you feel about Micha, since you can\u2019t keep your hands off him.\u201d She inspects her reflection in the mirror on the back wall of the bar. \u201cBut I get the emotion part and not wanting to say it to anyone. Sometimes I hide what I feel, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, raising my voice as the music gets louder. \u201cIt never seems like you do.\u201d</p><p>She glares at some creepy guy with a ponytail who keeps grinning at her from across the bar. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not that I hide what I\u2019m feeling so much as I pretend to feel something else, but I\u2019ve been trying to stop because it\u2019s unhealthy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know from experience that she\u2019s right. \u201cSo how do you suggest I get over the not being a writer part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just put the pen to the paper and write, I guess.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m sure something good will come out.\u201d</p><p>I continue to try and figure out a better solution until the song switches to an upbeat tempo and Lila claps her hands together, her eyes lighting up with excitement. \u201cI love this song,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s take another shot and dance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m only taking a shot if it\u2019s J\u00e4ger,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She makes a gagging face. \u201cEwe, you\u2019re so gross. I\u2019ll just stick with tequila.\u201d</p><p>She orders our drinks, and then we slam them back and head for the dance floor. We dance in the low lighting, making the occasional trip back to the bar for more shots until we\u2019re hot, sweaty, exhausted, and ready to go home. I feel good, not just because I\u2019m buzzed, but because I had fun, even though I\u2019m scared of getting married, worried about writing vows.</p><p>As we push through the crowd, heading for the exit, we collect our jackets from the chair. We slip them on as we push out the door and the ice-cold air stings at my bare legs.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s run,\u201d I tell Lila and she laughs as we take off, staggering and slipping in the ice as we run toward the Chevelle parked beneath the lamppost.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d Lila suddenly slams to a stop when we\u2019re almost to the car. She looks back at the club with a torn expression on her face. \u201cMaybe we should go back inside where it\u2019s warm and call the guys to come get us. We said we wouldn\u2019t drive drunk.\u201d</p><p>Through the sea of alcohol sloshing around in my head, I realize that we indeed shouldn\u2019t be driving since everything looks a little distorted and standing seems complex. \u201cYeah, good idea.\u201d I start to turn around to head back when a blue Camaro drives into the parking lot and parks between us and the door to the club, blocking our path.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be shitting me,\u201d I mutter as the window rolls down.</p><p>Mikey sticks his head out as a cloud of smoke rushes from the open window. The last time I saw him I was throwing a milkshake into his window and then he tried to chase us down. Knowing Mikey, I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s probably still holding a grudge.</p><p>\u201cElla, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lila asks tracking my line of sight as a smile creeps up on Mikey\u2019s face. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t the town rebel.\u201d He continues smiling as he opens his door and hops out. He\u2019s about average height for a guy, which makes me in heels as tall as him, but my weight is no match for his. His black hair blends with the night, his nose is crooked, probably because someone clocked him, and he has a barbed-wire tattoo curving around his neck.</p> <p>His boots stomp against the icy parking lot as he strides over to us with a smirk on his face. \u201cSo is that Gregory idiot with you, because I\u2019ve been dying to kick his ass too for that shake stunt you two pulled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lila asks way too loud and I shoot her a look over my shoulder, warning her to keep her mouth shut. Then I glance over at Mikey\u2019s car, noting that there\u2019s someone else in the passenger seat, a guy I think.</p><p>As Mikey slows to a stop in front of us, he measures Lila up with a sly look on his face. \u201cAre you his girl or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose girl?\u201d Lila plays dumb, shielding herself by stepping behind me. She\u2019s scared, her erratic breathing showing through the fog.</p><p>Mikey looks her over for a little bit longer and then focuses on me. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s looking at me, not like I\u2019m Ella the girl who could hang tight with the guys, even if he didn\u2019t like me. He\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m a girl, because I\u2019m dressed like one and I suddenly regret wearing the damn dress and fucking heels. \u201cElla, I know you\u2019re not stupid,\u201d he says, inching closer. \u201cI know you know that around here people just don\u2019t get away with throwing shakes in cars. They have to pay\u2014things have to be even.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and cross my arms over my chest. \u201cJust like I know that no one around here respects you.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his neck tighten as he steps into the light from the lamppost. I\u2019m growing a little nervous. Even though Mikey has always tried to seem tough, it was all an act and most of us knew that he was a lot of talk. But this Mikey looks different than the one I used to know. More ragged, rough, intense, and less cowardly. His eyes are sunken in and red and I wonder if he\u2019s gotten into drugs, but it doesn\u2019t really surprise me if he has. It happens sometimes in this town.</p><p>\u201cWatch your fucking mouth,\u201d Mikey cautions.</p> <p>Lila captures my arm, her fingers trembling as she whispers, \u201cMaybe I should call or text Micha and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and hiss, \u201cNo way. Then they\u2019ll just end up in a fight.\u201d</p><p>Lila glances at Mikey. \u201cI think we might end up in a fight if we don\u2019t get them here,\u201d she whispers nervously.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re fine,\u201d I reassure her, even though I\u2019m not so sure myself. \u201cJust go to the car and wait for me.\u201d I turn around and target my eyes on Mikey, attempting to look tougher than I feel as Lila backs toward the Chevelle.</p><p>He cracks his knuckles and neck, like it proves he\u2019s tough. \u201cYou think you can frighten me with a look?\u201d He spans his arms out to the side at the empty parking lot. \u201cYou got no one around to protect your ass.\u201d</p><p>That feisty, fighting girl that I keep shoved down inside pushes her way out and I step forward so we\u2019re close. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay.\u201d I span my hands out to the side and glance around, mockingly imitating his move, ignoring the fact that I know things are going to get ugly. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I could run, but then he\u2019d just chase me. \u201cSince I don\u2019t see any threat around.\u201d</p><p>A vein bulges in his neck and he starts to pace to the side while the other guy in the car climbs out. He\u2019s tall and bulky with cropped hair and arms the size of my legs. I try to calculate how fast I can run to the car in heels, and if I make it to the car, can I drive fast enough to get away because I know he\u2019s going to chase me down whether on foot or in a vehicle.</p><p>\u201cAh, now you\u2019re not so cocky,\u201d Mikey says with a smirk when I don\u2019t respond. I hate to back down because it would mean living through hell for almost forever, since no one in Star Grove can seem to forget, but at the same time this isn\u2019t my home. I might be here for holidays if that, so in the end, does it even matter?</p><p>Sucking in all of my stubbornness, I put my hands up and step back, putting distance between us. \u201cFine, you win,\u201d I say through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way.\u201d He counters my step back, narrowing the distances between us. \u201cYou insulted me and ruined the leather in my car. You don\u2019t just walk away. The question is, how are you going to pay? I mean, I could just make you pay to get it reupholstered.\u201d His eyes scroll up my body suggestively. \u201cAlthough, there might be something else you can give me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. I burst out laughing, which probably isn\u2019t the best thing to do but I\u2019m drunk and not thinking rationally. Big guy starts rushing for me as I back away with my hand over my stomach, my laughter echoing around us. But he slips and eats it, falling flat on his back and I laugh harder and Mikey\u2019s face heats with anger. He snatches my arm and jerks me forward, his fingers pressing against my skin and I wince as I stumble.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I say, yanking my arm back.</p><p>His fingers dig tighter as he wrenches me forward, opening his mouth to say something, but I bring my knee up and slam it in his manly parts. I\u2019m not sure how much force is behind the blow since I\u2019m intoxicated and having a hard time keeping my balance, but it seems to do the job and he frees me from his hold, clutching his junk as his face contorts in pain. I\u2019m about to turn and run when he lifts his arm and strikes me across the cheek.</p><p>My ears ring and I see spots as I clutch my cheek and blink. \u201cYou fucking asshole!\u201d I shout, pissed off. Some girls would have cried, but the pain only makes me want to get him back. I see the big guy walking toward us as Mikey lifts his hand to hit me again. I bring back my own hand and slam my fist into his cheek. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve hit someone and I\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t be my last, but no matter how many times I punch someone in the face, it still hurts my God damn hand.</p><p>We both cry out in pain, Mikey cupping his jaw where I clocked him while I shake out my hand as I scramble away from him, ready to bolt for the car. But then a group of guys and girls exit the bar, creating a lot of noise and making it so there are now witnesses.</p><p>One of the guys gives a questioning look in our direction as he lights up a cigarette and I seize the opportunity to hurry over to the Chevelle and climb in with Lila.</p><p>Her eyes are huge and dotted with tears and her arms are wrapped around herself. \u201cOh my God, Ella. That was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar Grove,\u201d I tell her then add, \u201cLock your door.\u201d</p><p>She obeys as I lock mine, too.</p><p>Mikey goes up to one of the guys who just walked out and they exchange a hand shake while big guy stares me down with his arms folded over his chest. I reach for my phone inside my pocket, debating who to call. I know that if I call Micha he\u2019s going to come here and if Mikey\u2019s still here then there\u2019s a good chance a fight\u2019s going to go down and that\u2019s the last thing I want.</p><p>\u201cI already called them the second that asshole came after you,\u201d Lila tells me. \u201cThey were at a pub a few blocks over. They\u2019re headed here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Lila, now they\u2019re going to come here ready to throw punches.\u201d I glance in the rearview mirror, wincing as I touch my red, puffy cheekbone. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to bruise.\u201d</p><p>Lila frowns. \u201cGreat, now you\u2019ll have a giant bruise in all of your wedding pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones Caroline\u2019s going to take.\u201d She slaps her hand over her mouth. \u201cOh shit, I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gape at her as I cradle my injured hand. \u201cWho invited them?\u201d</p><p>She drops her hand from her mouth to her lap. \u201cMicha\u2019s mom. She thought it would be good for you to have your brother here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to respond. My quiet wedding is now turning into a bunch of people who are going to be staring at me while I seal my future and of course read the vows I haven\u2019t even started to write. It shouldn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but at the same time it does. Especially if I do something stupid like panic. I don\u2019t want anyone to see me panic.</p> <p>I slump back in the seat and keep my eyes locked on Mikey, who\u2019s still chatting with the guy. \u201cGod, I forgot how intense this town is,\u201d I say, changing the subject. \u201cEverything is either life or death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just drive somewhere close?\u201d Lila suggests, reaching for the door handle to get out of the car and switch seats with me \u201cI feel sober enough now to at least get us away from here and then we can tell Micha and Ethan to meet us somewhere else so they won\u2019t have to show up here and get into a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where we go,\u201d I tell her. \u201cMikey will just chase us down. In fact, I bet he\u2019s hoping we drive somewhere just so he can chase us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with that guy?\u201d she asks, looking at Mikey. \u201cHe hit a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just how people are around here.\u201d I put the keys in the ignition, debating whether or not to start the car and turn the heat on. It\u2019s cold as death in here but at the same time the rev of the engine might set Mikey off. If my vision wasn\u2019t slightly blurred I\u2019d totally take on racing Mikey in a heartbeat, but I have a feeling that if I try anything right now, I could end up wrapping the car around a tree. Lila could get hurt, or someone else, and if something happened to me then that lovely future Micha and I have planned will be gone. The last thought sits in my chest, but in a good way because a few years ago I\u2019d have driven the car and risked it all.</p> <p>Some of the girls start off for a truck, lighting up a cigarette and passing it around, and the guys soon follow, waving at Mikey and the big guy. A gangly guy with a beanie on lingers behind and then he says something to Mikey and then all three of them climb into the Camaro.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Lila slants forward in the seat and squints at the Camaro as Mikey rolls up the window. He doesn\u2019t drive away, but he does turn the headlights off.</p><p>I thrum my fingers on top of the steering wheel. \u201cProbably dealing drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lila frowns and then stares out the window to the side of her. I\u2019m about to say we should just take off on foot and meet Micha and Ethan when someone knocks on the window.</p><p>I jump but relax when I see Micha standing outside with the hood of his jacket pulled over his head and this relaxed look on his face like he\u2019s had more than beers to drink tonight. Ethan is beside him and when he glances inside the car, he winds around the front, heading toward Lila\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWhen they ask what happened, tell them it was a girl who hit me,\u201d I whisper to Lila and then unlock the door.</p> <p>Micha backs up so I can open the door and then he ducks his head to look in the car, his blond hair hanging in his eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks, his breath smelling like an array of alcohol. He carefully looks me over and then his eyes flare as he notes my swollen cheek. \u201cHow the hell did that happen?\u201d He glances over at Lila and then his burning gaze lands back on me. \u201cLila said you guys needed help.\u201d</p><p>I shrug as Lila opens her door and I hear Ethan say something to her about looking so hot. \u201cThere was this bitch in the club who we used to go to school with,\u201d I tell Micha. \u201cApparently I kicked her ass one time and she was drunk and wanted to fight. Lila panicked and called you guys, even though I told her I could handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Lila pokes me in the back and I flinch. \u201cYou were not handling it very well.\u201d</p><p>I discreetly glance over at Mikey\u2019s Camaro that\u2019s still parked in front of the door. \u201cI handled it fine. Can we just go home now?\u201d</p><p>Micha crouches down, his eyebrows knitting. \u201cYeah, I think that might be a problem.\u201d He leans to the side and laughs this silly drunk laugh as he says to Ethan, \u201cI think we were lucky to even make it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d I remark and Micha looks back at me with a guilty face. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen him drunk and it worries me, not because I think he\u2019s going to be mean but because if Mikey comes over and tries to start something Micha is more likely to pick a fight and more likely to lose.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Micha admits with an adorable grin on his face. \u201cBut I won\u2019t be mean and hurt you.\u201d He presses his hand to his heart. \u201cI said I\u2019d never hurt you again and I won\u2019t. In fact, I\u2019ll be really, really nice if you let me,\u201d he says, glancing at my chest. \u201cI\u2019ll do all sorts of nice things to you...\u201d His fingers spread across the top of my leg.</p><p>I roll my eyes as Lila laughs, and then Ethan laughs, too. I don\u2019t dare turn around, worried what I might see the two of them doing if I do.</p> <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I check on Mikey\u2019s car, relieved it\u2019s still parked and quiet. \u201cI think we should go home,\u201d I say, looking back at Micha.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you suppose we do that?\u201d Micha asks innocently as he glances around at the four of us and then chuckles under his breath. \u201cIs anyone sober? Because I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not either,\u201d Ethan says with a slur to his speech and Lila laughs even louder.</p><p>I blink my eyes, hoping the blur and merry-go-round effect has vanished, but no such luck. \u201cNo, but we could always call your mom,\u201d I say, racking my mind for more ideas but all I get is a headache.</p><p>Micha waves me off and staggers to his feet, grinning proudly like he\u2019s just come up with the best idea ever. \u201cNah, we can just walk. Walking\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>I laugh as he tugs me to my feet and grips my waist to hold my balance as I stumble in my heels. \u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d I tell him, gripping onto his shoulder as we both slide on the ice. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one wearing heels.\u201d</p><p>He works to steady us and then his eyes roam down my legs as he sucks his lip ring in between his teeth. \u201cGod, those are some fucking sexy legs.\u201d His eyes heat with lust and I know if I don\u2019t get him home soon, I\u2019m going to have my hands even fuller. If a fight doesn\u2019t break out, then a live porn show might. \u201cI just want to rub my hands all over them,\u201d he growls, moving in for a kiss.</p><p>I laugh louder, trying not to trip as I gently put my hand to his chest and push him back. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, you call your mom to come get us and I\u2019ll let you rub my legs as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d he asks, with an intense look on his face.</p><p>I cross my heart with my finger. \u201cPromise, but make sure she brings Thomas. We can\u2019t leave your car here.\u201d Otherwise it\u2019ll probably get trashed.</p><p>He grins at me and then retrieves his phone out of his pocket to call his mom. I keep an eye on Mikey\u2019s car, hoping he stays in there until we\u2019re gone, because if he gets out and Micha finds out he hit me, all shit\u2019s going to hit the fan. Micha isn\u2019t the most violent person, except when it comes to me. I remember how Micha told me he punched Grantford Davis because he was the one who drove me to the bridge that night.</p><p>\u201cOkay, she\u2019ll be here in, like, five,\u201d Micha announces, stuffing his phone back into his pocket. Then he steps forward, rubbing his hands together, breathing out a cloud of air. \u201cNow for some leg rubbing.\u201d</p><p>I laugh as he backs me up against the car and then lifts me and sits me down on his lap as he sinks into the driver\u2019s seat and shuts the door. He starts rubbing his hands up and down my legs, tickling my thighs and making the air feel sweltering even though it\u2019s below zero out. Ethan and Lila start making out in the passenger seat, making these breathless noises, and Micha whispers something about them challenging us and then kisses me roughly.</p><p>The next few minutes move by in a blurry haze full of kissing and touching and awkwardness because Lila and Ethan are in the seat next to us doing the same thing. But everyone\u2019s too drunk to care and by the time Micha\u2019s mom pulls up beside us in Thomas\u2019s old pickup, she damn near gets an eyeful.</p><p>Thankfully, everyone\u2019s clothes are still on when she raps on the window. She makes Micha and I get out, cracking a joke about us acting like teenagers again, almost like she sort of misses it.</p><p>Micha and I get in the backseat and Ethan climbs back, too, ungracefully diving over the console. Then Lila follows him, jumping onto his lap. We\u2019re crammed in the backseat, Lila\u2019s knees pressing against mine as I pretty much ball myself up on Micha\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s room up here,\u201d Micha\u2019s mom says, patting the empty passenger seat and then she adjusts the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d the four of us say nearly in sync and then we laugh.</p><p>Micha\u2019s mom sighs and then follows Thomas out of the parking lot, leaving the bar, Mikey, and our past behind. At least for now.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Micha</p><p>I feel bad about getting wasted, but I was having fun hanging out and drinking beers and shots with Ethan and I got a little carried away. I promise myself that I won\u2019t be mean to Ella no matter what and it\u2019s actually pretty easy, considering the moment I see her I want to tear off her clothes and bury myself inside her.</p><p>As we head back to my house with my mom, our designated driver, like we\u2019re a bunch of teenagers again, I can\u2019t seem to keep my hands off Ella. I suck on her neck, giving her a hickey as my fingers sneak up her dress. She breathes against my skin as she buries her face against my neck, trying to be quiet. She smells like vodka and vanilla and I bask in the scent, ready to get home because I\u2019m seriously about to lose it.</p><p>The only time I get distracted is when we pass by a group of Christmas carolers standing on the corner near the park, bundled up in hats, coats, and gloves singing at the top of their voices. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I say, leaning forward and slapping the console with my hand. \u201cStop the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Micha.\u201d My mom flinches in surprise but then starts to tap on the brakes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go throw snowballs at them,\u201d I say nodding my head at the carolers and then pinch Ella\u2019s leg. \u201cLike we used to do when we were kids every year. It was kind of like our tradition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMicha Scott,\u201d my mom says in horror. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>But Ella starts to laugh. \u201cI completely forgot about that. Remember that one time I hit that guy straight in the face with one and then he chased us for blocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always got us into so much trouble,\u201d I say with a grin. \u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d</p><p>Ella starts to smile and even though we\u2019re probably too old to keep carrying on that tradition, we\u2019re both drunk enough that we\u2019re seriously considering it. But my mom presses on the gas and drives down the road, sighing disappointedly.</p><p>\u201cYou two and your crazy ideas,\u201d she mutters under her breath.</p> <p>I\u2019m disappointed that she\u2019s not letting us, but I quickly forget about it and start kissing Ella again until we\u2019re pulling up to my house and my mom is turning off the engine.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys want me to make something to eat?\u201d my mom asks as we hop out of the car. \u201cIt might be good for you guys to eat something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good. Thanks again for coming to get us.\u201d I wave her off and she sighs as I lead Ella inside, not even bothering to wait for Lila and Ethan or listen when my mom asks me to come back.</p><p>By the time I get us to my room and the door closed, I\u2019m burning with the need to touch Ella as I flip on the lamp. I don\u2019t even give her a warning as I jerk her leather jacket off and throw it onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have my hands full tonight, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she states with a wicked glint in her eyes like that\u2019s exactly what she wants.</p><p>I squint at her cheek, grazing my thumb across it. It looks even redder and more swollen in the light. \u201cHow hard did that girl hit you?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs. \u201cA normal hit.\u201d Then she grabs the bottom of my shirt and yanks me toward her. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. I got her back twice so everything\u2019s good,\u201d she says and then smashes her lips into mine so hard I think we\u2019ll have bruises in the morning.</p><p>I slip my tongue inside her as my fingers wander through her hair, up her body, under her dress, into her panties. I feel her from the inside but only for a moment because it\u2019s all that I can take. Then I pull my fingers out of her and peel her tight dress off, chucking it onto the floor, too. She helps me out of my shirt and then undoes the button of my jeans so I can I slip them off. I notice that she only uses her left hand and I wonder if she hurt her other hand when she hit the girl. I\u2019m about to ask her when she unhooks her bra, and then all thoughts leave my mind.</p><p>I grab her roughly and seal my lips onto hers as I back her up. She gasps against my mouth as her back slams into the wall and my knee bumps against the nightstand, knocking my lap onto the floor. The room goes dark, a small amount of light flowing in from the Christmas lights outside as I stroke her thighs, feeling her skin as I explore every inch of her mouth with my tongue until our lips are swollen and I need air.</p><p>As I pull away, she sucks my bottom lip into her mouth hard, tracing her tongue across my lip ring and driving me mad. I groan as she frees my lip and I grind up against her, sucking kisses down her jawline to her neck. I gently bite at her skin, tasting her, rolling my tongue along her flesh as my fingers hook the edge of her panties and she makes these sexy whimpering noises. I move back only to slide them down her legs, and then I yank my boxers off. As I lean into kiss her again, I hear voices from just outside the hall. My mom laughing and Thomas saying something really loud.</p><p>Ella and I pause, panting heavily, her chest colliding with mine every time she lets out a breath.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should slow down,\u201d she whispers, blinking. \u201cAt least until they go to sleep. They might hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d I tell her, seeking for a solution where we can be noisy without anyone hearing us. I reach for my iPod and click it on, cranking up the volume of \u201cChange (In the House of Files),\u201d by Deftones, and the music rises over the voices.</p><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t hear them, I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t hear us,\u201d I say and then crash my lips into hers again.</p> <p>Her fingers make a searing path up my back and knot through my hair as I grab her thighs and pick her up, opening her legs and giving her hardly any warning before I sink deep inside her. We gasp as we move our bodies together, holding onto each other like nothing else exists, the sounds of the music drifting in and out of focus until I can\u2019t concentrate on anything else but her and how she makes me feel. How just a few years ago, I\u2019d gone out with Ethan to the same pub and came home with a girl who had been hitting on me all night. The sex was meaningless, the passion, heat, sweat, burning raw intensity that I feel with Ella nonexistent.</p><p>There was nothing and now there\u2019s everything.</p><p>After we come down from the high, I gently pull out of her, carrying her weight when her weak legs give out on her. She laughs exhaustedly as I scoop her up in my arms and stumble over to the bed. I lay her down and then climb under the covers with her.</p><p>She places her head on my chest and draws heart patterns on my damp skin. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I shut my eyes and hug her tighter against me. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>We hold onto each other, floating toward sleep, just like we did so many times when we were younger. We actually started sleeping together when we were about thirteen, after we\u2019d been hanging out in my room and Ella didn\u2019t want to go home because she was avoiding her family. I let her sleep in my bed with me, not because I was being a pervert but because I liked having her around and didn\u2019t want her to go home. My mom worked nightshifts so I knew we wouldn\u2019t get caught. It was the best night of sleep I\u2019d had in a long time and after that it started becoming a habit. We alternated nights between our rooms and sometimes at other peoples\u2019 houses, on park benches, and sometimes even in my car.</p><p>The car was actually my favorite place, because it gave me an excuse to lie closer to her. Yes, a lot of amazing things happened in that car. All Ella and I needed was each other and my car and we were good, no matter what life threw at us, even if she was mad at me. We raced in it. We kissed in it. We held each other in it, just like we\u2019re holding each other now.</p><p>I smile at the memories flooding my head. I start to fall asleep, thinking about the night that started with a fight over a stolen kiss and ended with us falling asleep together, squished in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>It started off as a really shitty night, but in the end it turned out to be one of the best nights of my life.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Two and a half years ago...</p><p>Micha</p><p>It\u2019s about time to race and I\u2019m nervous, even though I have Ella in the car with me, my little good luck charm. We\u2019ve been off balance all night, partly because my growing feelings for her are making things awkward since every time I\u2019m around her I keep hoping she\u2019ll say she has feelings for me, knowing if I\u2019m the one to tell her first she\u2019ll freak out. But not tonight. She\u2019s had a rough day and is in a bad mood and even though I want to scream out to her that I\u2019m in love with her, I know I can\u2019t. I\u2019m hoping, though, that after the race, we can drive up to our spot and talk for a little while, sitting on the hood of my car, listening to music\u2014it\u2019s one of my favorite things to do.</p><p>But for now I have to concentrate on racing, so I focus on driving, winning, and making sure Ella has a fun time tonight, despite the fact that I can\u2019t stop thinking about kissing her.</p><p>\u201cSo are you ready for this?\u201d I ask, pumping the gas as she dazes off, staring out the passenger window. She\u2019s been doing it most of the night and I wish she would just tell me what\u2019s on her mind.</p><p>She turns and looks at me. \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>I pump the gas again. \u201cTo race. I know how turned on you get over it,\u201d I pretend to tease, even though it\u2019s true.</p><p>She rolls her eyes, for a fleeting second looking happy \u201cWhatever.\u201d Then her expression falls and she looks out the window again.</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cSo do you want to tell me why you\u2019ve been so quiet all night?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and lets out a loud breath. It grows deafeningly quiet in the car as she breathes in and out. I swallow hard and start to return my attention to the front of me, when suddenly she says, \u201cMicha, can I ask you something?\u201d She sounds choked and nervous and it makes me wonder what the hell she\u2019s going to say.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can ask me anything.\u201d I grip the steering wheel, staring ahead at the trees, unable to look at her, praying to fucking God that she\u2019ll finally say something, like \u201cMicha, can you feel it, too? Micha, please fuck me now. Micha, I love you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m hoping for the last one, even though it\u2019s not really a question, but after a long drawn out silence, all she ends up saying is, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bet for the race?\u201d She sighs at the end, like she was going to say something else\u2014maybe something important.</p><p>I have to take a deep breath before I speak, otherwise all the emotions on the brink of exploding inside me will show in my voice. \u201cI think, like, a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you racing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny and his Challenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re totally going to win it.\u201d Her lips turn upward and I think it actually might be a real smile.</p><p>I relax as I line up to race. I\u2019m nervous and Ella can tell because she turns up a little \u201cThe Distance,\u201d by the Cake, because she knows it\u2019ll settle me down. When the lyrics and beat bump through the speakers, I look at her.</p><p>\u201cOnly you know the way to my heart,\u201d I say with a tense, nervous smile. \u201cThank you, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she replies, relaxing back in the seat, looking comfortable there, like she belongs there, which she does. \u201cWhat are best friends for?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I force a smile, then push in the clutch and shove the shifter into first. Danny\u2019s in his Challenger to the side of us and he throttles up his engine. I return it, pressing the gas down so hard the car vibrates from the rumble of the engine. Then Danny\u2019s girlfriend comes strutting up between the cars. There\u2019s a rule that the girlfriend of the instigator of the race has to start the race. When I do it, I always have to pick some random girl from out of the crowd, because I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend\u2014never wanted one. I\u2019ve tried to get Ella to do it a few times, but she always rejects me, saying it\u2019s a sexist rule, when really I think she\u2019s worried people will start to think we\u2019re dating, even though a lot of people do already.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can always tell me to slow down,\u201d I tell her, letting her know she\u2019s safe. \u201cIf you get scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t get scared.\u201d She slips her shoes off and props her feet onto the dash for support.</p> <p>The way she looks so comfortable makes me grin. \u201cI know, but I always want to make sure.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later, Danny\u2019s girlfriend throws down her arms, and just like that we\u2019re off, kicking up a large cloud of dust that smothers the audience. The longer we drive, the more relaxed Ella becomes, her head falling back against the headrest and she looks so relaxed as she shuts her eyes and breathes in the cool air blowing through the window. She looks so beautiful at that moment, so touchable, so fucking perfect, and I almost forget I\u2019m racing.</p><p>Then I glance to the road and realize the Challenger has died in the middle of the road and we\u2019re about to slam into it. \u201cShit,\u201d I mutter and one of the gears grinds as I downshift and the tires skid in the dirt, the car swerving a little. I know if I don\u2019t get control of the car something bad could easily happen. It\u2019s not the first time this sort of thing has happened, but Ella is always the first thing to come to mind, which makes it more important for me to regain control.</p><p>\u201cMicha...\u201d Ella says as I crane the wheel to the side and downshift again.</p><p>The car fishtails, the back end winding a curvy path against the dirt as we swerve to the right. I hold my breath as we veer sharply around the Challenger and just about over-correct, but I use force to straighten the wheel out. I get it under control, but there\u2019s little time for a celebration as the end of the road appears.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I jerk on the e-brake and the tires screech.</p><p>We spin out of control, the engine making a lot of noises, but I get everything under control and in the end we\u2019re racing back toward the finish line.</p><p>I release a breath as I floor the car, even though the Challenger is still stalled.</p><p>\u201cFaster or slower?\u201d I ask Ella playfully, because I\u2019ve pretty much won the race.</p><p>She grips onto the door handle. \u201cFaster of course.\u201d</p><p>I grin because I\u2019m not surprised by her answer and she laughs as I slam my foot on the gas pedal. The trees and dark sky blur by as the headlights light up the dirt road ahead of us. I shift gears, increasing the speed, and people scatter out of the way, worried I\u2019m going to lose control because sometimes it happens. But I easily make it over the finish line, winning, and Ella looks so happy that it makes all the tension between us dissipate.</p> <p>I smile this really stupid, goofy smile that makes Ella giggle and then I lean my head back against the seat, relaxing for the first time tonight. \u201cFuck, I thought I was totally going to slam into the back end of him for a moment,\u201d I say with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she says and I turn my head and give her a doubtful look, but still smile. \u201cWhat? I knew you had him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had him,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd we have one hundred bucks to split.\u201d I get really excited over the fact that I just won and she\u2019s with me and she\u2019s smiling, which was sort of the whole point of the night anyway. \u201cFuck, fuck, fuck,\u201d I say, amped up as I pound on the steering wheel.</p><p>She snorts a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re such a goofball.\u201d She laughs a little more and I swear to God the sound of it is the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Rare and beautiful and it makes me want to touch her so fucking much. Without even thinking, as if it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world, I lean over the console and pull her into a hug.</p><p>For a second, I worry she\u2019s going to flip out on me because she hates getting hugged but she\u2019s happy enough at the moment that she hugs me back and I can\u2019t help but breathe in the sent of her. It\u2019s intoxicating, along with her warmth and, God, I get so swept away in her, wanting to touch her, kiss her, be inside her. Before I even know what I\u2019m doing, I tilt my head to the side and press my lips to hers. I don\u2019t even know why I do it\u2014I\u2019m usually more careful\u2014but I slip up and I know it the second our lips touch and she tenses, sucking in a sharp breath.</p><p>I panic and before she can say anything, I pull back and get out of the car. I\u2019ve seriously fucked up, not just because I know she\u2019s going to be upset with me, but because I took a happy moment and ruined it.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I procrastinate as long as I can, celebrating and collecting my money from Danny and then we chat a little while about cars and other stupid shit, but I barely pay attention, distracted by the lingering sensation of Ella\u2019s warm lips on mine. Yeah, I know I messed up but, God, the taste of her was so incredible.</p> <p>Ella sits in the Chevelle for what seems like forever and then she finally gets out and goes and hangs with Renee and Kelly, even though she doesn\u2019t really like Renee. Ella was obviously in a bad mood when I\u2019d woken her up from her nap earlier, but my kissing her only made it worse.</p><p>As I\u2019m chatting with Danny, Trixie something-or-other comes up behind me and whispers in my ear that we should go to my car and hang out alone. I briefly consider it, but all I can think about is Ella and I know it\u2019s time to go face her wrath. I decline Trixie\u2019s offer and walk up to Ethan\u2019s truck, where Ella\u2019s sitting on the tailgate arguing with him, while Renee and Kelly share a bottle of vodka.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off.\u201d Ella puts her hands on her hips, giving Ethan the death glare. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to pick a fight with me.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shakes his head as he takes a swig of beer. \u201cBullshit. You\u2019re just in a pissy mood as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you ready to go?\u201d I interrupt, playfully nudging Ella\u2019s foot with mine like nothing happened, like we didn\u2019t just kiss.</p><p>\u201cIf you are,\u201d Ella replies, her expression undecipherable, so I have no idea what the hell she\u2019s thinking. She jumps off the tailgate and walks past a row of cars, heading to the Chevelle parked over by a tree. She\u2019s wearing a pair of cutoffs and it\u2019s hard not to stare at her ass the entire time. I know if she looks back and catches me checking her out things will only get worse, but I take the risk and only look away from her when she gets into the car.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Ethan rolls his eyes as Renee hands him the bottle of vodka. \u201cWhat the hell did you do to her? She\u2019s even bitchier than she normally is.\u201d</p><p>I release an uneasy breath. \u201cI fucked up,\u201d I say and then turn for the car, feeling bad about kissing her, but the way she tasted was so fucking mind-blowing, it makes it hard to regret.</p><p>I prepare myself before I pull open the car door and climb inside with her. I slam the door and the soundlessness that follows is unnerving.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to drive slow or fast back home?\u201d I try to make light as I put the keys in the ignition and turn over the engine.</p><p>She slowly turns her head toward me. \u201cI thought we were going to our spot?\u201d she asks, surprising me. I\u2019d honestly thought that idea had gone out the window for tonight because I thought she\u2019d be too pissed off.</p><p>I shove the shifter into drive and tap on the gas while pushing down on the brake, revving the engine. \u201cYou still want to go?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs as I turn the headlights on, lighting up the trees in front of us. \u201cIf you still want to go.\u201d Her eyes are unreadable in the dark, but I can tell by the silent plea in her tone that she doesn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I tell her and then I release the brake and peel out onto the road. \u201cI was just making sure you still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I had to,\u201d she reminds me. \u201cThat you weren\u2019t going to let me sulk around at my house all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know... but I\u2019m giving you an out.\u201d As a sorry-for-kissing-you-even-though-I\u2019m-not-really-sorry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want an out.\u201d She stares out the window with her arms crossed over her chest. She has the same tank top on as the one she was wearing when I woke her up, only she put a bra on so sadly I can\u2019t see the outline of her nipples anymore. But I do notice how forcefully her chest is moving up and down. She\u2019s anxious and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just because of the kiss. In fact, whatever is making her anxious now is probably the thing that had her sleeping in her bed at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon.</p><p>I don\u2019t saying anything else and drive in the direction of our spot, a secluded area in the middle of the trees beside the lake. By the time we get there it\u2019s past midnight and Ella\u2019s drifting off to sleep. I park the car not too far away from the water, and then silence the engine but leave the headlights on.</p><p>Ella blinks and sits up, quiet for a while as she stares out at the water. Finally she reaches her arm across the console and turns the key back over, so the battery turns on. Then she picks up the iPod from the dashboard and turns on some Spill Canvas, before getting out of the car. She treads up to the shore, stopping just before she arrives at the water, then crosses her arms and looks up at the stars, her hair blowing in the light summer breeze.</p><p>I climb out of the car and cautiously walk up to the side of her. The moonlight reflects in her eyes as she bites on her bottom lip, refusing to look at me. I consider saying sorry for kissing her, but it\u2019d be a lie and I hate fucking lying to her.</p><p>\u201cMy mom had one of her episodes today,\u201d she says quietly, breaking the silence as she hugs herself. \u201cShe was looking for a picture of when we all went to the beach, even though we never have. I spent all day looking for it, even though I knew I\u2019d never find it and finally I had to just lie to her and tell her I think I lost the photo, so she\u2019d let it go.\u201d She closes her eyes and breathes in deep. \u201cAnd I was so glad when she finally fell asleep... so fucking relieved. I\u2019m the worst daughter in the world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d I sweep her hair off her shoulder and she stiffens when my fingers brush against the back of her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a lot better than most daughters.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as she swallows hard. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I get so tired of it... all of it. Sometimes I just want it to all stop.\u201d She pauses, catching her breath.</p><p>I rack my brain for something to say to her that\u2019ll make her feel better, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s words I\u2019m looking for. So I back away from her and she doesn\u2019t look at me, her eyes fixed ahead. When I reach the car, I open the door and lean inside to get the iPod. Then I shuffle through the songs until I stumble onto one of the slower, softer classics and then I crank up the volume and hike down toward her again.</p> <p>She looks over her shoulder at me as the music floods the forest around us. I stick out my hand, letting her know what I want to do, because we\u2019ve done it before and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do it again. She stares at my hand undecidedly before she guardedly moves over to me, her expression impartial.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an old man with your music sometimes,\u201d she says, stopping just out of my reach, her arms still folded over her chest.</p><p>I keep my hand extended to her and force a grin, even though I\u2019m a little nervous. \u201cHey, \u2018Girl from the North Country\u2019 is a classic. And it\u2019s got Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s old-man music.\u201d Her tone is tinged with humor. \u201cBecause inside, you\u2019re an old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that would make you an old lady for hanging out with me.\u201d</p> <p>She rolls her tongue, restraining a smile. I grab hold of her hand and jerk on her arm, tugging her against me and her laughter slips through. The sound breaks the tension between us and I know I\u2019m off the hook for now.</p><p>I twirl her around a few times and she laughs even harder, her hair falling in her face as she stumbles to keep up with me. I continue to twirl her until I know she\u2019s dizzy, like when we were kids and we\u2019d hang out in my backyard, spinning in circles.</p><p>\u201cMicha, please stop,\u201d she begs, laughing and stumbling over her feet. \u201cI can\u2019t see straight.\u201d</p><p>I stop and she crashes against me. She clutches on to my shoulders, holding on to me for support as I slip my arms around her and rock us to the rhythm, supporting her weight. My palm makes a path down her back, stopping when I near her ass, knowing I can\u2019t push things any further, at least not tonight.</p><p>She relaxes her head against my chest and I breathe in the vanilla scent of her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re too nice to me sometimes,\u201d she says. \u201cIn fact, you spoil me. You should really stop.\u201d</p><p>I leave one hand on her back and move the other to her head and hold her against me. \u201cYou deserve to be spoiled,\u201d I say, because no one else will except for me. No one\u2019s ever made her feel special, given her birthday presents, taken her to places, and I\u2019m pretty sure neither her mother nor father have told her they love her. That became my job the moment I got her to climb over the fence.</p> <p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d I ask her, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she says, her hands sliding up my shoulders and hitching around the back of my neck. \u201cBut Micha?\u201d</p><p>I try to remain calm, but it\u2019s difficult when she\u2019s touching me like this. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever kiss me on the lips again without permission,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll kick you in the balls.\u201d</p><p>I snort a laugh. \u201cOkay, sounds fair.\u201d</p><p>She pinches the back of my neck and another laugh escapes me. \u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d And I\u2019m sure she\u2019s telling the truth but I\u2019m just relieved she\u2019s letting it go.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything else and I hold on to her until the song finishes. The next song turns on and we keep dancing, not stopping until five more songs have played through. I pull back only when I feel her weight lean heavy against me, like she\u2019s falling asleep. When I look down at her, her eyes are shut and her grip on me is loosening.</p> <p>\u201cWe should probably get you home,\u201d I say, brushing her hair back from her forehead.</p><p>She shakes her head with her eyes shut. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where do you want to go?\u201d I ask. \u201cBack to my house?\u201d</p><p>She yawns. \u201cCan\u2019t we just stay here?\u201d</p><p>I stand there while she starts to drift off to sleep in my arms. Finally, I lean her back, slip my arms underneath her legs, and pick her up. She\u2019s too tired to argue with me and instead nestles against me as I carry her back to the car. Then I maneuver the door open and lower us both into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get in the backseat?\u201d I ask, sitting her up so I can get my legs in and then shut the door.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cI just want to sleep right here.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s limited space, but in the end it doesn\u2019t matter how much room there is because she\u2019s in my arms and she wants to be there. So holding onto her, I recline the chair back and lie down. She shifts her weight, so she\u2019s to the side of me, our legs entangled as she rests her head on my chest. As the music continues to play, we drift off to sleep together.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Present day...</p><p>Ella</p><p>When I open my eyes to daylight, Micha\u2019s already awake, with my mom\u2019s journal on his lap with the photo of her beside his leg. He\u2019s leaning against the headboard with his boxers on and he\u2019s shirtless so I can see his lean muscles and wisps of his hair dangling across his forehead. There\u2019s an intense look on his face as he reads the pages but when I move to sit up, my head and cheek pulsating in protest, he closes the journal, the intensity shifting to ease.</p><p>\u201cAnything good in there?\u201d I ask, clutching the blanket over my bare chest.</p><p>He shrugs, but by his frown I can tell he hasn\u2019t found anything that\u2019s happy. He tucks the photo into the journal, marking the page before he puts it aside, and then reaches over to stroke my puffy, tender cheekbone. \u201cWe should have put some ice on that last night,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously, Ella, it looks like it hurts like hell.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand over his. \u201cIt does hurt like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me how it really happened?\u201d he asks, and when I tense he adds, \u201cI know when you\u2019re lying, Ella May, so don\u2019t try to tell me some girl hit you because I could tell last night that you were full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you call me out on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was thinking with my dick and nothing else.\u201d</p><p>I smile, thinking about how he pushed me up against the wall and slammed into me so hard I could feel it through my entire body. \u201cMy legs actually hurt a little from last night,\u201d I divulge as I move the blankets off me and massage my thighs.</p><p>He looks down at my legs with intensity in his eyes. \u201cI could say I feel bad, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I cover myself back up with the blanket and lie down on the bed. He lies down with me and props his elbow on the pillow and rests his head against his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d I say as his finger strokes my cheek, \u201cbut you have to promise me that you won\u2019t do anything about it. No going looking for a fight.\u201d</p><p>He stops moving his fingers. \u201cI won\u2019t promise that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla May\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cover his mouth with my hand and cut him off. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Ella May\u2019 me. The last thing I need is a husband who either gets charges pressed against him or ends up seriously injured.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and then his lips curve upward beneath my hand. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He sighs and my hand leaves his mouth. \u201cI won\u2019t go looking for a fight as long as you\u2019ll tell me what happened and call me your husband again.\u201d He gets this goofy grin on his face that makes me smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right, husband,\u201d I say, making his smile expand. I take a deep breath and tell him about Mikey. I can see for the entire time that he\u2019s working really hard to control his reaction, his hands balling into fists as he listens.</p><p>When I\u2019m finished, he\u2019s quiet for a while, and then he finally says, \u201cCan I at least have Ethan kick his ass?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Lila doesn\u2019t need him hurt either. Or in jail.\u201d</p><p>His jaw is set tight and his eyes linger on my cheek before he blows out a breath. \u201cI really want to beat the shit out of him, Ella May. I swear to God...\u201d He clenches his fists, the muscles in his lean arms tightening.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he says, aggravated.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s for the best,\u201d I explain. \u201cBesides, I got a good kick and hit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have never hit a girl... I swear to God...\u201d He blows out a frustrated breath, shaking his head. \u201cCan\u2019t I at least fuck up his car or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll probably think it was you,\u201d I say. \u201cOr me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, you have to give me something.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFine, we can sneak over to his house and slash his tires one night before we go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d He pouts, frowning. \u201cCan\u2019t I, like, smash in his windows and then hit him a few times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the tires,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd no hitting. I don\u2019t want this turning into a huge problem.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepens. \u201cFine, but only for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I give him a kiss and he still seems irritated, but he responds, sliding his tongue into my mouth. We keep kissing as he flips us over, rolling me onto my back and lying over me. He gazes down at me all lovey dovey, stroking my cheek with a thoughtful look on his face, and when he opens his mouth, I have no idea what he\u2019s going to say.</p><p>\u201cLila says you got me a Christmas present,\u201d he says, surprising me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head. \u201cOnly because she made me get you one, so don\u2019t think you have to get me anything. I know we don\u2019t do the whole Christmas stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want to get you something, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can,\u201d I say. \u201cBut just so you know, what I got you isn\u2019t anything great.\u201d Which is true. While we were out shopping for wedding decorations, I saw these friendship bracelets that looked exactly like the ones Micha and I had for a while before we were kids, after we made this promise to be best friends forever. Eventually they got all worn out and we threw them away or lost them, and when I told Lila this, she said I should get them and give them to Micha as a present. I\u2019m not one for sappiness, but I still found myself buying them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m already getting you,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich is the best present ever.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cYou\u2019re so cheesy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you secretly love it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond because he\u2019s right and then he grins as he nudges my legs open with his knee, shifting his hips between them, ready to slip back inside me.</p><p>But a knock on the door interrupts us.</p> <p>\u201cElla,\u201d Lila calls out from the other side.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore her,\u201d Micha whispers, nibbling on my earlobe as he grazes his thumb across my nipple.</p><p>I groan, squeezing my legs against his hips as the tip of him presses into me.</p><p>\u201cElla, I know you\u2019re in there and I need you to come out.\u201d She pauses. \u201cDean and Caroline are here.\u201d</p><p>I work to keep my voice level as Micha thrusts inside me. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in just a second.\u201d My voice comes out breathless and Micha laughs, his mouth hovering over mine.</p><p>He pauses, arching his brow. \u201cA second. Really?\u201d</p> <p>I reach around and pinch his ass, causing him to laugh. \u201cYou better make it a second, otherwise you\u2019re going to get blue balls for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he smiles. \u201cFine, you win.\u201d Then his slips all the way inside me and again I lose myself in him.</p><p>About fifteen minutes later, we\u2019re fully dressed and we head out to the kitchen, exhausted but content. Lila\u2019s at the kitchen table, dressed in her pajamas with little cherries on the fabric. The table and counters are still covered in ribbon and candles, along with a few boxes of cereal and dirty dishes. Ethan\u2019s in the chair beside her, in a T-shirt and plaid pajama bottoms, eating a bowl of cereal.</p><p>A knowing grin rises on Lila\u2019s face when she sees us. \u201cTook you two long enough,\u201d she jokes as she adds a spoonful of sugar to her coffee.</p><p>Ethan glances over his shoulder, his eyes bloodshot, probably because he\u2019s hungover. He stares at my cheek, which I tried to cover up with makeup but shiners on the face are pretty much a lost cause so all I can do is wear it proudly.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell beat you up?\u201d Ethan asks, stirring his cereal with a spoon.</p><p>I touch the spot with my fingers as Micha releases my hand and goes over to the coffeepot beside the sink. \u201cMikey,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Ethan lets out a gradual exhale. \u201cShit, was it because...\u201d</p> <p>He trails off as Micha hands me a cup of coffee. \u201cBecause you two jackasses threw a shake in his car?\u201d he says. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Ethan frowns as he rakes his fingers through his hair, making it stick up on the top. \u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was mine,\u201d I say to Micha, inhaling the aroma of the coffee. \u201cDon\u2019t give him credit for my awesomeness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too hungover for you two to start arguing.\u201d Micha grimaces and then stretches his arms above his head, the bottom of his shirt riding up, flaunting his muscles.</p><p>Ethan and I exchange a challenging look, and then Ethan gives up and returns to eating his cereal as I take a soothing gulp of my coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou said Caroline and Dean were here?\u201d I ask Lila as I sit down at the table.</p><p>Lila nods as she stirs her coffee. Her hair is pulled back in a short ponytail and she doesn\u2019t have any makeup on. \u201cThey were, but I told them you were going to be a minute so they went over to your house and I told them I\u2019d send you over when you came out.\u201d</p><p>Out the window, I see there\u2019s a large maroon SUV parked in the driveway beside my house, just behind the Firebird. \u201cIs that their rental car?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Lila shakes her head. \u201cNo, they drove here because Caroline didn\u2019t want to fly. I think it\u2019s their car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he got rid of the Porsche then,\u201d I say, adding a drop of milk to my coffee.</p><p>\u201cProbably because they\u2019re about to have a baby and there\u2019s no room for a car seat in a Porsche.\u201d Lila smiles and then takes a gulp from her coffee mug. \u201cCaroline\u2019s belly is so cute.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shakes his head, his eyes wide as he fixes them on his cereal. I glance over at Micha, who\u2019s watching me while he leans against the counter, sipping his coffee. When he pulls the mug away from his mouth, he licks his lips. I know him well enough to know that he\u2019s attempting to read my reaction, not just about the Porsche\u2014my mom\u2019s old car\u2014being sold but because Lila\u2019s talking about babies.</p><p>I rise to my feet and look at Micha. \u201cDo you want to come with me and say hi or something?\u201d</p><p>Micha nods and moves away from the counter for the back door. We grab our coats and tell Lila and Ethan we\u2019ll be right back, and then we head over to my house. Thomas\u2019s old truck is parked in the driveway behind Micha\u2019s Chevelle and there are shoe prints in the snow, leading from Micha\u2019s steps to the fence. Then they pick up on the other side of the fence, heading to the stairs of my house. I can\u2019t help but smile because it probably means Dean and Caroline took our little path to the house.</p><p>I point down at the tracks. \u201cHey look, all the cool kids are doing it now,\u201d I joke.</p><p>Micha grabs the top of the fence and hops gracefully over it, landing in the snowbank on the other side. \u201cI\u2019d rather they not. I like that it\u2019s our path and I want it to stay that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I agree, sliding my fingers around the icy metal fence and hoisting myself up. Halfway over, Micha grabs onto my hips and helps me to the ground, setting me in the driveway so I don\u2019t sink in the snowbank.</p><p>We tromp through the snow to the house and walk inside, the air smelling like cinnamon again and perfume, along with a hint of bacon. There are pans on the stove and there\u2019s coffee brewing in a pot on the counter.</p><p>I should have prepared myself more because as soon as we enter, Caroline practically starts jumping up and down. She\u2019s wearing a flowing purple dress and her black hair is braided. The fabric of the dress stretches over her protruding belly and even though I try not to, I can\u2019t help but stare. Dean is sitting on the table, his feet propped up on a chair with a newspaper on his lap. He\u2019s dressed in a collared shirt and slacks and I still can\u2019t get used to the look. Growing up, all he would wear were old T-shirts and jeans and he even dyed his hair blue once.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, there you two are,\u201d Caroline says excitedly, clapping her hands with enough energy to power the entire house. \u201cCongrats, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I force myself not to get awkward and I let the nice moment be, even though deep down I feel uncomfortable with the positive attention.</p><p>She pauses. \u201cElla, what happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>I cup my swollen cheek. \u201cI got into a small fight, but nothing major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like old times,\u201d Dean remarks with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re okay,\u201d Caroline says, examining my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure her. \u201cThe swelling will go down in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then it\u2019ll be gone for the wedding.\u201d She leans in to hug me and I uncomfortably hug her back, feeling her belly press against mine. When she moves away, she notices me staring and places her hand across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a girl,\u201d she says and Dean glances up at me with a strange look on his face that I can\u2019t decipher. I wonder if he\u2019s freaked out, too, at the thought of children, if he\u2019s worried he\u2019ll end up like our father, drunk and nonexistent. I could ask him, but we\u2019re not to that place yet.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d I say to both of them.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Dean folds up the newspaper and tosses it into the table by the cookie jar. He\u2019s quiet for a moment and I seriously have no idea what the hell\u2019s going to come out of his mouth. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by his simple remark and I miss a beat before I respond. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be so good,\u201d Caroline says, whisking over to the counter to a plate of eggs and bacon. \u201cA wedding outside at Christmas time near a lake. I can only imagine the pictures I\u2019m going to get to take.\u201d She starts munching on the bacon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be freezing though,\u201d Dean says, stating the obvious as he hops off the table and then strides up to Caroline and circles an arm around her waist. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to have it inside? We\u2019ll all be freezing our asses off by the end of it.\u201d</p><p>Micha and I exchange a look and then we both shake our head. \u201cNo, cold temperature or not, I\u2019m not having it anywhere else,\u201d I tell Dean, and Micha squeezes my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dean says, confused. \u201cI guess we\u2019re having an outdoor wedding. But who all\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, Micha, Lila, Ethan,\u201d I ramble off the list, counting down on my fingers. \u201cMicha\u2019s mom and boyfriend, you and Caroline obviously, and Dad... and maybe his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Dean says as he kisses Caroline\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe secretary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew about her?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders rise and fall as he shrugs. \u201cHe mentioned it on the phone a couple of weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>He never mentioned it to me. \u201cOh.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sensing my downward mood, Micha takes my hand and gives me a soothing kiss on the cheek, his unshaven jawline rough against my skin, but comforting at the same time. Dean doesn\u2019t seem to notice at all that something\u2019s bothering me and it\u2019s not his fault. He doesn\u2019t know me like Micha does\u2014no one in my family does.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very many people,\u201d Caroline says, picking up a fork from off the plate. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to have more? I mean, you\u2019ve got to have some more old friends still around who\u2019d like to come to it. I know it\u2019s short notice but people might still come if you invited them.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone else I want to invite.\u201d</p> <p>She frowns down at her eggs as she stabs them with the fork. \u201cWhat about you, Micha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with just Ella there,\u201d Micha answers, hugging me against his chest. \u201cNo offense, but I really don\u2019t care if anyone else is there.\u201d</p><p>Caroline sighs as she takes a bite of the eggs. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll start planning then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLila and Micha\u2019s mom have already done a lot,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s that much left to do.\u201d</p><p>Caroline smiles at me as Dean lets her go and heads to the fridge. \u201cOh, Ella, there\u2019s always more to do,\u201d Caroline assures me. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>And she\u2019s right, but only because I\u2019m not planning the wedding myself. If it were just me, I\u2019d have Micha, me, the minister, and no one else. The wedding would take place somewhere serenely beautiful like at a private beach or in a field of violets. I would wear something punk/gothic and Micha would wear black with his leather bands because he always looks so God damn sexy when he wears all black. And there would be no vows, just exchanges of \u201cI do\u201d and a kiss.</p><p>But I\u2019m not planning the wedding myself. I have a whole team of people who are eager to make everything beautiful and sparkly.</p><p>I end up spending the rest of the day with Lila, Caroline, and Micha\u2019s mom in the next town over so that Micha\u2019s mom can pick out a dress. Caroline buys one too and then purchases a necklace for me to wear even though I tell her I don\u2019t need one. She tried to buy me a veil at first but there was no way in hell I was going to walk around with a piece of cloth on my head attached to a diamond tiara. So she ends up buying these clips that have black roses in them to match the dress and then we go to a cake shop and order a cake. The whole thing is getting a little too fancy for me, but I let them go crazy because it\u2019s making them happy and it\u2019s not really hurting anything. Thankfully, Caroline has the same sort of gothic style as me and orders a black- and red-striped cake with this lace on the bottom and red roses on the top. It matches the red and black ribbons and candles we already have for decoration, which Lila insists we can string up on the tree branches, although I\u2019m a little doubtful they\u2019ll stay up, especially if it\u2019s snowing.</p><p>At the end of the day, I\u2019m exhausted, but in a good, strange sort of way, like I may have accomplished something important, like finally committing to the wedding by being part of the planning. Plus, I\u2019d always wondered what it would be like to have people in my life, even though I actually wouldn\u2019t admit it aloud. A few years ago, if I was capable of looking forward and seeing myself getting married, I\u2019d imagine myself taking everything on alone and being miserable the entire time, feeling lonely and empty.</p><p>But right now I feel whole, yet still sad because there\u2019s one person missing from the scene. Someone who can\u2019t be here and it makes my heart hurt because if it wasn\u2019t for my mistake she might have been. I know my mom\u2019s death wasn\u2019t my fault but it took a lot of therapy to get there and despite the fact that I\u2019m not holding onto my guilt anymore, I still know deep down in my heart that perhaps if I would have stayed home that night, my mom wouldn\u2019t have taken her own life and maybe, just maybe, she would have also been out shopping for wedding stuff with me.</p><p>When I get back to Micha\u2019s house, Micha, Ethan, and my brother are still gone, looking for tuxes to rent at the last minute, even though I suggested they all just wear black button-down shirts. As Lila, Caroline, and Micha\u2019s mom get situated in the kitchen, ready to tie more ribbon and put candles in the glass jars they bought, I decide that I need to go visit the cemetery. So I grab my sketchpad and a pencil and bundle up in my coat, gloves, and boots.</p> <p>When I return to the kitchen, Micha\u2019s mom turns around from the sink and notices my outdoor attire. \u201cElla, where are you headed?\u201d she asks, scrubbing down a plate with a sponge as she holds it under running water.</p><p>I tuck my sketchpad under my arm. \u201cI need to go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She looks out the window at the cloudy sky and then at the microwave where the time blinks 4:02. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting dark and colder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be gone for too long,\u201d I assure her, walking toward the back door.</p><p>Lila gives me a strange look from the kitchen table as she loops some ribbon into a bow. \u201cDo you want company?\u201d</p><p>They look at me as I open the back door and let the winter air inside. \u201cNo. There\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d I wave at them. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon. I promise.\u201d Before any of them can argue, I step outside and shut the door. Heading down the driveway, I pull the top of my jacket over my mouth and nose as the frosty air bites at my skin.</p><p>At the end of the driveway, I veer to the right and walk down the sidewalk toward the cemetery, keeping a steady pace, knowing that I\u2019m not going to be able to endure the icy air for very long. By the time I reach the cemetery, my fingers are numb, but I shake off the cold as I sit down in the snow in front of her headstone. There\u2019s a leafless tree just behind it and icicles dangle from the bare branches. The iron gate that borders the cemetery is frosted with snow that also covers the tops of some of the headstones.</p><p>I relax back on my hands as the snow seeps through my jeans and stare at her gray headstone, trying to gather my thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure what to say,\u201d I say aloud, my breath fogging out in front of me. \u201cI know I should come visit more, but I don\u2019t live here any longer.\u201d I set my sketchpad and pencil aside and lean forward, resting my arms on my knees. \u201cSo I moved to California... I have a home and everything, which is weird, but nice, I guess.\u201d I breathe in and breathe out. \u201cEverything is nice really.\u201d I pause. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you never got your nice... I started reading your journal and I was hoping it\u2019d have some nice in it, but there isn\u2019t any, not really.\u201d I shut my eyes as the cold air kisses my cheek. \u201cI really would like to know if you ever did get any sort of happy. I know Dad said he thinks that you might have been happy sometimes, but he didn\u2019t sound like he fully believed it. And I know that sometimes you can fake it because that\u2019s what I do sometimes. I actually used to do it a lot, but not so much anymore... anymore when I\u2019m happy. I think it\u2019s real.\u201d My words are true, real, honest. I want to know if she was ever really happy, but maybe it\u2019s better not knowing since maybe the answer\u2019s not what I want to hear. Maybe she\u2019d tell me no, that she was never happy\u2014not ever. Not when she was younger, when she got married, had kids. I\u2019ve been in that place where depression was everything but it\u2019s not my life anymore and I couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine not getting a glimpse of happiness that I feel now. If depression was all she ever had then it would be sad and tragic and heartbreaking.</p> <p>\u201cCompletely off the subject, but I\u2019m supposed to be writing vows,\u201d I say to my mom\u2019s headstone, wishing she could really hear me. \u201cBut writing\u2019s never been my thing.\u201d I press my pencil to the paper and then I draw a line down it, letting my hands move freely. \u201cDrawing was more of my thing.\u201d Another line and then another. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you knew that. I know you raised me and everything, but we never really talked, at least about life and stuff. I never even knew you liked to draw until I got a box from your mom with some of your drawings on it. Well, she didn\u2019t exactly send it to me\u2014her lawyer did. She actually passed away. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that either. I mean, I didn\u2019t know her, yet at the same time it\u2019s sort of sad she\u2019s gone.\u201d I make a few shadings and some curves and jagged lines. When I pull the pencil away, I\u2019ve drawn Micha\u2019s face, half shaded, then below it I write, My light in my dark life. I turn the page and draw another quick image. It\u2019s nothing fancy but that\u2019s okay because fancy\u2019s not the point right now. When I\u2019m finished, I have a picture of him holding his guitar, music notes surrounding him. Below it I write, His mouth warmed my soul. I draw another one and write, God, I feel so loved sometimes I forget how to breathe. Then I start moving the pencil over the paper again, creating a map of our life, the first time we slept together in the same bed, the fence, his car, the concerts, the New Orleans trips, the lake, even the bridge. Not all the lines are perfect, but it\u2019s the little flaws and imperfections that make the story so beautiful. I finish off the last drawing, which is solely of Micha and write, My everything. Then I close the sketchpad and get to my feet, dusting the snow off the back of my jeans, my ass frozen and numb.</p><p>I know that if I\u2019m going to turn it in for my final portfolio, I\u2019m going to have to do more work on it, but the start is there, the basis, and I can build on it from there. Besides, starting is always the hardest part and even though I know everything won\u2019t just easily fall into place, at least I know that it\u2019s headed toward a completion.</p><p>A potentially wonderful completion.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Micha</p><p>When I return home from tux shopping, without a tux, because apparently there\u2019s nowhere around Star Grove that has them, Ella\u2019s not at the house. My mom tells me she went out on foot somewhere with her sketchbook, which worries me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where she went?\u201d I ask her, sitting down on the sofa beside her as she works on wrapping a Christmas present.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, but it couldn\u2019t have been too far, right? Since she walked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe, but maybe not.</p><p>My mom secures a piece of tape on the Christmas present and then sticks a bow on it. \u201cThere, I think I\u2019ve finally got everything wrapped.\u201d She leans back to put the Christmas present below the small artificial tree in the corner.</p><p>I frown as I slump back in the sofa. \u201cWhy is everyone so into presents all of a sudden? We never made a big deal about them before. First Ella and now you.</p> <p>\u201cSo... what\u2019s wrong with changing things and giving presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t get anyone anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really worried about everyone or just Ella?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cShe got me something and it feels like I should give her something back, but I don\u2019t want it to be something stupid\u2014I want it to mean something.\u201d</p><p>My mom eyes me over for a moment and then she gets to her feet. \u201cGet your coat on and follow me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it.\u201d She uses her stern voice and I get to my feet.</p><p>We put on our coats and then she heads outside, taking Ella\u2019s and my path and climbing over the fence to get to Ella\u2019s yard. I follow her, totally confused because she\u2019s acting weird. Then we wind around the Firebird and step up the back stairs to the door and she knocks, which makes things even weirder because I\u2019ve rarely knocked before. I usually just walk in.</p><p>\u201cMom, seriously, what are we doing?\u201d I ask, stuffing my hands into my pockets.</p><p>My mom knocks again and then turns to me, shivering from the cold. \u201cA few weeks ago, I saw Raymond carrying out a bunch of boxes to the garage. I offered him some help and we got to talking and he told me that the boxes had some of Ella\u2019s mom\u2019s old stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? I\u2019m not following you, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>She smiles at me. \u201cI\u2019m thinking that Ella would probably really like something that belonged to her mom, maybe something she could wear at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell her this is by far the worst idea she\u2019s ever had, since Ella\u2019s dad gets weird talking about stuff like that and I\u2019m not even sure how Ella would react if I gave her something of her mom\u2019s since it\u2019s such an emotional subject for her. But before I can say anything, the door opens up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Terri,\u201d Mr. Daniels says, looking confused as to why the two of us would be standing on his doorstep.</p><p>\u201cHey, Raymond,\u201d my mom says with a smile. \u201cI have a huge favor to ask you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. My mom hasn\u2019t always been this way\u2014so pushy. Well, she sort of has, considering it was her idea for Ella and me to get married in the first place, but she seems to be getting pushier the older she gets.</p><p>Raymond\u2019s brows crease and my mom starts explaining the little Christmas present dilemma. I feel my inside wind into knots, worried that it\u2019s going to upset him and he\u2019s going to take it out on Ella. I know they\u2019ve been good and everything, but still I can\u2019t shake the past and the things I\u2019ve seen.</p><p>And when my mom says, \u201cSo we were wondering if maybe there was something of Maralynn\u2019s we could give her, maybe in one of those boxes I helped you put in the garage a few weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>He scratches his head, looking really uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure there is. I mean, most of that stuff was just old clothes of hers.\u201d</p> <p>I tug on my mom\u2019s sleeve and say to Mr. Daniels, \u201cNo worries, we\u2019ll figure something else out.\u201d</p><p>My mom ignores me, keeping her feet planted. \u201cThere\u2019s not even, like, a piece of her jewelry or something? Like some earrings that were hers?\u201d</p><p>Raymond looks even more uneasy and I\u2019m about to just walk off and leave her there when suddenly he stands up straighter and looks over at the garage.</p><p>\u201cHold on... I think I just thought of something.\u201d He leans back into the house and grabs a large coat, slipping it on along with a beanie before he steps out and shuts the door. We follow him to the garage and my mom shoots me a grin, like, Ha-ha, I was right, and I shake my head but smile.</p><p>When we get inside the garage, Mr. Daniels flips on the lights and heads over to a stack of boxes in the corner. He lifts up the top box and sets it aside and then stares at the box below it for a moment, almost as if he\u2019s afraid to open it. I glance at my mom, who swallows hard, looking a bit uneasy. But then Mr. Daniels relaxes a little and carefully opens the box. He rummages around inside it for a moment and then he takes out this small wooden box. When he turns around, he\u2019s holding it in his hand like it\u2019s something really important.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a real wedding, you know,\u201d he says, looking up from the box. \u201cWe barely even dressed up.\u201d</p><p>My mom nods understandingly. \u201cMicha\u2019s father and I got married at a park and I think there was, like, a total of ten guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only had two,\u201d Mr. Daniels says. \u201cThey were both my friends, and the only reason we invited them was to be our witnesses. Maralynn didn\u2019t want to have anyone else there.\u201d He takes a deep breath and sighs. \u201cBut anyway,\u201d he says, and extends his arm toward me, urging me to take the wooden box. \u201cI gave this to Ella\u2019s mom the morning of our wedding. It\u2019s not anything fancy. I actually bought it at a pawnshop for, like, twenty-five bucks, but she wore it when we got married and maybe you can give it to Ella and have her do the same.\u201d</p><p>The box creaks as I open it. Inside there\u2019s a black ribbon threaded through a small red rose pendant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a necklace,\u201d Mr. Daniels tells me. \u201cElla\u2019s mom had a thing for roses. I\u2019m not sure if Ella will even want to wear it, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d</p><p>Discounting the fact that Ella might get a little emotional about it being her mom\u2019s, if this were a normal necklace I could see her wearing it with pride.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, shutting the box. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll like it and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be glad that you gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Daniels nods, and then without saying anymore we leave the garage. My mom and he chat at the back door for a little while about nothing major as I stare at the sky noting that it\u2019s turning gray and wondering if Ella came home while we were in the garage. I decide to go check and say thanks again to Mr. Daniels before I head back over to my house. When I walk in, Lila and Ethan tell me that she\u2019s not there and that they\u2019re getting ready to go visit his parents for a while, even though he doesn\u2019t want to. They head out and I go into my room and hide the necklace. Then, trying to distract myself, I read some of her mom\u2019s journal. Page after page of dark thoughts:</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. Be a mother and a wife. I thought I could but now I feel like I need to run, flee, escape the fear of commitment on foot. Because it\u2019s either escape or wait until Raymond decides he\u2019s had enough of me and abandons me. It\u2019s inevitable. I can feel it. He\u2019ll leave me because really I\u2019m not good enough and sometimes I don\u2019t want to be good enough. It\u2019s too much work and takes too much strength and I\u2019m so tired.</p><p>Maybe I should just run away and leave it all behind.</p><p>I really should.</p><p>Her words pierce at my chest because if I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d swear Ella had written them. But I don\u2019t believe that Ella will run away again. She loves me and I know that, even if she has a hard time expressing her feelings. I know she wants to be with me. She moved the ring to her engagement finger and moved in with me. She won\u2019t run.</p><p>She can\u2019t.</p><p>I keep reading through and my mom sticks her head into my room to tell me she\u2019s heading out with Thomas to get some dinner.</p><p>\u201cDo you want anything?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are some leftovers in the fridge if you get hungry,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say and she smiles and then starts to shut the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd Mom?\u201d</p><p>She pauses. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for going over to the Daniels\u2019s and doing that,\u201d I say.</p><p>She smiles. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019m just glad we found you something good to give her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>When she leaves, I glance at the clock and decide to give Ella fifteen more minutes before I go searching for her. I continue reading the journal, periodically checking the clock. The next several pages are equally depressing and my heart starts to feel heavy in my chest. It\u2019s like I\u2019m reading about a downward spiral, but fortunately I\u2019m the one reading it, not Ella. It was her choice not to, which makes her so much stronger than all this darkness, because she knew it would probably bring her down and she chose not to let it\u2014she chose to be happy.</p><p>I\u2019m about to put the journal away when I realize there\u2019s only one more page left and I decide to read it so I can be done with it. But then I\u2019ll have to go and break the news to Ella that I couldn\u2019t find anything happy inside the journal. Hopefully it won\u2019t crush her heart.</p><p>But as I read over the last page the heaviness dissipates and the words kind of make me smile. After I finish reading it, I get up to go look for Ella because I\u2019m worried about her being gone for so long and because she needs to read this. I put my jacket on and head to the back door where I left my boots, but as I\u2019m crossing the kitchen, the door opens and a breeze gusts inside. Ella enters looking as frozen as a Popsicle, her lips blue, her cheeks kissed pink, and she\u2019s shivering.</p><p>She offers me a small smile as she shuts the back door behind her. \u201cWere you going somewhere?\u201d she asks, eyeing my coat as she hugs her sketchbook to her chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah, to look for you.\u201d I stop zipping up my jacket and place my hands on her cheeks, which are ice cold. \u201cGod, you\u2019re freezing. How long were you out there?\u201d</p><p>She looks over at the clock on the microwave. \u201cA couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ella.\u201d I take the sketchbook and set it aside on the counter. Then I tug off her gloves, gather her hands in mine, and breathe on them while I try to rub warmth back into her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiles up at me. \u201cHow was your day tux shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good as any other day shopping. Although we didn\u2019t get tuxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of them. You\u2019ll look much better in your jeans and a button-down shirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs long as you think so then I\u2019m okay with it,\u201d I tell her, then pause, choosing my next words carefully as my fingers wrap around her wrist. \u201cWhen I came home I read some more of your mother\u2019s journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d She pretends to be only slightly interested but I feel her pulse accelerate in her wrist. \u201cFind anything good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Do you want to read it?\u201d</p><p>Her throat bobs up and down as she swallows hard, and then she looks at the sketchbook on the counter. \u201cCan I wait just a little bit longer? I\u2019m in good mood and I want to stay in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what I found is good,\u201d I promise her. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019ll still be hard to read, whether it\u2019s good or bad. It still has to do with her and she\u2019s gone and it always makes me sad.\u201d</p><p>How can I argue with that? \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, but I promise it\u2019s not bad and I really think you need to read it before we get married.\u201d I massage her right hand and she winces. \u201cDoes your hand hurt?\u201d</p><p>She nods, wincing again. \u201cIt\u2019s the one I punched Mikey in the face with. My knuckles collided with his jaw.\u201d</p><p>Thinking about Mikey hitting her still gets under my skin, but I force myself to shove it aside because I promised her I wouldn\u2019t do anything about it and I refuse to break my promises to her no matter what. \u201cHow many times have I told you to hit here?\u201d I free her hand and pound my fist flat against my palm. \u201cDon\u2019t use your knuckles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I was drunk and he\u2019s a scary guy. I got a little nervous and screwed up the punch,\u201d she says and the anger inside me flickers. I was never one for fighting. Sure, I\u2019ve gotten into a couple of fights but the only major one was with Grantford Davis, who deserved to get his ass kicked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do for the rest of the night?\u201d I tuck a strand of her auburn hair behind her ear.</p> <p>She looks around at the empty kitchen. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaroline went to your house with Dean. My mom went to dinner and Thomas went out with his friend.\u201d I place my hands on her hips. \u201cAnd Lila and Ethan went out to get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have the entire house to ourselves?\u201d she asks with a naughty grin on her face.</p><p>I tap my finger on my lip. \u201cWhatever shall we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm...\u201d Her eyes sparkle as she collects the sketchpad off the counter. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I return my hand to her waist and glide my palm around to her ass, cupping it roughly. Her body arches toward me. \u201cOh, I have a few ideas, starting with you getting naked.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and then suddenly takes off running toward the hallway, chucking her sketchpad onto the couch as she passes it. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll get naked when you can find me.\u201d She smiles at me then spins around and disappears down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cOh, pretty girl,\u201d I call out, winding around the table and chasing after her. The house is silent as I walk through the living room and past the sofa, getting a glimpse of a piece she\u2019s been working on in the open sketchpad. It\u2019s a drawing of me holding my guitar with music notes around me. Below it she wrote, His mouth warmed my soul.</p> <p>My heart does this stupid, very unmanly pitter-patter thing inside my chest, but I smile and take off jogging to my room. I check the closet, under my bed, and then, giving up on my room, I head for my mom\u2019s room. I search high and low, but can\u2019t find her anywhere, so I look in the bathroom. When I still can\u2019t find her, I backtrack to the living room. I\u2019m about ready to step through the doorway and into the kitchen when she jumps out from behind the wall and into the doorway right in front of me, scaring the shit out of me. I press my hand to my chest as I catch my breath and she laughs as she wraps her legs around me and throws all her weight into me, sending us to the ground. I manage to not smack my head on the floor, but my back does hit it hard.</p><p>She lands on top of me, her body falling on mine, and then she quickly pushes up so she\u2019s sitting on me with one leg on each side. Her hands come down beside my head as she stares down at me, her hair veiling around our faces.</p><p>\u201cThat is for all the times you wrestled me to the ground,\u201d she says, seeming very pleased with herself as she pants for air.</p><p>I shake my head as I sneak my hands to her hips. \u201cHave I taught you nothing?\u201d With one swift movement, I flip us over so she\u2019s on the ground and I\u2019m lying on top of her. \u201cI always win at wrestling.\u201d</p><p>Then I kiss her.</p><p>Hours later we\u2019re lying in my bed, our bodies tangled together as she lies naked on her side. She hasn\u2019t read the journal page yet and I\u2019m not going to push her. Instead she has her sketchbook out and she\u2019s scribbling lines down on a fresh sheet of paper, attempting to recapture a photo of her mom sitting on her bed, looking sad. On the other side of the sketchbook there\u2019s a picture of what looks like me with the words My everything written on the bottom.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you working on?\u201d I ask her as I trace a path up and down her spine, and with each stroke she shivers. \u201cI know this one\u2019s your mom\u201d\u2014I tap my finger on the drawing of me\u2014\u201cbut what\u2019s this one about?\u201d</p><p>The pencil briefly stops moving across the paper. \u201cCan I explain it to you later?\u201d She peers over her shoulder and wisps of her hair fall into her face. \u201cI want to finish it first and then tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>Everything. What does she mean by \u201ceverything\u201d? \u201cCan I have a hint?\u201d</p><p>She studies me, chewing on her lip, and then she directs her attention back down at the drawing, covered with angled lines and dark shades. \u201cIt\u2019s about our past... and our future.\u201d</p><p>Our future. I\u2019m surprised by her honesty and feel guilty because she\u2019s been so honest with me lately and I\u2019ve been keeping a huge secret from her. Well, not exactly a secret, but I\u2019ve been withholding information, concerned about how she\u2019ll react, fearing she\u2019ll say she\u2019ll go even though she doesn\u2019t want to. Or she\u2019ll say she won\u2019t go and that will be the end of my music dream. But it\u2019s time to stop avoiding the decision, especially when she\u2019s being so straightforward.</p><p>I let my finger trail up her back a few more times and then I drape my arm over her side and press my face against the back of her neck, folding my arms around her. \u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d I say, and her body goes as rigid as a board. \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s just news... a decision we need to make.\u201d</p><p>I hear her drop the pen onto the paper. \u201cOkay.\u201d She sounds anxious.</p><p>I kiss the back of her neck and shut my eyes. \u201cI got a call from Mike the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What\u2019d he want?\u201d She\u2019s trying to act calm but I can tell she isn\u2019t.</p><p>I open my eyes and press my cheek against her skin. \u201cYou remember that Rocking Slam Tour that I was telling you about a while ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tour you really wanted to go on but didn\u2019t think you were good enough to get on?\u201d She rotates over onto her back and looks at me. \u201cThe one with all the bands and singers who you idolize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>She pauses. \u201cDid you get on?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>A smile gradually rises on her face. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d She smashes a cheerful kiss against my lips, shocking me, and I\u2019m too surprised to even kiss her back. When she pulls away, she looks confused as she assesses my reaction. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t you happy about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d I trail off, searching for the right words. Finally, I sit up and bring one of my knees up, resting my elbow on top of it. \u201cThe tour starts in a few weeks and goes for a few months.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and hugs her knees against her bare chest, trying to look okay about it but sadness fills her eyes. \u201cSo you\u2019d be gone for a few months?\u201d</p><p>I nod, staring out the window at the glow of the Christmas lights shining against the ice on the house. \u201cAnd I\u2019d have to cancel our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips together, like she wants to say something, but she\u2019s trying to fight it. Then she lowers her head onto her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the honeymoon. I want you to live out your dream.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a moment as I work to pick up on her vibe, the real one that she\u2019s trying to hide from me. \u201cPretty girl, tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d I ask, because I can\u2019t read her very well at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking you should go,\u201d she says, lifting her head up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hold you back. I promised myself I\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be holding me back.\u201d I scoot closer to her and put a leg on each side of her. \u201cI want to be with you no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she says, taking my hands in hers. \u201cAnd you will. We\u2019ll just be apart for three months, which we\u2019ve done many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was miserable all those times.\u201d I pull my hands back only to put them on her legs so I can spread them open. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should go.\u201d I pull her toward me and wrap her long legs around me, feeling a ping of disappointment, but knowing it\u2019s right. If she\u2019s not going, than neither am I.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to go and you\u2019re going to love it. I\u2019m not going to have it any other way.\u201d She looks me straight in the eyes like she means business. \u201cI won\u2019t marry you if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say. I know her well enough that I know she\u2019s probably not one hundred percent okay with this, but she\u2019s trying to make me happy. But I don\u2019t want to go without her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d I sputter out abruptly, sounding like an idiot.</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cOn the road for three months?\u201d</p><p>I nod, getting a little excited at my sporadic, yet brilliant idea. \u201cIt could be fun. You and me and the car and the road. It could be our first adventure as husband and wife. We always said we\u2019d go places when we were kids. In fact, we promised one day we would. This could be our chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor three months?\u201d she repeats. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time on the road and I have school and work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could take a break from work and take online classes maybe,\u201d I suggest and then feel like an ass for even asking her to do such a thing.</p><p>She gets quiet, thinking about what I said, looking panicked and lost and excited all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide now,\u201d I tell her, not wanting her to feel pressure to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do. \u201cJust think about it for a few days.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates and then conclusively nods. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll think about it, but only if you do one thing for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin spans across her face. \u201cPlay me the song.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Ella</p><p>Go on the road for three months with him? Really? It\u2019s crazy to even think about, yet at the same time I want to go. It\u2019s not like I\u2019d truly miss my job at the art gallery and I could finish school online. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I wonder why I\u2019m even thinking about it at all. I should just go with him. Live life to the fullest. Draw. Be happy. Relax. I\u2019ve never done that before, never thought I could. But suddenly it hits me: I can. Holy crap. I could just do whatever I want. Travel on the road with him, listening to him play, watching him up on stage as his words move me the way he always does whenever he sings. It seems so damn easy, so why am I hesitating?</p><p>I decide after he plays me his song I\u2019ll tell him that I\u2019ll go with him. That way he won\u2019t have to worry about leaving me behind, because I know he is. Oh my God, I\u2019m seriously going to do this.</p> <p>Dressed in only his boxers, Micha gets his guitar from the closet and sits down at the foot of the bed. Holding the guitar his lap, he wraps his long arms around it, and then plucks at the strings. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sort of nervous.\u201d His eyes skim over my body as I relax against the wall with only a sheet draped over my naked body. \u201cI never in a million years imagined you\u2019d be naked when I played you this.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile as I fluff up a pillow and lean against it. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not going to even be surprised if somewhere in your song you talk about me being naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He lowers his head, his blond hair hanging down into his aqua eyes as he positions the guitar. \u201cThis song was not about my horny feelings for you. Only about my love.\u201d He peers up, grinning, but it\u2019s underlined with nervousness.</p><p>I roll my eyes, but my stomach flutters. \u201cSo sappy.\u201d</p><p>He wiggles his eyebrows at me and then he grows silent, holding his breath. \u201cAre you ready for this, Ella May? Because it\u2019s super intense.\u201d</p><p>I nod excitedly. \u201cBring on the intensity.\u201d</p><p>His fingers start moving gracefully across the strings, and everything around me, the room, my thoughts, my body blurs away into something that I never thought I could be. When he sings the first few lyrics, the soft, melodious sound of his voice blankets me and I float away to a place of memories linked to emotions that connect his soul to mine.</p><p>I see you standing inside the crowd, heart hidden inside, drowning in pain, no way to get out.</p> <p>The pain stabs at my heart, bleeds inside me, because if you\u2019d just let me, I\u2019d take all the pain away.</p><p>You think no one needs you. That you don\u2019t deserve anything else, so you let yourself drown.</p><p>But I sink with you, refusing to let go. I want to take away the pain and let it bleed into my soul.</p><p>He starts to pluck the strings with more passion, the volume increasing as he closes his eyes, his voice intensifying as he reaches the chorus.</p><p>Know that no matter what happens</p><p>through the hurt, the sadness, the burning ache inside my chest</p><p>I\u2019ll always be with you, inside and out.</p><p>Through hard times and helpless ones, through love, through doubt</p><p>My heart is yours forever. I\u2019ll never let go. I\u2019ll never let you sink.</p><p>I\u2019ll carry your pain for you if you just let me.</p><p>He pauses as he plays a few more intense notes and then opens his lips again.</p><p>The way I feel about you burns deep inside my chest, feelings I hold in, but desperately want to let out.</p><p>It hurts every time I\u2019m around you, hoping things will change, that somehow I\u2019ll find a way to save you,</p><p>find a way to stop you from drowning, pull you back and take your place, let the pain take me over.</p><p>God, please just let me take the pain away before it kills me because I can\u2019t watch you drown anymore.</p><p>Because I need you. I want you. I can\u2019t live without you.</p><p>The pitch of his voice is a little uneven at the end, but it still sounds beautiful and his fingers keep playing, his eyes still shut.</p><p>Know that no matter what happens</p><p>through the hurt, the sadness, the burning ache inside my chest</p><p>I\u2019ll always be with you, inside and out.</p><p>Through hard times and helpless ones, through love, through doubt</p><p>my heart is yours forever. I\u2019ll never let go. I\u2019ll never let you sink.</p><p>I\u2019ll carry your pain if you just let me.</p><p>God, please just let me.</p><p>His voice drifts off as he plucks a sequence of notes and then finishes the song. He sits quietly for a moment, his chest rising and falling before he opens his eyes. Then he takes one look at me and his eyes widen in alarm.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He shoves the guitar aside and scoots across the bed toward me. \u201cBaby, you don\u2019t need to cry. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be a sad song.\u201d</p><p>I touch my fingers to my cheeks and they\u2019re soaked with tears. I hadn\u2019t even realized I was crying or when I began to, but I\u2019m guessing probably from the start because each word hit me powerfully in the heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad,\u201d I tell him, wiping the tears away with my hand. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know you felt like that all the way back when you were fifteen. It means you felt like that for a really long time.\u201d</p><p>He traces his fingers down my cheeks, erasing the tears, but the feelings behind them still linger in me and I\u2019m glad. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even understand the lyrics myself at first, but when I finally did I realized I loved you and I\u2019d do anything to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>More tears flow from me and I don\u2019t even try to hold them back\u2014I couldn\u2019t even if I tried. Too much emotion was in that song and it still burns in my heart, too fresh, raw, but in the most wonderfully real way. I think about all those years where it was just him and me and all the many more years we have ahead of us.</p><p>As I climb onto his lap, I circle my arms around him and hug him tightly. \u201cJust so you know, you were the one who didn\u2019t let me drown. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I probably would have given up,\u201d I say and he rubs his hand up and down my back. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Micha</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting her to cry. I knew the song was really intense and emotional, which is why I\u2019d never sung it to anyone before, but Ella\u2019s not a crier and her tears only added beauty to the moment.</p><p>I hold on to her as the sun disappears behind the mountains and the room shifts to a dark gray, the lamp the only source of light in the room. Finally her tears subside and she moves away from my chest. Her eyes are red and puffy as she dabs her fingers across her cheeks. \u201cSo what did you find in my mom\u2019s journal?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cYou want to read it now? I thought you wanted to wait?\u201d</p><p>She brushes her hair out of her face. \u201cI guess so, since you said I had to read them before the wedding and it\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I smile as she traces the cursive lines of the tattoo on my rib cage. \u201cTomorrow and you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>Her lips itch to smile as she stares down at the tattoo. \u201cI think I was yours a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know so, at least I do now.\u201d She tilts to the side and grabs the journal off my nightstand and then hands it to me. \u201cWill you read it to me... the page you said I need to read?\u201d</p><p>I nervously nod, hoping she\u2019ll take what I read as a good thing, and then I lie us down on our sides, facing each other with our heads on the pillow and our legs tangled together underneath the sheet. Her fingers fold around my ribs as I hold the journal up, turning it to the page that I marked. \u201cI think it\u2019s the vows she wrote right before she married your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She seems shocked. \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re her vows, because it didn\u2019t seem like she was too eager to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure this is about your dad, since it says To Raymond on the top,\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice, what she wrote. Short and simple, but nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how our vows are going to be?\u201d she asks, peeking up through her long lashes, giving me a hopeful look.</p><p>\u201cThey can be however you want them to be,\u201d I reply. \u201cAnd if you still want to back out, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d She nestles her head into the crook of my shoulder. \u201c \u2019K, I\u2019m ready. Read what she wrote.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>I was living in a world where nothing made sense. Darkness. Instability. Life on the verge of death. Then you came into my life and shined through the darkness, showing me that light did exist. And for a moment I walked the path, breathed for the first time in a long time. You gave me air and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Without you, I wouldn\u2019t remember what it was like not to suffocate. Without you, I wouldn\u2019t remember what the light felt like. And I\u2019ll always love you for that, Raymond Daniels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stop reading and look down at Ella, checking her reaction. She looks like she\u2019s going to cry again and then suddenly she sits up and moves out of my arms.</p><p>Before I can respond, she\u2019s climbing out of bed and pulling a shirt over her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, sitting up.</p> <p>She slips on a pair of jeans, shimmying them up to her hips, and then she fastens the button. \u201cGoing to talk to my dad.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m puzzled, but I don\u2019t want to press. She doesn\u2019t look upset, only eager as she puts on her boots and reaches for her jacket hanging on the bedpost. Then she takes the journal from me, rips out the page I just read, and stuffs it into her pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give this to my dad.\u201d She leans across the bed and presses her lips to my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she says, breathless with enthusiasm as she hurries to the door, leaving me alone in my room and a little stunned.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting her to be so enthusiastic about it, but I\u2019m glad she is. I want her to be happy. I just hope I can keep doing that for her, make all the right decisions, keep her smiling, laughing, keep any pain away, just like my lyrics begged her to let me do.</p><p>Chapter 22</p> <p>Ella</p><p>I run over to my house with a crazy amount of energy fueled by the piece of paper in my pocket. I\u2019m not even sure if it is her vows. In fact, I think it\u2019s not, but what I do know is that my dad deserves to read the words, deserves to know that at one time he made my mom happy when it seemed like it was impossible.</p><p>The Firebird is parked in the driveway, so I know my dad\u2019s home. When I burst into the kitchen, I\u2019m relieved to find he\u2019s eating dinner at the table and he\u2019s alone.</p><p>He still has on his work clothes, a stained white shirt and jeans that are specked with red paint and there\u2019s some paint splattered on his hands. He has a plate with chicken, potatoes, and a roll on it and a cup of milk in front of him.</p><p>His head snaps up in my direction as I come barreling inside the house. \u201cElla, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, pushing away from the table and getting to his feet. \u201cYou look upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I promise,\u201d I say, breathless as I take the piece of paper out of my pocket. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m sort of happy right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad.\u201d His face contorts with confusion, as he looks down at the paper in my outstretched hand. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in Mom\u2019s journal,\u201d I say and his face falls and his mouth plummets to a frown. \u201cJust take it,\u201d I insist. \u201cAnd read it. I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates and then takes the paper from me. His fingers tremble as he unfolds it and then smoothes the creases out. His eyes start to skim the paper. Seconds tick by and tears form in the corners of his eyes. The tremble in his hands intensifies the farther down he gets and I can tell he\u2019s about to cry, but not out of pain. He doesn\u2019t look upset or hurt. Disappointed. Or sad. He looks... well, strangely relieved.</p><p>When he\u2019s finished, he carefully folds it up and then holds it in his hand like it\u2019s something precious. \u201cYou said you got this out of her journal?\u201d he asks as he glances up at me.</p><p>I nod as I wrap my coat tight around myself, hoping he\u2019s feeling at least a little happiness knowing he made Mom happy. \u201cIt was the last page. Was it... was it her vows for your wedding?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he stares at the paper in his hand, a tear or two dripping of his eyes. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever seen him cry before and witnessing it seems like some sort of miracle that makes me happy but also a little uncomfortable.</p><p>He breathes in and out for minutes and then he collects himself and pats my shoulder, giving me this strange look before he pulls me in for a very awkward hug. He smells like cigarettes and paint, but there\u2019s no scent of booze. It\u2019s different and weird, like the hug itself. I remember all those times when I was younger and I watched the other moms at the park hug their kids when they got hurt or just because they wanted to. The many times I watched Micha\u2019s mom hug him when she was happy, sad, or when she wanted to say she was sorry. I remember the first time I was hugged. I was eight and I\u2019d scraped my knee open. Micha tried to hug me better like his mom did with him. His arms barely made it around me before I freaked out and shoved him to the ground. I think about all the hugs that came after that, though, and how each of them became easier.</p><p>This one with my dad is far from easy, but maybe if we do it more often, it\u2019ll become easier, just like moving forward in my life has become.</p> <p>When I get back to Micha\u2019s house, it\u2019s past nine o\u2019clock. The air is deathly cold and seeping into the quiet house. I kick my boots off at the back door, hang up my jacket on the coatrack, and then pad through the kitchen to Micha\u2019s bedroom, only to find the room dark and him asleep in the bed, his face snuggled into the pillow with the blanket over him.</p><p>I flip the lamp on, slip my jeans off, and then quickly hop under the blanket with him. He stirs as I nuzzle up to him and then he tenses when my chilled skin touches his.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d I ask as I comb my fingers through his soft hair.</p><p>He lets out a sigh as his hands find my hips beneath the blanket. \u201cI was having such a good dream, where you snuck into my room and started touching me, but not my hair. It was a much lower place. I think you should try to find it.\u201d</p><p>I smile as my fingers drift down his firm chest. \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>He eyes open, and they\u2019re red and full of sleepiness. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>He slides an arm over my stomach and pulls me closer to him. \u201cTell me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go on the road with you,\u201d I say and as soon as I say it, I know it\u2019s the right choice. For us. \u201cI\u2019ll take the rest of my classes online and quit my job.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s silent and full of surprise. It takes him a moment to answer and when he speaks his voice is off pitch. \u201cAre you sure you want to quit your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you all the time. And I want to watch you play and just draw things that mean stuff to me, like you and I and the places we\u2019ve been, all our spots, like the lake and your room, the tree you used to climb into my window... the one that always brought you to me,\u201d I say with honesty. \u201cIf I could picture my life being any way, that\u2019s how I\u2019d picture it. It\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>His expression is unreadable as he searches my eyes for the truth. \u201cAre you sure? Because you have a few weeks to think about it and I want you to be absolutely sure. I never want you to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I interrupt him. \u201cMicha, I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re sure. I want to spend as much time as I can with you\u2014I want to be with you and I want you to live out your dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure about anything as long as it means I get to have you,\u201d he tells me with passion in his tone as he shakes his head with bewilderment in his eyes, like he can\u2019t believe that this is happening. \u201cAnd yes, I want you to come with me more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven more than you want to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not quite that much, but it\u2019s close.\u201d</p><p>We share a quiet moment as we contemplate our future and where it\u2019ll hopefully take us. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking about. With Micha, I never know, especially when his hand wanders down to my ass and he gets this naughty look on his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous about tomorrow?\u201d he asks as he presses his mouth against my forehead. His finger circles around the infinity mark on my lower back, sending shivers and tickling vibrations through my body.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, yeah,\u201d I tell him as my fingers hook the top of his boxers. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>He slides his hand up my side and then down my arm to my hand. \u201cHonestly, a little, but mainly because I\u2019m worried everyone\u2019s going to freeze their asses off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous that I\u2019ll run?\u201d I don\u2019t even know why I ask it. It just sort of slips out and I can\u2019t help but think of the morning after the night on the bridge, when I decided to run and then just a week ago when we were originally supposed to get married. Neither time was because I didn\u2019t love him. Even the night on the bridge, I did love him even though I wouldn\u2019t admit it. And that time I ran because I didn\u2019t love myself.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d he asks and I nod. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all?\u201d I ask. \u201cEven considering my past?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI know that you love me, Ella May. Just like I know that emotions freak you out, but deep down you feel more about us than a lot of people feel in their lifetime. Just like I know that you\u2019re scared and excited at the same time. Just like I know that every single day I\u2019ve spent with you, good and bad, has been worth it. And it\u2019s because of those things that I know that you\u2019ll walk up that aisle that Lila\u2019s going to make you walk up, say your vows, kiss me, and then we\u2019ll have our happy, sad, sometimes good, sometimes bad, crazy, bumpy, intense, worth-the-journey ever after.\u201d</p><p>His words plunge into my heart and tears well up in my eyes again. \u201cAre you going to say that in your vows tomorrow, because it was pretty perfect.\u201d</p><p>He smiles against my forehead. \u201cNo, I have something better planned for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I lean back and look him in the eyes, which are sparkling. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yeah.\u201d He lowers his mouth toward mine. \u201cAnd it\u2019s even better than the lyrics.\u201d And then he kisses me as his hands explore my body. By the time we pull away, we\u2019re exhausted, naked, and sweaty and it\u2019s just after midnight.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I tell Micha as I look at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s officially our wedding day and Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go through with this?\u201d Micha asks as he pins me between his legs and arms.</p><p>I nod with my eyes closed, but my heart is knocking inside my chest, wanting to flee. I\u2019m going to get married today. Holy shit! \u201cYeah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sound nervous,\u201d he remarks, kissing the top of each of my eyelids.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut that\u2019s probably normal, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cYeah, a little.\u201d</p><p>I free a breath trapped in my chest and open my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m nervous?\u201d he questions.</p><p>I nod, sliding one of my legs out from between his and hitch it over his hip. \u201cBecause it means we\u2019re on the same page and usually that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p> <p>He considers what I said and then bends his knee so it\u2019s pressed up between my legs, his body heat blissfully scorching against my skin. \u201cI guess you could look at it that way, at least if it\u2019ll get you up the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I assure him, cringing at the idea of either walking up the aisle alone or with my dad. Neither seems that appealing because alone I\u2019m probably going to freak out, and with my dad, if I do freak out, he won\u2019t be able to calm me down. \u201cMicha... will you... will you walk up the aisle with me or tell Lila we\u2019re just going to skip that part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell her?\u201d he asks, frowning.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cShe\u2019s wedding crazy. Seriously, I think she should consider becoming a wedding planner.\u201d</p><p>His arms slip around my waist and then he tastes my mouth with his tongue. \u201cIf you want me to walk up the aisle with you, then I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper and hug him tightly, knowing that if he\u2019s there with me it\u2019ll be so much easier to get through it. Everything is when he\u2019s with me.</p> <p>It\u2019s quiet for a while, and when Micha speaks again, he sounds a little bit excited.</p><p>\u201cSo since it\u2019s officially Christmas,\u201d Micha says pulling away from me slightly to look me in the eye, \u201care you going to give me my Christmas present?\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cIt\u2019s a really silly present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d he says. \u201cBesides, silly presents are the best.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and then sit up, slipping from his hold, and then pad over to my duffel bag that\u2019s on the floor in front of the bed. \u201cOkay, but try not to get too disappointed when you open it,\u201d I say, taking out the wrapped-up box with a bow on it. I climb back in to bed and hand it to him.</p><p>He grins at the box as he crisscrosses his legs. \u201cAw, you even wrapped it and put a bow on it and everything,\u201d he says in a teasing voice.</p><p>I shake my head and playfully pinch his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me. And Lila made me wrap it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that you wrapped it,\u201d he says and then rips off the paper like a little kid would. I put the bracelets into a small box, so he has to open that as well. When he gets the lid off, he stares at the thin strips of leather with the words forever engraved on both of them.</p> <p>When he doesn\u2019t say anything, I start to grow nervous, like he might not get what they are. \u201cThey\u2019re like the ones we used to have when we were kids, but I didn\u2019t get the one that says \u2018best friends,\u2019 figuring since we were way more than that I\u2019d just get two forevers.\u201d</p><p>He glances up at me and I can\u2019t read his expression at all. \u201cI remember. You actually made me wear the one that said \u2018best friends\u2019 and it made me sort of feel like girly.\u201d</p><p>I frown, regretting the present. \u201cYet you still wore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you asked me to,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we both know I\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s sappy, right?\u201d I reach for the box to take the bracelets back. \u201cI should have gotten you something better.\u201d</p><p>He quickly picks up the box and turns, holding it out of my reach. \u201cAre you kidding me? This is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said they were girly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said that having a bracelet that said \u2018best friends\u2019 was girly and that was when I was eight.\u201d He smiles and I start to relax as he takes out one of the bracelets. \u201cThis is the perfect present, Ella May, because it means something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sappy present though,\u201d I say as he slips the bracelet on.</p><p>\u201cWhich makes you a sap, just like me,\u201d he replies as he takes my wrist and slips the other bracelet on.</p><p>\u201cI guess you must be wearing on me,\u201d I joke, and then lean in to kiss him. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay.\u201d I fiddle with the bracelet, reducing the size so it\u2019ll fit my wrist, while Micha gets out of bed and starts digging through his dresser drawer. I think he\u2019s looking for a shirt to put on or something, since it\u2019s freezing, so I\u2019m surprised when he returns to the bed still shirtless but with a small wooden box in his hand.</p><p>\u201cNow, I didn\u2019t have time to wrap it since I got it for you tonight,\u201d he says, handing the box to me, his hand shaking a little bit, like it did last Christmas when he gave me the engagement ring. \u201cMerry Christmas, Ella May-soon-to-be-Scott.\u201d</p><p>I smile, but I\u2019m a little nervous at what the hell he could be giving me that would make him nervous. I take a deep breath as I open the box. Inside is a ribbon necklace with a rose pendant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I say with honesty as I run my fingers along the pendant, which feels like porcelain.</p><p>Micha lets out a loud breath as he scoots closer to me. \u201cIt\u2019s actually from me and your father. It belonged to you mother. He gave it to her on their wedding day and we sort of thought maybe you could wear it at our wedding, as a way to sort of be close to her.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like he\u2019s pushed this button and without warning I start to cry, tears streaming down my cheeks like a fountain, dripping down my lips, my nose, onto the necklace in the box. I\u2019m not even a crier, yet for some reason, I seem to be crying a lot lately. Usually, I\u2019d fight them back, but I really don\u2019t care at the moment. I just cry. Cry because I\u2019m happy and sad at the same time. Sad because my mom won\u2019t be there, but happy because I\u2019m marrying the love of my life tomorrow.</p><p>My head tips down so it takes Micha a second to realize I\u2019m crying. When he does, he cups my face and lifts my head back, immediately wiping the tears away with a worried look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI was worried about giving it to you because I thought it\u2019d upset you.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together and shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m happy,\u201d I say with a smile as tears continue to pour out.</p><p>He still looks unconvinced. \u201cSo you like the present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the present,\u201d I say and then kiss him with so much passion we collapse back onto the bed, the wooden box still clutched in my hand. We kiss until we\u2019re breathless, and then I pull way only to say, \u201cThe present is perfect\u2014you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>And he really, really is.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Micha</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you two and your fucking crazy-ass ideas.\u201d Ethan paces back and forth, flattening a path in the snow in front of my car with his hands stuffed in the pockets of his jeans, a hoodie pulled over his black button-down shirt. I went for a different look, wearing a pinstriped buttoned shirt Ella picked out for me, black jeans, and boots, along with a dark jacket we borrowed from Thomas. She made me roll up the sleeves and keep my leather bands on my wrists because she said it made me look sexy. Honestly, I don\u2019t really give a shit what I\u2019m wearing just as long as she\u2019s happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, popping the trunk of the Chevelle. The snow was so deep driving up that I had to put chains on the tires and it was still a pain in the ass to get down here so I\u2019m a little worried about going back. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little cold air.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as he glares at me. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to be ice statues by the time this is over, buried alive under five feet of snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019ll make great snowmen,\u201d I joke as I glance up at the sky where light, fluffy snowflakes drift toward the ground, landing in the bare branches of the trees and covering the ice-covered lake. Lila came down here a little earlier with my mom and scattered candles around a flattened-out area in snow beneath a canopy of trees, although I have no idea how the hell they\u2019re going to get them lit. They also tied black and red ribbons all over the branches along with silvery Christmas lights that are plugged into an extension cord that\u2019s plugged into an AC adapter in my car, which means I have to leave the engine on the entire wedding. They sprinkled rose petals all over the snow, which I can barely see now because of the fresh layer of snowflakes on top of them. After they did all this, they took off to go check on Ella and help her get ready. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not alone, because she seemed a little nervous when I left the house.</p><p>As I unload a few fold-up chairs from the trunk, I pretend I\u2019m not nervous, even though I am. Not because I want to bail but because I\u2019m fucking getting married and it\u2019s starting to freak me out. Ethan\u2019s responsibility lecture is fresh in my mind and I keep thinking, What if I screw up? I can\u2019t. Not with Ella.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d Ethan asks, dropping a few chairs onto a growing pile. \u201cYou look a little pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I put my foot on the bottom bar of a chair and stomp down on it to unfold it, and then I stand it up in the snow.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you line them up straight,\u201d Ethan says as he unfolds a chair and lines it up with the one I just set up. \u201cLila will chew our asses out if we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I smile, but keep my head down as I start forming an even row. It doesn\u2019t take more than a minute to get the few chairs set up, since there\u2019s hardly anyone attending the wedding, but it seems like an eternity goes by. By the time we\u2019re done, I\u2019m fidgety and jittery, a bundle of nerves sparking inside me.</p><p>Finally I can\u2019t take it anymore. Adrenaline is rushing through me and my pulse is erratic so I go back to my Chevelle and open the glove box. Digging around beneath a stack of papers, I find a pack of cigarettes that I hid in there ages ago for moments just like these. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ethan questions as I sit down in the driver\u2019s seat with the door open and my feet planted in the snow.</p><p>\u201cI just need to calm down,\u201d I say and pop one into my mouth. He shakes his head, laughing under his breath as I grab the lighter out of the pack, cup my hand around the end of the cigarette, and light it. As soon as the nicotine enters my lungs, I feel better and my heart rate starts to settle.</p><p>Ethan heaves a large Tupperware bin out of the trunk and drops it onto the ground as I suck drag after drag off the cigarette, my heart calming, my skin warming under my coat and shirt.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel better?\u201d he asks as I graze my thumb over the end of the cigarette and scatter ash across the snow.</p><p>I savor another breath of smoke. \u201cActually, I do.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. Ethan never did like it when I smoked, except I think he used to smoke pot. He would always chew me out, though, for getting ash in his truck and stinking up the upholstery.</p><p>After I finish the cigarette I put it out in the snow as a large maroon SUV comes bumping down the road. I wish I had some cologne on hand because now I stink and Ella\u2019s going to know I\u2019ve been smoking. She won\u2019t get mad at me, but she knows I do it when something\u2019s wrong, and knowing her, she\u2019ll think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to get married.</p><p>The SUV stops close to the Chevelle and the engine stays running as Dean hops out, zipping up his coat. His hair is combed to the side and he has these really shiny shoes on. I remember when we were younger, how he had an eyebrow piercing and was obsessed with the idea that one day he would have tattoos all over his arms and a goatee.</p> <p>\u201cHey, man, you might want to go back to the house and check on Ella,\u201d he says, stuffing his hands into the pocket of his slacks as he walks up to me.</p><p>I meet him at the front of the car and sit down on the frosted hood, folding my arms. \u201cShe said she was going to drive down here with my mom and Lila.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and hitches his thumb over his shoulder, pointing at the road. \u201cShe was... is, but something sort of happened.\u201d</p><p>I stand up, my pulse immediately accelerating as the fear that I\u2019ve been stood up again races through my mind. \u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>He looks tense and uncomfortable, rocking back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure. All I know is that Ella\u2019s friend... that blond girl, told me I should probably come get you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even wait for him to say anything else. I get inside the car, unplug the lights, and press on the gas, hoping it\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking.</p> <p>Hoping she\u2019s not standing me up again.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Ella</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to get air into my lungs, but I feel like I\u2019m suffocating, invisible fingers wrapping around my neck as I battle for oxygen. I don\u2019t even know where the panic attack stemmed from. One minute I was fine, getting my hair pinned up as I listened to Lila talk about her and Ethan\u2019s road trip plans and the next I felt like I was drowning in the fact that as soon as Lila was finished with my hair, I was going to have to put the dress on. Then it\u2019d be time to go to my wedding, say my vows, start my future.</p><p>I\u2019d flipped out and started bawling, scaring the crap out of Micha\u2019s mom, Lila, and Caroline as I jumped out of the chair and raced back into Micha\u2019s room. Lila came to check on me as I was balling on the bed. She tried to talk to me, but I couldn\u2019t stop crying. Then I\u2019d pulled a blanket over my head, ready to shut down, but then I\u2019d remembered all the progress I\u2019d made over the last couple of years and instead I ended up saying something that shocked me.</p> <p>\u201cGo get Micha, please.\u201d My voice cracks through my sobs.</p><p>Lila pauses. \u201cUm, okay.\u201d Seconds later, I\u2019d heard the door shut.</p><p>After she leaves, I cry for what seems like hours, ruining my makeup as tears stream down my face. I keep trying to tell myself to get out of the damn bed and go put the dress on because deep down I know I want to and I\u2019m just scared. Finally, the door creaks open and I freeze as I hear the soft sound of footsteps padding over to the bed. The mattress sinks as someone sits down on the edge of the bed, and then a hand touches my shoulder on the outside of the blanket.</p><p>\u201cElla...\u201d Micha\u2019s voice is alarmingly off pitch. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>When I don\u2019t respond, he pulls the blanket off my head and the cold air stings my skin. I peer up at him through tear-stained eyes and he sighs, looking like he\u2019s on the brink of crying too. \u201cAre you...\u201d He swallows hard as he touches my cheek with his fingers, and then he shuts his eyes. \u201cAre you getting cold feet again?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and sit up, rubbing the back of my hand across my face, making my makeup worse I\u2019m sure. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that... I\u2019m just...\u201d I search for what I\u2019m really feeling, because I want to tell him the truth. \u201cI\u2019m just scared. I keep thinking about putting the dress on, walking down the aisle, saying my vows... moving forward. I\u2019m overwhelmed and I needed someone here who got me. Who could help me put my dress on and get me through this.\u201d A slow breath eases from my lips as I realize that that\u2019s all I want\u2014Micha by my side because he\u2019ll get me through this. Sure, I know that sometimes I have to do things on my own, but at the same time admitting when I do need someone makes me stronger.</p><p>He opens his eyes and blinks back the tears. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I tell him, wholeheartedly. \u201cI just panicked and I\u2019m so sorry. I just need you here with me right now.\u201d</p><p>He studies me for what feels like forever and then he suddenly slides me to the side of the bed, takes my hand, and pulls me to my feet with this intense look on his face. Releasing my hand, he grabs the bottom of my shirt and tugs it over my head, moving carefully to avoid ruining the curls and braids or knocking out any of the black flowers. He discards my shirt on the floor, and then unties the drawstring of my pajamas, his eyes locked on me as he slips them down my legs. I refuse to look away from him and the longer I focus on him, the calmer I get inside, the violent rainstorm settling into a light drizzle. When the pants reach my feet, I step out of them. He makes his way to the closet and gets my wedding dress. It\u2019s a beautiful dress, a shimmering black silk top, a red ribbon securing the back, and an elegant flowing white bottom bunched together in places by red and black roses.</p><p>Micha slips the plastic straps off the hanger as he returns to me and then lowers the dress to the floor so I can step into it. Once I get my legs through, he guides the fabric up my body until the top covers my breasts. Then I hold the front up with one hand and he walks behind me and grazes his fingers down my spine.</p><p>\u201cFeeling any better?\u201d he asks, his breath hot on my neck and I shiver.</p><p>I nod, freeing a trapped breath. \u201cA lot better actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I want you to feel better. I want you to feel good about this\u2014about marrying me, Ella May.\u201d He slowly zips up the dress and the fabric constricts against my body, pushing my breast up the slightest bit. Once he gets it zipped, he steps back in front of me, nudging the flowing bottom out of the way with his boot. \u201cAre you sure you want this\u2014want me forever?\u201d He has this guarded look in his eyes, like he\u2019s trying to pretend that he can handle whatever, but I can tell that if I say no\u2014that I don\u2019t want this\u2014it\u2019ll crush him.</p><p>\u201cMicha, I want this more than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything,\u201d I say honestly as I run my fingers along the bottom of my eyes and cheeks. \u201cJust let me fix my makeup and we can go. I\u2019m sure I look hideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he says without missing a beat. \u201cYou always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHideously beautiful I think you mean,\u201d I joke, and he cracks a smile, his fingers seeking my cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo, you look beautiful,\u201d he promises. \u201cBut if you want to fix your makeup you can. I don\u2019t think I can do that for you.\u201d</p><p>I smile and pick up my makeup bag from the dresser, but he ends up holding one of my hands so it\u2019s sort of like he\u2019s helping me, only it makes the actual act of putting makeup on a bit complicated. But I manage and I end up getting the black eyeliner and lip gloss on without any mishaps. When I\u2019m done, I sit on my bed and Micha kneels down in front of me and helps me put on my boots.</p><p>\u201cI feel like Cinderella,\u201d I remark as I put my foot in and he laces the boot up.</p><p>He peers up at me and a smile touches his lips. \u201cGood. That\u2019s how you should feel.\u201d He stands up and then guides me to my feet before he leans in to kiss me. Then he walks over to the nightstand and picks up the wooden box he gave me last night. He opens it up, takes out the necklace, and, stepping behind me, puts it on me. As soon as the ribbon and rose are secured around my neck, I feel weirdly at peace.</p><p>He kisses the back of my neck and then walks around in front of me. \u201cAre you ready for this?\u201d His tone\u2019s light but I can tell he\u2019s worried about my response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than ready,\u201d I tell him and then grab the front of his shirt and pull him in for another kiss. When I pull away, I give him a questioning look. \u201cWait a minute... did you smoke?\u201d</p><p>He scratches the back of his neck, looking guilty. \u201cSort of, but only because I was a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout starting our future... taking care of you the right way. I just want to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have since the day we became friends,\u201d I assure him and the anxious look in his eyes evaporates as I slip on my leather jacket and tuck the photo of my mom inside it because I want her with me, even if it is just a picture.</p><p>He gives me a funny look, but he doesn\u2019t say anything and then we leave the room, holding hands, and head to our wedding together and everything feels right because he\u2019s here by my side and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Micha</p><p>She looks beautiful in her dress, her hair all done up in braids and curls, her green eyes big as she stares at me, gripping onto my hands for dear life as we get out of the car. I try to stay calm but my hammering pulse makes it hard to breathe, not because I\u2019m nervous but because I\u2019m excited. I turn on \u201cThe Story,\u201d by Brandi Carlile, so it\u2019s quietly playing through the speakers and Ella smiles, remembering how it was playing at Dean and Caroline\u2019s wedding when I told her that I wanted to marry her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou remembered the song,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d I reply, extending my elbow to her. \u201cIt was an epic moment in our history.\u201d</p><p>She loops her arm through mine and then we start to walk up to the aisle. By the time we make it up the snowy rose-covered path, with our friends and family staring at us, I feel so content and happy, knowing that in a few moments Ella will be mine forever and I\u2019ll be hers. I think a few of them are a little bit surprised though to see this actually taking place, particularly Ethan and Lila, who are cuddled up together and who look a little bit shocked when we get out of the car. My mom, however, looks like she\u2019s been pretty much waiting for this day. She nearly beams as she sits with Thomas, watching us with more happiness in her eyes than I\u2019ve ever seen. Dean looks neutral, just how he always looks, and Caroline\u2019s almost in tears. And Ella\u2019s dad\u2019s a little harder to read, but it almost looks like he\u2019s about to tear up.</p> <p>At the end, we stand under the canopy of the trees as the minister starts reading a marriage speech that I barely pay attention to. Snowflakes dot Ella\u2019s hair and melt against her chest where the rose pendant rests just above her breasts, making her skin wet. She looks perfect and I seriously want to lick her right now, but I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate, so I tell myself to keep cool until later tonight when I can do anything I want to her.</p><p>I basically zone out and focus on her until the minister announces for me to read my vows. Then I let go of Ella\u2019s hand only to take out the folded-up piece of paper from my pocket, my fingers shaking as I unfold it.</p><p>Ella looks nervous, her breath increasing and causing more haze to surround her face as she waits to hear what I have to say, the truth about how I feel about her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a time where I didn\u2019t want to be with you.\u201d I glance back and forth between the paper and her as I speak. \u201cFrom the moment you stepped out the door of your house, I thought you were beautiful and I wanted you in my life. I can\u2019t say it was love at first sight since I was too young and I don\u2019t believe in love at first sight. I believe in finding the right person who makes everything easy, who makes me happy, who makes life worth living and more exciting, whether it\u2019s kissing on swing sets,\u201d I say and that gets her to smile, \u201cracing cars, getting tattoos, sharing Popsicles and tears, or just sitting in my room singing while you draw. I couldn\u2019t have done life without you and every single moment, good or bad, has been worth it because it got us right here to this very place and this very moment where I get to have you for the rest of my life. You make me happier than I can even begin to explain. I love you, Ella May, more than life itself, and I\u2019ll continue to love you until I take my last breath\u2014I\u2019ll love you forever. You own my heart.\u201d By the end, my voice is getting unsteady with the emotions flooding through me as I think about everything we\u2019ve gone through to get to this place and that in a few moments she will be mine forever, the girl next door who I fell in love with and gave my heart to completely.</p><p>I suck in an uneven breath as I stuff the paper back in my pocket, knowing Ethan\u2019s going to tease the shit out of me for acting so emotional, but at the moment I don\u2019t care.</p> <p>I keep my attention on Ella, watching her as she fights tears back and takes a piece of paper out of her jacket pocket.</p><p>She stares at it for an eternity, like she can\u2019t find her voice, and her hands tremble. My heart constricts in my chest as I wait for her to say what I mean to her, worried she won\u2019t be able to do it. But then, surprising me, she finally releases a deafening breath and the sound of her voice sends a rush of relief through me.</p><p>\u201cYou know when I first met you, you scared the shit out of me.\u201d She pulls a \u201cwhoops\u201d face and glances at the minister, who sighs because he knows us well enough to know this is just how we talk. Then she returns her focus to me and clears her throat. \u201cYou were so intense and determined to get to know me and I couldn\u2019t understand why you would want to, for a lot of reasons, reasons that you know about because you know me better than anyone.\u201d Her voice wobbles a little and she lets go of the paper and wipes her sweaty palm on her jacket. \u201cBut eventually you sort of wore on me.\u201d Her lips quirk and it makes me grin. \u201cYou became my light in my dark life and you made me feel so loved that I\u2019d forget how to breathe. You were the only one who could make me laugh, smile, have fun, not give up. You were always there for me and somehow, through the crazy, intense years, you fought your way into my soul and ended up becoming my everything. You became my lifeline, the one person I could rely on no matter what, whether I was upset or pushing you away\u2014you were always there for me. And I love you for it and for the amazing person that you are, for writing me songs and tattooing them on your skin, for wearing a ridiculous O-ring on your finger,\u201d she says, trying to smile but I can tell she\u2019s getting overwhelmed by her emotions. \u201cAnd for loving me enough not to let me give up, not matter how hard I fought.\u201d A breath gradually eases from her lips as she stuffs the paper into her jacket pocket.</p><p>When she looks up at me, tears are forming in her eyes. She\u2019s overwhelmed with emotion and I\u2019m sure she can see the same emotion mirrored in my face. I\u2019ve never seen her be so open like that and I think, if it\u2019s even possible, I might have just fallen in love with her more.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet for a moment as everyone just sort of watches us, and then Ethan lets out a loud cough and I shake my head as Ella rolls her eyes. Lila hisses something at him and then the quietness surrounds us again.</p><p>The minister finally continues on to the ring exchange, directing us what to do. I slip the simple silver wedding band on Ella\u2019s finger and her breath falters as she looks down at it and smiles. Then she takes out her ring box and opens it up and it\u2019s a silver one that almost matches the one I gave her, only it\u2019s a little thicker. She replaces the O-ring with it, her hand shaking as she slips it over my finger.</p> <p>\u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife,\u201d the minister announces and suddenly everything\u2019s official. She\u2019s my wife and I\u2019m her husband.</p><p>I hear someone in the crowd clap their hands as I lean in toward Ella to kiss her. She follows my lead, our lips magnetizing toward one another and we meet halfway. Underneath the trees\u2019 branches blanketed with snow, our lips brush and our arms wrap around each other, finally getting to our wonderfully, imperfect, difficult, complex, yet beautiful and worth it ever after.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Two months later...</p><p>Ella</p><p>\u201cWake up, beautiful,\u201d Micha says as he breathes in my ear and presses his warm body up against mine.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I mutter, burying my face into a pillow as I draw the sheet over my naked body. \u201cI\u2019m too tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, pretty girl. I have a surprise for you.\u201d He places a delicate kiss against my neck, slipping his tongue out along my skin before rolling away from me. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be worth it. I promise.\u201d I hear him walk away toward the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019m going to go take a shower. Be ready to go somewhere by the time I get out.\u201d Moments later the door shuts and the shower turns on.</p> <p>I lie in bed for a while, telling myself that I\u2019m not going to get up because I\u2019m too damn tired from all the other mornings he\u2019s woken me up this same way. It\u2019s become a tradition. He finds a way to surprise me, whether it\u2019s taking me out to breakfast or waking my body up with his tongue.</p><p>I finally give in and force myself to open my eyes because I have a hard time saying no to Micha. The sunlight sparkles through the window as I stretch my arms and climb out of bed. I pull a short, black dress out of my suitcase and put it on and then side-braid my hair and secure it with an elastic. After I slip on my sandals, I sink down on the bed and wait for him to get out while I stare at the rings on my fingers. Even two months later, I still can\u2019t help but smile when I see them there, marking one of the best days of my life. The day I told Micha how I truly felt, the day he conclusively became mine. We kissed and danced a lot that day, to a list of songs that made an appearance in our history. It was beautiful and magical and really sappy, but all weddings are. Afterward, we spent hours having sex until I felt like my body was going to break apart. It was amazing and exhausting\u2014everything still is amazing and exhausting. And then we packed up our stuff and headed back home to start our life, but not after Micha made us stop by Mikey\u2019s house so he could slash his tires, like I promised him he could.</p><p>We\u2019ve been on the road for a little over a month now and it\u2019s been an adventure. Micha was given the option of riding the bus with a few other musicians, but because we missed our honeymoon, he decided that we could at least have a road trip so we\u2019re traveling across the country in the Chevelle, making it our goal to have sex in every state. So far we\u2019ve gotten up to sixteen, but after tonight it\u2019ll be seventeen.</p><p>After a while, Micha comes walking out with a towel in his hand, looking gorgeous and sexy in a red plaid shirt that he hasn\u2019t buttoned yet so I get a glimpse of his muscles. His jeans ride low on his hips and my body burns as I look at him, thinking about the many times he\u2019s used those hips to thrust into me. His hair is wet and flipped at the ends and I bite my lip, wanting to run my fingers through it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy right now that I think there might be something wrong with me,\u201d I divulge and he snorts a laugh as he balls up the towel and tosses it onto the hotel room floor.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being happy, pretty girl,\u201d he says, as he ruffles his blond hair into place. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I stand up and help him button up his plaid shirt while he continues to fuss with his hair. \u201cI hope you are, too, though.\u201d</p><p>His brows knit as he glances down at me, his aqua eyes burning with intensity. \u201cOf course I\u2019m happy. You\u2019re here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, if your fans knew you talked like that, they\u2019d go even more wild for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019d probably laugh,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t care what they think. Only you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot the female ones.\u201d I do up the last button and then link my arms around the back of his neck, standing on my tiptoes. \u201cOkay, where are you taking me today, because I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d he says, then grabs my hand and tugs me toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou say that every day.\u201d I pout as he slips his shoes on.</p> <p>He grins at me as he picks up my sketchbook and drawing pencil from the dresser. \u201cI know, and that pouty look that you always get on your face when I won\u2019t tell you makes it so much fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you grabbing that?\u201d I nod at the sketchbook, closing the door behind us as we step out into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to need it,\u201d he says, leading me down the hallway.</p><p>I sigh and follow him down the stairs and out to the car. We climb in, he starts the engine, and then he drives down the highway, heading out of town. We\u2019re in South Caroline right now, so even though it\u2019s February, the air is warm and the humidity makes my skin sticky, especially because we have the windows down. The ocean\u2019s pretty close by, the sand golden, the sky blue, and it makes my hands itch for the pencil and sketchbook Micha has in his lap.</p><p>When he finally stops the car, we\u2019re parked in front of a field covered in luscious grass and bushes. There\u2019s also this lofty tree in the center, by itself, some of the branches stretching toward the sky and others drooping toward the ground. It kind of reminds me of the tree back at home for some reason and it dawns on me why he might have brought me here.</p> <p>Micha grins as he slips the keys out of the ignition. \u201cSo when you said you wanted to come on the road with me, you said you\u2019d love to spend your time drawing things that mean something to you, along with that tree I always used to climb up to get to you. Well, since that very meaningful tree is far, far away right now, I thought maybe you could draw this.\u201d He gestures at the field. \u201cI found this field the other day when I was driving back from practice, searching for something that you could draw because I know you\u2019ve been wanting to do a meaningful landscape drawing. The tree kind of reminded me of the one back home, at least I think so, but then again I\u2019m no artist.\u201d He pauses, waiting eagerly for my response.</p><p>I think I might have fallen in love with him even more. I didn\u2019t think that was possible, but every day the love I have for Micha grows stronger, especially when he does stuff like this for me.</p><p>I lean over the console toward him. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say, unable to help myself. \u201cAnd I love the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he says and then he kisses me. By the time we stop for air, we\u2019re both breathless and I\u2019ve managed to climb over the console and onto his lap and his shirt\u2019s unbuttoned... I don\u2019t even know how it happened.</p><p>His hands are under my dress, grabbing at my flesh as he stares at me a little dazed. \u201cSo are you going to draw the tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but after I draw you first,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause you mean more to me than anything else in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have a ton of drawings of me already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t have one with you sitting under this tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be tired of drawing me, though.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo way. I will never get tired of you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how many times you say that, I will never get tired of hearing it,\u201d he admits, and then a thoughtful expression rises on his face \u201cSo me under the tree, huh? That\u2019s your meaningful drawing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is,\u201d I say, and then we kiss for a little bit longer before we climb out of the car and walk toward the tree, happy, peaceful, and content as we live out our forever just how we want to\u2014together. </p> </body></html>"]
