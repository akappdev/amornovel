My mother was Tanya Krenski; she was formerly a bartender at the Suds Bucket, which is where you met. You saw her socially for about three weeks before you married Queen Dara. (She\u2014Mom, not the queen\u2014used the money you gave her to finish paying for her journalism degree, moved to America, and we lived in Los Angeles for many years while she worked as a reporter for the Times. Not the queen, Mom.)</p> <p>I\u2019m sure you get these kinds of letters all the time, so I\u2019ve enclosed my DNA results, as well as most recent blood work. If you prefer your own physicians to examine me, tough nuts...I hate needles.</p><p>My mother passed away recently without ever telling me who you were. When her attorney read me her last will and testament, I was pretty shocked, and it\u2019s why I had to write to you.</p><p>To tell you a little about myself, I am five foot seven, with blue eyes and dark brown hair. My birthday is March 20, 1972. I enjoy tennis, cooking, and the collected works of Pat McManus and Carl Hiaasen. I work as a hunting and fishing guide for the Outer Banks Co. out of Juneau, and in my spare time I punch up scripts for Hollywood. The former is infinitely more satisfying, but the latter pays the rent.</p><p>I don\u2019t expect to hear from you, so don\u2019t feel bad. To be blunt, I can understand how a bastard popping up out of nowhere would be awkward for you and the rest of the royals. I just wanted you to know about me, but I understand you have many responsibilities, both family and professional.</p><p>I\u2019ve attached my contact information in case you want a lackey to reach me. But if I don\u2019t hear anything, no hard feelings.</p> <p>Sir, I hope this letter finds you in all good health.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Nicole</p><p>Part One</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>\u201cH oly mother of God!\u201d King Alexander II yowled. Jeffrey Rodinov, who had been casually leaning against the closed door of the king\u2019s office, instantly sprang back, then went through the door. He didn\u2019t open it and run through. He went through the door, his nine mil in his left hand. The safety was off. It was always off.</p><p>\u201cSir, get down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a heart attack here, Rodinov, so don\u2019t point that thing at me.\u201d The king had a piece of paper crumpled in a large fist. \u201cHoly Jesus! My God!\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey snatched his two-way from his right hip, pressed the Call button, and barked, \u201cCode seventeen, the Boss\u2019s office, yesterday.\u201d In other words, Dr. Hedman, get your ass up here pronto.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe this? I can\u2019t friggin\u2019 believe this.\u201d The black-haired, blue-eyed king, head of the Royal House of Baranov, was normally the picture of ?orid health. Right now he was as pale as the paper he was clutching.</p><p>Jeffrey had never seen him like that, not even after he\u2019d been shot four years ago. (The first, and last, vacation Jeffrey had ever taken. Left the country for one damn month and the whole place fell apart.)</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Jeffrey began, only to be interrupted as Edmund Dante, the king\u2019s majordomo, galloped through the shattered doorway, then screeched to a halt in front of the large mahogany desk.</p><p>\u201cMy king,\u201d Edmund gasped. \u201cHow may I assist you?\u201d</p> <p>It was a day for surprises; Jeffrey had never seen Mr. Dante so rattled. The king\u2019s special assistant was as tall as His Majesty, but thin as a stick. He had served the Baranovs since time out of mind and as such, had no fear of any of them.</p><p>He also had two master\u2019s degrees, one in Alaskan history, the other in Alaskan literature. The princesses had nicknamed him Ichabod Brain, something no one\u2014not even the king\u2014would dare say to his face.</p><p>Edmund Dante ruled the royal family with equal parts love and uncompromising ruthlessness. The RST (Royal Security Team) had as much respect for Dante as they did for any of their charges. They also took bets on whether Mr. Dante had ice water for blood or nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Dante asked mildly.</p><p>Jeffrey shook splinters out of his hair. \u201cHe yelled. I came. Nobody\u2019s here; it\u2019s clean. Doc\u2019s on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a damned doctor!\u201d</p><p>Edmund stared critically at the doorway. \u201cNo, but you certainly need a carpenter. At the risk of wasting time by repeating myself, my king, how can I be of service?\u201d</p><p>The king gargled in reply and thrust the smushed paper at his assistant. Edmund read it in four seconds, then read it again.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Hmmm? I\u2019ll hmmm your scrawny butt, Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tremble before your wrath, my king. May I see the envelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you screened all the king\u2019s mail,\u201d Jeffrey asked, dying to know what was in the mysterious letter, but too proud to ask.</p><p>\u201cNinety percent,\u201d Edmund replied absently, glancing at the envelope, which had been neatly slit by one of the battalion of royal secretaries.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I keep telling you to ramp it up to ninety-five,\u201d the king said, gesturing to the piles of paper all over his desk.</p><p>Mr. Dante ignored the king; he was probably the only person in the country who could get away with it. \u201cA few things slip by. Perhaps one of the admins read it and felt it was for the king\u2019s eyes only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d The king ran his blocky fingers through his thick black hair. Although in his early sixties, he looked fifteen years younger, with very little gray in the hair he had passed on to nearly all of his children. \u201cI got another kid running around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not.\u201d Edmund was now looking at a piece of paper that was still in the envelope. \u201cDNA tests can be faked. This entire thing may be a fake. You have not forgotten you are the seventh richest man on the planet, I trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, holy old cripes, I guess it slipped my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Rodinov, will you kindly holster your weapon? Goose season is several months away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Jeffrey didn\u2019t bother to point out that a nine mil would be a poor weapon for hunting geese. \u201cMajesty, if you don\u2019t need me, I\u2019ll be at my post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jeff.\u201d Only the king got away with that; he hated the nickname. \u201cAnd thanks for the response time. Sorry I scared you. Cancel the doc, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite all right, sir. And I will.\u201d Jeffrey bowed but, as Baranov royal protocol was much less rigid than most other royal protocols, was able to turn his back on the king and walk out.</p><p>He canceled the code seventeen, then took up his usual position, but since there was no longer a door, could hear everything. That was fine. That was more than fine. He liked being invisible. It made his job infinitely easier.</p><p>The Boss and Mr. Dante\u2019s voice drifted into the hallway. Jeffrey took it as a mark of trust that neither of them bothered to lower their voices. \u201cMy king, there is one question on my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know I had doubts about marrying Dara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always surprised you went along with an arranged marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, my dad was sick and it was what he wanted. And you know how it is\u2014a crown prince without heirs makes everybody nervous. But I still felt like they were jamming that wildcat down my throat. So I had a fling before the wedding. Nice gal. Really nice gal. Bartender, like the letter said. The woman made a mean Rusty Nail and that\u2019s no lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a good time. She knew who I was and didn\u2019t give a ripe shit. I liked that. Hell, I loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I got married. She knew the score; we had a nice good-bye and that was that. She never told me about any baby. Why didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to deduce why she bedded you,\u201d Edmund admitted.</p><p>\u201cShaddup. Not a peep. Never asked me for a thing, never wrote me, never called. I just thought...you know. A nice memory and that was it. Then Dara got knocked up right away with David and we were off to the races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it is biologically possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kidding? I was barely out of my teens. I could go all night in those days. And we did, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajesty, could you hand me that trash can? I\u2019m feeling the uncontrollable urge to vomit blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, tight ass. First thing we gotta do is find out if this, uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if this Nicole is the real deal. And then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s best if we take it one thing at a time, my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will contact the lab that did these tests. If they verify the blood work, I will make arrangements for our own tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she says she doesn\u2019t want any more needles.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey heard a short silence, and then a distinctive sound: Edmund snorting. \u201cYou are her king, sire, and your will is Alaska\u2019s will. Her wishes have no bearing on the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Edmund. Spoken like a true Nazi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to serve, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>N icole Krenski, bastard princess of Alaska, daughter of a bartender and a king, counted to ten.</p><p>\u201cHey, I almost got that one,\u201d her client chirped, yanking on his fishing rod with all his might.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great, Jim, if we were fishing for pine trees. Give that to me.\u201d Before I stick it up your ass. With a few practiced tugs, the Daredevil lure freed itself from the tree and plopped into the water. Nicole slowly started reeling it in, and felt a nibble. \u201cOkay, you got a bite. Now remember what I told you.\u201d Twenty-five times. \u201cCarefully set the hook and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He snatched the rod from her hands and gave a mighty yank, which only ripped the lure out of the fish\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey, I think I\u2019m getting the hang of this!\u201d</p><p>Nicole scowled at the short (her height) balding stock broker on vacation from New York City. \u201cJimmy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not call me babe. And if you ever take a fishing rod away from me without my permission, you\u2019ll be shitting five-pound test line for three days.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy gulped and managed a smile. Nicole knew full well that clients hit on her when they got a look at her tits and eyes and whatnot, and gave up when she proved she had nothing in her veins but river water. At least as far as her customers were concerned, she\u2019d sooner lay a grizzly than someone who paid her bills.</p> <p>Jimmy sketched a mock salute. \u201cYou got it, boss lady. Ready to try again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d One. Two. Three. Four. Five. \u201cNice and easy. Use your wrist, not your arm.\u201d Six. Seven. Eight. \u201cRelease the bale. And\u2014you\u2019ve caught another tree.\u201d</p><p>Meekly, Jimmy handed back his rod. \u201cCould you get that out of the branch for me, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d she groaned. Oh God, please save me from tourists. Especially big city tourists.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should try a different spot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I should try a different client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cold, babe. I guess we really are in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what cold is. And don\u2019t call me babe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>E xhausted\u2014more from Jimmy\u2019s refusal to learn anything other than any real physical exertion\u2014Nicole dropped him off at the Juneau branch of the Outer Banks Co. office and drove to her trailer, faking a cheerful wave as she sped off in her pick-up. At least this one hadn\u2019t tried to grab her boobs when she bent over to tie on a sinker. And when did that guy get out of the hospital? Her boss had told her but she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>As always, her spirits lifted at the sight of the neat brown and cream mobile home at the far edge of the Juneau town limits. It was small, but she didn\u2019t need much space, and the large shed held all her hunting and fishing equipment.</p> <p>Best of all, the trailer backed up to 500 acres of wilderness. She\u2019d had deer, possums, raccoons, snakes, rabbits, bears, and moose in her yard. Sparrows, woodpeckers, blue jays, hummingbirds, chickadees, plovers, and terns visited the dozen birdfeeders she kept full. And occasionally, Great Gray Owls swooped down and helped themselves to a plover or chickadee. Ah, well. Nature red in tooth and claw and all that.</p><p>Once a gut-shot deer had staggered into the yard and she\u2019d put the poor thing out of its agony with a quick shot to the head with one of her rifles. The doe had never had a chance; it had been trailing viscera through her yard. She\u2019d then called the Game Warden; when he showed up, he\u2019d offered her the venison. She had declined, having a freezer full of wild game. She hoped the idiot who hadn\u2019t bothered to track his kill would contract malaria in the near future.</p><p>Nicole carefully put her equipment away, locked the shed, then went through her front door. The place was immaculate, as usual, and sparsely furnished, as she liked it. Perfect order, perfect solitude. Her CDs and books were alphabetized; all the cans and boxes in the pantry were lined up. If only her mother had\u2014</p><p>But her mother\u2019s death was too recent and raw, and she shoved the thought away, hard. Her mother had left her enough money to buy the trailer new, for cash, and not much else. Oh, and her mother had also left her a favor. A last wish, as it were.</p><p>Her answering machine was blinking. She knew it wasn\u2019t the office; they didn\u2019t guide at night. She knew it wasn\u2019t her dead mother. She had no friends, only acquaintances, and hadn\u2019t been laid since her mother had gotten sick. Therefore...</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>She stabbed the Play button and heard a cultured, cool voice say, \u201cMiss Krenski, my name is Edmund Dante and I am calling from the Sitka Palace regarding a letter you sent King Alexander. His Majesty the king requires an audience with you at once, as well as an examination by the royal physician. Please call me at 907-263-9331 at your earliest convenience. Thank you.\u201d Click.</p><p>Nicole chewed her lip and thought about it. And thought about it some more.</p> <p>And then she erased the message.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>N icole erased the new message the next day.</p><p>And the next.</p><p>And the next.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>N icole dropped her client, a perfectly pleasant family practitioner named Sandra Dee, of all things, at the Outer Banks Co. and pocketed the generous tip.</p><p>Sandra Dee, also from New York City, had caught on at once and spent the afternoon kicking ass and filling the live well. The small redhead nearly staggered under the weight of the fish on her stringer. Nicole unhitched the boat trailer, mentally promising her boss she\u2019d come back first thing in the morning and hose it down.</p><p>Nicole couldn\u2019t help but laugh as her giddy client bounded up the steps to the office with one final wave over her shoulder. These were the best days for her: showing someone a skill they had not known they possessed. Showing a stranger the utter and mystifying beauty of the Alaskan wilderness and recognizing the look on their face, the awe of someone at a stirring church service.</p><p>She swung by Chicken Lickin\u2019 for a three-piece meal, hold the biscuits, extra gravy. Mmm...gravy. She\u2019d drink it by the glass if she could. The thought made her grin.</p><p>Her smile faded as she saw the long black car parked in her driveway and the two men loitering on her front lawn. She didn\u2019t slow and didn\u2019t look in that direction again. She stared straight ahead\u2014nope, nothing wrong here, and I certainly don\u2019t live there, which is why I\u2019m not looking at you two\u2014and kept going past her trailer.</p><p>She found the back trail leading into the woods, got out of her truck and locked the hubs, then got back in, engaged the four-wheel drive, and bounced and jounced until she was only half a mile from the south side of her property.</p><p>Muttering under her breath, Nicole popped open her glove compartment and pulled out the .38. A poor weapon at long range, but she had every expectation of getting nice and close. Besides, the rest of her guns were in the shed. She cursed herself for not installing a gun rack in the truck. Well, maybe next week.</p><p>Nicole locked the truck (some of her rods were custom made) and stole through the forest on foot, noisy as a salamander. She came up on her trailer from behind, knelt, and carefully slid aside the panel to the left of the back door. She belly crawled beneath her trailer until she was beside her porch.</p><p>One of the men was sitting on her porch; the other one\u2014the armed one, no mistaking the bulge on his hip, even from the road\u2014was standing beside him. In fact, he was standing about nine inches in front of her face.</p><p>She supposed most single women might wonder why armed strangers were waiting for her in her yard, but she\u2019d never been one to sweat the why of things.</p><p>She noiselessly slid the panel back, reached, clutched his ankles, and yanked. The man hit the ground face first and in a flash she vaulted from cover, sat on him, and pressed the barrel of her gun to the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a .38,\u201d she informed him. \u201cNormally a pea shooter, but at this range, it\u2019ll ruin your week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d the man said calmly into the grass.</p><p>She relieved him of his sidearm, a spotless nine millimeter, and tossed it behind her, beneath her trailer. \u201cWhen you get it back, you might want to break it down and hit it with some gun oil. It\u2019s pretty dirty under there. Also, I don\u2019t like surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would have guessed,\u201d the stranger mumbled into the turf.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d the man on the porch said in a deep voice, sounding exasperated and charmed at once. She turned her head, not moving the gun.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d the King of Alaska replied agreeably. He was dressed in jeans and a blue oxford shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. He had his chin cupped in his hand (he needed a shave) and took her in at a glance: the brunette hair, the blue eyes, the dirty shirt and jeans, the gun.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said, sounding almost...cheerful? \u201cYou\u2019re one of mine, all right. Nice to meet you, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cG o away,\u201d Nicole said warmly.</p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t be like that, kiddo. And would you mind putting away the pea shooter? You\u2019re hurting Jeff\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention my kidneys,\u201d the man mumbled into the ground.</p><p>She carefully got off the man but kept the gun at her side.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d the king said as Jeff climbed slowly to his feet. \u201cSo, I\u2019m Al, your dad. And we know who you are. That\u2019s Jeff, head of my detail.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not dead yet?\u201d She was being nasty because she was so completely distracted by the bodyguard\u2019s size. When he stood, he went up and up and up. Well over six feet and probably 220, none of it fat. He was built like a linebacker. He hadn\u2019t looked so big from the road. Or so gorgeous.</p><p>No. She did not think that. Sure, he had lush, curly black hair\u2014true black, not dark brown\u2014and pale blue eyes. Sniper\u2019s eyes. He had a built-in tan (was he part Akiak? or maybe Ekok?) and the muscular definition of a champion lifter. His head and hands were blocky, like they had been carved by a skilled craftsman who was in a hurry. He filled out his black tailored suit\u2014a man his size couldn\u2019t buy off the rack\u2014superbly.</p><p>Gorgeous? Please. She was just distracted because she hadn\u2019t been laid in 29 months and 18 days.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI apologize. I will tender my resignation at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell. I didn\u2019t hear a thing either. Serves us right for showing up on her turf without calling. Oh, wait. Edmund\u2019s been leaving her messages all week.\u201d The king beamed at her. \u201cShould have had the palace guards drag you to my place instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead palace guards,\u201d she informed him. \u201cMutilated subjects. Body parts all over the Sitka Palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you inherited none of your mother\u2019s charm. Just my mouth. Oh, and my fabulous good looks,\u201d he added modestly.</p><p>\u201cLike you knew a thing about my mother.\u201d It made her angry, it enraged her, to hear this pampered cheating bastard talk about her dear dead mom. \u201cShe was a fling, a one-night stand that lasted for a week or two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe was lovely and sweet and funny, and you will watch your tone when you speak to me, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>She almost took a step backward.

He had sounded like\u2014well, like a king.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>The king cheered up instantly. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. It\u2019s been a weird week for everybody.

Annoyingly, all the hairs on her left arm stiffened to attention, and she jerked her head away from his mouth.</p><p>The king coughed. \u201cUh, Nicole, I\u2019m sorry we got off on the wrong foot, but I wasn\u2019t exactly asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going and I do not submit to your authority, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d The king shot Jeff a look and coughed again. \u201cYou sort of don\u2019t have a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow quickly we forget, King Cheats-on-His-Fianc\u00e9e. You might want to reread my letter. My mother and father were Alaskan citizens, but I was born in Los Angeles.\u201d</p> <p>The king scowled. \u201cDual citizenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight-o.\u201d Under Alaskan law, merely residing in Alaska did not mean you were a subject of the king. You needed to be Alaskan on both sides and born in the country. Any deviation resulted in dual citizenship, and the gentleman (or bastard princess) in question could claim the other country as her own. \u201cSo thanks for stopping by, ta-ta, so long, get lost.\u201d</p><p>The king stood and, like Jeff, he went up and up and up. Of course, he was standing two steps above her, but still. She craned her head to glare up at him. \u201cGo away now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Mom didn\u2019t like you for your keen intellect.\u201d</p><p>The bodyguard actually flinched, but the king didn\u2019t move. Instead, he scowled down at her. \u201cI\u2019m gonna let that one go by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks gobs.\u201d</p><p>His black brows caromed together and his eyes were dark blue slits. But she would not be intimidated! Well, not much.</p> <p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to see me,\u201d he bitched, \u201cand you don\u2019t want to come to the palace, why the hell did you write me that letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my mother asked me to. It was in her will. She told me about you and she asked me to get in touch, and that was all she asked.\u201d And it was damn sure all she was going to do. \u201cIt was the only thing she ever asked of me in twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Then, quietly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your mother. She was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes; on the whole, she preferred him kingly and commanding and generally acting like a jerk. \u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The bodyguard\u2014Jeff\u2014reached under her trailer with a long arm and retrieved his gun. He gave her a look she couldn\u2019t figure as the king thumped down her steps.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the king said after an awkward pause.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d she said.</p><p>Without another word, they left.</p><p>Nicole fumbled for her door, ran into the trailer, collapsed on the couch, and wept for fifteen minutes. Then she got up, walked to the bathroom, washed her face, and kicked a hole in the cupboard under the sink.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>A lexander Baranov, descendant of Russian rebels who took a country for themselves, bounded into his office, with Jeff right on his heels. Edmund was spreading out various paperwork for him to sign, which on any other occasion would have dampened his mood and made him contemplate loading a shotgun.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d Edmund said, eyeing the rumpled Jeff. For Edmund, that was the equivalent of \u201cHoly hell!\u201d \u201cWhat happened to you, Jeffrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kid,\u201d Al couldn\u2019t help bragging. \u201cShe got the drop on both of us.\u201d</p><p>Edmund blinked slowly, like a gecko. This was the equivalent of anyone else yelling, \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy king, I remind you that we have yet to verify our own DNA testing and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, but I\u2019m telling you. She\u2019s the spitting image of Alex and Kathryn. She\u2019s got the Baranov blue eyes and the dark hair.\u201d Al plopped into his chair as Jeff took up his position just inside the doorway. Al knew Jeff\u2019s humiliation was a live thing, a stinging thing, and he would stay closer than usual until the sting wore off. Although he was pleased with Nicole, he felt for his proud bodyguard and made no comment when Jeff didn\u2019t leave the office.</p><p>\u201cMouthy, too,\u201d Al continued, trying not to grin and failing. \u201cI didn\u2019t see much of her mother in her, to tell the truth. But I know it like I know how to gut a salmon: Nicole Krenski is my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure poetry as usual, my king. May I meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Al glanced at Jeff, who remained a stone. \u201cWell, she refused to come with us.\u201d</p><p>Edmund, tidying still more paperwork, froze. This was the equivalent of anyone else yelling, \u201cWhat the holy hell are you talking about?!?\u201d</p><p>After a long silence, Edmund straightened and put his fingers together, Mr. Burns style. The only thing missing was a drawn-out \u201cEhhhxxxceleeent.\u201d</p><p>Edmund took a breath and let it out. \u201cShe...refused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she cannot. She may be royalty, but she is also your subject, and as such, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, dual citizenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDual...ah.\u201d Edmund tapped his long, skinny fingers together. \u201cBut if she refused to return with you, then why did she bother to\u2014ah. Perhaps her mother asked her to? A, erm, dying wish, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight on the nose, Eddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire, if you call me that again I shall instantly tender my resignation, and then disembowel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe threatened the king,\u201d Al told Jeff. \u201cThat\u2019s worth prison time. My great granddaddy signed the bill himself.\u201d</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t move, or speak. It was the rare week Edmund didn\u2019t threaten to resign or slaughter the royal family, or both.</p><p>\u201cGod, what a kid,\u201d Al continued, leaning back in his chair and lacing his fingers behind his head. He sighed happily. \u201cGot the drop on us, jammed that .38 in the back of Jeff\u2019s head\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was the dull thud as Jeff banged the back of his head on the wall, his eyes closed. Politely, Al and Edmund ignored it.</p><p>\u201c\u2014sassed me like you wouldn\u2019t believe, then kicked us off her property. It was unbelievably wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt, er, sounds unbelievably wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey banged his head again.</p><p>With a worried glance at the head of his detail, the king finished, \u201cNobody\u2019s talked to me like that since Christina joined the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe certainly sounds like a Baranov,\u201d Edmund admitted. \u201cSire, it is vital we verify her bloodline. You realize the ramifications.\u201d</p><p>Al did. He wondered what his eldest son, David, would think about all this. What all the kids would think.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019 you think I should tell the kids now or wait until we have proof?\u201d</p><p>Edmund hesitated. \u201cMy king, I would not presume to advise you on such a personal matter.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey made a strangled sound that he managed to turn into a cough; Al laughed outright. \u201cSince when? You got a fever or something, Edmund?\u201d</p><p>Jeff cleared his throat. It sounded like gravel in a blender. \u201cLet me go back, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Al glanced at his bodyguard. \u201cWhat? Jeff? Did you hit your head too hard on the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire, let me go back and try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, I dunno...I thought we\u2019d give her a little space before trying again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy king, you know that is unacceptable!\u201d Edmund was as upset as Al had ever seen, and that was saying something. He had actually raised his voice. \u201cWe cannot let this sleeping dog lie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to resist referring to my kid as a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI require proof she is your kid, my king. And you know why. And you know we cannot delay.\u201d</p><p>The king shifted uncomfortably in his chair. \u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire, forgive the interruption, but let me go back,\u201d Jeff urged. \u201cFirst thing tomorrow. I\u2019ll switch detail with Reynolds. I can do this. Please let me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Jeff...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all do respect, Jeffrey, if the king could not persuade her, I fail to see what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush up, Edmund. Give me a second here.\u201d</p><p>Al thought about it. The two men let him. Finally, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t see the harm. And if you\u2019re willing, it\u2019s fine by me, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d This time Edmund was thinking, and the two others let him. After a short silence, Edmund made a suggestion, showing his usual cool good sense, and Al instantly accepted the advice. Then he gave Jeff his instructions.</p><p>\u201cMy king,\u201d Jeff acknowledged, and bowed. Then he did something Al had never seen him do: he grinned.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>G ulping the last of her coffee, Nicole swung into the driveway of the Outer Banks Co. She was surprised to see a strange car beside her boss\u2019s and the other guides\u2019. She nearly always beat the clients in. Who\u2019d bother showing up at 6:30 A.M. if they didn\u2019t have to?</p><p>She hopped out of her truck, locked it, then crossed the damp lawn, enjoying the spring sunshine. Winter had a pretty good grip every year, but it always eased up, and she was always surprised when it happened. It was finally jacket weather, which meant in hot southern places like North Dakota it was shorts weather.</p><p>Spirits high, Nicole bounded up the steps and into her boss\u2019s office.</p><p>And groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe meet again, Nicole,\u201d the bodyguard told her. He was decked out for fishing\u2014old jeans, faded flannel shirt, work boots. His curly black hair was rumpled, as if he\u2019d spent the time waiting for her running his fingers through it. She wanted to run her fingers through it, to see if the texture was as silky as it looked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, she did not.</p><p>\u201cNicole, this is Jeffrey Rodinov\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d she said shortly.</p> <p>\u201cWho works at the Sitka Palace,\u201d her boss, Mike Freeborg, continued excitedly. A Minnesotan who had moved to Juneau fourteen years ago, Mike looked quite a bit like his Norwegian forebearers: large, broad-shouldered, blond hair, green eyes. The other guides called him The Viking. And although he looked fierce, he had the temperament of a pampered kitten. \u201cAnd he asked for you personally.\u201d</p><p>Nicole groaned again.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiarrhea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mike shrugged his massive shoulders. \u201cWell, anyway, show him a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not.\u201d She felt her face getting hot, which made her mad, which made her redder.</p><p>Oblivious, Mike continued. \u201cFill the boat\u2014not that you\u2019re taking the boat\u2014so he goes back to the palace and tells them all about our little outfit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit,\u201d Nicole said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t quit,\u201d her boss yawned, showing his back fillings. Nicole quit three or four times a month. \u201cSandra Dee\u2019s coming back next month and she also asked for you personally. That was a five-hundred-dollar tip, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019m on vacation effective this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! We both know you have no life at all. This job is your vacation.\u201d</p><p>She cursed his perfect estimation of her character.</p><p>\u201cNow get going.\u201d</p><p>Nicole glared at the bodyguard, who smiled back. \u201cPrepare for a day in the darkest depths of hell,\u201d she informed him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m prepared,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m bristling with weapons and pepper spray, not to mention my rape whistle.\u201d Courteously, he opened the door for her. \u201cAfter you, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>J effrey landed the fish, deftly worked the hook out of its lower lip, and then tossed it back into the river.</p> <p>Nicole was sitting beside him on the bank, her head in her hands. \u201cYou know how to fish,\u201d she mumbled into her palms.</p><p>\u201cCould be I went out a time or two with my dad,\u201d he admitted, baiting the hook and casting again.</p><p>\u201cAnd you sound like a local.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs local as you can get,\u201d he admitted. \u201cRussian on my dad\u2019s side, Ekok on my mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains the blue eyes and the built-in tan. You\u2019re sure as hell not a tourist. You don\u2019t need me to take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I haven\u2019t been able to get you out of my mind since you shoved your gun into my head.\u201d This, unfortunately, was nothing but the truth.</p><p>Nicole jerked her head up and glared at him. He froze, mesmerized by the Baranov blue eyes. Funny how he knew six other people with eyes that exact same shade, none of which had the same effect on him. \u201cVery funny. You can go back and tell the king he\u2019ll die of old age before I show up and get poked and prodded, and then play princess for him and those other weirdos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose other weirdos,\u201d he said mildly, \u201care your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m lying. Maybe it\u2019s a hoax.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She jumped up and stomped her foot. \u201cYou don\u2019t know. So don\u2019t pretend blue eyes and dark hair is a ticket into the royal family. You\u2019ve got blue eyes and dark hair.\u201d</p><p>He yawned. \u201cMy family has been taking care of the royals for three generations. I know a Baranov when I see one. And so does the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king,\u201d she muttered, pacing back and forth on the bank. She cursed as she stepped into some mud, shook her foot, then nearly overbalanced into the river, and cursed more. Jeffrey listened with admiration; she knew swear words he didn\u2019t, and he\u2019d done a stretch in the AAF (Alaskan Air Force). \u201cDid he tell you he cheated on his fianc\u00e9e with my mom, and then dumped her to get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She actually gurgled with rage and her hands snapped into fists. He faked a cough so she wouldn\u2019t see him grin or hear him laugh.</p><p>\u201cDo you always do that?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake unanswerable observations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how romantic,\u201d she mocked, fluttering her long black lashes. \u201cIt gets me right here.\u201d</p><p>He certainly hoped so. Because she was really something. Gorgeous, mouthy, smart, knew her way around a fishing pole. Killer body...slim, but muscular; doing guide work kept her in good shape. Trim-hipped in blue jeans, a red T-shirt, and a bright blue windbreaker; the spring breeze had kissed roses into her cheeks and made her eyes sparkle. Or perhaps glitter with rage; it was hard to tell.</p><p>Jeffrey tried to understand why this particular Baranov had such an effect on him. He certainly hadn\u2019t been attracted to Kathryn or Alex. Of course, he\u2019d known them since they were kids. And God knew he wasn\u2019t attracted to the king, or the other Alex. Of course, he wasn\u2019t gay or bi. So why this one?</p><p>Because Nicole was different. She had royal blood in her veins but was raised by a commoner. The two of them against the world, no doubt. He doubted she had the slightest idea of the effect she had on men. Those magnetic blue eyes alone\u2014</p><p>He felt a nibble, waited with the patience of a python, and then at a firmer bite set the hook and reeled it in, unhooked it, tossed it back into the river with a plop, and then baited his hook again.</p><p>\u201cPlus you\u2019re doing catch and release! You don\u2019t even need me to clean them for you. There\u2019s no reason for me to be here at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, can we stop with the Obi-Wan speak? What\u2019s your game plan, slick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo charm you into coming back to the palace with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You had to know this would happen when you wrote what you wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I wrote what I wrote?\u201d She stopped pacing and stared down at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. And I would never ask. It was the king\u2019s personal correspondence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Uh, I didn\u2019t think about it that way. That you didn\u2019t\u2014sorry,\u201d she said, looking like the apology tasted bad. Again, he had to force a cough. \u201cWell, I wrote him who I was, reminded him about my mom, left my phone number, and that was about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I said, you had to know there would be consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a choice, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s dying wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow how did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdmund Dante guessed, and the king confirmed. Mr. Dante is the man who has been leaving messages for you. He pretty much runs the palace, and the royal family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell. He tries to run me and I\u2019ll break both his ankles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough to do from a riverbank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t! I\u2019m wise to you, Mr. Bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>Oh no you aren\u2019t, sweetie.</p><p>\u201cI have another bite,\u201d he said smugly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d she announced, \u201chave a migraine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>W ell! She handled yesterday pretty well, considering.</p><p>Considering the fact that she wondered what he looked like with his shirt off.</p><p>No, she did not.</p><p>Oh yes, you did, liar. Can\u2019t you be honest with yourself ever?</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she snapped at herself. She occasionally had entire conversations with herself. Most of the time she attempted to keep them inside her brain.</p><p>But! She had handled him just fine. Refused to head back to the, God forbid, Sitka Palace. Sent him on his merry way. Ignored Freeborg\u2019s insistence she give him a blow-by-blow recap. Drove home. Had McNuggets. Didn\u2019t think about him once.</p><p>Liar!</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d she yowled, slamming on her brakes and wincing at what the spraying gravel was doing to her truck\u2019s ruby red paint job. She shut it off, shoved the door open, fairly leaped to the ground, and then darted into the office.</p><p>And groaned.</p><p>\u201cNicole!\u201d Freeborg yodeled when he saw her. \u201cHe\u2019s back! And he brought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who the crown prince is, Mike, Gawd.\u201d She ignored Prince David Baranov\u2019s outstretched hand and scowled. \u201cEverybody who reads People or The Juneau Empire knows who he is. Got an overwhelming urge to fish, Prince David? Not enough protein up at the palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I need some food for my penguins, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t let the door hit you between the eyes on your way out.\u201d</p><p>By reply, the prince turned to Jeffrey and said, \u201cUh-huh. I see what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about me like I\u2019m not here again and you\u2019ll be a neutered crown prince. And then where would we be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole!\u201d her boss screamed, horrified.</p><p>Prince David grinned and pointed a finger at her. \u201cJailable offense! Maybe a month or two behind bars will make the palace look like a better option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Your Highness, she tends to go about heavily armed.\u201d Jeffrey was nervously eyeing her windbreaker.</p><p>\u201cWhat, \u2018heavily\u2019? It was a lousy .38.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really get the drop on him? Dad said it, but it was still kind of hard to believe.\u201d David jerked a thumb over his shoulder at Jeffrey. His eyes, the same shade as hers, twinkled at her. She wondered if he could make them do that on purpose. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of got a reputation, y'know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014what\u2019s going on?\u201d her boss asked, the color leaking back into his face. He was glancing from her to the prince and back again. \u201cDo you know His Highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know her,\u201d Prince David said cheerfully. \u201cOnly by reputation, of course. So, what is it? Why won\u2019t you come back? Hate needles? Doctor-o-phobic?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIatrophobia,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.

Nicole closed her eyes. \u201cYour what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Nicole opened her eyes in time to see the Crown Prince of Alaska wink at her. \u201cHalf sister.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p> <p>D avid Baranov, Crown Prince of Alaska, plopped down in the chair in front of the king\u2019s desk. Relieved to have a break from reading tedious legislation, Al all but shoved the paperwork away from him. \u201cCome in! Sit down! Spend some time with your old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019ve got to finish that stuff up sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder anything gets done. If you\u2019re not stalling, you\u2019re sneaking out to go fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your mouth in Park, boy.\u201d</p><p>His son mimed locking his lips shut, then tossed an imaginary key over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNo go, Dad. And for the record, no one has ever spoken to me like that in my life. Except for you. And...well. Is it just me, or does she remind me of Christina?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe reminds me of every one of you brats,\u201d the king growled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the resemblance was hard to miss. And not just on the physical side.\u201d David paused. \u201cHave you, ah, told the other sibs about this yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pause. Al fought the urge to roll his eyes. Here comes the moral assurance that I haven\u2019t gone down in his estimation. \u201cListen, Dad. I had all last night and all day today to think about it. And I don\u2019t\u2014I mean, I know you and Mom weren\u2019t exactly thrilled with each other a hundred percent of the time, and I\u2019m sure Nicole\u2019s mother was what you needed at just the right time. I just, you know. Understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a relief. I love you, boy, but I require neither your permission nor your assurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSieg heil, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>His eldest son stretched out long legs and yawned. He had the distinct air of fish guts about him and was dressed casually. Al was always startled to see how much his boy looked exactly like a younger version of him. It was like looking into a sneaky mirror.</p><p>Hell, it didn\u2019t seem so long since he\u2019d been David\u2019s age. Objectively, it had been decades. Subjectively, it felt like maybe five years. Hell, he was a father by the time he was David\u2019s age.</p><p>Of course, David was a father now, too. The king smiled, thinking of his granddaughter, Dara.</p><p>\u201cOh, and she\u2019s only the best angler I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d his son teased, bringing Al back to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cSecond best,\u201d the king grumped. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it, boy. You\u2019re not too big to spank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I really sort of am. Think of how Dara would be scarred to see her grandfather assaulting her father! She could be the Queen of Alaska someday, and yet psychologically crippled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh.\u201d So, he mused. David had obviously gone fishing. Nicole had agreed to take him out, as she\u2019d taken Jeffrey out. Maybe there was a way to crack this egg yet. \u201cYou get anything else out of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she knows the technical term for an uncontrollable fear of doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d he bluffed.</p><p>\u201cIatrophobia,\u201d his son kindly supplied.</p><p>\u201cIf that kid\u2019s scared of anything, I\u2019ll eat sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dad,\u201d his son mock-begged. \u201cDon\u2019t befoul your gourmet palate. Hamburgers will never taste the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got to take shit from every one of my kids. Every one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your curse,\u201d his son agreed happily.</p><p>\u201cIatrophobia,\u201d Al mused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. In fact, I think it was a feint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA faint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to throw us off the trail. Which is exceedingly weird. She writes us about her, when she could have clammed up, and then refuses to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could refuse my dying wish so easily?\u201d</p><p>His son colored, but doggedly continued. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to be one of us? She passes the DNA, she\u2019s got a claim to one of the biggest fortunes on the planet. She\u2019ll never have to worry about money again, nor any of her kids, or grandkids. Plus, we have a pretty good time around here.\u201d David spread his palms. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to love?\u201d</p><p>Al smiled at his son. David was young. And he thought his family\u2019s way was the only way. Although Al strongly suspected his son was quite a bit more intelligent than he was, he lacked experience. Al had been walking around on the planet long enough to know just how much people feared change.</p><p>David, born and reared a prince, could not conceive of any other lifestyle, nor understand why a stranger would turn it down.</p><p>\u201cIt was her and her mama for her whole life,\u201d Al said. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s all alone. Maybe she likes her solitude.\u201d Except scratch the maybe.</p><p>There was a discreet rap on the door. \u201cC\u2019mon in, Edmund!\u201d they called in unison.</p><p>\u201cMajesty. Highness.\u201d Edmund fairly staggered under the load of paperwork. Al made a conscious effort not to cringe. \u201cMay I presume to ask how it went, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see her anywhere, Edmund?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch the tone, boy,\u201d the king said absently, drumming his fingers on the desk. One thing he had insisted on before any of his children could walk: hired help were also subjects, and subjects deserved respect. Always. Except, of course, for one. And he\u2019d straightened her out, by God. Sent her packing with a flea in her ear. Again.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Edmund,\u201d David was saying. \u201cMy morning was equal parts aggravating and amusing. Didn\u2019t mean to mouth off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know not to what you refer, Highness. Will you permit me a suggestion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hate when he pretends he doesn\u2019t control our every move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all my black heart,\u201d Al replied. \u201cSpill, Edmund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the time for gentler tactics have passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean?\u201d the prince gasped.</p><p>\u201cThe big guns?\u201d the king guessed.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Edmund paused a beat. \u201cPrincess Christina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d king and prince said in unison.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cS o!\u201d the Crown Princess of Alaska greeted her as she entered the office. \u201cYou\u2019re the numbnut who won\u2019t submit to a blood test.\u201d She stuck out an unmanicured hand. Startled, Nicole shook it. \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Christina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I read about your wedding in People. And your daughter\u2019s birth in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews of the Weird?\u201d the princess guessed. Nicole\u2019s hand shot up, too late.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Jeffrey-the-annoying gasped. \u201cWas that...a smile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh, Jeff. Don\u2019t scare her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff-rey, Your Highness. As we\u2019ve discussed, only His Majesty\u2014</p><p>\u201d She spun on him and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this a zillion times. You call me Christina, I\u2019ll call you Jeff-rey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d Nicole interrupted, smiling again and praying neither of them would comment. \u201cGenerations of duty to the royal family. Familiarity is beaten out of them at an early age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, screw,\u201d the princess muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you Christina. I\u2019ll also call you \u2018see you later\u2019 and \u2018thanks for stopping by.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said you were never at a loss for words,\u201d the perfectly cool, tall, blond woman said. Like every royal she had met so far, she was dressed casually: tan shorts (a bold move in forty-five-degree weather), a T-shirt (another bold move) with the logo I\u2019M THE PRINCESS OF ALASKA, WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?, and a buttercup yellow sweater knotted around her waist. \u201cThey also said you looked extraordinarily like Alex and Kathryn, and that\u2019s true, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper duper. Well, what\u2019s up? Salmon fishing? Hiking? There\u2019s not much in season if hunting\u2019s your thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Uh, could you cool out your boss a little? He looks about ten seconds from a stroke.\u201d</p><p>Nicole was embarrassed; she\u2019d been so distracted by Jeffrey (who was in his black tailored suit; duh, she should have known this one wasn\u2019t going fishing) and the Crown Pr\u2014Christina that she hadn\u2019t even noticed Freeborg was at his desk.</p><p>And Christina was right. He was as pale as the belly of a trout.</p><p>\u201cMike? Mike!\u201d She waved a hand in front of his glazed eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not in any trouble.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of them,\u201d he accused, pointing a trembling, banana-sized finger at Christina. \u201cHer husband said!

Your reputation precedes you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m an in-law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t think. Know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you were trying to talk one of them into something they absolutely did not want to do, how do you think it would go?\u201d</p><p>Christina opened her mouth. Then closed it. Then opened it again, looking remarkably salmon-like. Then she glared. \u201cDon\u2019t confuse me with facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a valid warning,\u201d Jeff added.</p><p>\u201cPipe down, Jeff-rey. One thing I\u2019ve learned living with some of the richest people in the world is that everyone has a price. So what\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna cost to get you to come with me and submit to our DNA test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that you can pay me?\u201d To turn my back on my mother and everything she ever did for me? God! They were all the same! \u201cYou bitch!\u201d Then she socked her. Almost. Jeffrey moved like lightning, so she actually socked him in the throat (she\u2019d been aiming for Christina\u2019s left eye).</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Christina yelled as Nicole\u2019s boss clawed for his wastebasket and started retching. \u201cRule number one: Nobody roughs up the help!\u201d</p><p>Then Nicole saw black stars explode as Christina socked her back.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cO w ow OW!\u201d Nicole yelled, regaining consciousness. She opened her eyes, then groaned in equal parts pain and horror. About a hundred people were crouching over her.</p><p>\u201c\u2014didn\u2019t mean for her to hit her head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, for Christ\u2019s sake. We sent you to be a diplomat\u2014ever heard of the word?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d a paramedic said, ripping the blood pressure cuff off Nicole\u2019s arm, \u201ccan you tell me where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe seventh circle of hell,\u201d Nicole answered.</p><p>Christina elbowed two other Baranovs out of the way and peered down anxiously. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nicole. I only meant to give you a black eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an apology?\u201d the crown prince demanded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you to hit your head on the boss\u2019s desk when you fell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014how did you all get here so fast?\u201d She was looking around, and in addition to two paramedics, she recognized Princess Kathryn, Prince Nicholas, Crown Prince David, Prince Alexander, Princess Alexandria, King Alexander, and her brand-new nemesis, Christina. \u201cDoes the palace have a teleporter pad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out cold for twenty minutes,\u201d Prince Alexander, a shorter, younger version of his brother David, told her. \u201cWe had tons of time to get here. I\u2019m Alexander, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She clapped a hand over her eyes. \u201cI know who you are. I know who you all are.\u201d Her head was on the firmest pillow ever. Who knew Freeborg kept\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, kiddo?\u201d the king asked anxiously. \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s rude,\u201d Prince Alexandria said approvingly.</p><p>\u201cAll of you back off and give her some air,\u201d Jeffrey ordered from\u2014ulp\u2014directly above her. She realized with equal parts heat and cold that the pillow was him, and her head was in his lap.</p><p>As one, the royal family took three steps back.</p><p>\u201cYour vitals are fine,\u201d the other paramedic was telling her, \u201cbut with such a long loss of consciousness I think we should run her to the hos\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hospital. No doctors. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign the NMA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNMA?\u201d she heard the youngest, sixteen-year-old Nicholas, whisper to his sister Kathryn.</p><p>\u201cNo Medical Attention,\u201d Kathryn replied. \u201cMeans if she falls down the stairs and breaks both legs while barfing up blood, she can\u2019t sue.\u201d</p><p>Nicole almost laughed at the mental image, but managed to mask it as a groan of pain as she sat up.</p><p>\u201cIf you come to the hospital, you could get a prescription...\u201d one of the paramedics wheedled.</p><p>\u201cFirst someone tries to bribe me with money, now Vicodin? Do I have \u2018weak loser\u2019 written on my forehead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina Baranov!\u201d the king roared.</p><p>To Nicole\u2019s vast enjoyment, Christina backed away from the red-faced king so fast she nearly tripped and went sprawling. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to bribe her with money! I just said everyone had their price!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can see how that wasn\u2019t offensive,\u201d Prince Alexander snarked.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up, Alex. I meant like how I got the run of the kitchens when I got here. I just thought maybe she\u2019d like her own lake or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine plan,\u201d Alexandria observed, squinting down at Nicole. \u201cGood job, Christina. Really. Hey, Dad, let\u2019s put her in charge of defusing the situation in China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand it over,\u201d Nicole told the paramedics, who were packing up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood you stole while I was conked.\u201d</p><p>The paramedics looked at each other with superbly faked expressions of confusion. \u201cBlood we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop yelling, it hurts my head!\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>Half the light was blotted out when the king pointed a finger at her. \u201cThe Baranovs do not steal. Apologize at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said sweetly, \u201cthat you\u2019re sensitive about being called thieves after your ancestors stole the country from its rightful owner, Mother Russia.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, awful silence broken by Nicholas saying, \u201cScrew the blood test. I\u2019m convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t have a legitimate DNA test supervised by our own docs in the palace, Edmund will murder us all in our beds,\u201d David explained to his siblings.</p><p>\u201cHold your breath waiting for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d Kathryn asked.</p><p>\u201cWill you all keep it down?\u201d Jeffrey rumbled from behind her. He was still sitting behind her, like she might (ha!) get dizzy and fall back in his lap again. \u201cYou\u2019re upsetting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe punched you in the larynx, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why he sounds so dreadful?\u201d Kathryn whispered to her brother Alexander.</p><p>David knelt beside her, and when he spoke, it was with so much sympathy she could hardly bear it. \u201cIt will happen, Nicole. It has to. See, if you\u2019re really a Baranov, which everyone in this room knows you are, that means you\u2019re first in line for the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but you and Christina Quickknuckles are the crown prince and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole, you\u2019re older. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>She did. Then she crawled to her boss\u2019s wastebasket and threw up.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cO h dear,\u201d Edmund said.</p><p>\u201cThen she hit her head and got knocked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen David laid it out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Laid it out\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, never, my king. But at times it seems to me you have your own code. And I left my secret royal decoder ring in my other pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, how she\u2019s now first in line for the throne.\u201d Alaska was famous for doing it by birth order, not sex.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she barfed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reaction I myself have nearly every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Jeff kicked us all out. I think in his heart she\u2019s one of us, so he thinks he\u2019s her bodyguard,\u201d the king said approvingly. It was early that afternoon, and the king was enjoying a beer. Edmund drank coffee and played with the oft-neglected paperwork.</p><p>\u201cOh, is that what he thinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Then Jeff took her home and we all came back here. I think Christina\u2019s still sulking in her suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajesty, is there a question of lawsuit against\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because Nicole threw the first punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the king mused, taking a swig of Bud, \u201cthat might be leverage. You know, \u2018cooperate or we\u2019ll tell the world you tried to coldcock the crown princess.\u2019 I get the feeling she\u2019d hate publicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy king, you have read none of the newspapers I so carefully laid out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Edmund said, holding up that morning\u2019s edition of The Juneau Empire. \u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>BASTARD PRINCESS FOUND WORKING FOR</p><p>OUTER BANKS CO.</p><p>Sitka Palace denies comment.</p><p>The king hurriedly drained his beer. \u201cOh, fuck me,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cWith regret, I do decline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna barf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it must be Thursday. And, my king, you have yet one more worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can be worse than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink hard,\u201d Edmund advised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no mood for riddles, Edmund, so just\u2014\u201d</p><p>His office door was slammed open and his arch enemy, Holly Bragon (\u201crhymes with dragon\u201d), stood framed in the doorway. She waved that day\u2019s newspaper at him and crowed, \u201cBastard Princess! I fucking love it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me another beer,\u201d he said. \u201cGet me a six pack. Get me three six packs.\u201d Then, to the Dragon, \u201cI fired your ass last week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I know, King Grumpy.

But spring was here, and it was time to do his annual check on his grandfather\u2019s home to get it ready for summer.</p><p>Not that he made much use of it himself, but his dear sister would require it for much of the summer, and he wanted it in tip-top shape for her.</p><p>She would also be a frequent guest at the palace, where all the children were fond of her. (Must stop thinking of them as children, a voice in the back of his brain whispered for the hundredth time. His Highness the Crown Prince is thirty-four!)</p><p>A lovely, charming woman in her fifties with Down syndrome, Edmund\u2019s sister greeted the annual house\u2019s opening with the unbridled delight of a precocious child.</p> <p>He would die for her. And if she understood death, Geraldine would have died for him. Since he expected to precede her in death by some time (she had been a late-in-life baby for his parents, a true Lost Boy who had never grown up), he had made generous arrangements for her care as long as she lived.</p><p>And if he hadn\u2019t been able to do this thing, the king, with typical generosity (while claiming to be heartless and indifferent), had assured him many times that Geraldine would never have to worry about paying bills or cooking meals.</p><p>No matter when he passed on (hopefully via a brain aneurysm while scolding one of his beloved Baranovs), Geraldine would want for nothing.</p><p>To his surprise, as he drove up the long, tree-lined driveway, he saw another parked car. He hit the high beams and saw someone waiting for him on the wrap-around porch. In all his years of service, that had never happened.</p><p>His chest tightened; he prayed nothing had gone seriously wrong at the palace. Please no one is sick or hurt. Please no one is sick or hurt. Please no one\u2014</p><p>He nearly leaped out of his car and ran to the porch\u2014not much fun at his age\u2014and his heart rate slowed dramatically when he saw who it was.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening, Miss Krenski,\u201d he tried not to gasp. \u201cI trust you are well.\u201d</p><p>Chin in her hand, she squinted up at him. \u201cYou okay, slick? You\u2019re not gonna keel over on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know who I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else could you be?\u201d he said warmly. \u201cAnd it grieves me to point out you have not answered me. Are you quite well, Miss Krenski? No ill effects after this afternoon\u2019s, ah, misunderstanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a bitch of a headache all damn day, and the next time I see the crown princess it is awwwwn. Oh, and I\u2019m gonna be the next fucking Queen of fucking Alaska. Other than that, I\u2019m great.\u201d</p><p>After decades of practice, Edmund had the best poker face on the planet. O, my king, you were so right. She is of your blood. \u201cI see. Please, come in. I\u2019m afraid I can offer you nothing in the way of refreshments\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. This is your family\u2019s summer home. You just came up to check it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how did you know that?\u201d he asked, holding the door for royalty as he had done thousands, no millions of times before.</p><p>\u201cVee haff ways,\u201d she said, and grinned at him. His heart did a little flip-flop in his chest, and he realized anew what the king and the new princess did not: Jeffrey Rodinov was not sticking close because he wanted to be her bodyguard.</p><p>\u201cI brought take-out,\u201d she said absently, preceding him. \u201cHeard you get weak in the knees at the thought of bad Chinese food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have our vices,\u201d he admitted, and closed the door.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cS o lay it out for me, Mr. Dante,\u201d Nicole said to the tall, neatly dressed, skinny guy she pegged to be in his early seventies. Guy moved like a matador, though, and she guessed that running around after the royals kept him in good shape. And he sure got over a surprise in a hurry. Another occupational hazard. \u201cLet\u2019s say I lose my tiny mind and go to the palace tomorrow and get this damn DNA test. What happens then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming it\u2019s positive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be positive,\u201d she said glumly, poking at her beef and broccoli with a chopstick. \u201cUnless this is my mom\u2019s idea of a disgusting practical joke.\u201d</p><p>He spooned more rice onto his plate. \u201cYour status will be confirmed to the press. Arrangements will be made for you to move into the palace. Training will commence at once. Prince David has a thirty-year head start on you in terms of learning how to run a country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I wait around for the king to die, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssume the throne, yes.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her plate away. She didn\u2019t want to throw up again. \u201cBut wait a sec. I read somewhere that the king wants his kids to be co-kings and co-queens. He got the idea from reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did, and, yes, that is his wish. But Miss Krenski...\u201d Mr. Dante\u2019s sad bulldog eyes blinked slowly at her. \u201cThere must be a High King. Or a High Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, yes. But of course your brothers and sisters would assist you in any way they could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf brothers and sisters,\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist adding.</p><p>Mr. Dante tactfully ignored that. \u201cQuite frankly, you cannot be everywhere at once, which His Majesty discovered in his early twenties, and you would be unwise to try. If I may impart a confidence to you, Miss Krenski\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Krenski, but no thank you. This is the best I can do until your status as an HRH is confirmed, at which point I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHRH?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer Royal Highness. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, trying to stifle her gag reflex.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, the king has always regretted being an only child and has taken nothing but joy at the birth of each successive son or daughter. You wrote in your letter that you thought he might be embarrassed by you. Nothing could be further from the truth. He is most anxious to begin the process of knowing you.\u201d</p><p>Nicole grunted. \u201cWell, he\u2019s gonna get his wish, starting tomorrow. But this whole shitstorm? It\u2019s gonna be on my terms.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dante, who seemed like a helluva nice guy in spite of his overly formal demeanor\u2014how did you sit at attention?\u2014shook his head. \u201cOh, my dear. At this moment, several of your blood relatives are thinking the exact same thing.\u201d</p><p>She absently cracked her knuckles. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Krenski, if I may make bold to ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ate all the rest of my rice, so you might as well stay bold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth has changed your mind? I had a private wager with myself that you would have (a) held out for six more months at least or (b) fled to America.\u201d</p><p>Her headache, which had finally been receding, gave a tremendous throb, and she nearly barked, \u201cFled?\u201d</p><p>Weirdly, Edmund seemed pleased. \u201cI beg your pardon, I meant no offense. I only thought you might have taken advantage of your dual citizenship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. That\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell whether he was being super-tactful or playing dumb. But didn\u2019t it come down to the same thing?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the papers. Local at first, but the wires have jumped on it now. It\u2019s spreading all over the world like Ebola squared. My boss blabbed the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Sweet and sour sauce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll puke again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething we must avoid at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning when I came to work there were a zillion reporters and even more civilians.\u201d She still had trouble understanding the fact that all those strangers wanted to take her picture. Among other things.</p><p>\u201cThat is to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanting my autograph, you believe it? I\u2019ll never have a private life again. Everything\u2019s\u2014\u201d She heard her voice crack and hated herself for it. She cleared her throat and quietly continued, \u201cEverything\u2019s over for me, now. So there\u2019s no point in fighting it for another week. Or even another day.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, Mr. Dante was on his feet and patting her on the shoulder. \u201cOh, Highness, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s just another beginning. Nothing at all to fear.\u201d</p><p>It was only then that she realized her face was wet.</p><p>And it was only hours later that she realized what he had called her, quite unaware, while comforting her.</p><p>She would spend the rest of her life internally flinching at the title, but would never forgot that the first time she heard it it wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cO ut!\u201d the King of Alaska roared, his hands running across his desk and finally seizing something that wouldn\u2019t give him a paper cut. He hurled a paperweight in Holly Bragon\u2019s general direction, but as usual, she didn\u2019t take the hint. Normally he would never treat a lady in such a fashion, but of course, the Dragon was no lady.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d Holly said as if a glass weight hadn\u2019t shattered two feet (he had been careful to aim wide) from her left ear. \u201cTell me about the bastard princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give her that name in my God-be-damned memoirs, I will give you a nose job with a chainsaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready had one, sans chainsaw,\u201d she said, clicking forward on her high heels and sitting in the chair to the left of his desk. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? Don\u2019t I look glorious?\u201d</p><p>He fought the urge to plunge his hands in his hair and yank. He still had every strand, by God, at an age when lots of men were bald as billiard balls. He wouldn\u2019t let her drive him to Rogaine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The awful thing was, the Dragon did look glorious. About fifteen years younger than him, she was a fine-looking, brown-eyed redhead with the lush figure of a fifties pinup girl. None of that anorexia chic for the Dragon.</p><p>The only concession to her age were her purple-rimmed bifocals. Her tailored suit was the same shade. When she crossed her legs, he observed that she had not given up the odd habit of wearing tennis shoes with designer suits.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a Goddamned eggplant in that thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Big Al, every word out of your mouth is pure honeycomb.\u201d Hun-ahh-cooom.</p><p>\u201cAnd you sound like pure cornpone. When are you going to ditch that awful accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig Al, I\u2019m gonna give your funeral service in my cornpone accent, and every fellow Texan is gonna cheer me on.\u201d Give yer fun\u2019rul sur-vuss. Gone cheer me awn.</p><p>He slumped back in his chair and massaged his temples. \u201cGod, I think my ears are actually bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that high-cholesterol lifestyle you lead, big guy. So tell me about the new girl. Word on the wires is, she\u2019s a bit older than Davey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrince David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019course, Big Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s King Al!\u201d Fucking Americans. Too casual by far. Right now, he could stand a little awe.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, Big Al.\u201d She crossed her legs and even the whisper of her pantyhose rubbing together got on his nerves. \u201cAnyhoo, that puts her in line for your job after you fall overboard and drown on one a\u2019your clandestine fishin\u2019 trips that don\u2019t fool no one no how. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you speaking English? At all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh can speak anuhthin.\u201d She occasionally tortured him by deepening her already annoying Texan accent, and could keep it up for hours.</p> <p>She had been fired nine times.</p><p>She had been escorted out by Jeffrey seventeen times.</p><p>She had reduced him to shouting at her so many times he lost count after her second visit. But like roaches and disco, she kept coming back.</p><p>And far, far worst of all? The Dragon was his official biographer. She had a doctorate in Alaskan history, gotten published at age nineteen, and written four books on the history of Alaska.</p><p>And as usual, the royal family had chosen a foreigner for the job of chronicling the current monarch\u2019s life. Subjects tended to be a little too overawed to ask the tough questions.</p><p>\u201cSo? It\u2019s true, raht?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true. I had a\u2014a relationship before I married the queen. Forget it, not tellin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Big Al, an\u2019 here I was on the edge of my seat waiting to hear about your naked shenanigans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShenanigans? Did you just curse me in Texan? Never mind. Point is, yeah, I wasn\u2019t exactly a virgin on my wedding night.\u201d Then again, neither was my bride. \u201cAnd Nicole Krenski Baranov was the result.\u201d</p><p>The Dragon didn\u2019t write any of that down in her ever-present notebook. \u201cWhy, Big Al, I\u2019ve never known you to go out on a limb. I hear the DNA ain\u2019t been confirmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t been confirmed, you illiterate twit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThay-ets Daktuh Illiterate Twee-it, Big Al,\u201d she corrected him sweetly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, stop it, you\u2019re killing me. You hear me? After I fired you the fourth time my doctor said my blood pressure was ten points higher than normal! You are literally killing me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll part of the big plan, Big Al,\u201d she said, easing up on the accent. \u201cI\u2019m the Texan Secret Weapon, sent up here to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, like I said, DNA hasn\u2019t been confirmed. So why take the risk of telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m old and tired and it\u2019s been a weird damned week.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. He made a mental note to check with Parliament to see if he could bomb Texas. \u201cYou! Old!\u201d She laughed so hard she almost fell out of her chair. Unfortunately, no such luck. \u201cYou! Oh my Gawd! Haw haw haw!\u201d</p><p>He surreptitiously checked to make sure his ears hadn\u2019t begun to bleed. \u201cYou really were sent by America to kill me, weren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked gloomily.</p><p>\u201cBig Al, the grand ole You Ess of America don\u2019t need me. They could turn Juneau into a smokin\u2019 pile of cinders with no trouble a\u2019tall. Now. Tell me about the new girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Al. You know I\u2019m gonna get it out of you even-\u2019chally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. You will not. Where the hell were we when I last fired your ass?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over in her chair and slapped a thigh. \u201cMy extremely shapely ass, don\u2019t pretend you never noticed, and we were talking about how you flew fighters in Korea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Okay. So...\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>J effrey had driven her to Mr. Dante\u2019s house, waited silently and patiently in the car\u2014Mr. Dante had never even seen him\u2014then had driven her back home. He had taken in her swollen eyes at a glance and, thank God, said nothing.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak a word for forty miles, but weirdly, it wasn\u2019t awkward. Jeffrey hummed along with the fifties oldies station he played softly and seemed content to let her think. Or (what she was really doing) stew.</p><p>\u201cCome in for a moment?\u201d she asked when he pulled up to her trailer.</p><p>\u201cThat depends. How\u2019s your artillery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer the word cautious.\u201d</p><p>When they were inside, she offered him a drink, which he declined. Oh...duh. He probably considered himself on duty.</p><p>\u201cUh, can you give me a ride to the palace tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He had been glancing around her living room, and spun around so fast she nearly took a step backward. For a big guy, he was quick on his feet. \u201cThe palace? You want to go to the palace? Our palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Buckingham Palace,\u201d she snapped. \u201cOf course our palace. Can you give me a ride? And get me in to talk to the king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. But as the head of his detail, I\u2019d like to know your intentions. You realize that killing him will only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill him! My intentions are to submit to a DNA test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking a DNA test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you partially deaf with that earpiece clogging up your left ear? Yes.\u201d</p><p>She observed his eyebrows knit together. \u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Gorgeous, but slow on the uptake, this guy.</p><p>\u201cAnd then it will be official. You will be, to the world, Her Royal Highness, Crown Princess Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Then I better do this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>But he was moving with that lithe speed again and before she knew it, he was holding her in his arms and kissing her on the mouth. She was so surprised she forgot to bite.</p><p>And then she pretty much forgot everything else, too, for the first time since this crazy shit started up.</p><p>He was holding her firmly, but she had no sense of being restrained. He was taking her mouth without permission, but she had no sense of being violated.</p><p>Best of all, he wasn\u2019t stopping, and she had no sense of being not in control of the situation.</p><p>Because the truth was, she was kissing him back just as hard as he was kissing her.</p><p>Finally, after a time that might have been ten seconds or ten minutes, he let go of her and spun away, leaning on the counter between the kitchen and the living room. Clutching the counter, really. She saw with some astonishment that his knuckles were white.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014why did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause tomorrow you\u2019ll be Princess Nicole, and I won\u2019t be able to do it. I\u2019ll never be able to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>She was so amazed she forgot to stop him.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>A discreet rap on the door. King Al, grumpy after a long session spilling his life to the Dragon, and five more Buds, and four hours of sleep, massaged his temples. The discreet rap sounded like a giant was pounding on the wood with a ball-peen hammer.</p><p>His breakfast sat before him, untouched. At the moment, he doubted he\u2019d ever be able to eat again. And he was swearing off beer! Again!</p><p>Another discreet rap.</p><p>He made a bet with himself. It would be Edmund, with the morning mail.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Edmund.\u201d</p><p>Only Edmund\u2019s head came in; he had opened the door and stuck his head through. \u201cYour Majesty? Drink your juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate tomato juice! It\u2019s like drinking red snot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA master of poetry, even during the largest of hangovers. Majesty, I have a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdmund, if I have one more surprise this week, I\u2019m firing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not tease, Majesty. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he sighed. Then, \u201cHit me.\u201d</p><p>Edmund\u2019s head disappeared, and then Nicole walked in.</p><p>\u201cHoly mother of God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you too, Al.\u201d Nicole had a wry expression on her face. Cute as a bug, too, and\u2014was she wearing a dress? A perfectly lovely dress with black tights and sensible black flats?</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014what\u2014how\u2014why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man of letters, just like Mr. Dante said. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a brain tumor, so please stop yanking my chain,\u201d he begged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a headache, you infant. Look, I went over to Mr. Dante\u2019s house yesterday and talked it over with him and here I am, so shut up about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how the hell did you even know where he lived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? I\u2019m here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right! Hell, it\u2019s great to see you again, kiddo!\u201d He got up and practically ran around his desk, holding his arms out without thinking.</p><p>He would have bet the east wing that she had no idea how horrified she looked at that moment, so he dropped his arms and stuck out a hand instead. Thawing an inch or two, she shook it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEdmund, you are a fuckin\u2019 miracle worker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d The crumb didn\u2019t even bother looking smug. Just took it as his due. \u201cAll in a day\u2019s work, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>She jerked a thumb in Edmund\u2019s direction. \u201cI bet that gets annoying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHon, you have no idea. Nice dress,\u201d he said, motioning for her to sit down.</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s the only one I have. Wore it to Mom\u2019s memorial service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That would explain the severe black and the long sleeves. And what message was she sending, anyway? Reminding him he couldn\u2019t take her mother\u2019s place? That was fine. He\u2019d never intended to try. \u201cWell. Ah. Say, how did you get in here, anyway? You\u2019re not anywhere on my schedule.\u201d He was pretty sure.</p><p>\u201cJeffrey brought me here.\u201d</p><p>Fine, but why did that make her blush? Well, it was a stressful moment for her. And not likely to get much better in the months to come. He tried to harden his heart against the sympathy he felt for her (for the good of the country!) and failed. He had never been able to harden his heart against a child. Any child.</p> <p>\u201cJeffrey switched with Reynolds this morning,\u201d Edmund added. \u201cWhich is on your schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that,\u201d he bluffed. \u201cSo, uh, kiddo\u2014Nicole\u2014if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d just as soon we got that test out of the way before you change your mind and shoot us all in the face.\u201d</p><p>Nicole remained a stone. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdmund, will you get doctor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cETA four minutes, my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Annoying bastard. And thank God. \u201cGreat. Nicole, you had anything to eat yet?\u201d He suddenly remembered the paramedics, the ambulance, and felt bad about all the hangover bitching. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She just sat there like a lump, a pretty lump, and looked at him. Her hands, already tan from being outdoors, rested limply on the chair\u2019s armrests. Her long, slender fingers didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he said again, totally at a loss. He could deal with kids. He could deal with his kids. He could deal with his grown-up kids. But a grown-up kid he\u2019d known only for a week? That was breaking new territory.</p><p>Al mentally spat on his hands. The blood of rebels ran in his veins, and they had made an art form of breaking new territory.</p><p>It did not occur to him until much later that the blood of rebels ran in her veins, too.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want anything? Cup of coffee? Tea? Milkshake? Soy shake? Latte? A beer and a ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early for me, so never mind the booze, but I\u2019d kill for a cup of coffee,\u201d she admitted. \u201cWhere is it? I\u2019ll get it myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, Edmund will get it.\u201d</p><p>One of her fingers twitched. Her trigger finger, he noticed. Her eyes narrowed a bit and her mouth thinned. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna be waited on hand and foot, King Alexander. So you can get that idea out of your pounding head right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, we\u2019d never dream of radically altering your lifestyle,\u201d Edmund broke in. \u201cHow do you take it, Miss Krenski?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and he figured she\u2019d already guessed there was no arguing with the man. \u201cBlack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtta girl,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cShe takes it like a man,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help bragging to Edmund.</p><p>\u201cYour exquisite notions of chauvinism are as fascinating as they are maddening, my king.\u201d</p><p>Nicole laughed for the first time that day.</p><p>\u201cShaddup,\u201d he told them both.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>\u201cM atch,\u201d the doc whose name Al couldn\u2019t remember told him. \u201cMatch. And match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk in your medical jargon, doc; just spell it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The doctor frowned. \u201cI thought I was being fairly clear. Miss Krenski is a direct blood relation of yours, Your Majesty, a sibling or a daughter. And due to the age difference and the fact that your parents are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So it\u2019s official. She\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, Your Majesty. There is no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere never was, doc.\u201d</p><p>He was so excited to get the ball moving, he didn\u2019t notice his youngest, Nicholas, motioning to the doctor. He went out the door of the lab without another backward glance, to his son\u2019s great good fortune.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>BASTARD PRINCESS</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>SITKA PALACE CONFIRMS BASTARD PRINCESS</p><p>NEXT IN LINE FOR THRONE</p><p>N icole walked into yet another ridiculously grand room, one she could have fit four of her trailers in. Her (ugh) siblings and (ugh ugh) father were already seated.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nicole,\u201d Nicholas, the youngest, called to her. He was the only blonde among them. She\u2019d heard the rumors, of course.</p><p>The official story was that Queen Dara was killed in a car accident on the way to a hairdresser appointment. Unofficially, she had been en route to meet her lover\u2014Nicky\u2019s real father.</p><p>But even when things were at their worst\u2014when David and Christina were king and queen pro tem while King Alexander was in a coma\u2014David did not permit a DNA test for the youngest Baranov.</p><p>\u201cYou made the front page this morning,\u201d Nicholas was saying. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reading at the table,\u201d King Al ordered. \u201cDitch the rag, boy. How\u2019d you sleep, Nicole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d A lie. \u201cBut if I\u2019m going to live here, is there a chance I could pick a different bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have any room\u2014rooms\u2014you want.\u201d</p><p>Excellent.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry? You must be. I didn\u2019t see you eat a thing all day yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d There was one empty spot at the table\u2014to the king\u2019s right. David sat at his left. \u201cThanks for waiting for me. Let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallelujah, brothers. And sisters,\u201d Alexander, the middle son, said. \u201cNicole, can I ask a personal question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your mama?\u201d</p><p>Before Nicole could reply, Kathryn, the youngest daughter, hurled a croissant across the table, catching Alexander neatly on the upper lip. \u201cDumbass! Don\u2019t ask her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancer,\u201d Nicole replied, struggling to remain straight-faced.</p><p>\u201cWas she in any pain at the end?\u201d the king asked quietly, which neatly quashed her urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, at the end\u2014she never knew anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d Alexandria, the eldest daughter (besides Nicole herself, she supposed), hissed at her brother. \u201cOur first meal as a family and you had to go bring that up! Throw something else, Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Alexander was cowering behind his saucer. \u201cI was curious, that\u2019s all. I would have liked to have met her. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got the diagnosis about two years ago,\u201d Nicole elaborated, helping herself to an English muffin. \u201cI took care of her as long as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took care of her?\u201d Christina asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I slammed her ass in a nursing home so I wouldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d Nicole snapped, feeling her cheeks get warm.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill my wife,\u201d David said calmly, spooning up oatmeal. \u201cIt\u2019ll ruin Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Nicole laughed; she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, uh, kinda mercurial, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kathryn asked.</p><p>Nicole shrugged, and as a footman discreetly poured her coffee, she thanked him and took a sip.</p><p>Her first night in the palace had been strange. She\u2019d known it would be, of course, but still wasn\u2019t prepared.</p><p>For one thing, the palace was ginormous. Easily the largest building she\u2019d been in in her life\u2014and she used to live in L.A. With hallways and rooms and corridors and multiple kitchens and nine thousand fireplaces, and it went on and on and on.</p><p>For another, she had a real glimpse of the kindness of the king. Her father. There had been a press conference, but she hadn\u2019t attended. Mr. Dante and her dad had handled the whole thing.</p><p>He had told her to explore and gave her a cell phone so small and thin it looked more like a fat credit card than anything else.</p><p>It had a very specific function; it summoned intermediaries at a beep, particularly Edmund.</p><p>So she had walked around and occasionally bumped into a sibling and introduced herself to at least a hundred staff members, and by the time she went looking for David, he was long gone and not due back until after midnight. She and Christina had exchanged a few stiff words, she\u2019d declined to meet her niece, and left.</p><p>Exhausted, she had gone to bed in a palatial (no pun intended) room that screamed \u201canonymous guest bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least they didn\u2019t already have a suite in her name all set up. They were arrogant, but not that arrogant.</p><p>And now they were, day two, at breakfast.</p><p>She had hoped to talk to David alone, then realized it might be a thing better spoken in front of all of them, so she spoke her piece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about usurping the throne from you,\u201d she said, taking another sip of the excellent coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I wrote the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsurp means to seize or commandeer,\u201d Alexander-the-younger said, \u201cimplying you had no right to it. When, in fact, you have every right to it.\u201d</p><p>David was nodding. They\u2014they were all nodding. That was a shock. \u201cStill. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, Nicole, but not for the reasons you think. None of this can be easy for you. We\u2019ll all do our best to make the transition as painless as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d she murmured, looking down at her plate.</p><p>\u201cAs for not being king...I haven\u2019t really had a chance to wrap my brain around that one.\u201d He smiled, but the smile didn\u2019t climb into his eyes. \u201cBut who can predict the future? Who knows? Maybe Dad has another kid running around and he or she is older than you are. Then you\u2019re off the hook.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cTease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting right here, kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad,\u201d David replied. \u201cBut you\u2019re not exactly lily white on this one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI gotta take shit from a punk like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Nicky said, squeezing his muffin so hard it imploded in a spray of crumbs and blueberries. \u201cThe day Dad dies, Nicole can abdicate!

I\u2019m the king\u2019s official biographer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Nicole shook hands with the woman.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re in the mood to talk about your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr how all this feels right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr what it\u2019s like to go from a commoner to first in line for the throne, set to inherit one of the world\u2019s largest fortunes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d The redhead looked around the suite of rooms. \u201cIs this gonna be yours, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA taciturn girl, I like that. The others can be a bit of a handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I\u2019m a pussycat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m an amoeba.\u201d</p><p>Holly pushed past Nicole\u2014a relief from bowing and \u201cYour Highness\u201d this and \u201cYour Highness\u201d that. Nicole pegged her accent as deep South United States, Texas or Georgia or someplace like that.</p> <p>Holly peered out the five-foot-high windows. \u201cHmmm. It looks like we\u2019re three stories up, but the south pavilion roof is right down there, ain\u2019t it? And from there it\u2019s not much of a drop for a tall girl like you.\u201d</p><p>Nicole raised her eyebrows. Holly \u201crhymes with dragon\u201d was a quick one. \u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy big ole Texan butt you hadn\u2019t.\u201d She slapped herself on the flank. \u201cAin\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...it\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I had to make that drop, I\u2019d mess up my fabulous underwear. Heights give me the creeps. But not you, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once followed a bear over a cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a memo to me to follow up with you on that story. But why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I shot him but didn\u2019t kill him, so I was morally obligated to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Why this suite, why the setup so you can slip off the grounds? You\u2019re not a prisoner, like Rapunzel in her tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to come and go as I like. Do you have any idea how long it takes just to arrange to go into town for, I dunno, a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst you gotta tell Edmund. Then he tells your security detail. Then they waste tons of time getting organized. Then, an hour or two later, finally, you can leave. Except you\u2019re not alone, of course. And with all the bodyguards and royal cars and all, everybody stares. And you can\u2019t pay for anything; the store owner comes out and practically genuflects. Then, finally, you come back to the gilded cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProb\u2019ly easier to stay in and have someone bring you a cuppa joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. The point is, I used to be able to come and go as I please, and now I can\u2019t.\u201d She resisted the urge to kick something. \u201cRapunzel\u2019s got nothing on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby,\u201d the Dragon yawned. \u201cHow do you find the strength to go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just messing with me.\u201d</p><p>The Dragon turned and beamed at her. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do, darlin\u2019. Excuse me: Princess Darlin\u2019. So if you don\u2019t mind my asking, what\u2019s next for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess lessons, I guess. Maybe smashing champagne bottles on a few cruise ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s worse royal families to end up in, you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Honey, I\u2019m a history major and a writer. Know what that makes me? The biggest snoop you ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a wonderful ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. And historically speaking, most princesses were ugly and dumb from all the inbreeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely thought,\u201d she said, appalled.</p><p>\u201cHistory ain\u2019t lovely, honey. At least in this country, they don\u2019t much care if you marry one a\u2019 the hoi polloi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have noticed they\u2019re all ridiculously good looking,\u201d she admitted. \u201cGuess it pays not to keep marrying your cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck your mirror sometime, honey, speaking of ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, biggest snoop I ever met, expert on the royal family, I have to admit I\u2019m curious about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your theory about Prince Nicky\u2019s parentage?\u201d</p><p>Holly snapped her notebook shut and gave Nicole a look over her bifocals. \u201cThat\u2019s generally considered the rudest question you can ask in these here parts. You want to get along with your new family, I wouldn\u2019t bring it up. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d</p><p>The sunny smile returned. \u201cAll part of the service, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>J effrey had spent the last two hours guarding Nicole\u2019s closed bedroom door, then went to stroll the grounds on a break. And like a lovesick school boy, he was standing on the lawn beneath Nicole\u2019s suite, staring up at the windows.</p><p>Get it together, man.</p><p>He\u2019d had flings before. He\u2019d even been in love before. But no one had ever made him feel like this. Hot and cold and urgent and lusty and protective and angry and happy all at once or one right after the other.</p><p>It was...disconcerting.</p><p>He doubted Nicole had a clue. He prayed she didn\u2019t have a clue. It was too embarrassing, almost a clich\u00e9; he was not in a Whitney Houston movie, for the love of God. And he outweighed Kevin Costner by forty pounds.</p><p>While he watched the window, he thought about the kiss. Thought about her scent\u2014she smelled like the outdoors, fresh and cottony\u2014and her sweetly yielding mouth. Thought about how he almost took her on the floor of her living room like a\u2014like a\u2014</p><p>He tried to shake it off. Never had he been so easily distracted while on duty; it was shameful. He was doing her no good if all he could think about was how she looked without her\u2014</p><p>Now what the hell was this?</p><p>The darkened window was silently swinging open and he grabbed for his gun out of pure ingrained training. Which would have been fine if someone was going in.</p><p>Instead, a lithe figure in dark clothes climbed out, hung from her hands by the sill, and dropped almost noiselessly to the roof of the pavilion. Swung over again, hung until her legs only dangled about four-and-a-half feet above the ground, and dropped yet again. Then stood, looked around, and walked away without the slightest trace of a limp.</p><p>He holstered his gun and nearly fell to his knees, his relief was so great. The twit could have broken every bone in her body! Talk about your personal and professional disasters. He could imagine the conversation: \u201cMy king, the first night I was in charge of Princess Nicole\u2019s detail, she broke both her legs. Very sorry.\u201d</p><p>He stepped out of the shadows to intercept her. \u201cGoing somewhere, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaaaaah! Jeez! Don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo very sorry, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey, you bum, were you watching my window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You didn\u2019t think we just hung around in doorways, did you?\u201d</p><p>Hands on her hips, she advanced on him. He wondered how heavily armed she was. \u201cI just want to take a walk, get it? And I don\u2019t want to bring the whole damn circus along, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about just me, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lip, which made him want to chew on her lip, and finally said, \u201cWell, I s\u2019pose. Let\u2019s hit the bricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t rat me out if I didn\u2019t let you tag along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo astute, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing. I saw you yesterday. On your break.\u201d They were walking across the vast lawn, staying out of the pools of brightness cast by the floodlights. \u201cDoing the New York Times crossword.\u201d</p><p>She saw him? Well, that seemed fair, as he was acutely aware whenever she was within twenty yards of him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was all out of chisels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve seen footmen treat you like your knuckles drag on the ground when you walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t it splendid?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, then laughed. \u201cAh. Ah-ha! I get it. Me big dumb bodyguard, me easily tricked, come into my web said the spider to the fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr words to that effect,\u201d he agreed, hands in his pockets so he wouldn\u2019t grab her for another kiss. \u201cLet them think what they like. Let them assume a man my size is slow and/or stupid. I like it when they can\u2019t see me coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a philosophy I can get behind,\u201d she said approvingly, and he grinned in the dark. \u201cSo where\u2019d you learn to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad, when he wasn\u2019t guarding the late king and queen. His dad before him. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found guides and they taught me. I\u2019ve spent more of my life in Los Angeles than Alaska, but I was always...I don\u2019t know...pulled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulled,\u201d he agreed. It was as fine a word for duty as any. Duty to country, or to self.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted trees and rivers and green. I feel like there\u2019s a plan when I\u2019m in the forest instead of all this\u2014this\u201d\u2014she gestured vaguely and he wondered if she realized she was pointing at the palace\u2014\u201cchaos.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a noisy bunch,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cand they\u2019ve got tempers like you wouldn\u2019t believe.

Nothing. And if someone shot me, he\u2019d have his hands full with my king.

Hair-trigger tempers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPot, meet kettle. Kettle, meet pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush up. You and your unanswerable observations.\u201d She was cupping her elbows and he realized that she was wearing only black leggings, flats, and a black T-shirt, and the sun had set two hours ago. He unbuttoned his suit jacket and slung it over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Stupid not to bring a jacket. Except I didn\u2019t have a black one.\u201d She pushed her arms into the sleeves and huddled into it. \u201cHey, maybe I would have frozen to death and then wouldn\u2019t have to worry about any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice that my career would have ended on a note of personal disaster, not to mention total disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, nobody asked you to skulk outside my window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been transferred to your detail,\u201d he said, not telling her he\u2019d slammed the paperwork through himself. Not telling her that the thought of someone else guarding her made him physically ill. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me to skulk. Skulking is what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She kicked at a tuft of grass. \u201cWhat, you get demoted? That\u2019s a bummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...quite demoted, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNih. Cole. Nicole. Nicole! You\u2019re wasting your time, you know. I thought you realized when we met that I could take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole Krenski, private citizen? No question. Her Royal Highness the Princess Nicole? The world is a big place, and there are an awful lot of people who wouldn\u2019t mind seeing you hurt. Or ransomed.\u201d Or dead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the same person I was two weeks ago,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess Nicole. To that end, you\u2019re the same person you were thirty years ago: Princess Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom was right not to tell me,\u201d she muttered. \u201cShe was right to protect me from all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother kept you from your rightful inheritance, from your destiny. And for what? To keep you to herself.\u201d</p><p>Nicole swung around and even in the near-gloom he could see her blue eyes blaze. \u201cDo not ever shit on my mother, Jeffrey, unless you\u2019d like a pistol-provided enema.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have angered Her Highness, I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stop talking about me in the third person!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand apologies.\u201d He paused and swallowed a snicker. \u201cTo Her Highness.\u201d</p> <p>This time the kick landed on his left shin, after which she spent a full minute hobbling in a small circle and groaning, \u201cOw my God, oh ouch oh ow ow ouch ouch ouch ouch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you require a doctor, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking doctor! Jeffrey, you are driving me batshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s two thousand for me, then. And we\u2019re never going to talk about it again, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d he said, playing dumb, which he did almost as well as Edmund.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she said, and caught him by the hair and pulled him down to her for a kiss that he thought might burn his mouth.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>T hey grappled, groped, and danced back and forth on the lawn, their mouths together, their tongues dueling, until Nicole lost her balance, Jeffrey lost his trying to grab for her, and they both rolled all the way down the south lawn.</p><p>How steep is this hill? she had time to wonder before fetching up against the trunk of a tree, hard.</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>\u201cNicole?\u201d His face peered anxiously down at her, feeling her limbs, the back of her skull. \u201cAre you all right? Do you need a doc\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...fucking...doctors,\u201d she moaned, wondering if he\u2019d even realized he\u2019d dropped the \u201cHer Highness\u201d crap. \u201cHad my fill while I was watching my mom die.\u201d She sat up and observed the line of pine trees marking the edge of the lawn. \u201cOh, man, I hope you\u2019ve got a crane in one of your pockets. I don\u2019t think I can get back up that hill on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014why did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m clumsy and I don\u2019t know the lay of the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that. Why did you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>She extended a hand, more to feel his than anything else, and he pulled her easily to her feet. \u201cWhy did you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you why. Once you\u2019re officially a princess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that, Jeffrey. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I got laid?\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Still he stared.</p><p>\u201cGoing on two years, buddy boy. And if you think I\u2019m gonna be The Celibate Princess, your tailor\u2019s been cutting your suits too tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it this way. You can do me, or you can find someone to do me. Y\u2019know, vet their credentials, make sure they\u2019re not a security risk. That sort of thing. Either that or I keep sneaking out of the castle at odd times of the day and night looking for lurrrrrv.\u201d</p><p>Even in the gloom, she could see him whiten. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re the smart one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy IQ is 157,\u201d he snapped, brushing pine needles out of his hair, \u201cand you\u2019re telling me I\u2019ve got to fuck you or pimp you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s quite a turn of phrase, Big Brain. But, yeah. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>He threw up his hands and walked around in a small circle. \u201cYou\u2019re just as bad as any of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hey. No need to get nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy way or the highway.\u201d Now he was kicking grass. \u201cIt ought to be on the Baranov coat of arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is on the Baranov coat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Old war injury?\u201d She swallowed a giggle as she saw him flush.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean I physically can\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014I mean I\u2019m perfectly capable\u2014that is, the ladies have said\u2014not that there have been a lot, but\u2014oh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>That was it; it was too much. Overload. She sank to her knees, laughing like a loon on uppers.</p><p>\u201cI remind Her Highness,\u201d he said grimly, hands jammed wrist-deep into his pockets, \u201cthat I am heavily armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it, stud. And stop talking about me in the third person; I\u2019m not warning you again. But first get me up this hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the latter, but we\u2019re not done discussing the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I make it a royal command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t issue a royal command if I stuck my gun up your nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, is that your idea of foreplay?\u201d</p><p>Muttering, he turned his back to her and brushed more pine needles off his suit. She leaped on his back and wrapped her legs around his waist. He was so surprised he nearly fell down again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ride, cowboy,\u201d she said, then kissed him on the right earlobe.</p><p>He took the gradual slope at a dead run, clutching her legs so she wouldn\u2019t fall off, and she rode him all the way to the top, whooping and giggling.</p><p>They were having so much fun, in fact, that they nearly knocked Edmund down the same slope they\u2019d just come up.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>J effrey had his gun out, but whether it was to shoot himself, Nicole, or Edmund he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Disgrace. Dishonor. Death?</p><p>Edmund\u2019s question, \u201cDid you two lose something besides your minds?\u201d was still hanging in the air.</p><p>Nicole hadn\u2019t climbed down. She just glared at Edmund over Jeffrey\u2019s left shoulder. He could feel the glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here? It\u2019s practically the middle of the night!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine-thirty,\u201d Edmund said mildly. \u201cPrince Nicholas went looking for you, Princess. He is still looking. So I suggest, Your Highness, that you get back inside. Now.\u201d</p><p>It was amazing. He sounded totally polite, even deferential, but she knew it wasn\u2019t a request.</p><p>Jeffrey, the bum who was supposedly watching out for her physical safety, dropped her like she was hot, and she hit the lawn ass-first.</p><p>\u201cOw, dammit!\u201d Nicole reacted. Then, \u201cFine, we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Dante\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey, your...ah...devotion to duty is commendable, but I am perfectly capable of escorting Her Highness back to the palace if you need to...ah...walk the perimeter. That is what you were doing, yes?\u201d He speared Jeffrey with a laser-beam gaze. \u201cWalking the perimeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Jeffrey said glumly. There was no point in wondering whether Edmund had seen them kissing. The man saw everything.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Nicole was handing him back his jacket. \u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble, right? Because I take full responsibility. I was the one who climbed out of my window and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed our walk, Highness,\u201d he said loudly, drowning out her confession. \u201cReynolds will relieve me at the top of the hour, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Incredibly, she seemed almost hurt. But that couldn\u2019t be right. He was saving her reputation at the cost of his own. It was for her own good. Surely she realized that.</p><p>\u201cFine. See ya,\u201d Nicole said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fell into step with Edmund and walked with him without once looking back.</p><p>He knew, because he was watching.</p><p>Chapter 26</p> <p>P rince Nicholas, last in line for the throne, was giving serious thought to playing baseball with the jade chess pieces the Emperor had given his great-grandfather when Edmund finally walked in with Nicole.</p><p>Edmund, of course, looked as he always did: starched and proper. Edmund was never-ending, like the tides, and never-changing, like the face of the moon, or his father, or Kathryn\u2019s aim.</p><p>But Nicole looked like she\u2019d been run over by a truck. Her hair was all over the place, there was something sticky (sap? mud?) on her left cheek, pine needles all over her leggings, a bloody scratch on her right arm, and her mouth looked weird, like the lips were slightly swollen or something.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap! What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA midnight hike,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks for the escort, Edmund. Buh-bye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHighnesses.\u201d Edmund bowed and left.</p><p>Nicole looked around the room, noting the several dozen chess boards. \u201cOh, boy. The boredom generated in this room alone is trying to sap my will to live.\u201d She turned her gaze\u2014so like his other sisters\u2014on him. \u201cYou were looking for me?\u201d</p><p>This was a pleasant surprise. His other siblings took their sweet time when he needed one of them or were busy on one royal duty or another. He was the baby; he was used to the teasing and, worse, being ignored.</p><p>And Nicole was really old, older even than David! Mid thirties! That was old, man. He couldn\u2019t believe he had to wait only ten minutes for her to show up.</p><p>\u201cI knocked on your door but you didn\u2019t answer, so I thought you were sleeping. But Edmund said he knew where you were. It\u2019s kind of cold out for hiking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d she replied, \u201con who you\u2019re hiking with. What\u2019s up, blondie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I got hauled into the Room of Perpetual Yawns? For nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014I was just hoping you were doing okay.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look and sat down across from him. They both ignored the chess board between them. \u201cAs well as can be expected, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had to go live in a strange place, I might be scared. And I prob\u2019ly wouldn\u2019t tell anybody if I was scared. And it\u2019s okay. If you\u2019re scared, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d he added, holding out a CD case, \u201cthere\u2019s this.\u201d</p><p>She took it and examined it. \u201cWhat is it? Did you burn me a mix CD? Because I have to tell you, I\u2019m all eighties rock, all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow, you really are old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a wonderful conversation we\u2019re having,\u201d she muttered, and he felt bad because he forgot old people didn\u2019t like being reminded they were old. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t The Greatest Hits of Teena Marie, then what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nineteen ways I\u2019ve found to get safely out of the palace without being seen. You keep going over the ledge like that and off the pavilion, you\u2019re going to break an ankle.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cDoes everyone know that\u2019s why I picked that suite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me and Edmund. And probably your security detail. And maybe the Dragon. Probably the Dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t, he sure does now,\u201d she muttered, which he didn\u2019t quite get. \u201cDoes the king know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, our father doesn\u2019t know. Are you kidding? He still thinks Kathryn\u2019s a virgin.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes nearly bulged out of her head. \u201cThaaaat\u2019s a bit of an overshare. Let\u2019s not do that again, okay? Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m the only virgin in the family,\u201d he added glumly.</p><p>\u201cYou just did it again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. Sex is overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His brothers and sisters never talked to him about this stuff. Why would they? To him, he was always going to be the six-year-old mischief maker who didn\u2019t look like any of them. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, I just said it\u2019s overrated. Look, when you\u2019re a virgin, losing it is the most important thing in the world. It\u2019s all you can think about, right? But once it\u2019s gone, once you\u2019ve got that whole awkward weird first time out of the way, it\u2019s never going to be as big a deal again.\u201d</p><p>Except she had an odd look on her face as she told him this, almost like she wasn\u2019t sure she believed what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cHard to imagine,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, this aged ancient knows of what she speaks. Dammit! Now I\u2019m referring to myself in the third person.\u201d She bounced the case up and down in her hand like a baseball. \u201cThanks for this. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right! So keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, Curly. I never forget a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You\u2019re one of us. And don\u2019t call me Curly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll blow up half of your personal belongings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, listen, what is it with you and incendiary devices? Is it the typical youngest-seeking-attention thing? Or do you, uh, need to be speaking to someone? Someone with many degrees in psychiatry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell, Curly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Curly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, never again, Curly.\u201d Then she hauled him out of the chair, bounced him to the floor, and tickled him until tears were streaming down his face and he was begging her to stop.</p><p>\u201cThis might not entirely suck,\u201d she announced as he staggered to his feet. \u201cI never had a little brother before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m three inches taller than you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but your muscle mass hasn\u2019t caught up with your height. So until then I can beat you with impunity.\u201d She shoved him and he nearly went sprawling, scattering chess pieces like confetti. \u201cAnd I shall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis does entirely suck,\u201d he informed her, lying like mad. \u201cThe last thing I needed was another older sibling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck it up, Curly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me\u2014don\u2019t tickle! No! I mean it! Quit! Nicooooooole!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>K ing Al tiptoed through the outer room leading to his office, not an easy thing for a man of his height, or weight. Moving as stealthily as he could ever remember in his life, he eased the door open and slipped inside. This early, no one was likely to\u2014</p><p>\u201cHowdy, Big Al!\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cYou! I fired you yesterday. Again! I made sure Reynolds got you on that flight! You\u2019re supposed to be in Dallas right this second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m from Houston. And o\u2019course your man saw me get on board. But we refueled in Minot, and I hopped a flight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we were back in the U.S. of A., your men didn\u2019t have any authority over me. But you knew I couldn\u2019t stay away, else why all the pussyfooting at this ungodly hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hedging my bets. Now get lost, you hideous scribe of a she-devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragon,\u201d she said, smiling. She was wearing the usual purple glasses, this time with a red suit and white jogging shoes. She jiggled her left foot like mad. \u201cAnd congrats; I didn\u2019t know you knew a great big word like scribe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow big can it be? It\u2019s one syllable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked to the new girl yesterday,\u201d she added, apropos of nothing. \u201cSeems like a nice enough gal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Nicole?\u201d He gestured to a chair. \u201cSid-down, what\u2019s your rush? How\u2019s she doing? What\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re askin\u2019 me? You\u2019re the daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m trying to give her some space. We\u2019ve asked a lot of her this week. I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want to make things worse.\u201d</p><p>The Dragon\u2019s mouth, normally set in a jeering smile, softened. \u201cShe\u2019ll come around, Big Al. Who\u2019d resist your charms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d he grumped. \u201cSo what\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we mostly talked about the historical prevalence of inbreeding among royalty.\u201d</p><p>Al groaned.</p><p>\u201cWell, not in your family, o\u2019course.\u201d</p><p>He groaned again. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we talked about her new digs. She sure looks like you guys. And acts like you guys. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>The Dragon appeared, of all things, to be choosing her words carefully. \u201cShe\u2019s still missing her mama, o\u2019course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019ll have a hard time. Not because of all this.\u201d She gestured to the magnificent office, and the king knew she meant all of it\u2014the money, the status, the property. \u201cBut because she lost the only family she ever had. So why would she ever dare let any of y\u2019all get close?\u201d</p><p>The king stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart, for a psychopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d The Dragon winked. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the cute boys say.\u201d</p><p>Chapten 28</p><p>\u201cJ effrey, would you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Highness.\u201d Her bodyguard stepped back and kicked in the door to the Outer Banks Co.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jeffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>Nicole brushed splinters off her shoulders and marched inside. \u201cFreeborg, you scumbag!\u201d</p><p>Her former boss had shoved his chair back as far as he could go without actually going out the window. He was pale, even for him. \u201cNicole, what\u2014you\u2014I mean, Your Highness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ratted me out! You blabbed to the press! You ruined my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Nicole\u2014I mean, Your Highness\u2014it was going to come out anyway! We had royalty in here two days in a row!

Never mind that you sold me down the river at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they all\u2014I mean, the royal family all knew you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they couldn\u2019t prove it unless their own doctor did the test. Something I was managing to avoid very neatly, by the way. Until you wrecked any chance I had of a normal life.\u201d She was leaning over his desk now, and he was cringing back in his chair. Since he had seen her shoot, this was a wise move. \u201cSo I figure the least you deserve is a wrecked door and the penalty of my displeasure.\u201d</p> <p>Jeffrey whispered in her ear. She smiled. Her former boss went, if possible, whiter. \u201cThe penalty of our displeasure. That\u2019s the royal \u2018our,\u2019 by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNic\u2014Your Highness, give me a break. Except for the occasional Sandra Dee, we\u2019re struggling to stay out of the red. Now I\u2019ve got bookings through the end of next year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all you had to do,\u201d she said sweetly, \u201cwas sell us down the river.\u201d Hmm. She could get used to the \u201croyal we\u201d thing. \u201cWell, enjoy your success, Mike. You\u2019ve earned it. By the way, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re audited every month until the end of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, have we met? Jeffrey, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, you were never exactly Employee of the Month!\u201d Freeborg yelled back. \u201cWith that mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d Jeffrey murmured, tapping his earpiece.</p><p>\u201cLoads,\u201d she said, and smiled at him.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>B ack in the car, Jeffrey tapped his earpiece again. \u201cRodinov and Hunter en route to the palace.\u201d He listened, then tapped it again.</p><p>Nicole figured it was a two-way communication piece, kind of like the ones they used in the old Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes. Tap to open broadcast, tap to close. Neat.</p> <p>\u201cHunter, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your call sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just use my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause then the bad guys will know who we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>She mused in the passenger seat. She had flatly refused to ride in the back like an invalid. \u201cWhat\u2019s the king\u2019s call sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoet.\u201d</p> <p>Poet? Weird. \u201cAlexandria\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepwalker.\u201d</p><p>Weirder and weirder. \u201cDavid\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMini-Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good. Christina\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMime.\u201d</p><p>What the blue hell? Those were some pretty fucked up call signs. \u201cNicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all you have to do is read People to figure that one out.\u201d She was forgetting someone, she just knew\u2014ah! Alexandria had married an American two years ago, but he was currently out of the country. In fact, Alex herself was leaving tomorrow to be with him, according to the schedule.</p><p>Yeah, the schedule. She got one of her very own, first thing in the morning, along with all the major newspapers. Every little thing any of the family had to do was spelled out in excruciatingly dull detail. Every morning. With hourly updates.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d she said brightly. \u201cGiven any thought to our little chat last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the chat and the piggyback ride that almost got me fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s firing you without my say-so. Wait a minute. If I fire you, will you sleep with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll too well. Never mind, that\u2019d mean you could sue me for sexual harassment. I\u2019d hate to inadvertently bring a lawsuit against the royal family my first week in residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done anything inadvertently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. Neither have they.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe royal family. Them. They.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you skip breakfast? Blood sugar a little low?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour royal family. Us. We.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, give me time. Anyway, quit trying to change the subject. Have you thought about our chat or haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey, who usually drove like a robot, actually took his gaze off the road and looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve thought about. I didn\u2019t sleep a wink last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s odd. I slept great.\u201d And she had, because she hadn\u2019t slept a wink the night before. \u201cSo? What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNi\u2014Your Highness, there\u2019s a car behind us with two more bodyguards in it. You want me to just\u2014to just pull over and do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a perfect world,\u201d she admitted, \u201cyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a perfect world...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a perfect world you wouldn\u2019t be a princess and I wouldn\u2019t be your subject,\u201d he said in a rush of words.</p><p>\u201cJeez, take a breath or you\u2019re gonna pass out at the wheel.\u201d</p><p>He did as she asked, he took a deep breath and tightened his grip on the wheel. She was surprised the wheel didn\u2019t creak from the pressure.</p><p>\u201cAnd for the record,\u201d she added, \u201cI agree one hundred percent. But we\u2019re not in a perfect world. If we were, my mom would be alive and French fries would help you lose weight.\u201d</p><p>He barked a laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re not. And she isn\u2019t. And they don\u2019t. So what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plan is, I drive you back to the Sitka Palace, Princess, and then you do as you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I get the feeling we would have been pretty good between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, too,\u201d he said quietly, and wouldn\u2019t speak to her for the rest of the drive.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>\u201cY ou sure you\u2019re ready for this, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we can put it off for a few more days. It\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem; they\u2019re already waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>The king snorted. He was actually dressed up in a tailored navy blue suit, sky blue shirt, and red-and-blue-striped tie. \u201cBelieve me, they\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, she wants to do it,\u201d David said, equally dressed to the nines. \u201cLet her do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Al.\u201d \u201cAl\u201d was as close as Nicole could come. She had dropped the \u201cking\u201d but couldn\u2019t bring herself to call him Dad, or even Father. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They were in a spacious salon, and sun streamed through the Eastern windows. The king was there, she was there, and David was there. And their bodyguards were there, of course. Also the redhead who, wonderfully, seemed to irritate the piss out of Al.</p><p>The other royals had other duties or had gotten out of this one.</p><p>Nicole also was dressed in a suit; her closet had mysteriously filled overnight with clothes that fit perfectly. She was dressed in black, with a white blouse and her mother\u2019s gold earrings.</p><p>The Alaskan Olympic Ski Team marched in, fresh from two silvers and a gold at the Winter Olympics in Gstaad. Nicole, David, and Al were supposed to pat them on the back, have a nice lunch, and in general tell them they were the pride of Alaska.</p><p>Which, to be fair, they were.</p><p>Nicole sighed and prepared to be bored.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t bored. Not at all. Because the Olympian on her left\u2014Yanos somebody\u2014and the one across the table from her\u2014Thomas somebody\u2014were both excellent flirts with truly marvelous physiques.</p><p>They were full of charming questions about her status as the bastard princess (The papers had given her the nickname, and it had stuck...and she didn\u2019t mind. It was better than just princess.) and what she had been up to and how she was coping.</p><p>\u201cTruly remarkable,\u201d Thomas somebody was saying. \u201cAnd how are you adjusting to life at the palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Good days and bad. Hey, don\u2019t hog the last roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my princess commands,\u201d Thomas teased, and tossed it to her.</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Skier Boi. So what do you guys do when you\u2019re not shushing down mountains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeguile beautiful women,\u201d Yannos teased.</p><p>\u201cAnd beg for their favors,\u201d Thomas added.</p><p>\u201cBeg for their favors? What century do you live in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny century where you are, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hmm. She was eating with two men who were literally the best in the world at what they did, who had the bodies of gods and, one hoped, appetites to match. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose one of you guys would be open to a royal command, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would be open to anything Your Highness wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things more than others,\u201d Thomas asked, giving her a wicked grin.</p><p>Now this she could get used to. \u201cOh! In that case, I\u2014shit! I dropped one of my eight forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Princess, you can use mine to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCode twenty-nine!\u201d Jeffrey bellowed. Then he yanked Thomas\u2019s chair away from the table, yanked Thomas out of said chair, and tossed him four feet through the air. The skier hit the wooden floor with a spectacular slam.</p><p>Nicole saw that the other royals had been hauled away from the table and their guards were standing protectively in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the king roared, spraying soup.</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to stab the princess,\u201d Jeffrey replied stonily.</p><p>Nicole was on her feet. She didn\u2019t remember pushing her chair back or standing. \u201cHe was lending me his fork.\u201d</p><p>Six more bodyguards came out of nowhere and they were all pointing their guns at Thomas, who was lying on his back like a stunned beetle.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d David asked sharply, peeking around his bodyguard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raised her voice. \u201cHe was lending me his fork.

You did that because he was flirting with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd trying to stab you.\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked on the urge to punch him in his smug face. \u201cHe was not trying to stab me and you know it! You saw us getting cozy, and for whatever weird reason, you didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cWeird reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t want the job, so now...what? You\u2019re gonna immobilize any decent prospect that comes along?\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms across his massive chest and didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Jeffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you at the luncheon. And I need to get back to reassess the threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible. Try that again and I\u2019ll shoot you with your own gun. Now get lost!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m currently on duty and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I being unclear? Slurring my words? I want you out of my face. Go away. Run away. What the fuck ever. Just get in the wind, buddy boy, and you can consider that a royal command.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the stricken look on his face. She was completely immune to it. It didn\u2019t make her feel bad at all. Nope. Not one bit.</p><p>Fuming and heart sore, she went back to the luncheon just in time to hear the king scream, \u201cWell, somebody better tell me what the hell is going on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Al. Eat your soup.\u201d</p><p>He pointed his spoon at her, then seemed to think better of it and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>The rest of the conversation was strained, to say the least.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>J effrey knocked on the door he had leaned against thousands of times.</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d</p><p>He opened it but stayed on the threshold. \u201cYou wished to see me, my king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on in, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey walked into the office. \u201cMajesty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Jeff.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his career, Jeffrey took the seat opposite the king. \u201cHow may I assist you, my king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can settle down and unclench. Want a drink? Something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, you\u2019re so tense you\u2019re making me nervous. Granted, your last vacation wasn\u2019t much fun\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nearly died. By the time the border patrol eased up enough for me to get back into the country, it was all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but your last vacation was also four years ago. I think, after what happened at lunch, that you\u2019re a little overdue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the king require my resignation?\u201d he asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cShit, no!\u201d The king looked honestly stressed, and even worried. Jeffrey had often wished someone would try something on his watch, just so he could have the pleasure of taking a bullet for Alexander Baranov II. And he always felt guilty when he had such thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m just worried about you, Jeff. Nicole popping up out of the woodwork has been stressful for all of us\u2014\u201d</p><p>My king, you have no idea.</p><p>\u201c\u2014everybody\u2019s on edge and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She talked to me like she hated me.</p><p>\u201c\u2014stressful, sure, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hated me.</p><p>\u201c\u2014a handful, but she\u2019s had to adjust to a lot\u2014\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bear it if she felt the way she sounded.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d King Alexander beamed. \u201cSo it\u2019s settled. Effective tomorrow, you\u2019re on vacation for the rest of the week.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, take two weeks. See what a softy I am?\u201d</p><p>He cursed himself for not paying more attention. Then he realized: the king was right. He couldn\u2019t even focus on orders from the sovereign. What good was he to Nicole in this state?</p><p>\u201cThat, ah, that won\u2019t be necessary, sir. I\u2019ll see you Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake \u2019er easy, Jeff. Oh, and Jeff! Where\u2019s the Dragon right now?\u201d</p><p>He consulted his Palm Pilot. \u201cThird floor, north wing. I would guess she\u2019s taking more pictures of the family portraits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. That\u2019s fine. Thousand of feet away. Okay. Thanks. Enjoy your time off. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Then why did it feel more like a punishment than a reward?</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>C hristina Baranov, once Crown Princess of Alaska, now just plain Princess, came at once to answer her daughter\u2019s cries.</p><p>She cursed Dara\u2019s grandfather for letting the almost-four-year-old watch Lord of the Rings. This was the third night in a row Dara had dreamed of catapulting severed heads. She soothed her daughter, named for a dead queen, David\u2019s mother. And soon enough, the child drifted back to sleep.</p><p>David hadn\u2019t come to help her. And when David was home, he always came when Dara cried.</p><p>Christina was hot tempered, but a good wife who loved her husband beyond all reason, and she said nothing to David when she returned to their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cShe okay?\u201d David said, not looking away from the television. That in itself was super weird; David never watched television. He never had time. If he wasn\u2019t tending the penguins or speaking at an aquarium or studying law or history, he had almost as much paperwork to juggle as Al, or Edmund.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cAnother nightmare about flying severed heads. Remind me to kick your dad\u2019s butt up to his shoulder blades tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>David smiled, clicking rapidly through the channels. \u201cYou know he can\u2019t refuse her anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s spoiling her rotten and giving her nightmares. The worst of both worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bug Dad. He\u2019s got enough on his mind. Especially after that balls-up of a luncheon.\u201d</p><p>Shockeroo number eighty-seven, and it had already been a helluva week. David didn\u2019t normally talk crude; he left it to her.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, trying for noncommittal. \u201cYeah, I heard Jeffrey had kind of an overreaction. But all those guys are wound so tight I can\u2019t believe it hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d it go? Nicole\u2019s first official thingamabob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after our gold medalist nearly got concussed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So. Uh. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Click click click click click. \u201cAt all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, we haven\u2019t really talked about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you\u2019re suddenly out of the job you\u2019ve been training for since you were in diapers.\u201d</p><p>At last, at last he looked at her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss. It\u2019s just as much my duty to step aside for the true heir as it was my duty to learn how to\u2014to run things after Dad. You know.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cDuty! If I hear that word again this week I\u2019ll puke! Fuck duty, how do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Click. Click. Click.</p><p>She jerked the remote out of his hand, shut off the television, and tossed the remote across the room.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d her husband observed, \u201cnow that\u2019s mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid! Stop being such a damn guy and talk to me! Tell me you\u2019re pissed, tell me you\u2019re sad, tell me you\u2019re thrilled to be off the hook. I don\u2019t give a shit, just speak.\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cArf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she muttered, getting up from the bed, but he rolled across the mattress, grabbed her arm, and pulled her back down.</p><p>\u201cYou worship the very ground I walk on and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t press your luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, I can\u2019t tell you how I feel because I don\u2019t know how I feel. I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d He groped for words, seemingly at a loss. Or perhaps actually at a loss.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care if I\u2019m ever queen. You know that. You always knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to have feelings about not being the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have feelings.\u201d He paused. \u201cI just have no idea what they are.\u201d</p><p>She understood. She had spent her time as a royal dreading Al\u2019s death, dreading the crown. And now that she never had to worry about it again, she wasn\u2019t sure if she was relieved or out of sorts. And if she, who\u2019d only been in the royal family a little over four years, didn\u2019t know, how could David possibly know?</p><p>\u201cYou want something? An omelet?\u201d Their suite was the only one equipped with a kitchen; Christina had been a cook in her old life. \u201cCoddled eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of eggs. I\u2019d rather have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooh,\u201d she said, letting him drag her across the bed and into his lap. \u201cNow if only you had the remote back, you\u2019d be the happiest guy in the country.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>\u201cU h, hello.\u201d Nicole blinked at the stranger standing opposite her door. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalia Burdenov, Your Highness. I\u2019m new to your detail, effective 0800 today.\u201d</p><p>Nicole blinked harder. Yesterday had been a disaster\u2014the botched luncheon, her screaming at Jeffrey\u2014complete and total nightmare. She\u2019d spent the rest of the day hiding in a library she\u2019d found. No one had disturbed her, and she\u2019d worked her way through four Hardy Boys books. She had declined to eat with the royal family and had hit the sheets early after someone sent up a sandwich and decaf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her favorite sandwich: rare roast beef, mustard, tomatoes, on a sourdough roll.</p><p>She wondered how the palace staff ferreted stuff like that out.</p><p>Resolved to make a fresh start and hash this thing out with Jeffrey, her plan had been foiled by sleeping late. And now\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jeffrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff duty for the rest of the week, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>She squinted at Natalia, who looked as far from a bodyguard as anyone she\u2019d ever seen: big dark pansy eyes, pale skin, long blond hair in a Valkyrie braid that hung over her left shoulder. Black suit. Armed to the teeth. Sensible flats.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Highness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I get him in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Highness.\u201d</p><p>Great. They\u2019d assigned her a cyborg.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWell, what\u2019s the plan for today, Natalia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be presenting awards to the GSA\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl Scouts of Alaska. Then lunch. Then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen nothing. I\u2019m off duty then, too.\u201d</p><p>Natalia didn\u2019t blink. Perhaps she hadn\u2019t been programmed to. \u201cYes, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Nicky?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 34</p><p>A fter dealing with several giggling preadolescents, all who wanted to know what it was like to be \u201ca real live princess, like Sleeping Beauty!\u201d she made her escape and tracked down the youngest prince. She found him exactly where Natalia had told her he\u2019d be, which was a good trick.</p><p>Because when it was just family, the detail left them pretty much alone. They only stuck close at official luncheons and the like. And they were positively leechlike when the royals left the palace grounds. And yet, they always knew where each royal could be found, day or night.</p><p>Anyway, Nicky was watching the new Harry Potter movie, which she knew for a fact wouldn\u2019t be out in theaters for another six weeks, and munching popcorn in the small theater.</p><p>Munching alongside him was Princess Christina.</p><p>\u201cHi, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>He turned and smiled when he saw her. \u201cHi, Nicole. Lights!\u201d</p><p>The gloomy theater instantly brightened, and the movie shut off.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seen it three times already.\u201d Christina was studying her with a cool, calculating gaze. \u201cDid you come to rumble? Get payback for that bump on the noggin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet your niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry about that. Sure, but maybe later? I mean, doesn\u2019t she have a schedule, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Al is sneaking her Ding-Dongs and ruining her supper,\u201d Christina said dolefully. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have supper with us? David and me and her, I mean, in our suite? I\u2019ll cook.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. She had read that Christina Baranov, n\u00e9e Krabbe, had been a cruise line chef before meeting the king, and then David. \u201cSure, sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you allergic to anything?\u201d</p><p>Amused, Nicole asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t have paperwork on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But who can find it in that haystack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no allergies. But I hate green beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree helpings of haricots vertes coming up.\u201d Christina tossed another handful of popcorn in her mouth. \u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Christina, I\u2019m here for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are? I mean, of course you are.\u201d Christina looked surprised. Nicky looked smug. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry about the other day. Even though you started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really suck at apologies,\u201d Nicky told his sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014no hard feelings, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Nicole replied, \u201chave no other kind of feelings, on the off chance you hadn\u2019t noticed. Now if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to talk to Nicky alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to him?\u201d Christina asked suspiciously, not budging from her seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to probe his diabolical mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being serious.\u201d</p><p>Christina turned to the only other blonde in the family. \u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably got some piano wire on her somewhere. Possibly a crossbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m in danger because she tried to punch you? You\u2019re in danger because she tried to punch you. Why don\u2019t you go take care of David\u2019s penguins or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it\u2019s true?\u201d Nicole said. \u201cThere really are penguins living inside the palace? I thought that was an urban legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all wish.\u201d The tall blonde shuddered but got to her feet. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go take care of the smelly things? Because I have a life? I\u2019m gonna go make pea soup from scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPea soup,\u201d Nicky said, shivering. \u201cWhy not just vomit into a bowl and call it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re disgusting.\u201d Christina moved up the aisle. \u201cLater, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven \u2018maybe\u2019 sounds ominous coming from you.\u201d But Christina was talking to herself; Nicole had focused her attention on Nicky.</p><p>She sat beside him and said, \u201cIf I wanted to find out where a staff member lived while at the same time not making a big deal of it, how would I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He handed her a computer printout. It had one name on it, and one address.</p><p>Jeffrey Rodinov.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cWhat are you, a witch? How\u2019d you know what I wanted? How\u2019d you know I\u2019d show up here looking for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everybody knows Jeffrey was sort of forced into a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced?\u201d she said sharply. Here she\u2019d been thinking he had gotten himself transferred to another detail, and who could blame him?</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. He\u2019s really overdue. It\u2019s stressful, watching out for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nicole, you can\u2019t. Our detail is bored 99.9 percent of the time, and the other tenth of a percent, people are shooting at them\u2014or us\u2014or trying to blow us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t think about it like that.\u201d Mostly, she mused, she thought of the detail as grossly invading her privacy as much as they could.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was on Dad\u2019s detail for years. That\u2019s probably the most stressful detail of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ve established I\u2019m the detail dumbass. But you still haven\u2019t explained how you can see into the future. Is that your royal superpower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just figured you\u2019d want to check up on him. Whenever one of our detail is sick or whatever, we usually stop by their place at least once. They\u2019re trained to take a bullet or a knife; the least we can do is visit them when they\u2019re sick or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sick or whatever had nothing to do with nothing, but she had no plans to enlighten the Prince of Darkness. \u201cI\u2019m with you so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I figured you wouldn\u2019t know who to ask\u2014Edmund, by the way, when in doubt, always ask Edmund\u2014so I pulled Jeffrey\u2019s address out of one of our databases, printed it, and stuck it in my pocket. I figured I\u2019d have to find you, but you tracked me down.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of terrifying, you know?\u201d</p><p>He arched blond brows at her. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you blow up the bathrooms at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole!\u201d He grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you believe everything you read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a chance to kill myself if I ever get on your bad side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Uh.\u201d He colored. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sorry about your mom and all, but I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here. It\u2019s been so boring lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything to brighten your weird little life.\u201d She pocketed the printout. \u201cThanks for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Next time give me something hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to stump you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>J effrey sat in his living room, drinking Scotch.</p><p>This was a horrible idea, for several reasons.</p><p>One: He didn\u2019t drink.</p><p>Two: If he did drink, it wouldn\u2019t be Scotch, which tasted like rubbing alcohol to him, no matter how good or how old. And this had been a Christmas gift from the king; he knew it went for at least three hundred bucks. Still, it tasted like a doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>Three: At the rate he was going, he was looking at a real bitch kitty of a hangover tomorrow.</p><p>And four: It wasn\u2019t helping. He was still ashamed, and horny, and mad.</p><p>He drained the glass.</p><p>At least Nicole was in good hands. Natalia may have been the youngest agent on the detail, but what she lacked in experience she made up for in cold-blooded efficiency. And she had been an Olympian-level sharpshooter. Quite a catch for the detail and an impeccable military background, too.</p><p>But, oh God, he wished he was the one watching out for Nicole. Who knew what mischief that mouthy, gorgeous, irritating princess would get up to? For that matter, who knew what\u2014</p><p>There was a tap on the door.</p><p>Jeffrey cursed. That would be a palace rep, asking him to return to duty for whatever reason. Except he couldn\u2019t, because he\u2019d been drinking.</p><p>He got to his feet and walked to the door, stooping to look through the peephole.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d He yanked the door open. \u201cTell me Natalia knows where you are.\u201d</p><p>Nicole brushed past him. \u201cNatalia of the Borg thinks I\u2019m asleep in my bed. Jeez, nice fumes, did you fall into a brewery on your way home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNicole!\u201d he howled.</p><p>\u201cPlease come in, Nicole. So nice to see you again, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole! Sneaking out to walk around the palace property is one thing. But you can\u2019t leave the palace proper, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d He fought the urge to gouge out his own eyes in horror. \u201cThe detail is going to shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if you rat me out.\u201d She was looking around his slightly messy apartment with interest. \u201cSo this is where you live when you\u2019re not driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drive you crazy?\u201d He tried to drink more Scotch but realized anew that the glass was empty. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, that\u2019s hilarious, I would have bet large amounts of currency that it was the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He tried to see it through her eyes: the living room comfortably furnished with an oversized chair and a sectional couch. The fireplace. The kitchen, with dinner dishes still stacked in the sink. A serviceable bathroom with an extra-large whirlpool tub; he got kinks in his back and neck from being alert every moment of every hour he was on the job, and the tub did wonders for his muscles.</p><p>And the\u2014the\u2014</p> <p>\u201cNicole, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She shrugged out of her jacket and tossed it over the back of the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re off duty for the rest of the week. And I\u2019m off the grounds. So I figured, what better time for us to have sex than now? You\u2019re not a bodyguard. And I\u2019m not a princess.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, the stress of palace living had driven her insane, poor girl. \u201cOf course you\u2019re a princess, how could you ever not be a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rephrase. I don\u2019t feel it here.\u201d She lightly touched her left breast and he clutched the glass so hard he thought it would break. \u201cPeople can \u2018Her Highness\u2019 me until they pass out, but it doesn\u2019t feel real. None of this feels real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to give it time. More time than a week. Like it or not, you\u2019re a princess born. You don\u2019t have to feel it. You just are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice speech.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. I\u2019m all tingly and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Then, incredibly, she was stripping her T-shirt over her head. \u201cOkay, that wasn\u2019t quite true,\u201d she went on conversationally. \u201cYou feel real. I think about you all the time. And we\u2019ll never have a better chance than this one.\u201d She was shucking out of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop undressing!\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cI was kind of hoping you would start undressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole\u2014I\u2014your father would shoot me with my own gun. And then several of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we a little old to worry about what Daddy thinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014you\u2014we\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blushed to her eyebrows. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to. Oh, boy.\u201d She covered her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t normally misread a situation this badly. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got a bottomless pit I can throw myself into.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cJeffrey?\u201d</p><p>Then she felt his hands on her wrists, pulling her fingers away from her face. He had moved with that silently, spooky speed.</p><p>And then, oh thank God, he was kissing her and yanking at the buttons on his shirt.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>S he tried to help him with his shirt, but he was in a hurry and it tore. She hadn\u2019t realized a good quality men\u2019s shirt could rip like a Kleenex. She fumbled at his belt and, oh boy, was there a sexier sound than a man\u2019s belt coming undone?</p><p>He yanked at his pants and they staggered back and forth while he tried not to trip, and finally he kicked free of them. Then he was pushing her bra cups down and sucking greedily at her nipples.</p><p>She arched against him and groaned, \u201cFeels like you\u2019re doing that between my legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, voice muffled against her flesh.</p><p>She did what she had wanted to do for days: plunged her fingers into his black, curly hair, stroking, touching. His hair was coarse and soft at the same time, crackling beneath her fingers like a cat\u2019s fur.</p><p>He fumbled for the middle of her back, fumbled more, then muttered, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and yanked. She grinned as he relieved her of her (now useless) bra.</p><p>\u201cYou know, those hook and eye things are a pain to get back into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole, hush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHouse rules, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He scooped her up in his arms and practically ran to what she hoped was a bedroom.</p><p>And...it was! He dropped her on the bed and pulled down his boxers. She wriggled out of her panties, trying not to stare at him. His chest was furred with dark hair, tapering down his stomach and into his pubic hair. His sex jutted out at her and she could see how the tip gleamed.</p><p>Now she was really trying not to stare. Although why she was surprised, she didn\u2019t know. Why wouldn\u2019t a guy with big hands and broad shoulders be big...in all ways?</p><p>She was so busy trying not to stare at him, she didn\u2019t realize he was staring at her. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYou look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloated?\u201d she suggested. \u201cMy monthly visitor is due in four or five days.\u201d</p><p>He considered for a moment. \u201cIncredibly, that did not ruin the mood. And the word I had in mind was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He obliged, which was very fine. She couldn\u2019t get enough of his mouth, she felt like devouring him. Then he trailed kisses down her breasts, lingered on her nipples, then moved to her stomach. He put his hands on her knees and slowly spread her legs; then he was kissing her where she had longed to be kissed.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d</p><p>He was parting her lower lips with his tongue again and again, teasing and licking and kissing. She pumped her hips against his mouth in pure unconscious reaction, and then he was\u2014oh he was\u2014he was fucking her with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cPlease please get up here!\u201d</p><p>He obliged and kissed her hard. He tasted like salt and fresh grass and her. She heard the bedside table drawer slide open and realized he was finding a condom by touch while kissing her so hard she was having trouble finding her breath.</p><p>She broke the kiss and said, \u201cLet me.\u201d She ripped the corner of the foil with her teeth, pulled out the condom, and grabbed his stiff dick. He shuddered like a horse and she eased her grip, then rolled the condom on.</p><p>He fell upon her like a starving animal, slid into her up to the hilt with no further formalities, and she wrapped her legs around his hips and pumped back at him stroke for stroke.</p><p>They surged together, kissing and scratching and writhing, and she was astonished to feel her orgasm closing in on her. It normally took quite a bit longer.</p><p>\u201cDry spell\u2019s over,\u201d she gasped, and in reply he pressed his face to her neck and thrust harder.</p><p>Then she was flying\u2014or, at least, it always seemed like that to her. Flying and free and soaring and going wherever she wanted to go.</p><p>\u201cJeffrey,\u201d she whispered, still feeling the internal quakes.</p><p>\u201cNicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again.\u201d</p><p>For reply he took a deep breath and she realized he was breathing in the scent of her hair, and the thought of such tenderness from a man who looked like a brute was all it took; she fell over the edge again, swooping and soaring.</p><p>Then he was stiffening in her arms, and then she slowly settled back to the planet.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>\u201cN o. No! No damned way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. Don\u2019t be like that, Big Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut! I mean it! The detail has orders to shoot to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to feel wanted.\u201d</p><p>He gave her the scowl that sent most people scurrying for cover, but that just made her grin widen. \u201cBad enough I have to put up with you during the course of my business day. But I refuse\u2014refuse\u2014to put up with you during my own time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re in your office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews flash, Dragon: I can be in any of these rooms I want. It\u2019s my fucking house. Plus, this is my time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so, Big Al. Kings don\u2019t get time off. Neither do their biographers, and let me tall ya, that\u2019s something they didn\u2019t mention in grad school. What\u2019re you doing, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking up porn on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaw! Like you don\u2019t have a battalion of underlings to fetch you all the porn you want. C\u2019mon, you know I\u2019ll drag it out of you after a while. Cough up, big guy. Watcha doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading Nicole\u2019s scripts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She came around the desk and peeked at his laptop. Today\u2019s suit was navy blue; the shoes were red Keds. He got a whiff of\u2014cookies?\u2014when she bent over to look.</p><p>\u201cDie Hard: Enough Is Enough,\u201d she read aloud. \u201cShe wrote this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRewrote. It\u2019s her\u2014it was her other job. Punching up scripts for Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many d\u2019you find so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice work, if you can get it. Hollywood\u2019s got the bucks t\u2019spare.\u201d Her hand was resting on his shoulder; he doubted she realized. Her soft, slim hand. The hand of a scholar. His hands were too big, too blocky, and riddled with calluses. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t skedaddle for L.A. when the shitstorm began.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a Baranov,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWe don\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>The Dragon was now drumming her fingers on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s of historical significance, doncha know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. But the other, too. We\u2019ve had royal poets and royal songwriters, but never a royal script writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a plague on me, not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, that\u2019s true enough, Big Al.\u201d She was staring down at him. Her curls framed her face in a dark red cloud. \u201cI guess I can wait until you kick it before being a plague on her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, well, the way this month is going, that\u2019s gonna happen sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that,\u201d she said, taking off her glasses, \u201cwould be a pure d-shame.\u201d</p><p>And then she leaned down and kissed him softly on the mouth.</p> <p>Chapter 38</p><p>T he Dragon, well used to being tossed out of the king\u2019s office, took the whole thing with her usual equanimity. The important thing was, she had finally done what she\u2019d fantasized about for the past three years.</p><p>Al was gonna be a tough nut to crack. Scuttlebutt had it he was still in love with the late, treacherous Queen Dara. But she was a historian, and took the long view. He\u2019d come around eventually.</p><p>Besides, who\u2019d be able to refuse a chance at her? She was smart, she was sexy, she had the ass of a twenty-five-year-old.</p><p>Hmm. Perhaps she was getting a little obsessed with her own ass. Something for her shrink to work on; they could forget about her traumatizing freshmen year of college for a while.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Al had said, escorting her out of his office with a firm hand in the middle of her back. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this.\u201d</p><p>She tried to drag her feet, but the sucker was as strong as he was big. \u201cWhy the hell not, Big Al?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019d be like the Road Runner doing the Coyote. A crime against all the laws of nature. Also, you\u2019re fired again.\u201d</p><p>Then the detail drove her back to her hotel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Big Al,\u201d she said aloud, chowing down on fairly awful barbecued ribs. Why she bought BBQ North of Missouri she didn\u2019t know. The Daily Show was on\u2014fake history! Hurrah!\u2014and she was sitting cross-legged in her lonely bed.</p><p>Did the big oaf think she kept coming back to write his memoirs, for the luvva Pete? She\u2019d been gone the day she met him. Big, gruff, great-looking, with the energy of a man half his age and the vocabulary of a sailor. She\u2019d been gone at that moment; her love only deepened with each firing.</p> <p>Because the Dragon was tired of being alone.</p><p>And Big Al was, too. Poor sucker just didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>Then she ordered another platter from room service. Scheming always made her hungry.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>\u201cN icole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go.\u201d</p> <p>She stretched, then curled back against him like a sleepy kitten. \u201cToo tired.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair, running his fingers through the silky strands. He was still having trouble digesting the events of the past forty minutes.</p><p>Nicole\u2014the Princess\u2014had snuck out. Again. Had come to him. Tried to persuade him to the absurd notion that this week she wasn\u2019t royalty and he wasn\u2019t a bodyguard. And then she\u2019d\u2014and then he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>But she was still here. And that was a problem.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Yes, it was.</p><p>\u201cNicole.\u201d He shook her gently. \u201cYou have to get dressed. I have to take you back. If they notice you\u2019re gone, everyone will go right out of their minds.\u201d</p><p>She yawned, rolled over, and stroked his penis, which went from sleepy to extremely interested in about two seconds. \u201cSo? Oh, hey, is this for me?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and pulled away from her. \u201cYou\u2019d frighten your family just to get laid again?\u201d</p><p>She jerked away from him and sat up. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like my family,\u201d she said sullenly. \u201cMy mother was my family. My father was just a two-week party for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d He rose, strapped on his wristwatch, then walked around the room gathering the clothes that hadn\u2019t been ruined. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You fuck me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you fucked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and then kick me out? Jeffrey, your pillow talk sucks.\u201d \u201cSucks\u201d was punctuated as she hurled a pillow at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go back,\u201d he said stonily, ignoring the inner voice that begged to differ. Ignoring the urge to take her back to bed and never, ever let her go. \u201cRight now. We\u2019re done talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right we are,\u201d she hissed, and climbed out of his bed.</p><p>He tried to help her with her clothes, but she slapped his hands away and nearly burned his eyes out of his skull with the force of her glare.</p><p>He drove her back, his heart growing heavier the closer they got to the palace. She was fuming in the passenger seat, arms folded over her chest, scowling at the road.</p><p>He got her as close as he could to her suite without actually driving across the lawn. As she got out, he leaned over and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do this again, Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...worry!\u201d \u201cWorry\u201d was punctuated with the door slamming.</p><p>He rested his head on the steering wheel, and it was a good five minutes before he could turn the car around.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>N icole found her way into the palace via a little-used servants\u2019 entrance. Oh, Nicky\u2019s digital map had been a godsend. She was able to slip inside and make it back to her suite in fifteen minutes.</p><p>Where an astonished Natalia watched her approach her own closed door. \u201cYour Highness! I didn\u2019t\u2014what are you\u2014how did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things,\u201d she said, her body still tingling from Jeffrey\u2019s urgent touch, \u201cwill never be told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Natalia.\u201d</p><p>The blonde bowed. \u201cHighness.\u201d</p><p>Nicole shut the door behind her, taking in the three-room suite at a glance. Private bathroom, sitting room decorated in shades of gold and red, deluxe bedroom decorated in gold and blue. Stuffed with furniture so old and expensive she was afraid to use any of it.</p><p>Except the bed. The bed might be an antique four poster, too, but it was sturdy enough. And a good thing, too, because she had every intention of throwing herself on it and crying for an hour or so.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>E xhausted from a sleepless night and too tired for breakfast, Nicole staggered into the hall outside her room.</p><p>Natalia bowed. \u201cGood morning, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Cof\u2014\u201d Natalia was already handing her a cup. \u201cNatalia, whoever programmed you did a helluva job.\u201d</p><p>Natalia didn\u2019t twitch. \u201cYes, Highness. The king would like to see you, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta see the king? Now? Great. I have no friggin\u2019 idea how to get there from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t, Highness?\u201d</p><p>Nicole stared at her bodyguard suspiciously. Natalia didn\u2019t blink. In fact, Nicole\u2019s eyes were watering with sympathy as the seconds ticked by and Natalia still didn\u2019t blink. \u201cYou got something on your mind, Natalia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, super. You mind walking me over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Highness.\u201d The blonde tapped her earpiece. \u201cHunter to see Warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow too fucking G.I. Joe,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Highness.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they were in the hallway outside the king\u2019s office. She was pretty sure. All the damn hallways looked the same to her.</p><p>A man she\u2019d never seen was leaning on the wall, arms crossed, but he stood straight and tall when she approached, then bowed.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to talk to the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess Nicole, he\u2019s expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanding off Hunter,\u201d Natalia said with cool formality.</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged. Go get an early lunch, Natty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir. Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHanding off?\u201d she asked the man. He sure didn\u2019t look like a bodyguard: slim, shorter than she was, soberly dressed, small hands. He looked like he was Edmund\u2019s assistant or something. \u201cWhat am I, a relay baton?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHardly, Princess.\u201d He touched his index finger to the corner of his left eyebrow. \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d</p><p>She rapped on the door with her knuckles and at the harried, \u201cCome in, quick!\u201d opened the door and walked in.</p><p>The king was on his feet, staring anxiously over her shoulder. \u201cAre you alone? Is she out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dragon! I know she\u2019s lurking around here somewhere, just waiting to\u2014never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she isn\u2019t lurking in the corridor. Are you okay? You look a little stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStressed,\u201d he mumbled, \u201cis not the word. You\u2019re sure nobody\u2019s out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some guy I never saw before. What can I do for you, Al?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, kiddo.\u201d He slumped back into his chair. \u201cIs \u2018Dad\u2019 so hard? Pop? Papa?\u201d</p><p>She yawned and sat across from him. \u201cIs that why you called me up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, naw.\u201d He waved away her irritation. \u201cJust an early morning observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks so much. You\u2019re not exactly looking your best, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the best shape of any one of you guys,\u201d the king bragged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to be,\u201d she admitted, \u201cto run this funny farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, maybe you should see Doc Hedman. Alexandria was having terrible insomnia a couple years ago and he was able to help her out. This was before she got married to Sheldon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she cried, and was surprised when the king flinched. She didn\u2019t think he could flinch. \u201cSheldon Rivers. That\u2019s the American who married Alexandria. She\u2019s with him now, right? At some aquarium or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he didn\u2019t marry her, she married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say tomato, I say toe-maw-toe. Anyway, it was driving me nuts, trying to remember another relative\u2019s name. You\u2019re a big bunch to keep track of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019m a fertile son of a bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She covered her eyes. \u201cPlease, Al. I\u2019m begging you. We\u2019re headed for overshare country.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He had a great laugh, booming and kingly. She looked up at him and smiled in spite of herself. Then took a closer look and lost her smile. \u201cYou look more than a little stressed. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s nothing for you to worry about. I called you up here for two things\u2014thanks for coming so quickly, by the way. Thing one, how are you doing? Do you need anything? To put it another way\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, because English is my ninth language.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014shaddup\u2014are you not getting something you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food\u2019s great, everybody\u2019s nice, I don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause speaking of Sheldon, you might want to talk to him. The last thing that guy ever wanted was to be a prince. But he sucked it up. And you think Christina wanted to be the Queen of Alaska? Ever? You could learn a lot from those two weirdos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d She sipped her coffee.</p> <p>\u201cWe were, ah, surprised when you didn\u2019t dine with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed some time alone.\u201d In fact, she\u2019d skipped the dinner with Christina, too, and felt horribly guilty. Well, she\u2019d track her down today and apologize.</p><p>She leaned forward, rattled by the hurt look in his eyes. That\u2019s all she seemed to do these days: hurt the men in her life. \u201cYou gotta try to understand, Al. It was me and mom, and then it was me. I fish and hunt for a living. I like the quiet. I love the solitude. And here, I don\u2019t have either. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel claustrophobic in here, but I do. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, how can we do better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice offer, but it\u2019s me, not you guys. I\u2019m the one who has to adjust. I\u2019m the one who has to change. I wouldn\u2019t have sat for the DNA test if I wasn\u2019t reconciled to that. And none of it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be argued that all of it\u2019s my fault.\u201d She opened her mouth, but he rushed forward. \u201cNicole, I friggin\u2019 hate seeing you unhappy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not much fun on this end, either.\u201d But she took the sting out of her words with a small grin. \u201cYou said you had two reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve really got a gift. I\u2019ve been reading some of the scripts you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she practically screamed. Al reared back in his chair. \u201cOh, God, tell me, tell me you didn\u2019t read any of the dreck I wrote for Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you saved a bunch of movies! Killing Cardinals had a totally different, sucky ending according to the trades. And you single-handedly rescued the dialogue for I\u2019m Okay, You\u2019re Insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just to pay the bills, Al. It\u2019s not art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought it was pretty nifty, swifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, the humiliation never stops around here, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not. You know, if you ever thought about writing a book...\u201d</p> <p>A book. A fishing guide. Her mother\u2019s story. Her story. Sure, she\u2019d thought about it. But who had the time?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not implying I\u2019d have all this leisure time to write, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. If it\u2019s something you wanted to do, there\u2019s not much in your way. It\u2019s not like you have to spend your creativity fixing other people\u2019s words. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s...an interesting perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got tons of perspective,\u201d he bragged. \u201cI got it running out of me like...stuff that runs out of me. By the way, three American movie studios have called here looking for you. They want to buy the rights to your story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. When I was a lonely hack they wouldn\u2019t return my calls. Now they want to toss money at me and make a movie out of my life. Pass.\u201d She rose from her seat. \u201cStill, you\u2019ve given me something to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at shit like that,\u201d he said, lacing his fingers beside his head. \u201cG\u2019wan, get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He was leaning forward in his chair and looking anxious. \u201cLook first and tell me; is the Dragon out there?\u201d</p><p>Nicole opened the door and checked both ends of the corridor, waving to the short bodyguard. Then she went back inside. \u201cCoast is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m dying for some scrambled eggs. Had a conference call so I didn\u2019t eat with the kids today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten yet. We could eat together. Unless it\u2019s a working breakfast or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no! It\u2019s not a working breakfast. Yeah, that\u2019d be great. Come on, I\u2019ll show you one of the prettiest rooms in the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to sign bills into law or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an inspiration to us all,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI assume this means that when I\u2019m queen, I can constantly blow off my work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I care? I\u2019ll be worm food by then. Come on, let\u2019s get out of here before Edmund brings me more work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bastard,\u201d she agreed, and followed him out the door.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>T he king watched Nicole pick at her eggs and ham, and drink cup after cup of black coffee. Something was wrong, and he didn\u2019t think it was just the events of her birthright coming to light.</p><p>No, it was something else.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the eggs, we can get you something else.\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just not very hungry, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you gotta eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d she replied, obviously anxious to change the subject. \u201cThis is the prettiest room in the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d was a solarium on the east side, second floor. The entire east wall was one big window. It was warm in there even in the middle of January. It was one of the few rooms that didn\u2019t have a fireplace. Thanks to the greenhouse effect, it didn\u2019t need one.</p><p>\u201cYup. Used to do my homework in here when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to picture you as a little boy,\u201d she teased. \u201cI bet you were more of a handful than Nicky is.\u201d</p><p>Al groaned. \u201cThat kid is the punishment for all my sins. Karma\u2019s a bitch, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should write greeting cards. That\u2019s quite a poetic touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we can\u2019t all be professional writers-for-hire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Speaking of writers, what\u2019d the Dragon do to freak you out? And didn\u2019t you fire her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fired her eleven times,\u201d he said gloomily, still running hot and cold every time he remembered her mouth on his, her hands pressing his shoulders, her skirt riding up as she sat in his lap. \u201cShe keeps coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you could make her stay away if you really wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2014I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes you, you know.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>She shrugged and forked up some egg. \u201cJust sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her project, not her\u2014her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Al, I\u2019m calling bullshit. You think she keeps coming back for the privilege of writing down your old war stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re not talking about this. Besides, I\u2014in my heart, I\u2019m still married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen Dara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014did you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the first person I loved more than myself. And then she gave me amazing children. Even if I hated her, I\u2019d honor her for that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Al. It\u2019s been so long. Fifteen years or so, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive or take,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to be alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you?\u201d</p><p>He could see he\u2019d shocked her with the observation. She stammered for a few seconds, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou can get married again. But in my whole life, I\u2019ll only have one mother.\u201d She bowed her head. \u201cShe knew me better than anyone. She could have gotten me through this. I\u2019d give everything I had, and everything you have, just to talk to her one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole\u2014honey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I just miss her so much!\u201d she cried, and sobbed into her hands.</p><p>Al was out of his seat in half a second, patting her on the shoulder. \u201cNicole, honey, it gets easier, I promise it does. Not just adjusting to us. The grief. It won\u2019t always be a killing thing. I swear to you, you\u2019ll miss her forever, but eventually you\u2019ll only think of the good, never the bad.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against his hip. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard, Dad. I didn\u2019t think it would be so hard.\u201d</p><p>So he comforted her, as he had comforted the tears of all his children. And though Nicole never remembered the first time she called him Dad, the king never forgot.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>\u201cT here you are, Big Al!\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s hands jerked. Papers flew. \u201cGaaahhh!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream, my king, we only just got your office door fixed,\u201d Edmund begged. He turned. \u201cGood morning, Ms. Bragon. No, no, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he told the out-of-breath bodyguard. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d He shut the door. \u201cSomething to drink, Ms. Bragon? Coffee? Juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just drink in the sight of the glorious king of Alaska, if y\u2019all don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Al rested his head on his desk.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Edmund admitted, \u201cbut frankly I can\u2019t imagine anyone being that thirsty. I\u2019ll leave you to your work, ma\u2019am.

You\u2019re fired. And banned! And fired. Go away or I\u2019ll yell rape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never.\u201d She plopped down in her usual seat. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re passing up the incredible opportunity I\u2019m throwing in your kingly lap. You out of your mind, boy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been a boy since I was four. And complications like that, I do not need. Besides, I have to focus on Nicole. And David! Poor kid\u2019s out of a job and he doesn\u2019t know whether to shit or go blind. And Nicky. He\u2019s been way too quiet lately; I don\u2019t trust that budding psychopath. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re takin\u2019 care of ever\u2019body, Al. \u2019Cept yourself, o\u2019course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me your hideous brand of psychology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkey-dokey. How about I just plant another smacker on that kingly snoot?\u201d</p><p>He actually cringed back. Her grin widened. Oh, this was gonna be fun. She\u2019d held her feelings in for three years before realizing that was no way to catch the King of Alaska. Now he was going to pay for every soulful look she\u2019d given him, every natural impulse she\u2019d squashed, every time she\u2019d betrayed her feelings.</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t molest me again,\u201d he begged. \u201cI can\u2019t take any more this week. I absolutely can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me about Nicole\u2019s mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s blackmail, you horrible horrible thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-yup. It\u2019s also called getting the job done.\u201d Impersonal as a secretary, she took out her notebook. \u201cSo, talk. You\u2019re s\u2019posed to be getting married. You take off. You go to a bar and order a drink. Or maybe your detail does. Either way, you meet the bartender. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd none of your damn business!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put your big, smelly, fishy hands all over her boobs and make her moan like a donkey?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it, stop it!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit her with the old \u2018hey, baby, mind if I knock you up with an illegitimate daughter\u2019 line?\u201d</p><p>He was actually banging his head on the desk. \u201cHate you. Hate you. Hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaw! You love me, Big Al. You just won\u2019t admit it. Anyway, back to Nicole\u2019s conception. When the condom broke, did you pretend you\u2019d had a vasectomy? Or did you just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie! Die, die!\u201d</p><p>She jotted it all down and managed to needle him for another ten minutes before he gave up and threw her out.</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>\u201cD amn, Christina, you can cook! Here all I thought you were good for was throwing sucker punches.\u201d</p> <p>Christina, who had been starting to smile, changed tactics and frowned. Dara gurgled with joy as she watched the play of emotions on her mother\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cEat your applesauce,\u201d she told her daughter. To Nicole, \u201cF-U-C-K Y-O-U-R-S-E-L-F.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, what\u2019s fook yr lelf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d David said, not bothering to hold back his laughter, \u201cshe\u2019s already starting to read. Spelling out your colorful vocabulary will work for maybe another six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see all the parent\u2013teacher conferences now,\u201d Nicole teased. She forked in more linguine with clams\u2014clams that had been in the ocean that very morning\u2014and chased it with a glass of milk. \u201cYour Highness, the littlest Highness called me a B-I-T-C-H today, and while I\u2019m obliged to obey her, I feel she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just stop,\u201d Christina groaned, sitting back down. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen my job here is done. Seriously, this is the best pasta I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Christina and David waited for the follow-up insult.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. That\u2019s all I was gonna say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Dara sang, big blue eyes gleaming, applesauce drooling down her chin. She blotted it with her own napkin. \u201cN\u2019cole, are you going to live here forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I\u2019m trapped, just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are,\u201d David assured her.</p><p>\u201cHooray!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw. Dara, you\u2019ve got your mother\u2019s lungs but, fortunately, your father\u2019s intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I invite her to dinner?\u201d the princess asked the prince.</p><p>\u201cBecause essentially, you\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>Christina sighed. \u201cI was afraid that was why.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>A t ten o\u2019clock that night came the long-awaited knock on his door.</p><p>Jeffrey didn\u2019t get up to answer it. \u201cGo back to the palace, Nicole!\u201d</p><p>More knocking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you in, Nicole!\u201d</p><p>Insistent pounding. He ignored it and sipped his milk. No Scotch tonight, by God. Once this week was enough. She\u2019d eventually take the hint and go away. Find another lover. And he didn\u2019t care. Not even remotely.</p><p>The knocking stopped and he gritted his teeth so he wouldn\u2019t leap out of his chair, kick his own door down, haul her into his apartment by the hair, and do her on the living room carpet.</p><p>It had been a mistake. And he never made the same mistake twice. No matter how delectable. No matter how softly she moaned his name in his ear. No matter how\u2014</p><p>No matter.</p><p>He had decided she had taken the hint when the car battery crashed through the sliding glass doors leading to the back lawn.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Nicole said cheerfully, picking her way through the broken glass. \u201cDid you know your neighbors have the most interesting garbage? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to put those in the garbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreeze!\u201d he roared, and she froze. Then he set down his milk glass, crunched across the glass, picked her up in his arms, and carried her to the glass-free zone. Then he set her down. Or tried to. The trouble was, she\u2019d been kissing his ear while he carried her, and the throbbing between his legs told him he had about five seconds before he gave up the battle.</p><p>\u201cNicole, I never make the same\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to take care of myself with my fingers this morning,\u201d she whispered into the ear she\u2019d been kissing. \u201cThat\u2019s how much I missed you.\u201d</p><p>He ran with her into the bedroom.</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>T hey didn\u2019t make it as far as the bed. They made it as far as the hallway. Then he lowered her to the carpet and commenced yanking her clothes off.</p><p>Nicole did her best to help, and supposed she should be frightened by his urgency, but the truth was, it thrilled her, warmed her to her toes and\u2014and other places. It kindled her own lust, made her feel closer to him, closer to him than she had been with anybody. She\u2019d had one-night stands. In college she had dated the same guy for a year and a half. In her twenties, the occasional dalliance or relationship doomed to fail.</p><p>But all of it together couldn\u2019t equal the passion the two of them were generating in a cramped, dark hallway on a first-floor apartment in Juneau, Alaska, twenty-two miles from her ancestral home.</p><p>He pulled. She tugged. He yanked. She pressed. He kissed her again and again, her eyes, her throat, her breasts. She begged. He shoved. Then he was inside her, sliding in with sweet, delicious friction, and she came almost at once, bucking and jerking against him; then he was shuddering over her, and then he collapsed on top of her.</p><p>\u201cUlf,\u201d she managed, before his weight drove all the air out of her lungs. Quietly suffocating, she beat him on the shoulder until he rolled off her with a groan. \u201cOh, sweet Jesus! I can breathe again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that \u2018shut up, Your Highness\u2019?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNot in my apartment. Here, it\u2019s Nicole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, he unclenches!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, if you take another lover, I\u2019ll kill him, then you, then myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet!\u201d</p><p>He pressed his palms to his eyes. She could see the sweat gleaming on his body, could smell his good clean smell, and wanted him all over again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I hate you or love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d She snuggled against him. \u201cCan\u2019t you do both?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>\u201cB ig Al! Where you been hiding all day?\u201d</p><p>Holly had to stifle a laugh as she saw the Alaskan monarch flinch away from her. It felt like she\u2019d been prowling around the palace half the night. The detail didn\u2019t tell her shit; they viewed her as some sort of extra-annoying reporter.</p><p>\u201cGet lost,\u201d Al said rudely. \u201cI got enough on my plate without you getting even more annoying. Which I didn\u2019t think was possible, until this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRack \u2019em up,\u201d she told him. \u201cBowling\u2019s no fun for just one.\u201d</p><p>So he did. And then he beat her ass so badly at bowling she fumed for ten minutes before challenging him to a rematch.</p><p>\u201cHolly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Big Al, I\u2019m lining up a split that will humiliate the Alaskan monarchy until the end of time.\u201d She was holding up her bright purple bowling ball and measuring the distance. She let fly and knew the second the ball left her hand that it was good. She jumped up and down as the last four pins went over with a clatter, giving her the game. \u201cBoo-ya! That\u2019s what a good ole Texas whuppin\u2019 feels like, Big Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he said sullenly, marking down the score.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one for you and one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I can count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go for the tie breaker? U. S. of A. versus Alaska, winner take all?\u201d</p><p>He brightened. \u201cWhat are the stakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWellllll...tell you what. I win, I get to take you to bed.\u201d</p><p>He reddened, but his blue eyes narrowed and he studied her with a look she had seen a thousand times from men of all ages. \u201cAnd what do I get if I win?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy, the very same thing!\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed.

And thank goodness.\u201d</p><p>He rested a finger on her nose. He leaned in and whispered, \u201cDid you know your accent gets thicker when you\u2019re nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh, does not. I\u2019m from Texas; nothin\u2019 has scared us since the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet your royal ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolly, the queen and I\u2014our relationship was very complicated.

Now rack \u2019em up.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>E dmund Dante smoothed his perfectly smooth suit jacket, patted his unmussed hair, flicked imaginary lint off his shoulder, then left his rooms and strolled toward the west kitchens.</p><p>He courteously greeted every staff member by name and received battalions of \u201cGood morning, Mr. Dante,\u201d and \u201cHi, Edmund,\u201d and \u201cGood morning, sir,\u201d greetings as he went. He stopped one of the chambermaids, fresh from maternity leave, and asked after the baby. He stopped one of Prince Alexander\u2019s footmen and asked how his ailing mother was doing.</p><p>He knew everyone. He knew everything. The smallest detail did not escape him. All was right with the world.</p><p>After observing the kitchen staff for a minute, it was obvious there had been no last-minute disasters and breakfast would be served on time, which today meant 8:00 A.M. That gave him an hour and a half to read everyone\u2019s schedules, wake the king, and be debriefed by the detail.</p><p>Yes, it would be close.</p><p>He turned to leave, only to hear, \u201cEdmund!\u201d</p> <p>He turned back, and deftly caught the orange one of the cooks had tossed him. \u201cPut it in your pocket for luck,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cKnowing you, it\u2019s all you\u2019ll eat today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Carrie. And good morning.\u201d</p><p>He found his way to the king\u2019s chambers, picking up the schedules from his office on the way. Nothing out of the ordinary here, either, and that was very well. In fact, a refreshing change\u2014no outside visitors, except for Miss Holly Call-Me-Dragon. Ah, poor King Alexander. She was his cross to bear.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Reynolds. All well, I trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quiet night,\u201d Reynolds replied. He looked exceptionally cheerful for a normally stone-faced detail man. \u201cFor the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Quiet. For the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynolds, are you quite all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite, Mr. Dante.\u201d Reynolds fished out his two-way. \u201cBookman to see Warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I have your permission to enter, Mr. Reynolds?\u201d Not that he needed it. There wasn\u2019t a single room in the palace off limits to him; he had played here as a child and they all knew it. Still, the courtesies must be observed. That was no surprise, either.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Edmund sighed with satisfaction. No surprises. A place for everything and everything in its place. The sun rose in the east and set in the west. The schedules were constantly updated but always correct.</p><p>He rapped twice and opened the door.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>And did something he had never done in the service of his king: He shouted, \u201cOh my God, what are you two doing?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>N atalia was new to the detail and wasn\u2019t sure she liked it. Granted, it was the highest honor offered by the Alaskan military. And granted, she had worked hard to get here.</p><p>But her charge, Princess Nicole, was sneaking out at night. The king had, inexplicably, begun sleeping with the Dragon. Jeffrey, the detail\u2019s rock, was on vacation.</p><p>And the woman in charge of Christina\u2019s detail confided that she suspected the Crown Princess was pregnant. Like any of them wanted to go on that wild ride again. She hadn\u2019t been there at the time, but she\u2019d heard all the rumors.</p><p>The detail was famous for it; one man\u2019s gossip was another woman\u2019s way to better protect her charge.</p><p>Now here came Mr. Dante, looking\u2014say it isn\u2019t so\u2014rattled.</p><p>\u201cNatalia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king\u2014the king\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas there been a schedule update, sir?\u201d she asked, playing dumb.</p><p>\u201cDamn right there has!\u201d the man nearly screamed, then got hold of himself. \u201cForgive me. I\u2014I haven\u2019t had breakfast yet. My blood sugar is low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might try eating that orange in your pocket,\u201d she said helpfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, I might. Is the princess in?\u201d</p><p>And that was the sticky spot. Because she had no idea whether Nicole was in there or not. She hadn\u2019t heard her leave. But she never did. And Nicole hadn\u2019t come past her to get back in. It was shameful to be ready to open a door and have no idea whether her charge was in there or not.</p><p>\u201cI...think so.\u201d</p><p>The sweaty, stressed Edmund started to snap a response, then took a deep breath. \u201cNatalia, please don\u2019t worry. The princess can take care of herself, as she has demonstrated again and again. And she\u2019s sneaking off to visit Jeff. So even when you don\u2019t know where she is, she\u2019s in good hands.\u201d</p><p>Natalia felt her mouth pop open in surprise and almost broke Rule Number One with a whispered, \u201cHow...\u201d Because nobody ever asked how Mr. Dante knew everything. He just did.</p><p>And he was kind enough to pretend he hadn\u2019t noticed her blunder.</p><p>So she didn\u2019t announce him or anything when he tapped on Princess Nicole\u2019s door and at the clear, \u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d entered.</p><p>She spoke into her two-way. \u201cBookman to see Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged.\u201d</p><p>Then she leaned against the wall, wondering what else was in store for the detail in the weeks to come. God knew, it had been a madhouse since the king got the famous letter.</p><p>She wondered what was in store for them all next, and found she couldn\u2019t wait to see.</p><p>That was the trick, the others had told her. That was how they got you. They were a big, merry bunch of troublemakers, and they pulled everyone into their madness.</p><p>Natalia checked to make sure the corridor was empty, then smiled, something that would have shocked the already shell-shocked palace inhabitants.</p><p>Chapter 50</p><p>N icole was surprised to see a clearly rattled Mr. Dante walk into her room. At least she\u2019d been in her room.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten smart after her first visit to Jeff and went to the most diabolical source she knew.</p><p>Somehow, within twenty minutes, Nicky had procured a three-story rope ladder that would hold up to 320 pounds. So she no longer had to walk past Natalia when she returned; she just scurried back up the black ladder, which was downright invisible at night.</p><p>She was still wearing last night\u2019s outfit. Hopefully, Mr. Dante wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>Oh, who was she kidding? He noticed everything.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want something? Natalia rustles up a mean cup of coffee, no matter how many times I tell her to quit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Highness.\u201d</p><p>She gestured for him to have a seat, but he ignored her. She couldn\u2019t help but be curious; what was he doing here? And what was wrong? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ah\u2014that is\u2014the king\u2014I have\u2014I have been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! You\u2019d better sit down. You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfinitely worse,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cAnd I pray I never see such a sight again. Princess, I have been remiss.\u201d</p><p>She was having a hard time following the conversation. Well, it was early. And Edmund was clearly in the middle of a cerebral hemorrhage. \u201cYou\u2019ve what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI neglected to explain the nature of your security detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re the only one who needed to leave the palace for an assignation?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, do you think you would be here if royals couldn\u2019t sneak away for a little fun now and again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, um, hadn\u2019t occurred to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wonder of wonders, he actually interrupted her. \u201cLet your detail help you. If you wish to visit Jeffrey, Natalia will take you. And she would never tell the king. Just as the king would never\u2014never mind.\u201d</p><p>There was no point in playing dumb, so she didn\u2019t bother. \u201cBut Jeffrey is my detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that poses a problem, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she felt the urge to unburden herself. To tell him everything. She spoke to him like she would her mother. \u201cHe says while I\u2019m in his apartment I\u2019m just Nicole. But what about when he comes back from vacation? He won\u2019t be with me while he\u2019s on duty...and the detail considers themselves on duty twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t begrudge them their devotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s begrudging? It just makes my life more difficult, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to what you\u2019re doing to Natalia,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHey! I didn\u2019t ask for any of this, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. You didn\u2019t want. You weren\u2019t ready.

Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>He shoved the Dragon off his lap and she went willingly enough. Then he yelled, \u201cYou harpy, get the hell out of my office!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Big Al. All I want to know is how you met Princess Nicole\u2019s mother. You gotta admit that\u2019s historically significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! There\u2019s historically significant and there\u2019s none of your damned business! Guess which this is?\u201d</p><p>Alexandria walked in. \u201cYou two aren\u2019t fooling anyone. We all know you did the beast with two backs last night.\u201d</p><p>The king and the Dragon gaped at the princess.</p><p>\u201cWell, we do,\u201d she said mildly, perching on the arm of one of the chairs. \u201cDad\u2019s detail knew, then Edmund knew, then the whole detail knew, and Nicky\u2019s been patching into their two-way since he learned how to hack, and he told all of us at breakfast, at which you were conspicuously absent, Dad, and I shudder to think why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to strangle my youngest,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. It\u2019s only such a big deal because we\u2019re happy for you. You\u2019ve been alone too long.\u201d Alexandria, a breathtaking brunette with the standard-issue Baranov blue eyes, smiled at Holly. \u201cGranted, your choice was kind of a surprise, but still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo goddamned privacy in my own house,\u201d he grumped.</p><p>\u201cWell, Dad. Did you think she kept coming back to write more deathless prose about signing the Conservation Act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did everyone know why you kept coming back except me?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cuz you\u2019re a dumbass, Big Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to kick this broad out, Alex? Is this private business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but she\u2019ll have to know eventually. Get ready to be a grandfather again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He jumped up and swung his daughter around in a hug that left her breathless. Then, \u201cOh shit! Sorry. You\u2019re not gonna puke, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, I imagine so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Alex,\u201d Holly said, smiling broadly.</p><p>\u201cJust when I thought I couldn\u2019t take one more surprise, you lay this egg in my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost literally,\u201d Alex added, then giggled. \u201cAnother kid who\u2019ll think nothing of their grandpa being on all the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days. I flew to the States to tell Sheldon, then hopped a transport back here. Shel will be here later today. Anyway, I\u2019m due in November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you tell that bum first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s the father, Dad. I\u2019m pretty sure. Kidding! Don\u2019t throw anything at me. In fact, I\u2019ll leave you two alone so you can have more old people sex.\u201d She shivered all over. \u201cYou know what? Maybe I will throw up.\u201d Then she left, closing the door firmly behind her.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Grandpa,\u201d Holly said.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever call me Grandpa again, I\u2019ll fire you. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll chance it.\u201d She plopped back into his lap. \u201cSo, what\u2019s on today\u2019s agenda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire. Brimstone. Worlds colliding. I mean, I\u2019m doing the Dragon. Isn\u2019t that a sign of the Apocalypse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be, Al,\u201d she laughed, leaning down and planting a kiss on his mouth. \u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>He started to kiss her back, then pulled away and looked her right in her big brown eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not getting married again, Holly. Never, ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s askin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll never be queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d want the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were after me for my money. Or you were looking for a crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAl, I\u2019m after you, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Stop shivering! But your money and your crown don\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with it.\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got, ah, other qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been saying,\u201d he said smugly.</p><p>Chapter 52</p><p>N atalia was escorting Nicole to the nearest coffee shop\u2014she was hungry to get out of the palace\u2014when her two-way beeped. She spoke into it, then turned to Nicole.</p><p>\u201cRebel wants to meet with you. It sounds urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Highness, but if he had been hurt, I would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll go out some other time. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take me there; I have no idea where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Natalia. Bet you can\u2019t wait until Jeff gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting the seconds, Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a weird one, Natalia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Highness.\u201d</p><p>And in twenty minutes, she was knocking on Nicky\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cNicky? It\u2019s Nicole. Okay if I come in?\u201d</p><p>At the muffled, \u201cYeah,\u201d she turned the knob and entered.</p><p>The sixteen-year-old was clearly waiting for her; the television was off and he wasn\u2019t playing video games. Just sitting on the couch and waiting, his hands dangling in his lap. He was growing so quickly his cuffs were an inch above his wrists.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s having sex again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, um, didn\u2019t have to tell me that. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014I think he\u2019s ready to let my mother go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Listen, Nicky, I know it\u2019s awful and revolting to think about, but grown-ups have needs, even ancient doddering grown-ups like our father. It doesn\u2019t mean he loved your mother any less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I think he\u2019s officially over her now. So I can finally talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She sat down in the easy chair across from him. \u201cHon, I\u2019m not up to a birds and bees chat. Last time was bad enough.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019m sixteen, not six. I know all about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said, amused.</p><p>\u201cBut I wanted to show you this.\u201d He handed her a piece of paper, one that looked awfully familiar. She had seen one just like it not long ago, it was her\u2014</p><p>\u201cThese are the results from my DNA test,\u201d Nicky explained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014oh. How did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard the rumors. Everybody has. Dad just won\u2019t hear them, and won\u2019t let anyone talk to me about them, or him. He was the guardian of her memory, I guess. But she\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m too old to be taken care of anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you on that last one,\u201d she said fervently, still trying to make sense of the numbers and words on the paper. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-five and I\u2019m way way too old to be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Nicole, and this is about me, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Dr. Hedman had to take Dad\u2019s blood. And your blood. And then I cornered him and ordered him to take my blood and run the same test. See, always before, Dad wouldn\u2019t allow the test. He sure wouldn\u2019t cough up any of his blood for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you bullied Dr. Hedman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bully,\u201d he corrected her sharply, sitting up straighter and looking like the prince he was. \u201cI commanded. And he did as I asked. That piece of paper says I am not a blood relation to the king. None.\u201d He paused, obviously struggling to keep his composure. \u201cMy mother was a queen. And she was a liar and a betrayer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicole bit her lower lip. \u201cI see.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cWell, two things. We can\u2019t ever know what was going on with Queen Dara. Maybe she fell in love. Maybe she was lonely. Maybe she made a mistake and was sorry later. Don\u2019t let that stupid piece of paper ruin your good memories of her. My\u2014our father told me that the pain of a loved one\u2019s death goes away, leaving good memories. And that\u2019s what you have of your mom, Nicky. The good memories.\u201d</p><p>Impassively, he said, \u201cYou said two things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you understand that in Dad\u2019s heart you\u2019ll be his son until the planets cave in on themselves.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled thinly. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second time you\u2019ve called him Dad since you came in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it? I hadn\u2019t realized.\u201d Hmm. That was weird. It had sort of slipped out without her noticing.</p><p>\u201cBut see, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a changeling child, and now I know why. But it\u2019s okay. I think it was time for me to stop wondering and find out for sure. And I could only do that because of you. I think...I think I was meant to find out the king wasn\u2019t my father because part of me knew you were coming. With you here he still has the same number of children, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nicky, he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s got one more, that\u2019s all. Even if he knew, he\u2019d never disown you, never cast you out. You\u2019re his son and that\u2019s all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d The boy clenched his fists and tried to lock back the tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I should tell him or not. But since you went through this kind of thing not long ago, you\u2019re the only one I can talk to. The bastard princess. But what does that make me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis son, Nicky. That\u2019s what it makes you. As for this?\u201d She crumpled it in her fist and tossed it into the fireplace; then she got up, lit a match from the gold box on the mantel, and incinerated the DNA test into ash. \u201cIt\u2019s your business, Nicky, and no one else\u2019s. And I swear to you by my mother, I\u2019ll never tell. The bastard princess is a coward, but not a liar.\u201d</p><p>Nicky wiped his cheeks and said, surprised, \u201cYou\u2019re not a coward. I think you\u2019re very brave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not. But I\u2019m going to try to be. Damned if I\u2019ll be shamed by a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, sorry. Anyway, come on, Prince Nicky. I was headed into town for coffee when you beeped Natalia, but now I feel the need for Dairy Queen. Let\u2019s go drown our sorrows in thousands of calories.\u201d</p><p>Shyly, he took her hand, and brother and sister left the suite of the youngest Baranov, the bastard prince.</p><p>Chapter 53</p><p>J effrey Rodinov rose in the middle of the morning with his mind made up. He shaved, showered, dressed, and called the super to report the damage Nicole had done to the sliding glass door.</p><p>Then he drove to the palace, found Edmund, and tendered his resignation.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d was the reply, to his shock.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Dante, there are circumstances\u2014you don\u2019t understand\u2014my duty is conflicting with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe desire to impregnate Princess Nicole; yes; I gathered as much. Your resignation is not accepted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sir! I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it, Jeffrey; I absolutely can\u2019t take it!\u201d Edmund (horrors!) yelled. Jeffrey thought, The king died and nobody told me. That\u2019s the only reason Edmund Dante would ever raise his voice or forget to comb his hair.</p><p>\u201cSir, maybe you\u2019d better\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on a killing spree,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI am surrounded by people having irresponsible sex!\u201d</p><p>Shocked, Jeffrey had no reply.</p><p>Edmund visibly calmed himself. \u201cYour resignation is not accepted. For heaven\u2019s sake, Jeffrey, look around you. This is Alaska. The royals marry subjects all the time. The greatest queen our country has ever seen used to be a maid. Also, there is no rule that says a princess may not bone her bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey was shocked into silence by Edmund\u2019s use of the word bone as a verb.</p><p>\u201cNow, the king will give you nine kinds of holy hell about it, but that\u2019s your problem, not mine. Do you see the bags under my eyes, man? I cannot take another upheaval to the schedule. You will not quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Nicole\u2014I mean, Her Highness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014is at the Dairy Queen with the youngest prince. If you hurry, you can catch them.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey turned, already groping in his pockets for his car keys. \u201cWith all respect, this isn\u2019t over, Mr. Dante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith zero respect, it certainly is, Jeffrey. Best of luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a thousand yards from all right. Run along now.\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey ran along.</p><p>Jeffrey saw two detail automobiles parked in the driveway, and judging by all the citizens pressed to the windows, deduced Nicole was eating her ice cream inside one of the sedans.</p><p>He rapped on one dark window, which slowly slid down.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jeffrey!\u201d Prince Nicholas called. Nicole was sitting beside her brother, closest to the window. \u201cWant a cone? Is your vacation over already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Nicole asked, clearly surprised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that in a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d Nicholas continued. \u201cDad\u2019s having sex and Alex is pregnant. And Christina\u2019s been such a bitch lately we think she is, too. Isn\u2019t that the most terrifying news you\u2019ve ever heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this week, Highness. I\u2014wait. The king is what?\u201d He mentally shook himself. \u201cNever mind. Please excuse me.\u201d He pressed a button on his two-way and the locks disengaged. Then he opened the door and yanked Nicole out.</p><p>\u201cHey! My Peanut Buster Parfait!\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his and led her to the other sedan, rapped on the driver\u2019s side window, and said to Natalia, \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d She got out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to Natalia like that! Natalia, I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. In.\u201d</p><p>Nicole took a steadying breath, shrugged, and climbed into the backseat. He turned to Natalia and said, \u201cI\u2019ll need a few minutes of privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d was her almost-but-not-quite-sarcastic request as he got in and shut and locked the doors.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s easier ways to get a bite of my parfait,\u201d she informed him. Then she was juggling the plastic tub of ice cream as he crushed her to him and kissed her until he thought he might bruise her. Then he eased up.</p><p>\u201cNot that I mind, but this isn\u2019t exactly discreet, and I thought you were all about being\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me. Make me a prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re in love with me for my title?\u201d she teased, but he could tell she was rattled.</p><p>\u201cAll this time I\u2019ve been coming at it from the wrong end.\u201d</p><p>She reddened. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about what we tried later last night, I told you, that happens to every guy now and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reconcile my duty with one-night stands with the Crown Princess of Alaska. But I don\u2019t want a number of one-night stands, Nicole. I want you, for the rest of your life. And mine. Marry me and make me a prince, and as long as I\u2019m by your side, you\u2019ll never want for family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m kind of getting used to them. My family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He felt his heart actually shrink in his chest. Of course, the famous Baranov bounce: They came back from every shock, every disaster, stronger than ever. He should have known. She didn\u2019t need him. She had never needed him.</p><p>And he was a fool.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said stiffly, leaning away from her. \u201cThen you have no need of me, or my proposal, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, Jeffrey, I didn\u2019t say no, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole,\u201d he said stonily, \u201cdon\u2019t play with me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s playing? You\u2019re the one who keeps jumping to conclusions. Yes, I\u2019ll marry you. Yes, I\u2019ll make you a prince, and later, much much later by the grace of God, the King of Alaska.\u201d</p><p>She took another bite of her ice cream, chewed, and swallowed while his heart slowly resumed something resembling a normal rhythm. \u201cYou will? I mean, you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first I thought it was because you didn\u2019t sulk after I got the drop on you that first day. Then I thought it was because you kept coming back to my old fishing guide job. Then I thought it was because you\u2019re really really good in bed. But now I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she said, pausing to lick the spoon, \u201cit\u2019s because it\u2019s something my mother would have wanted for me. And I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re the best angler I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m pretty sure I fell in love with you when I watched you tie on that sinker the day we went fishing.\u201d</p><p>He slumped back in the seat with relief. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Then he gathered her in his arms, ignoring her squealed, \u201cI\u2019m spilling my parfait!\u201d and kissed her until they were both panting and covered with ice cream.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, pulling back to catch his breath. \u201cWho is the king having sex with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even ask, Jeffrey. You wouldn\u2019t believe it if I told you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 54</p><p>\u201cY ou\u2019re what?\u201d the king screamed.</p><p>\u201cGetting married. Oh, and having gobs of sex,\u201d Nicole added helpfully, ignoring Jeffrey\u2019s horrified groan.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve only known each other a fucking week!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFunny you should use the word fucking.

Dad, I\u2019m almost ready for bifocals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you possibly know\u2014no offense, Jeff\u2014how can you know this guy is the love of your life in a measly seven days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t,\u201d she assured her father. \u201cI\u2019m marrying him for his great big dick.\u201d</p><p>The king and Jeffrey groaned in unison.</p><p>There was a knock on the door, and the king screamed, \u201cGo away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Dad? You okay in there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, fuck. Come in, David.\u201d</p><p>The prince entered cautiously. \u201cHi.

Congratulations, Nicole. Welcome to the family, Jeffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019re hardly in a position to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m in a position to or not to do. I\u2019m the goddamned King of goddamned Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get that on a T-shirt like Christina has,\u201d Nicole suggested, \u201cbecause you seem to think nobody remembers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d The king buried his face in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re all out to get me. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know. I know things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, David, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I really need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, Nicole? Is there something you need help with? Because I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another knock. \u201cBig Al? You in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d he shouted. \u201cGo away and die!\u201d</p><p>The door opened and the Dragon sauntered in. \u201cAw, music to my ears, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me darlin\u2019, you horrible horrible thing. I\u2019m having the worst week. No offense, Nicole. Jeffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2018Dad\u2019?\u201d Nicole teased, laughing out loud as the king and Jeffrey flinched in unison.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I missed all the excitement.\u201d The Dragon smelled news; she came into the room with her eyes wide and her ears perked up. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t congratulate them! I haven\u2019t given my permission yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the permission of the sovereign and you know it,\u201d Nicole said coolly. \u201cNeither of us do. This isn\u2019t England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you pretend you\u2019re a little in awe of me?\u201d the king begged.</p><p>\u201cAw, we all are, Big Al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hush up. All you people are trying to drive me to a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m seriously thinking about abdicating to David.\u201d</p><p>The king pounded on his chest with a fist. \u201cAck! Here it comes! The fatal coronary!\u201d</p><p>David turned to stare at her, ignoring his father\u2019s cries of distress. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, think about it. I\u2019m not ready for this job. Dad\u2019s ancient, he could keel over any second. And there I\u2019d be, jammed into a job I\u2019ve had minimal training for. That\u2019s not good for the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeling over right now!\u201d the king gurgled.</p><p>\u201cAlthough I think Jeffrey would make a fine king,\u201d Nicole added thoughtfully, nodding approvingly at the Dragon as she solicitously pounded the king on the back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m too used to seeing the job from the other side of the desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole, I thought we agreed we were going to spring these things on your father one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planned this? To assassinate me by speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jeffrey, but then David walked in and it was kind of the perfect moment to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I still in the goddamned room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicole.\u201d David was frowning at them. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re the eldest. The crown is yours by right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop being so damn noble? I don\u2019t want it. Worse, I\u2019m not ready for it. Even worse? I\u2019m not worthy of it. You\u2019ve got twenty IQ points on me, and more than thirty years of experience. There\u2019s no contest. At all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the eldest,\u201d David repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, King of Alaska in the room. Maybe we should, I don\u2019t know, PRETEND I\u2019M IN CHARGE AND DISCUSS IT WITH ME?\u201d</p><p>It took twenty seconds for everyone\u2019s ears to stop ringing. And when they did, it was the Dragon who spoke. \u201cI know how to settle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Al warned. \u201cShe\u2019s dangerously insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should take care of this the American way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Have a revolution? Loosen the gun laws? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a poll. Ask the Alaskan people who they want running their lives when Al kicks it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a democracy,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, an\u2019 you know how many monarchies aren\u2019t around anymore because people decided family lineage was no way to decide who ran the country? I could give you a list. Hell, David, you could probably give me one. So why don\u2019t you put it out there for the people? I\u2019m not saying you should let \u2019em decide. But the figures might help y\u2019all decide what\u2019s really best for the country.\u201d</p><p>They argued. They swore at each other. The king disinherited Nicole, then fired Jeffrey, then disinherited David. The Dragon laughed her ass off. The king begrudgingly took it all back.</p><p>Then Nicole asked the Dragon, \u201cHow does one conduct a poll, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Part Three</p><p>PRINCESS NICOLE KRENSKI</p><p>Chapter 55</p><p>BASTARD PRINCESS GIVES FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE</p><p>ANNOUNCES LEGAL TITLE TO THE WORLD</p><p>ABDICATES THRONE TO CROWN PRINCE DAVID</p><p>\u201cS o that\u2019s what it is?\u201d Nicholas asked. \u201cYour title is HRH Princess Nicole Krenski? Like Krenski was your middle name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best way I can reconcile my Baranov side with my mother\u2019s memory. I know the general consensus around here is that she was selfish to keep me to herself her entire life, but the bottom line is, I owe everything to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody at this table,\u201d the king said mildly, pretending it was a comment and not a command (no one was fooled), \u201chas one bad thing to say about your dear mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d David said. He raised his water glass. \u201cTo Ms. Krenski, mother of the bastard princess.\u201d</p><p>The other siblings and in-laws raised their glasses and thundered \u201cTo Ms. Krenski!\u201d so loud the chandelier tinkled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never ever be queen?\u201d Nicky persisted.</p><p>\u201cGod willing,\u201d Nicole said fervently. \u201cDavid\u2019s cut out for it. I\u2019m not. Everybody at the table was nice to pretend otherwise.\u201d</p><p>There was an awkward silence, broken by, \u201cJeffrey, will you stop standing in the corner and go eat lunch with your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d the king demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re not on her detail anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all respect, Your Majesty, I am until the wedding day.\u201d</p><p>The king brightened. \u201cThen that means\u2014I knew your father, and your grandfather, so that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sex until I\u2019m a married woman,\u201d Nicole said glumly. \u201cFucking sense of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, am I the eldest or am I the eldest?\u201d she demanded, smiling up at the footman who refilled her milk glass.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d David said, \u201cyou don\u2019t get any special treatment. And you\u2019ve got to put up with gobs of annoying younger sibs.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn sneered and threw a buttered roll at her brother, who, from years of practice, ducked handily.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all\u2019s dinner manners remind me o\u2019 this family of monkeys I saw in a zoo once. The head monkey, who was by far the smelliest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Dragon. You\u2019re fired!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish my soup, at least. Christina made it herself. Tastes like spring, darlin\u2019,\u201d she added to Christina.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Listen, Nicole, I feel terrible that we got off on the wrong foot. I know what it\u2019s like to lose a mother. I just\u2014\u201d To everyone\u2019s shock, she burst into tears. \u201cI handled it all wrong and I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, stop it, okay, okay, I forgive you.\u201d Nicole had rarely been so alarmed. On the whole, she preferred her sister-in-law to come out of the corner swinging, not sobbing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. We\u2019re family, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, we are! And, Holly, I love you. I really really love you. Al\u2019s been alone too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing my sex life at the dinner table,\u201d the king commanded.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Al, I\u2014\u201d Christina grabbed her napkin...and threw up in it.</p><p>\u201cOh, guh-ross!\u201d Kathryn and Nicholas screamed in unison.</p><p>\u201cHey, I almost barfed myself. I sure don\u2019t want to discuss Dad\u2019s sex life,\u201d Nicole said.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is indisposed,\u201d David sighed. \u201cHoney, I think it\u2019s way past time you went to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I have to share my first pregnancy with Pregzilla?\u201d Alexandria demanded as her husband, Shel, laughed like a hyena. \u201cChris, how late are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive weeks,\u201d she mumbled, accepting with thanks several clean napkins.</p><p>\u201cSee? Not fair! I\u2019m two weeks behind you! You\u2019re gonna be first...again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you bitching about?\u201d Alexander-the-younger snapped. \u201cThe rest of us are putting up with two pregnant sociopaths.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Nicole caught Jeffrey\u2019s eye and winked.
