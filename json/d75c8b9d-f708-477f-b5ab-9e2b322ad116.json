She\u2019d known he would find out \u2013 he had eyes and ears everywhere but it never stopped her from disobeying him. It was all part of the plan to get what she wanted.</p><p>Stumbling down the dark corridor of the underground London club towards his office, she barely registered her stupidity. Determination and too much alcohol were getting in the way. She had a loving family at home, people who treasured and loved her, made her feel wanted and valued. She knew deep down that there was no good reason to be exposing her body and mind to this sordid, seedy underworld. Yet she did it again tonight. And she\u2019d do it again tomorrow night.</p><p>Her stomach turned as she approached the door to his office, her alcohol-drenched brain only barely functioning enough to make her hand lift and take the handle of the door. On a little hiccup and another stagger in her ridiculous stilettos, she fell into William\u2019s office.</p> <p>He was a handsome man in his late thirties, with a head of thick hair that was beginning to grey at his temples, giving him a distinguished salt-and-pepper fleck that matched his distinguished suits. His square jaw was harsh, but his smile friendly when he chose to flash it, which wasn\u2019t very often. His male clients never saw that smile. William chose to maintain the hard front that made all men quiver when in his presence. But for his girls, his eyes always sparkled and his face was always soft and reassuring. She didn\u2019t understand it and she didn\u2019t try to. She just knew that she needed him. And she knew that William had developed a fondness for her, too. She used that weakness against him. The hard businessman\u2019s heart was soft for all his girls, but for her, it was complete mush.</p><p>William looked to the door as she stumbled through, raising his hand and halting the serious talk coming from a tall, mean-looking type standing over his desk. One of his rules was to always knock and await instruction to enter, but she never did and William never reprimanded her. \u2018We\u2019ll continue this soon,\u2019 he said, dismissing his associate, who left without delay or protest, shutting the door quietly behind him.</p><p>William stood, straightening his jacket while stepping out from behind his huge desk. Even through her alcohol-induced fog, she could see the concern on his face with perfect clarity. She could also see a hint of irritation. He approached her carefully, cautiously, as if he was worried she\u2019d bolt, and gently took her arm. He placed her in one of the quilted leather chairs opposite his desk, then poured himself a Scotch and handed her some iced water before taking a seat.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel scared in the presence of this powerful man, even in such a vulnerable state. Bizarrely, she always felt safe. He\u2019d do anything for his girls, including castrate any man who overstepped the mark. He had specific rules, and no man in his right mind dared break those rules. It was more than their life was worth. She\u2019d seen the result and it wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>\u2018I told you no more,\u2019 William said, trying to sound cross, but he only achieved a tone drenched with sympathy.</p> <p>\u2018If you don\u2019t set them up for me, I\u2019ll find them myself,\u2019 she slurred, her drunkenness injecting some spunk into her small frame. She threw her bag onto his desk in front of him, but William ignored her lack of respect and pushed it back toward her.</p><p>\u2018Do you need money? I\u2019ll give you money. I don\u2019t want you in this world any more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not your decision,\u2019 she countered fearlessly, knowing damn well what she was doing. His straight lips and the darkening of his grey eyes told her she was succeeding. She was forcing his hand.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re seventeen years old. You have your whole life ahead of you.\u2019 He stood and made his way around his desk, sitting on the edge in front of her. \u2018You lied to me about your age, you\u2019ve broken endless rules, and now you refuse to let me put your life back together.\u2019 He took her chin and lifted her defiant face to his. \u2018You\u2019ve disrespected me and, worst of all, yourself.\u2019</p><p>She had no answer to that. She\u2019d misled him, tricked him, just to get close to him. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 she mumbled quietly, breaking free of his hold to take a long swig of her water. She didn\u2019t know what else to say and even if she could find the words, it would never be good enough. She knew William\u2019s compassion for her could tarnish the respect he\u2019d earned in this underworld business, and her refusal to let him fix her situation \u2013 a situation he felt responsible for \u2013 was only risking that reputation further.</p><p>He knelt in front of her, his big palms resting on her bare legs. \u2018Which one of my clients broke my rules this time?\u2019</p> <p>She shrugged, not willing to share the name of the man she\u2019d tempted into bed. She knew William had warned them all to stay away from her. She had misled him as much as William. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 She wanted William to be angry at her continued disrespect, but he remained calm.</p><p>\u2018You won\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for.\u2019 William felt like a bastard delivering such harsh words. He knew what she wanted. \u2018I can\u2019t look after you,\u2019 he said quietly, pulling down the hem of her short dress.</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 she whispered.</p><p>William took a long, tired breath. He knew she didn\u2019t belong in his world. He didn\u2019t even know if he belonged any more. He\u2019d never let compassion interfere with business, never put himself in situations that could ruin his well-respected standing, yet this young female had stamped all over that claim. It was those sapphire eyes. He never let sentiment get in the way of business either \u2013 he couldn\u2019t afford to \u2013 but this time he\u2019d failed.</p><p>His big hand lifted to stroke her soft, porcelain cheek and the desperation in her eyes pierced his hard heart. \u2018Help me do what\u2019s right. You don\u2019t belong here with me,\u2019 he said.</p><p>She nodded, and William exhaled a breath of relief. This girl was too beautiful and too reckless \u2013 a dangerous combination. This girl was going to find herself in trouble. He was furious with himself for letting this happen, despite her deception.</p><p>He looked after his girls, respected them, made sure his clients respected them, and he always kept his eagle eyes open for anything that might put them at risk, mentally and physically. He knew what they would do before they did it. Yet this one he\u2019d let slip. This one had fooled him. He couldn\u2019t blame her, though. He blamed himself. He was too distracted by this young woman\u2019s beauty \u2013 a beauty that would for ever be etched on his mind\u2019s eye. He would send her away again and this time he\u2019d make sure she stayed away. He cared about this one too much to keep her. And it seared painfully on his dark soul.</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>There\u2019s something to be said about making the perfect cup of coffee. There\u2019s even more to be said about making the perfect cup of coffee from one of the spaceship-like machines I\u2019m staring at. I\u2019ve spent days watching my fellow waitress, Sylvie, complete the task with ease, while chatting, grabbing down another mug, and tapping the order through the till. But all I seem to be achieving is a royal mess, of both the coffee and the area surrounding the machine.</p><p>I force the jammed filter contraption on with a quiet curse and it slips, scattering the coffee grains everywhere. \u2018No, no, no,\u2019 I mutter under my breath, grabbing my cloth from the front pocket of my apron. The damp rag is brown, a dead giveaway to the millions of other times I\u2019ve wiped up my mess today.</p><p>\u2018You want me to take over?\u2019 Sylvie\u2019s amused voice creeps over my shoulders and makes them sag. It\u2019s no use. No matter how many times I try, I always end up in the same pickle. This spaceship and I are not friends.</p><p>I sigh dramatically and turn, handing Sylvie the big metal handle thingy. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. The machine hates me.\u2019</p><p>Her bright-pink lips break out in a fond smile, and her black shiny bob swishes as she shakes her head. Her patience is commendable. \u2018It\u2019ll come. Why don\u2019t you go and clear table seven?\u2019</p><p>I move fast, grabbing a tray and making my way over to the recently vacated area in the hope of redeeming myself. \u2018He\u2019ll sack me,\u2019 I muse, loading the tray. I\u2019ve only been working here for four days, but on hiring me, Del said it would only take me a few hours of training on my first day to get the hang of the machine that dominates the back counter of the bistro. That day was hideous, and I think Del shares my thoughts.</p><p>\u2018No he won\u2019t.\u2019 Sylvie fires the machine up, and the sound of steam rushing from the froth pipe fills the bistro. \u2018He likes you!\u2019 she calls louder, grabbing a mug, then a tray, then a spoon, a napkin and the chocolate sprinkles, all while rotating the metal jug of milk with ease.</p><p>I smile down at the table as I wipe it before collecting the tray and making my way back to the kitchen. Del\u2019s only known me for a week, and he\u2019s already said that I haven\u2019t a bad bone in my body. My grandmother has said the very same thing but added that I\u2019d better grow some soon because the world and the people in it are not always nice or gentle.</p><p>I dump the tray on the side and start loading up the dishwasher.</p><p>\u2018You okay, Livy?\u2019</p><p>I turn toward the gruff voice of Paul, the cook. \u2018Great. You?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Top of the world.\u2019 He continues cleaning out the pots, whistling as he does.</p><p>Resuming stacking plates in the dishwasher, I think to myself that I should be just fine as long as I\u2019m not let loose on that machine. \u2018Is there anything else you\u2019d like me to do before I get off?\u2019 I ask Sylvie as she pushes her way through the swing door of the kitchen. I envy the way she carries out all tasks with such ease and speed, from dealing with that damn machine to stacking mugs on top of each other without looking.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 She turns and wipes her hands on the front of her apron. \u2018You get off. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I remove my apron and hang it up. \u2018Bye, Paul.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have a good evening, Livy,\u2019 he calls, waving a ladle above his head.</p><p>After weaving my way through the tables of the bistro, I push my way out the door and onto the narrow back street, getting immediately pelted by rain. \u2018Wonderful,\u2019 I smile, shielding my head with my denim jacket and making a run for it.</p><p>I hop between the puddles, my Converse doing nothing to keep my feet dry, squelching with each hurried stride as I make my way to the bus stop.</p><p>Taking the steps up to our house, I barge through the door and rest my back against it, catching my breath.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Nan\u2019s husky voice instantly lightens my wet mood. \u2018Livy, is that you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s me!\u2019 I hang my soaked jacket on the coat hook and kick off my sodden Converse before making my way down the long hallway to the back kitchen. I find Nan stooped over the cooker, stirring a huge pot of something \u2013 soup, undoubtedly.</p><p>\u2018There you are!\u2019 She drops the wooden spoon and wobbles towards me. At eighty-one, she is really quite remarkable and still so on the ball. \u2018You\u2019re drenched!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not so bad,\u2019 I assure her, ruffling my hair as she assesses me from top to bottom, settling on my flat stomach as my T-shirt rides up.</p><p>\u2018You need fattening up.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes but humour her. \u2018I\u2019m starving.\u2019</p><p>The smile that graces her wrinkled face makes me smile, too, as she embraces me and rubs my back.</p><p>\u2018What have you done today, Nan?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>She releases me and points to the dinner table. \u2018Sit.\u2019</p><p>I do as I\u2019m told immediately, picking up the spoon she\u2019s set down for me. \u2018So?\u2019</p><p>She turns a frown on me. \u2018So what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Today. What did you do?\u2019 I prompt.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 She flaps a tea towel at me. \u2018Nothing exciting. A bit of shopping, and I baked your favourite carrot cake.\u2019 She points across to the other worktop, where a cake is sitting on a cooling rack. But it isn\u2019t carrot cake.</p><p>\u2018You made me carrot cake?\u2019 I ask, watching as she returns to serving up two bowls of soup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes. Like I said, Livy. I made your favourite.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But my favourite\u2019s lemon cake, Nan. You know that.\u2019</p><p>She doesn\u2019t falter in her serving, bringing the two bowls to the table and setting them down. \u2018Yes, I do. That is why I made you lemon cake.\u2019</p><p>I flick a glance across the kitchen again, just to check I\u2019m not mistaken. \u2018Nan, that looks like pineapple upside-down cake.\u2019</p> <p>Her rump hits the chair, and she looks at me like I\u2019m the one losing my mind. \u2018That\u2019s because it is pineapple upside-down cake.\u2019 She plunges her spoon into the bowl and slurps off some coriander soup before reaching for some freshly baked bread. \u2018I made your favourite.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s confused, and so am I. After that last few seconds\u2019 exchange, I have no clue what sort of cake she\u2019s made, and I don\u2019t care. I look across at my dear grandmother, studying her feeding herself. She seems okay and doesn\u2019t look confused. Is this the beginning? I lean forward. \u2018Nan, are you feeling okay?\u2019 I\u2019m worried.</p><p>She starts laughing. \u2018I\u2019m pulling your leg, Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I scorn her, feeling immediately better. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not losing my marbles yet.\u2019 She waves her spoon at my bowl. \u2018Eat your supper and tell me how you got on today.\u2019</p> <p>My shoulders sag dramatically on a sigh as I stir my soup. \u2018I can\u2019t get on with that coffee machine, which is a problem when ninety per cent of customers order some kind of coffee.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll get to grips with it,\u2019 she says confidently, like she\u2019s an expert on the damn thing.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not so sure. Del won\u2019t keep me just for clearing tables.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, apart from the coffee machine, are you enjoying it?\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018Yes, I really am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. You can\u2019t look after me for ever. A young thing like you should be out enjoying herself, not tending to her grandmother.\u2019 She eyes me cautiously. \u2018And I don\u2019t need tending to, anyway.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I like looking after you,\u2019 I argue quietly, bracing myself for the usual lecture. We could argue about this until we\u2019re blue in the face and still be in disagreement. She\u2019s fragile, not physically but mentally, no matter how much she insists she\u2019s okay. She draws breath. I fear the worst. \u2018Livy, I will not be leaving God\u2019s green pastures until I see you pull things together, and that\u2019s not going to happen if you spend all your time henpecking me. I\u2019m running out of time, so get your skinny little arse in gear.\u2019</p><p>I wince. \u2018I\u2019ve told you. I\u2019m happy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Happy hiding from a world that has so much to offer?\u2019 she asks seriously. \u2018Start living, Olivia. Trust me, time soon passes you by. Before you know it, you\u2019re being measured for false teeth and you won\u2019t dare cough or sneeze through fear of pissing yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I choke on a piece of bread, but she\u2019s not amused at all. She\u2019s deadly serious, as she always is during these types of conversations.</p><p>\u2018True story,\u2019 she says on a sigh. \u2018Get out there. Take whatever life throws your way. You\u2019re not your mother, Oliv\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan,\u2019 I warn slowly.</p><p>She visibly slumps in her chair. I know I frustrate her, but I\u2019m quite happy as I am. I\u2019m twenty-four, I\u2019ve lived with my nan since I was born, and as soon as I left college, I made my ex-cuses to stay at home and keep an eye on her. But while I was quite happy looking after my nan, she was not. \u2018Olivia, I\u2019ve moved forward. You need to, too. I should never have held you back.\u2019</p><p>I smile, not knowing what to say. She doesn\u2019t realise it, but I needed holding back. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s daughter, after all.</p> <p>\u2018Livy, make your nan happy. Put some heels on and go out and enjoy yourself.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s me slumping now. She just can\u2019t stop herself. \u2018Nan, you\u2019d have to pin me down to get me in heels.\u2019 My feet ache at the very thought.</p><p>\u2018How many pairs of those canvas things do you have?\u2019 she asks, buttering me yet more bread and passing it over.</p><p>\u2018Twelve,\u2019 I answer, completely unashamed. \u2018All in different colours.\u2019 I plan on buying them in yellow on Saturday, too. I take the bread and sink my teeth in, smiling around my bite when she huffs her displeasure.</p><p>\u2018Well at least go out and have fun. Gregory\u2019s always offering. Why don\u2019t you take him up on his constant offers?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t drink.\u2019 I wish she\u2019d stop with this. \u2018And Gregory will only drag me around all the g*y bars,\u2019 I tell her, raising my eyebrows. My best friend sleeps with enough men for both of us.</p><p>\u2018Any bar is better than no bar. You might like it.\u2019 She reaches over and brushes some crumbs from my lips, then strokes my cheek softly. I know what she\u2019s going to say. \u2018It\u2019s frightening how similar you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I rest my hand over hers and hold it in place while she silently reflects. I don\u2019t remember my mother very well, but I\u2019ve seen the proof; I\u2019m a carbon copy of her. Even my blond hair falls strangely similarly into waves that cascade over my shoulders, almost making it seem like too much hair for my tiny body to carry. It\u2019s incredibly heavy and only behaves if rough dried and left to do as it pleases. And my big navy-blue eyes that match my grandmother\u2019s and my mother\u2019s have a glassy reflecting quality. Sapphire-like, people have said. I don\u2019t see that part. Make-up is a pleasure, not a necessity, but it\u2019s always minimal on my fair skin.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve given her enough time to reminisce, I take her hand and place it by her bowl. \u2018Eat up, Nan,\u2019 I say quietly, continuing with my own soup.</p><p>Dragging herself back to the here and now, she carries on with her supper, but she\u2019s quiet. She\u2019s never got over my mother\u2019s reckless lifestyle \u2013 a lifestyle that stole Nan\u2019s daughter from her. It\u2019s been eighteen years and she still misses my mother terribly. I don\u2019t. How can you miss someone you hardly knew? But watching my nan slip into these sad thoughts every now and then makes it just as painful for me.</p><p>Yes, there\u2019s definitely something to be said about making the perfect cup of coffee. I\u2019m staring at the machine again, but today I\u2019m smiling. I\u2019ve done it \u2013 the correct amount of foam, the smoothness like silk and the little dusting of chocolate, forming a perfect heart on the top. It\u2019s just a shame that it\u2019s me who\u2019s drinking it, not an appreciative customer.</p><p>\u2018Good?\u2019 Sylvie asks, watching with anticipation.</p><p>I hum and gasp, setting the cup down. \u2018The coffee machine and I are now friends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yay!\u2019 she squeals, throwing her arms around me. I laugh and match her enthusiasm, looking over her shoulder as the door to the bistro swings open.</p><p>\u2018I think the lunchtime rush is about to start,\u2019 I say, breaking free from her grip. \u2018I\u2019ll get this one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, she\u2019s full of confidence,\u2019 Sylvie laughs, moving to give me access to the serving counter. She beams at me as I make my way over to the man who\u2019s just arrived.</p><p>\u2018What can I get you?\u2019 I ask, getting ready to jot down his order, but when he doesn\u2019t answer, I look up and find him watching me closely. I start shifting nervously, not liking the scrutiny. I find my voice. \u2018Sir?\u2019</p><p>His eyes widen a little. \u2018Er, cappuccino, please. To take away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 I snap into action, leaving Mr Wide Eyes gathering himself, and take myself to my new best friend, loading the handle thingy and securing it successfully into the holder \u2013 so far so good.</p><p>\u2018That is why Del won\u2019t sack you,\u2019 Sylvie whispers over my shoulder, making me jump slightly.</p><p>\u2018Stop it,\u2019 I say, retrieving a takeaway cup from the shelf and placing it under the filter before pressing the correct button.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s watching you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sylvie, stop it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Give him your number.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I blurt too loudly, quickly checking over my shoulder. He\u2019s staring at me. \u2018I\u2019m not interested.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s cute,\u2019 Sylvie concludes, and I have to agree. He\u2019s very cute, but I\u2019m very uninterested.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have time for a relationship.\u2019 That\u2019s not strictly true. This is my first job and before this I spent most of my adult life caring for Nan. Now I\u2019m not sure whether she really does still need the care, or whether it\u2019s just my excuse.</p><p>Sylvie shrugs and leaves me to finish my second round with the machine. I finish up, smiling as I pour the milk into the cup before releasing a drop of dust on the foam and securing a lid. I\u2019m far too proud of myself and it\u2019s obvious on my smiling face as I turn to deliver the cappuccino to Mr Wide Eyes. \u2018Two pounds eighty, please.\u2019 I go to place the cup down, but he intercepts me and takes it from my hand, ensuring contact as he does.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he says, pulling my eyes up to his with his soft words.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 I slowly take my hand away from his, accepting the tenner he hands me. \u2018I\u2019ll get your change.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 He shakes his head mildly, running his eyes all over my face. \u2018But I wouldn\u2019t mind your phone number.\u2019</p><p>I hear Sylvie chuckling from the table she\u2019s clearing. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m in a relationship.\u2019 I punch his order through the till and quickly collect his change, handing it over to him and ignoring Sylvie\u2019s snort of disgust.</p><p>\u2018Of course you are.\u2019 He laughs lightly, looking embarrassed. \u2018How stupid of me.\u2019</p><p>I smile, trying to ease his awkwardness. \u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t usually just ask any women I meet for their number,\u2019 he explains. \u2018I\u2019m not a creep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Honestly, it\u2019s okay.\u2019 I\u2019m feeling embarrassed myself now, and I\u2019m silently wishing he\u2019d leave before I throw a coffee cup at Sylvie\u2019s head. I can feel her staring at me in shock. I start to rearrange the napkins, anything to take me away from the uncomfortable situation. I could kiss the man who walks in behind, looking like he\u2019s in a hurry. \u2018I\u2019d better get this.\u2019 I indicate over Mr Wide Eyes\u2019s shoulder to the harassed-looking businessman.</p><p>\u2018Oh, yes! Sorry.\u2019 He backs away, holding up his cup in thanks. \u2018See ya.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bye.\u2019 I lift my hand before looking to my next customer. \u2018What would you like, sir?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Latte, no sugar, and make it quick.\u2019 He barely even looks at me before he answers his phone and walks away from the counter, dumping his briefcase on a chair.</p><p>I\u2019m only semi-aware of Mr Wide Eyes leaving, but I\u2019m more than aware of Sylvie\u2019s biker boots marching up to me, where I\u2019m tackling the coffee machine again. \u2018I can\u2019t believe you declined!\u2019 she whispers harshly. \u2018He was lovely.\u2019</p><p>I make quick work of my third perfect coffee, not giving her shock the attention it deserves. \u2018He was okay,\u2019 I reply nonchalantly.</p><p>\u2018\u201cOkay?\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, he was okay.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m not looking at her, but I know she\u2019s just rolled her eyes. \u2018Unbelievable,\u2019 she mutters, stomping off, her voluptuous rump matching the side-to-side sway of her black bob.</p><p>I\u2019m smiling in triumph again as I deliver the coffee, and my grin doesn\u2019t even fall away when the harassed businessman thrusts three pounds into my hand before snatching his cup and marching out, without so much as a thank you.</p><p>My feet don\u2019t touch the ground for the rest of the day. I fly in and out of the kitchen, clean endless tables and make dozens of perfect coffees. On my breaks, I manage to check up on Nan, being told off each time for being a whittle-arse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As five o\u2019clock approaches, I sink into one of the brown leather couches and open a can of Coke, hoping the caffeine and sugar might snap me back to life. I\u2019m knackered.</p><p>\u2018Livy, I\u2019m just going to take the rubbish out,\u2019 Sylvie calls over, yanking the black sack from one of the bins. \u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fabulous.\u2019 I hold my can up and rest my head back on the sofa, resisting the temptation to close my eyes, instead focusing on the spotlights in the ceiling. I can\u2019t wait to fall into bed. My feet are aching, and I desperately need a shower.</p><p>\u2018Is anyone working or is it self-service?\u2019</p> <p>I jump up from the couch at the sound of the impatient but smooth voice, and swing around to tend to my customer. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 I rush to the counter, smacking my hip on the corner of the worktop and resisting the urge to curse out loud. \u2018What can I get you?\u2019 I ask, rubbing my hip as I look up.</p><p>I stagger back. And I definitely gasp. His piercing blue eyes are burning into me. Deep, deep into me. My gaze drifts and takes in his open suit jacket, a waistcoat and pale-blue shirt and tie, his dark stubbled jaw, and the way his lips are parted just so. Then I find those eyes again. They\u2019re the sharpest blue I\u2019ve ever seen, and they\u2019re cutting right through me with an edge of curiosity. The definition of perfection is standing before me and it has me staring in wonder.</p><p>\u2018Do you often examine customers so thoroughly?\u2019 His head cocks to the side, his perfect eyebrow arching expectantly.</p><p>\u2018What can I get you?\u2019 I breathe, waving my pad at him.</p><p>\u2018Americano, four shots, two sugars, topped up halfway.\u2019 The words roll from his mouth but I don\u2019t hear them. I see them. I lip-read every word, writing them down while keeping my eyes on his mouth. Before I know what\u2019s happened, my pen has drifted from my pad and I\u2019m scribbling on my fingers. I glance down with a frown.</p> <p>\u2018Hello?\u2019 He sounds impatient again, prompting my eyes to snap up. I allow myself to step back and take in all of his face. I\u2019m shocked, not because of how incredibly stunning he is, but because I\u2019ve lost all of my bodily functions, except my eyes. They\u2019re working just fine, and they can\u2019t seem to disconnect from his flawlessness. I don\u2019t even lose my concentration when he rests his palms on the counter and leans forward, encouraging a wave from his tousled dark hair to fall onto his forehead. \u2018Am I making you feel uncomfortable?\u2019 he asks. I lip-read that, too.</p><p>\u2018What can I get you?\u2019 I breathe once more, waving my pad at him again.</p><p>He nods down to my pen. \u2018You\u2019ve already asked me. My order\u2019s on your hand.\u2019</p><p>I look down, seeing ink strewn all over my fingers, but it doesn\u2019t make a bit of sense, not even when I try to match up the pad to where the pen has trailed off.</p><p>Slowly lifting my eyes, I meet his. There\u2019s an element of knowing in them.</p><p>He looks smug. It\u2019s thrown me completely.</p> <p>I scan the information stored in my mind from the last few minutes, but I find no order for coffee, just saved images of his face. \u2018Cappuccino?\u2019 I ask hopefully.</p><p>\u2018Americano,\u2019 he counters smoothly on a whisper. \u2018Four shots, two sugars and topped up halfway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right!\u2019 I snap myself from my pathetic awestruck state and move to the coffee machine, my hands shaking, my heart thudding. I bash the filter on the wooden drawer to rid it of the used beans, hoping the loud smacking will knock some sense back into me. It doesn\u2019t. I still feel . . . strange.</p><p>Pulling the lever on the grinder, I load the filter up. He\u2019s staring at me. I can feel those piercing blues penetrating my back as I faff and fiddle with the machine that I\u2019ve grown to love. It\u2019s not loving me right now, though. It\u2019s not doing anything I tell it to. I can\u2019t secure the filter in the holder; my shaking hands are not helping in the slightest.</p><p>Taking a deep, calming breath, I start again, successfully loading the filter and placing the cup underneath. I press the button and wait for it to work its magic, keeping my back to the stranger behind me. In the whole week I\u2019ve worked at Del\u2019s Bistro, I\u2019ve never known the machine to take this long to filter some coffee. I\u2019m silently willing it to hurry the hell up.</p><p>When an eternity has passed, I take the cup and slip in two sugars, ready to top it up with water.</p><p>\u2018Four shots.\u2019 He breaks the uncomfortable silence with that soft rasp.</p><p>\u2018Pardon?\u2019 I don\u2019t turn around.</p> <p>\u2018I ordered four shots.\u2019</p><p>I look down at the cup, containing just one shot, and close my eyes, praying for the coffee gods to help me out. I don\u2019t know how long it takes me to add three more shots, but when I finally turn to deliver his coffee, he\u2019s sitting on a sofa, relaxed, his lean physique stretched out, his fingers tapping the arm. His face doesn\u2019t show a hint of emotion, but I detect he\u2019s not happy, and for some strange reason that makes me really unhappy. I\u2019ve handled that damn machine perfectly all day, and now when I really want to look like I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m coming off as an incompetent fool. I feel stupid as I hold up the takeaway cup before placing it neatly on the counter.</p><p>He looks at it, then back to me. \u2018I want to drink in.\u2019 His face is serious, his tone flat but sharp, and I stare at him, trying to figure out if he\u2019s being difficult or genuine. I don\u2019t remember him asking for a takeaway; I just assumed. He doesn\u2019t look like the type to sit around in back-street bistros. He looks more like a champagne bar, mingle-with-the-money type.</p><p>Grabbing a coffee cup and saucer, I simply transfer the coffee and shove a teaspoon on the side before taking steady steps over to him. No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t stop the chinking of the cup on the saucer. I place it down on the low table and watch as he swivels the saucer before lifting the cup, but I don\u2019t hang around to watch him drink, pivoting quickly on my Converse and escaping.</p><p>I virtually burst through the swing door of the kitchen, finding Paul putting his coat on. \u2018All right, Livy?\u2019 he asks, his rounded face scanning me.</p><p>\u2018Yep.\u2019 I dive into the large metal sink to wash my sweaty hands as the bistro phone starts ringing from the wall. Paul takes the initiative to answer, obviously concluding that I\u2019m dead set on scrubbing my hands until they disappear.</p><p>\u2018For you, Livy. I\u2019m outta here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have a great weekend, Paul,\u2019 I say, drying my hands before I take the phone. \u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, honey, are you busy tonight?\u2019 Del asks.</p><p>\u2018Tonight?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I have a catering contract for a charity gala and I\u2019ve been let down. Could you be a doll and help me out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Del, I\u2019d love to, but . . .\u2019 I have no idea why I said I\u2019d love to, because I really wouldn\u2019t, and I can\u2019t finish that sentence because I can\u2019t find a \u2018but\u2019. I have nothing to do this evening except faff around my grandmother and get told off for it.</p><p>\u2018Ah, Livy, I\u2019ll pay you well. I\u2019m desperate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are the hours?\u2019 I sigh, leaning against the wall.</p><p>\u2018You star! Seven to midnight. It\u2019s not hard, honey. Just walk around with trays of canap\u00e9s and glasses of champagne. Piece of cake.\u2019</p><p>A piece of cake? It\u2019s still walking, and my feet are still killing me. \u2018I need to go home to check on my nan and change. What should I wear?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Black, and be at the staff entrance of the Hilton on Park Lane at seven, okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019</p><p>He hangs up, and I hang my head, but my attention is soon pulled to the swing door when Sylvie bursts through, her brown eyes wide. \u2018Have you seen it?\u2019</p><p>Her question quickly reminds me of the stunning creature who\u2019s sitting drinking coffee in the bistro. I almost laugh as I place the receiver back in its cradle. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve seen him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Holy f**king shit, Livy! Men like that should carry a warning.\u2019 She glances back into the bistro and starts fanning her face. \u2018Oh God, he\u2019s blowing the steam off his coffee.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t need a visual. I can imagine it. \u2018Are you working tonight?\u2019 I ask, trying to divert her dribbling into the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 She swings back towards me. \u2018Did Del ask you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He did.\u2019 I unhook my keys and lock the doors that lead to the alley.</p><p>\u2018He tried to get me to ask you, but I know you\u2019re not mad about night work, what with your nan at home. Are you doing it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I agreed.\u2019 I give her a tired look.</p><p>Her serious face grins. \u2018It\u2019s closing time. Would you like to let him know that it\u2019s time to go?\u2019</p><p>Stupidly, I\u2019m battling off the shakes again at the thought of looking at him, and I chastise myself for it. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ll tell him,\u2019 I declare with all the confidence I\u2019m not feeling. Rolling my shoulders back, I walk with sureness past Sylvie and into the bistro, coming to an abrupt halt when I see he\u2019s gone. The strangest sensation comes over me as I scan the area, feeling a bizarre sense of desertion mixed with disappointment.</p><p>\u2018Oh. Where\u2019s he gone?\u2019 Sylvie whines, pushing past me.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I whisper, slowly walking to the abandoned sofa and picking up a half-drunk coffee and three pound coins. I separate the napkin that\u2019s stuck to the bottom of the saucer and start to screw it up, but some black lines catch my attention and I\u2019m quickly unravelling it with one hand and flattening it on the table.</p><p>I gasp. Then I get a little mad.</p><p>Probably the worst Americano that I\u2019ve ever insulted my mouth with.</p><p>M.</p><p>My face screws up in disgust, along with the napkin as I ball it and stuff it in the cup. The arrogant arsehole. Nothing makes me mad, and I know it exasperates my grandmother and Gregory, but I\u2019m really heated with annoyance now. And it really is over something quite silly. But then I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I failed to make good coffee when I\u2019ve been doing so well, or simply because the perfect man didn\u2019t approve of it. And what does M stand for, anyway?</p><p>After disposing of the cup, the saucer, and the offending napkin, then locking up with Sylvie, I finally reach the conclusion that M stands for Moron.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Del leads us through the staff entrance of the hotel, dishing out instructions, pointing to the serving area and ensuring that we\u2019re aware of the type of clientele.</p><p>Bottom line: posh.</p><p>I can deal with that. Once I\u2019d checked on Nan, she virtually pushed me out the front door and chucked my black Converse out after me before she went to get ready for bingo with George at the local oldies group.</p><p>\u2018Never leave anyone with an empty glass,\u2019 Del calls over his shoulder, leading on, \u2018and ensure all empties are delivered back to the kitchen so they can be washed and refilled.\u2019</p><p>I follow Sylvie, who\u2019s following Del, listening intently as I pile my heavy hair up and secure it with a hair tie. It sounds easy enough, and I absolutely love people-watching so tonight could be fun.</p><p>\u2018Here.\u2019 Del stops and thrusts a round silver tray at both of us, looking down at my feet. \u2018You didn\u2019t have any black flats?\u2019</p><p>Following his line of sight, I look down and pull my black trousers up a little. \u2018These are black.\u2019 I wriggle my toes within my Converse, thinking how much more my feet would hurt if I were wearing anything else.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say any more; just rolls his eyes and leads on until we\u2019re in a chaotic kitchen space where dozens of hotel staff are flying around, shouting and barking orders at each other. I move closer to Sylvie as we continue walking. \u2018Is it just us?\u2019 I ask, suddenly a little alarmed. All of the frantic activity suggests a lot of guests.</p><p>\u2018No, there will be the agency staff he uses, too. We\u2019re back-ups.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does he do this a lot, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s his main income. I don\u2019t know why he keeps the bistro.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod thoughtfully to myself. \u2018Doesn\u2019t the hotel provide a catering service?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh yes, but the type of people you\u2019re about to feed and water call the shots, and if they want Del, they\u2019ll have Del. He\u2019s notorious in this game. You have to try his canap\u00e9s.\u2019 She kisses her fingertips, making me laugh.</p><p>My boss shows us around the room where the function is being held and introduces us to the many other waiters and waitresses, all looking bored and inconvenienced. This is obviously a regular thing for them, but not me. I\u2019m looking forward to it.</p><p>\u2018Ready?\u2019 Sylvie places a final glass of champagne onto my tray. \u2018Now, the trick is to hold it on your palm.\u2019 She picks up her own tray, her palm underneath in the centre. \u2018Then swing it up onto your shoulder, like this.\u2019 In one fluid movement, the tray glides through the air and lands on her shoulder, without even a chink from glasses touching. I\u2019m fascinated. \u2018See?\u2019 The tray glides back down from her shoulder until it\u2019s at waist level again. \u2018When offering, hold it here, and when you\u2019re moving around, keep it up here.\u2019 The tray swishes through the air, landing on her shoulder perfectly again. \u2018Remember to relax when you\u2019re on the move. Don\u2019t be stiff. You try.\u2019</p> <p>I slide my full tray from the counter and position my palm in the centre. \u2018It\u2019s not heavy,\u2019 I muse, surprised.</p><p>\u2018Yes, but remember when empty glasses start replacing full glasses it\u2019ll get even lighter, so bear that in mind when you\u2019re transferring it up and down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 I swivel my wrist, taking the tray up to my shoulder with ease. I smile brightly, taking it back down again.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a natural.\u2019 Sylvie laughs. \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>Transferring the tray back to my shoulder, I swivel on my Converse and head towards the increasing sound of chatting and laughing that\u2019s coming from the function room.</p> <p>On entering, my navy eyes widen, taking in the wealth, the gowns and the dinner jackets. But I don\u2019t feel nervous. I feel stupidly excited. This is people-watching at its best.</p><p>Without waiting for any prompt from Sylvie, I lose myself in the growing crowds, presenting my tray to groups of people and smiling, whether they thank me or not. Most don\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t dampen my mood. I\u2019m in my element, and I\u2019m surprised by it. The tray glides up and down with ease, my body shifts effortlessly through the masses of wealth, and I dance back and forth to the kitchen time and time again to restock and redeliver.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re doing good, Livy,\u2019 Del tells me, just as I\u2019m leaving with another trayload of champagne flutes.</p><p>\u2018Thank you!\u2019 I sing, keen to get myself back to my thirsty crowd. I catch Sylvie across the room, and she smiles, encouraging a further beam from me. \u2018Champagne?\u2019 I ask, presenting my tray to a group of six middle-aged men, all kitted out in dinner jackets and bow ties.</p><p>\u2018Ah! Bloody marvellous!\u2019 a stout man gushes, taking a glass and handing it to one of his companions. He does this a further four times before taking one for himself. \u2018You\u2019re doing a fine job, young lady.\u2019 His free hand moves toward me and slips into my pocket as he winks. \u2018Treat yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no!\u2019 I shake my head. I won\u2019t take money from a man. \u2018Sir, I get paid by my boss. You really mustn\u2019t.\u2019 I try to retrieve the note from my pocket while holding the tray steady on my palm. \u2018We don\u2019t expect tips.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I won\u2019t hear of it,\u2019 he insists, pulling my hand from my pocket. \u2018And it\u2019s not a tip. It\u2019s for the pleasure of seeing such beautiful eyes.\u2019</p><p>I immediately blush bright red, stumped for anything to say. He must be sixty, if a day! \u2018Sir, really, I can\u2019t accept it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 He dismisses me with a snort and a wave of his chubby hand, before returning to the chatter of his group, leaving me wondering what the hell to do.</p><p>I scan the room but I can\u2019t see Sylvie to ask and Del is nowhere in sight, so I quickly offload the remaining glasses before heading back to the kitchens, finding Del tweaking canap\u00e9s.</p><p>\u2018Del, someone gave me this.\u2019 I slap the note on the counter, feeling better already for confessing, but my eyes bug when I see it\u2019s a fifty. A fifty? What\u2019s he thinking?</p><p>I\u2019m even more stunned when Del starts laughing. \u2018Livy, you star. Keep it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you can. These people have more money than sense. Take it as a compliment.\u2019 He pushes the fifty towards me and continues arranging the tiny flatbreads.</p> <p>I don\u2019t feel any better. \u2018I\u2019ve only served him a glass of champagne,\u2019 I say quietly. \u2018It hardly justifies a fifty-pound tip.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it doesn\u2019t, but like I said, take it as a compliment. Put it back in your pocket and get serving.\u2019 He nods at my empty tray, reminding me that it is, in fact, empty.</p><p>\u2018Oh! Yes, sure.\u2019 I fly into action, stuffing the obscene tip in my pocket, ready to dispose of it later, and reload my tray before quickly making my way back into the crowd. I avoid the gent who\u2019s just thrown away fifty pounds and circle in the other direction, halting at the back of a red satin gown. \u2018Champagne, madam?\u2019 I ask, flicking a gaze across to Sylvie. She nods her reassurance once more, smiling, but I don\u2019t need it. I\u2019m nailing this.</p><p>I turn my attention back to the satin-adorned woman, who has glossy black poker-straight hair falling to her pert bum. I smile as she turns towards me, revealing her companion.</p><p>A man.</p><p>Him.</p><p>M.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I prevent the tray of freshly filled champagne glasses from falling to the floor, but I do. I don\u2019t, however, prevent my smile from falling. His lips are parted again, his eyes stabbing at my flesh, but there\u2019s no emotion on his exquisite face. His dark stubble is absent, leaving nothing but perfect tanned skin beneath, and his dark hair is a little less tousled, instead falling in perfect waves to the tops of his ears.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 the woman says slowly, taking a glass and pulling my eyes away from the strange man. A huge, sparkling, diamond-encrusted cross is suspended from her delicate neck, the brilliant stones nestling just north of her br**sts. I\u2019ve no doubt it\u2019s real. \u2018Would you like?\u2019 She turns to him, holding up the glass.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. He just takes the glass from her perfectly manicured hand, all the time keeping his shocking blue eyes on me.</p><p>He\u2019s not at all receptive, and far from warm, but there\u2019s something strange burning inside me as I gaze at his face. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced before \u2013 something that makes me feel uncomfortable and vulnerable . . . but not frightened.</p><p>The woman helps herself to another glass, and I know it\u2019s time for me to leave, but I can\u2019t move. I feel like I should smile, anything to break the staring deadlock, but what usually comes so naturally to me is completely failing me now. Nothing is working, except my eyes and they\u2019re refusing to break from his.</p><p>\u2018That will be all,\u2019 the woman prompts harshly, making me jump. Her delicate features are screwed up in annoyance and her dark eyes have darkened further. She has a stunning face, even if it\u2019s scowling at me right now. \u2018I said, that is all.\u2019 She steps between me and M.</p><p>M? I decide right here and now that M is for mystery, because he really is. I say nothing as I finally swing my tray back onto my shoulder and slowly turn, walking away, feeling compelled to glance over my shoulder because I know he\u2019s still staring at me and I\u2019m wondering how that might be going down with his girlfriend. So I look, and it\u2019s as I suspected \u2013 steely blues burning holes into my back.</p><p>\u2018Hey!\u2019</p><p>I jump out of my skin, the tray tumbling from my hands, and I can do nothing to stop it. The glasses seem to float down to the marble, champagne trickling slowly from the flutes, the tray spinning in mid-air until it all comes together in a collective crash on the hard floor, silencing the room. I\u2019m frozen on the spot as broken glass dances around my feet, seeming to take forever to settle, the piercing, drawn-out noise ringing through the quiet space around me. My eyes are cast downward, my body tense, and I know all attention is pointed at me.</p><p>Just me.</p><p>Everyone is looking at me.</p><p>And I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 Sylvie\u2019s panicked voice snaps my despairing head up, and I see her hurrying towards me, her brown eyes concerned. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>I nod and kneel to start collecting the broken glass, wincing as a red-hot pain shoots through my knee, and the material of my trousers is sliced through. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I pull in a sharp breath, tears immediately pinching the backs of my eyes. They\u2019re a combination of pain and pure embarrassment. I don\u2019t like any attention on me, and I do a good job to avoid and repel it, but I can\u2019t escape this. I\u2019ve brought a room full of hundreds of people to an eerie quiet. I want to run away.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t touch it, Livy!\u2019 Sylvie pulls me up, giving me an all-over assessment. She must conclude that I look ready to break down because I\u2019m quickly dragged to the kitchen, removing me from my audience. \u2018Jump up.\u2019 She pats the counter and I lift myself, still fighting back tears. She takes the hem of my trousers and lifts up until my wound is exposed. \u2018Youch!\u2019 She flinches at the clean slice and steps back, looking up at me. \u2018I\u2019m shit with blood, Livy. Was that the guy from the bistro?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I whisper, shrinking when I see Del approaching, but he doesn\u2019t look annoyed.</p><p>\u2018Livy, are you okay?\u2019 He hunkers down and performs his own little grimace at my leaking kneecap.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018I don\u2019t know what happened.\u2019 He\u2019ll probably sack me on the spot for causing such a spectacle.</p><p>\u2018Hey, hey.\u2019 He straightens his body, his narrow face softening completely. \u2018Accidents happen, honey.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve caused such a drama.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s enough,\u2019 he says sternly, turning to the wall and unhooking the first-aid case. \u2018It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u2019 He opens up the box and fishes around until he lays his hands on an antiseptic wipe and tears it open. My teeth grit as he gently swipes it across my knee, the stinging making me hiss and stiffen. \u2018Sorry, but it needs cleaning.\u2019</p><p>I hold my breath as he undertakes my clean-up operation, finishing by taping square gauze to my knee and lifting me down from the worktop. \u2018Can you walk okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 I flex my knee and smile my thanks before collecting a new tray.</p><p>\u2018What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019 he asks, frowning.</p><p>\u2018I . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018God bless you, Livy. Go to the loo and sort yourself out.\u2019 He points to the exit across the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I insist, even though I don\u2019t feel it, not because my knee\u2019s sore but because I\u2019m not looking forward to facing my spectators or M. I\u2019ll just have to keep my head down, avoid a certain steel stare and see my shift through with no further mishaps.</p><p>\u2018Toilet!\u2019 Del orders, taking the tray and placing it on the counter. \u2018Now.\u2019 He rests his hands on my shoulders and guides me to the door, not giving me the opportunity to protest further. \u2018Go.\u2019</p><p>I force a smile through my lingering embarrassment and leave behind the chaos of the kitchen, stepping into the huge room and striving to hurry through unnoticed. I know I\u2019ve failed \u2013 the feeling of sharp blue eyes prickling my skin everywhere confirming it. I feel like a let-down. I feel incompetent, foolish and fragile. But most of all, I feel exposed.</p><p>I navigate the plush carpeted corridor until I push my way through two doors and land in the ridiculously extravagant washroom, kitted out in cream marble and shiny gold at every turn. I almost don\u2019t want to use the facilities. The first thing I do is take the fifty from my pocket and gaze at it for a few moments. Then I screw it up and throw it in the bin. I\u2019m not taking money from a man. I wash my hands before presenting myself to the gigantic gold-framed mirror to retie my hair, sighing when I\u2019m confronted by haunted sapphire eyes. Curious eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t pay much attention when the door opens, and continue to tuck some wayward strands of hair behind my ears. But then there\u2019s someone behind me, casting a shadow over my face as I lean into the mirror. M. I gasp and jump back, straight into the body that\u2019s just as hard and lean as I\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in the ladies\u2019,\u2019 I breathe, swinging around to face him. I try to put some distance between us but I don\u2019t get very far with the sink behind me. Through my shock, I allow myself to drink in his closeness \u2013 his three-piece suit, his clean-shaven face. He smells out of this world, all manly with a touch of earthy wood. It\u2019s an intoxicating cocktail. Everything about him sends my sensible being into a tailspin.</p><p>He steps forward, closing the already narrow space between us, and then shocks me by kneeling and gently lifting the leg of my trouser. I\u2019m pushing myself back against the sink unit, holding my breath, just watching him run his thumb softly over the gauze hiding my cut.</p><p>\u2018Does it hurt?\u2019 he asks quietly, lifting those incredible blue eyes to mine. I can\u2019t talk, so I shake my head a little and watch as he slowly stands back up to his full height. He\u2019s thoughtful for a few moments before he speaks again. \u2018I need to force myself to stay away from you.\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t point out that he\u2019s doing a terrible job of that. I can\u2019t take my eyes off those lips. \u2018Why do you need to force yourself?\u2019</p><p>His hand meets my forearm, and it takes every ounce of my strength not to flinch at the heat radiating through me from his touch. \u2018Because you seem like a sweet girl who should get more from a man than the best f**k of your life.\u2019</p><p>My lack of astonishment shocks me. Instead, I feel relieved, even if he\u2019s just promised to f**k me and nothing more. He\u2019s taken by me, too, and that confirmation pulls my eyes up to meet his. \u2018Maybe I want that.\u2019 I\u2019m goading him, encouraging him, when I should be running in the other direction.</p><p>He seems to drift into thought as he concentrates on the soft trail of his fingertip travelling up my arm. \u2018You want more than that.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s telling me, not asking. I don\u2019t know what I want. I\u2019ve never stopped and considered my future, either professionally or personally. I\u2019m drifting, that\u2019s all, but I do know one thing. I\u2019m on dangerous ground, not just because this unidentified man seems to be forward, dark, and way too stunning, but because he\u2019s just said that he\u2019ll do nothing more than f**k me. I don\u2019t know him. I\u2019d be inconceivably stupid to dive into bed with him, just for sex. It goes against all of my morals. But I can\u2019t seem to locate the reasons to stop me. I should be uncomfortable with what he\u2019s provoking from me, but I\u2019m not. For the first time in my life, I feel alive. I\u2019m buzzing, unfamiliar feelings attacking my senses, and an even more demanding buzz attacking me between my clenched thighs. I\u2019m pulsing.</p> <p>\u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to tell you, Livy.\u2019</p><p>Before I can ask him how he knows my name, Sylvie\u2019s cry across the party room plays on repeat in my head. I want to touch him, but as I lift my hand to rest it on his chest, he backs up slightly, his eyes nailed to my floating palm between our bodies. I pause for a second to see if he withdraws further. He doesn\u2019t. My hand falls down and comes to lie on his suit jacket, coaxing a sharp pull of his breath, but he doesn\u2019t stop me; he just watches as I gently feel his torso over his clothing, marvelling at the solidness beneath.</p><p>Then his eyes flick up to mine, and his head slowly falls forward, his breath heating my face as he nears until I finally close my eyes and brace myself for those lips. He\u2019s getting closer. His scent is intensifying and my face is scorching from his hot breath.</p><p>But the happy chatter of women breaks the moment, and I\u2019m suddenly being hauled down the row of cubicles and shoved in the very last one. The door slams and I\u2019m whirled around, pinned to the back of the door with his palm over my mouth, his face close to mine. My whole body is heaving as we stare at each other, listening to the women preen in the mirror, reapplying lipsticks and refreshing perfume. I\u2019m mentally yelling at them to hurry the hell up so we can pick up where we left off. I could very nearly feel his lips brushing over mine, and it\u2019s just increased my desire for him tenfold.</p><p>It seems like an age, but the chatter eventually fades. My heavy breathing doesn\u2019t, though, not even when he allows air into my mouth by removing his hand.</p> <p>His forehead meets mine and his eyes clench shut. \u2018You\u2019re too sweet. I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 He lifts me and removes me from the doorway before hastily exiting, leaving me a stupid bag of pent-up lust. I\u2019m too sweet? I let out a sardonic snap of laughter. I\u2019m angry again \u2013 pissed off and ready to track him down to tell him who gets to decide what I want. And it\u2019s not him.</p><p>Letting myself out of the cubicle, I run a quick check over my face and body in the mirror, concluding I look harassed, before exiting the bathroom and making my way to the kitchen.</p><p>I spot Sylvie appearing from the kitchen entrance. \u2018There you are! We were just going to send a search party.\u2019 She hurries toward me, her face turning from amused concern to concerned concern. \u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 I brush her off, concluding that I must look as shook up as I feel. I don\u2019t hang around for Sylvie to press further, instead grabbing a bottle of champagne and ignoring her inquisitive stare. It\u2019s empty. \u2018Are there any more bottles?\u2019 I ask, dumping it down a little too harshly. I\u2019m shaking.</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 she replies slowly, passing me a freshly opened replacement.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I smile. It\u2019s strained, and she knows it, but I can\u2019t shake my grievance or my irritation.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sylvie.\u2019 I pause from pouring and take a deep breath, turning and fixing a sincere smile on my harassed face. \u2018Honestly, I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p> <p>She nods, unconvinced, but she helps me pour rather than digging further. \u2018I guess we should get serving, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We should,\u2019 I agree, sliding my tray from the counter and swinging it up to my shoulder. \u2018I\u2019m out of here.\u2019 I leave Sylvie and brave the crowds of people, but I\u2019m not as attentive to the guests as I was before. I don\u2019t smile half as much when offering out the champagne, and I\u2019m constantly scanning the room for him. I\u2019m quick to restock in the kitchen so I can return to the masses, I\u2019m not paying a bit of attention to my surroundings, and I\u2019m at risk of making a complete fool of myself for a second time if my lack of attention causes me to bump into something and drop my tray again.</p><p>But I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I have an unreasonable need to see him again . . . and then something makes me turn, an invisible power pulling my body toward the source.</p><p>He\u2019s there.</p><p>I\u2019m frozen in place, tray hovering between my shoulder and my waist, and he\u2019s studying me, a tumbler of dark liquid hovering at his mouth. It draws my eyes to his lips \u2013 the lips I nearly tasted.</p><p>My senses heighten when he slowly raises the glass and tips the contents down his throat before wiping his mouth with the back of his hand and placing the empty on Sylvie\u2019s tray as she passes. Sylvie does a double-take, and then swings around, clearly looking for me. Her wide browns land on me briefly before she starts flicking eyes full of intrigue, mixed with a little worry, back and forth between me and this confounding man.</p><p>He\u2019s staring \u2013 really staring, and his companion must get curious, because she turns, following his line of vision until she\u2019s looking at me. She smiles slyly, lifting her empty champagne flute. Panic sets in.</p><p>Sylvie\u2019s gone, leaving it down to me to fulfil her request. The woman wiggles the glass in mid-air, a prompt to get my arse in gear, and my curiosity, coupled with my lack of bad manners, prevents me from ignoring her. So I make my way towards them \u2013 her still smiling, him still staring \u2013 until I\u2019m standing before them, offering the tray to them. Her attempt to make me feel inferior is obvious, but I\u2019m too intrigued to care.</p><p>\u2018Take your time, sweetheart,\u2019 she purrs, taking a glass and extending it to him. \u2018Miller?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he says quietly, accepting the drink.</p><p>Miller? His name\u2019s Miller? I c**k my head at him, and for the first time, his lips tip knowingly. I\u2019m sure that if he really let go, he\u2019d probably knock me out with his smile.</p><p>\u2018Run along now,\u2019 the woman says, turning her back on me and pulling a reluctant Miller with her, but her rudeness doesn\u2019t dampen down my inner delight. I turn on my Converse, happy to leave with the knowledge of his name. I don\u2019t turn back, either.</p><p>Sylvie\u2019s on me like a wolf when I enter the kitchen, just as I knew she would be. \u2018Holy, shitting hell!\u2019 I wince at her burst of bad language and set my tray down. \u2018He\u2019s staring at you, Livy. I mean proper burning eyes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 You\u2019d have to be blind or utterly stupid not to notice.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s with a woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I might be pleased to have learned his name, but I\u2019m not so pleased about that part. Not that I have any right to feel jealous. Jealous? Is that what I am? It\u2019s an emotion I\u2019ve never experienced before.</p><p>\u2018Oohh, I\u2019m feeling something,\u2019 Sylvie chants, laughing as she sashays out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Yes. Me too,\u2019 I muse to myself, turning to look back at the entrance, knowing he watched my every step back here.</p><p>I avoid him for the rest of the evening but definitely feel his eyes on me as I weave through the crowds. I feel a constant pull in his direction and struggle to keep my eyes from drifting over, but I\u2019m proud of myself for resisting. While it\u2019s an unfamiliar pleasure to lose myself in his steely gaze, I could risk ruining it by seeing him with another woman.</p><p>After saying my good-byes to Del and Sylvie, I push my way out of the staff entrance into the midnight air and head for the Tube, looking forward to curling up in bed and having a morning lie-in.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s just a business associate.\u2019 His soft voice from behind halts me, stroking my skin, but I don\u2019t turn around. \u2018I know you\u2019re wondering.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to explain yourself to me.\u2019 I continue walking, knowing exactly what I\u2019m doing. He\u2019s taken by me, and I may not be familiar with the chasing game, but I do know that I shouldn\u2019t appear desperate, even if, annoyingly, I am. I\u2019m sensible; I know a bad thing when I see it, and standing behind me is a man who could crush my logic.</p><p>My arm is seized, halting my escape, and I\u2019m swung around to face him. If I were strong enough, I\u2019d close my eyes so I don\u2019t have to soak up his exquisite face. I\u2019m not strong enough, though.</p><p>\u2018No, I don\u2019t have to explain myself, yet here I am doing exactly that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I don\u2019t pull my arm from his grip because the heat of his touch is working its way through my denim jacket and warming my chilly skin, setting my blood alight. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it.</p><p>\u2018You really don\u2019t want to get involved with me.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t sound convinced of that himself, so he must be kidding himself if he expects me to buy it. I want to buy it. I want to walk away and wipe my encounters with him from my mind and return to being stable and sensible.</p><p>\u2018Then let me leave,\u2019 I say quietly, meeting the intensity of his stare with my own. The long silence that falls and lingers between us is an indication that he really doesn\u2019t want to, but I decide for him and remove my arm from his grasp. \u2018Goodnight, Miller.\u2019 I take a few backward steps before turning and walking away. It\u2019s probably one of the most sensible decisions I\u2019ve ever made, even if the majority of my scrambled mind is willing me to pursue it. Whatever it is.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The lingering strangeness of Friday evening was soon hijacked by Nan on Saturday morning when she said my three favourite words: \u2018Let\u2019s go sightseeing.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We roamed, we sat, we drank good coffee, we roamed some more, we had lunch, we drank more good coffee and we roamed again, finally falling through the front door late Saturday evening with a fish and chip supper from the local chippy. Then on Sunday, I helped Nan stitch together the patchwork quilt that she\u2019s been making for a soldier based in Afghanistan. She has no idea who he is, but the local oldies group all have pen pals out there, and Nan thought it\u2019d be nice if hers had something to keep him warm . . . in the desert.</p><p>\u2018Have you got the sun tucked away in your socks, Livy?\u2019 Nan asks as I walk into the kitchen ready for work on Monday morning.</p><p>I look down at my new canary-yellow Converse and smile. \u2018Don\u2019t you love them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wonderful!\u2019 she laughs, placing my bowl of cornflakes on the breakfast table. \u2018How\u2019s your knee?\u2019</p> <p>Sitting down, I tap my leg and pick up my spoon. \u2018Perfect. What are you doing today, Nan?\u2019</p><p>\u2018George and I are going to the market to buy lemons for your cake.\u2019 She places a pot of tea on the table and loads my mug with two sugars.</p><p>\u2018Nan, I don\u2019t take sugar!\u2019 I try to swipe the mug from the table, but my grandmother\u2019s old hands work way too fast.</p><p>\u2018You need fattening up,\u2019 she insists, pouring the tea and pushing it across the table to me. \u2018Don\u2019t argue with me, Livy. I\u2019ll put you over my knee.\u2019</p><p>I smile at her threat. She\u2019s promised it for twenty-four years and never followed through. \u2018You can get lemons at the local store,\u2019 I point out casually, plunging my spoon into my mouth to stop me from saying more. I could say so much more.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019 Her old navy eyes flick to me briefly before she slurps her tea. \u2018But I want to go to the market and George said he\u2019d take me. We\u2019ll speak no more of it.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m desperately holding back my grin, but I know when to shut up. Old George is so fond of Nan, but she\u2019s really quite short with him. I don\u2019t know why he sticks around to be bossed about. She plays all hard-hearted and uninterested, but I know George\u2019s fondness for her is quietly returned. Gramps has been gone for seven years and George could never replace him, but a little companionship is good for Nan. Losing her daughter sent her into dark depression, but Granddad took care of her, suffering in silence for years, silently coming to terms with his own loss and hiding his own grief until his body gave in. Then there was just me \u2013 a teenager left to hold it together . . . which I didn\u2019t do a very good job of in the early days.</p><p>She starts to top up my bowl with more flakes. \u2018I\u2019m going to Monday club at six, so I won\u2019t be home when you get in from work. Can you sort your supper out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 I say, holding my hand over my bowl to stop the flow of cornflakes. \u2018Is George going, too?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 she warns sternly.</p><p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 I smile as I\u2019m attacked by annoyed eyes, and she shakes her head, her grey curls swishing around her ears.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s a very sad situation when I socialise more than my granddaughter.\u2019</p><p>Her words kill my smile. I\u2019m not getting into this. \u2018I need to go to work.\u2019 I stand and dip to kiss her cheek, ignoring her sigh.</p><p>I jump down from the bus, dodging people as I hurry through the chaos of rush-hour pedestrian traffic. My mood reflects the colour of my Converse \u2013 bright and sunny, as does the weather.</p><p>After navigating through the back streets of Mayfair, I push my way into the bistro, finding it jam-packed already, just like it was last Monday when I started working for Del. I don\u2019t have time to chat with Sylvie or apologise to Del again for the fiasco on Friday. My apron is thrown at me, and I swing into action, immediately clearing four tables of empty cups before the vacated seating is snapped up by more arriving customers. I smile, deliver quickly and clear the tables even faster. I really am a natural at this service-with-a-smile business.</p><p>Come five o\u2019clock, my yellow Converse aren\u2019t feeling so bright any more. My feet are aching, my calves are aching, and my head is aching. But I still smile when Sylvie slaps my backside as she passes me. \u2018You\u2019ve only been here a week and I already don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u2019</p><p>My smile widens as I watch her push through the swing door into the kitchen, but it soon falls away when I turn and come face to face with him again. I\u2019m not particularly big on fate or things happening for a reason. I believe that you\u2019re the master of your own destiny \u2013 your own decisions and actions are what influence your life course. But unfortunately, the decisions and actions of others impact this course, too, and sometimes you\u2019re powerless to prevent it. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve closed myself off from the world \u2013 shut myself away and rejected any person, potential situation, or possibility that may take the control away from me. I\u2019m perfectly happy admitting it to myself. Someone else\u2019s poor, selfish choices have already affected my life too much. What I\u2019m not happy about is my sudden inability to continue with my sensible strategy, probably when it\u2019s most important that I do.</p><p>And the reason for this lapse in strength is standing in front of me.</p><p>The familiar feeling of my heartbeat increasing should tell me all I need to know, and it does. I\u2019m attracted to him \u2013 really attracted to him. But what\u2019s he doing here? He hated my coffee, and while I\u2019ve been making endless perfect cups of the stuff all day long, I suspect that may change now.</p> <p>He\u2019s just staring at me again. I should be annoyed but I\u2019m in no position to ask him what the hell he\u2019s looking at because I\u2019m staring at him, too. He\u2019s displaying his usual impassive expression. Can he smile? Does he have bad teeth? He looks like he has perfect teeth. Everything I can see is perfect, and I know that everything I can\u2019t will be, too. He\u2019s dressed in a three-piece suit again, this one navy, making his blue eyes brighter. He looks as perfect and as expensive as ever.</p><p>I need to speak. This is silly, but it takes Sylvie to swing the kitchen door into my back to knock me out of my trance. \u2018Oh!\u2019 she exclaims, steadying me by clenching my arm. She scans my startled face, worried when I don\u2019t respond or make any effort to move. Then her gaze shifts and her mouth gapes a little. \u2018Oh . . . she whispers, releasing her grip, her eyes flicking from me to him. \u2018I\u2019ll just . . . um . . . empty the bins.\u2019 She deserts me, leaving me to serve him. I want to yell for her to come back, but once again, my tongue is tied and I\u2019m bloody staring.</p><p>He braces his hands on the counter, leaning forward, and that lock of hair falls onto his forehead, diverting my eyes just north of his. \u2018You\u2019re watching me very closely,\u2019 he murmurs.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re watching me, too,\u2019 I point out, finding my tongue. He\u2019s really watching me. \u2018You\u2019re not doing very well at keeping away.\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t entertain my observation. \u2018How old are you?\u2019 His gaze drags slowly down my body before returning to my eyes. I don\u2019t answer, but I do frown as his eyebrow arches expectantly. \u2018I asked you a question.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Twenty-four,\u2019 I answer quickly, when I really wanted to tell him to mind his own damn business.</p><p>\u2018Are you involved with anyone?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I stun myself with my willing answer. I always claim to be in a relationship when any man shows his interest. It\u2019s like I\u2019m under a spell.</p><p>He nods thoughtfully. \u2018Are you going to ask me what I\u2019d like?\u2019</p><p>By that I\u2019m hoping he means what he\u2019d like to drink. Or am I? Does he want to pick up where we left off? I start twisting the antique sapphire eternity ring that Granddad bought for Nan, an obvious sign of my nerves. It\u2019s been in the exact spot for three years after Nan gave it to me for my twenty-first birthday and has been a source of twiddling ever since. \u2018What would you like?\u2019 My confidence of Friday night is nowhere to be found. I\u2019m a wreck.</p><p>His piercing blues seem to darken slightly. \u2018An Americano, four shots, two sugars and topped up halfway.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stabbed by disappointment, which is ridiculous. What\u2019s also ridiculous is that he\u2019s returned after claiming my coffee was the worst he\u2019d ever tasted. \u2018I thought you didn\u2019t like my coffee.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t.\u2019 He pushes himself away from the counter. \u2018But I\u2019d like to give you the chance to redeem yourself, Livy.\u2019</p><p>My cheeks heat.</p><p>\u2018Would you like to try to redeem yourself?\u2019 He\u2019s completely poker-faced, totally serious.</p><p>I should search deep to find that bad bone that Nan keeps telling me about and tell him where to go, but I don\u2019t search very hard. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I say instead, turning towards the wretched coffee machine that I know is going to let me down. I would undoubtedly do a better job if I wasn\u2019t under such close scrutiny.</p><p>Sending a little mental prayer to the coffee gods, I start with the first of four shots, working hard to regulate my broken breathing. I undertake my task slowly and accurately, not caring if it takes me all night. Stupidly, I want him to enjoy this one.</p><p>In my peripheral vision, I see Sylvie\u2019s curious head pop through the swing door, and I know she\u2019s desperate to know what\u2019s going on. I can feel her grinning, even if I can\u2019t see it. I\u2019d like her to come out and break the awkward silence, give me someone comfortable to speak to, but I also don\u2019t want her to. I want to be alone with him. I\u2019m drawn to him, and I absolutely cannot help it.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I top up his takeaway cup and secure a lid before turning to deliver it to him. He\u2019s sitting down again, and I immediately realise my error. He\u2019s not even tasted it and I\u2019ve already cocked up.</p><p>He focuses his blues on the cardboard cup, but I speak before he does. \u2018Would you like a proper cup?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take the takeaway.\u2019 His eyes lift to mine. \u2018It might taste better.\u2019 He\u2019s not smiling, but I get the feeling he wants to.</p><p>Walking carefully, even though the risk of spilling is minimal with a lid, I approach him and hold out the cup. \u2018I hope you enjoy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So do I,\u2019 he says, taking it and nodding at the sofa opposite. \u2018Join me.\u2019 He removes the lid and slowly blows the steam from his coffee, his already kissable lips seeming to invite me in. Everything he does with that mouth is slow \u2013 from talking to blowing steam from hot coffee. It\u2019s all so very deliberate, and it makes me wonder what else would be. He\u2019s beyond beautiful, if a little stand-offish. He must turn heads everywhere he goes.</p><p>He cocks a brow and indicates the sofa opposite again. My legs move forward of their own volition to take a seat. \u2018How is the coffee?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>He takes a slow sip of his Americano, and I find myself tensing, bracing for him to spit it out. He doesn\u2019t. He nods in approval, taking another sip, and I relax, stupidly relieved that he doesn\u2019t seem disgusted. His eyes lift. \u2018You may have noticed that I\u2019m quite fascinated by you as well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As well?\u2019 I ask, confused.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s rather obvious you\u2019re fascinated by me.\u2019</p><p>What an arrogant prick. \u2018I suppose lots of women must be fascinated by you,\u2019 I retort. \u2018Do you invite them all for coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, just you.\u2019 He leans closer and the look in his eyes practically takes my breath away. I\u2019ve never been the subject of such intense focus. It\u2019s too much.</p><p>I break the eye contact and find myself looking away, but then I remember something and force myself to confront his intensity. \u2018Who was that woman at the party?\u2019 I ask, not the least bit embarrassed to enquire. He came right out and asked me what my relationship status is, so I have every right to know his. She looked far too familiar to be a business associate. I\u2019m not holding my breath, but I\u2019m still hoping he is single. The idea that this man is available is ridiculous, and so is the fact that I want him be \u2013 I want him to be available . . . for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Business,\u2019 he replies, watching me carefully, his smooth tone stroking my heated skin.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re single?\u2019 I ask, wanting complete clarification, but for what purpose I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m actually wondering what my subconscious is planning, because I haven\u2019t a clue . . . nor am I concerned, and that should really concern me.</p><p>\u2018I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 is all I say, still watching him, feeling quietly delighted. Now I want to know how old he is. He seems mature and his clothes have been of the highest quality every time I\u2019ve seen him, screaming money.</p> <p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he counters, slowly sipping more coffee as I look on. He\u2019s like a giant mass of intensity, enticing me into . . . something. \u2018I enjoyed my coffee,\u2019 he says, placing his cup down and swivelling it, before slowly rising from the couch. My gaze follows him up until I feel small under his potent, piercing blues, looking down at me.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re leaving?\u2019 I blurt, shocked. What was all this about? What was his point?</p><p>He shifts uncomfortably and puts his hand out to me. \u2018It was a pleasure to meet you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We already met,\u2019 I point out. \u2018You nearly kissed me but walked away.\u2019</p><p>His hand drops a little at my sharp words before he gathers himself and raises it again. \u2018And then you walked away from me.\u2019</p> <p>So it\u2019s a game? He\u2019s unhappy because I was the one who walked away, so now he\u2019s returning the favour, having the final say? His hand comes closer and I recoil, too scared to touch him.</p><p>\u2018Do you think there will be sparks?\u2019 he asks quietly.</p><p>My eyes widen. I know there will be sparks because I\u2019ve felt them already. His mocking injects some bravery into me and my petite hand lifts to meet his. And there they are again. Sparks. Not electricity firing off all over the bistro, causing us both to gasp or jump back in shock, but there\u2019s something there, and instead of firing outward, it\u2019s shooting inward, ricocheting all over my body, making my heart beat faster and my lips part. I don\u2019t want to let go, but he flexes his palm, prompting me to release him.</p><p>Then he turns and strides out, without another word or look to suggest that he felt something too. Did he? What was that? Who is he? My palms rise to my cheeks and I rub furiously, trying to scrub some sensibility into me. I\u2019m way too intrigued by him, and no amount of sightseeing or quilting with my grandmother is going to distract me from where my thoughts are wandering to, not after that brief but enlightening conversation. I\u2019m getting into unknown territory \u2013 dangerous territory. After my years of avoiding all men, even the decent ones, I\u2019m finding myself encouraging one who looks like he should definitely be left alone.</p><p>There\u2019s a pull, though \u2013 a very powerful pull.</p><p>I\u2019ve been away with the fairies all week. Every time the bistro door swings open, I look for him. But he\u2019s never there. A dozen men over the last four days have asked me my name, my number, or they\u2019ve told me what stunning eyes I have. And each one I\u2019ve wished could be Miller.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been busy churning out perfect coffee after perfect coffee, and I even waitressed at another posh function for Del on Tuesday, hoping he\u2019d be there. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019ve always tried to keep my life simple, but now I\u2019m craving a complication \u2013 a tall, dark-haired, mysterious complication.</p><p>It\u2019s Saturday, and Gregory has humoured me, tagging along for a walk through the Royal Parks. He knows there is something on my mind. He kicks a pile of leaves as we traipse down the middle of Green Park, towards Buckingham Palace. He wants to ask, and I know he won\u2019t hold out for much longer. He\u2019s made all of the conversation, while I\u2019ve returned one-word answers. I\u2019m not going to get away with it for much longer. I\u2019m clearly absent in mind, and I could probably muster up the energy to feign my normal self, but I don\u2019t think I want to. I think I want Gregory to press me so I can share Miller with him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve met someone.\u2019 The words fall from my mouth, breaking the comfortable silence between us. He looks shocked, which is okay because I\u2019m quite shocked, too.</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019 he asks, pulling me to a stop.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I shrug, lowering my bum to the grass and picking at some of the blades. \u2018He turned up at the bistro a few times and also at a gala ball where I waitressed.\u2019</p><p>Gregory joins me, his handsome face morphing into a big grin. \u2018Olivia Taylor has been affected by a man?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, Olivia Taylor has most definitely been affected by a man.\u2019 It feels like such a relief to share my burden. \u2018I can\u2019t stop thinking about him,\u2019 I admit.</p> <p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 Gregory throws his arms in the air. \u2018Is he hot?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stupidly.\u2019 I smile. \u2018He has the most amazing eyes. As blue as the sky.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to know everything,\u2019 Gregory declares.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s nothing more to tell.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what did he say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He asked if I was involved with anyone.\u2019 I try to sound casual, but I know what\u2019s coming.</p><p>His eyes widen as he leans forward. \u2018And you said?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s happened!\u2019 he sings. \u2018Thank the f**king Lord, it\u2019s finally happened!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Gregory!\u2019 I scold him, but I can\u2019t help laughing too. He\u2019s right; it has happened, and it\u2019s happened hard.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Livy.\u2019 He sits up straight, looking all serious. \u2018You don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been waiting for this. I need to see him.\u2019</p><p>I scoff, pushing my hair over my shoulder. \u2018Well, that\u2019s unlikely. He appears quickly and disappears faster.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How old?\u2019 The excitement on Gregory\u2019s face is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. I\u2019ve made his day \u2013 probably his month, or even his year. He\u2019s tried relentlessly to drag me out to bars, even willing to make them straight bars if it means I\u2019ll tag along. Gregory has been in my life for eight years, just eight, although it could be forever. The \u2018it\u2019 boy at school, all of the girls swooned over him and he dated them all, but he had a little secret \u2013 a secret that saw him ostracised once it was discovered. The cool kid was g*y. Or eighty per cent g*y, as Gregory has always claimed. Finding him behind the bike sheds, beaten to a pulp by some of the college kids, was the beginning of our friendship.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m guessing late-twenties, but he seems older. You know, very mature. He always wears very expensive-looking suits.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Perfect.\u2019 He rubs his hands together. \u2018Name?\u2019</p><p>\u2018M,\u2019 I say quietly.</p><p>\u2018\u201cM\u201d?\u2019 Gregory\u2019s face screws up into a disapproving frown. \u2018Who is he? James Bond\u2019s boss?\u2019</p><p>A burst of laughter flies from my mouth, and I giggle to myself while my friend looks on, waiting for confirmation that my muse has a name beyond one letter of the alphabet. \u2018He signed with an M.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Signed?\u2019 His confusion deepens, as does his scowl. I\u2019m not sure if I should divulge this part.</p><p>\u2018He didn\u2019t like my coffee and chose to let me know by writing it on a napkin. He signed it M, but I\u2019ve since found out that his name is Miller.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oooohhh, sexy! But the cheek!\u2019 He\u2019s shocked, displaying a similar reaction to what I did, but then his face straightens and he narrows his eyes on me. \u2018And how did that make you feel?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Inadequate.\u2019 I say the word without thought, and I don\u2019t stop there. \u2018Stupid, angry, irritated.\u2019</p><p>Gregory\u2019s smiling now. \u2018He drew a reaction?\u2019 he asks. \u2018You got a little mad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I breathe, completely exasperated. \u2018I was really pissed off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh my God! I already love him.\u2019 He stands and puts his hand out to pull me up. \u2018I bet he\u2019s completely taken by you, like most men on God\u2019s green earth.\u2019</p><p>Accepting his offer, I let him pull me to my feet. \u2018They\u2019re not.\u2019 I sigh, reflecting on the brief words that we exchanged; on one line in particular: I\u2019m quite fascinated by you, as well.</p><p>Does fascinated equal attracted?</p><p>\u2018Trust me, they are.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly eager to spit it all out and see what Gregory makes of it. \u2018I was a millimetre away from his lips.\u2019</p><p>Gregory inhales sharply. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 His back straightens, and he narrows his eyes on me. \u2018Did you bottle it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I was the one pushing it.\u2019 I\u2019m not even ashamed. \u2018He said he couldn\u2019t and left me in the ladies\u2019 feeling like a desperate idiot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Were you mad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Furious.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 His hands slap together, and I\u2019m yanked into his embrace. \u2018This is good. Tell me more.\u2019</p><p>I spill the whole thing \u2013 the dropped champagne, Miller\u2019s \u2018business associate\u2019, the way he approached me afterwards just to warn me off.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, Gregory hums thoughtfully. It\u2019s not the reaction I was expecting or that I wanted. \u2018He\u2019s a player. Not the right man for you, Livy. Forget about him.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m shocked, and the quick removal of my body from his, coupled with the reproachful look on my face, tells him so. \u2018Forget? Are you mad? The way he looks at me, Gregory \u2013 it makes me want to be looked at like that forever.\u2019 I pause briefly. \u2018By him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh dear, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>I sigh. \u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Distraction,\u2019 he declares, looking down at my orange Converse. \u2018What colour shall we buy today?\u2019</p><p>My eyes light up. \u2018I\u2019ve seen some in sky-blue down on Carnaby Street.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sky-blue, eh?\u2019 His arm slips around my shoulder and we start towards the Tube station. \u2018Fancy that.\u2019</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Sylvie and I are the last to leave the bistro. While Sylvie locks up, I cart the rubbish into the alley and dump it in the wheelie bin.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to have a long soak in the bath,\u2019 Sylvie says, linking arms with me as we start wandering down the road. \u2018With candles.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not going out tonight?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Nope. Mondays are shite, but Wednesday nights are bombing. You should come.\u2019 Her brown eyes twinkle suggestively, but dull straight down when she clocks me shaking my head. \u2018Why not?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t drink.\u2019 We cross the road, dodging the evening rush-hour traffic, getting honked at for not using the pedestrian crossing.</p><p>\u2018Oh, f**k you!\u2019 Sylvie shouts, drawing a million looks in our direction.</p><p>\u2018Sylvie!\u2019 I yank her from the road, mortified.</p><p>She laughs and flips the driver a finger. \u2018Why don\u2019t you drink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t trust myself.\u2019 The words just fall from my lips, shocking me and clearly shocking Sylvie, because startled brown eyes swing to me . . . then she grins.</p><p>\u2018I think I might like drunken Livy.\u2019</p><p>I scoff in disagreement. \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019 I point to the bus stop as I step into the road, ready to cross again.</p><p>\u2018See you tomorrow.\u2019 She leans in to kiss my cheek, and we both jump when we\u2019re honked at again. I ignore the impatient idiot, but Sylvie doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018For f**k\u2019s sake! What is wrong with these people?\u2019 she shouts. \u2018We\u2019re not even in the way of your fancy AMG, you Mercedes-driving ponce!\u2019 She steps towards the car just as the passenger window starts to slip down. I feel road rage brewing. She leans in. \u2018Learn to f**king dr\u2014\u2019 She halts her rant, her back straightening as she pulls away from the black Mercedes.</p><p>Curious, I lean down to find out what\u2019s shut her up, my heart skipping too many beats when I register the driver.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 Sylvie\u2019s voice is barely heard over the rush of traffic and blurting of horns. She steps away from the roadside. \u2018I think he may have been honking at you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m still partially bent as my eyes trail from Sylvie back to the car, where he\u2019s sitting back, relaxed, with one hand draped casually on the steering wheel. \u2018Get in,\u2019 he orders shortly.</p><p>I know I\u2019m getting in this car, so I don\u2019t know why I look to Sylvie for guidance. She shakes her head. \u2018Livy, I wouldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t know him.\u2019</p><p>I return to vertical and my mouth opens to speak, but no words form. She\u2019s right and I\u2019m torn, my eyes swinging from the car to my new friend. I\u2019m not careless or stupid \u2013 haven\u2019t been for a long time \u2013 although every thought running through my mind right now is flooring that claim. I don\u2019t know how long I stand there deliberating, but I\u2019m distracted when the driver\u2019s door of the Mercedes swings open and he strides around the car, clasping my elbow and opening the passenger door.</p><p>\u2018Hey!\u2019 Sylvie tries to reclaim me. \u2018What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m pushed into the seat before he turns towards a stunned Sylvie. \u2018I\u2019m just going to talk to her.\u2019 He takes a pen and paper from his inside pocket and scribbles something down before handing it to Sylvie. \u2018That\u2019s me. Ring the number.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Sylvie snatches the paper from his hand and runs her eyes over it.</p><p>\u2018Ring the number.\u2019</p><p>Landing him with a reproachful glare, she drags her phone from her bag and dials. A mobile starts screeching, and he pulls an iPhone from his inside pocket before handing it to me.</p><p>\u2018She has my phone. Ring it and she\u2019ll answer.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I could ring hers,\u2019 Sylvie points out, ending the call. \u2018What the hell does that prove? You could take it off her the second you drive away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I guess you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it.\u2019 He shuts the door and strides around the car, leaving Sylvie on the pavement, her mouth agape.</p><p>I should jump out, but I don\u2019t. I should protest and curse at him, but I don\u2019t. Instead, I look to my friend on the pavement and hold up the iPhone that Miller\u2019s just handed me. She\u2019s right; this proves nothing, but it doesn\u2019t deter me from doing something incredibly stupid \u2013 I\u2019m not frightened of him, though. He\u2019s no danger to me, except, maybe, to my heart.</p><p>More car horns start screeching around us as he slides into the car before pulling hastily away from the kerb without a word. I don\u2019t feel nervous. I\u2019ve practically been abducted on a busy London street and my stomach isn\u2019t even turning in panic. It is, however, fluttering with something else. I discreetly look across to him, noting his dark suit and stunning profile. I\u2019ve never seen anything like him. It\u2019s silent in the enclosed space surrounding us, but something is speaking and it\u2019s neither Miller nor I. It\u2019s desire. And it\u2019s telling me that I\u2019m about to experience something life-altering. I want to know where he\u2019s taking me, I want to know what he wants to talk about, but my desire for this knowledge doesn\u2019t prompt me to ask, and he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s going to offer the information up right now, so I relax back into the soft leather of my seat and remain quiet. Then the stereo kicks in and I\u2019m suddenly listening in wonder to Green Day\u2019s \u2018Boulevard of Broken Dreams\u2019, a track I would never have paired with this mysterious man.</p><p>We\u2019re in the car for a long half-hour, stopping and starting with the rush-hour traffic, until he pulls into an underground car park. He seems to be thinking hard as he shuts off the engine and taps his hand on the wheel a few times before letting himself out and making his way around to me. Opening the door, he finds my eyes, and I can see reassurance in them as he holds his hand out to me. \u2018Give me your hand.\u2019</p><p>My response is automatic, my hand lifting to take his as I remove myself from the car while savouring that familiar feeling of internal lightning bolts attacking me. It\u2019s more incredible each time I experience it.</p> <p>\u2018There it is again,\u2019 he murmurs, repositioning his hand to get a better grip on me. He feels it, too. \u2018Give me your bag.\u2019</p><p>I hand him my bag immediately, involuntarily, not even thinking about it. I\u2019m on autopilot.</p><p>\u2018Do you have my phone?\u2019 he asks, lightly kicking the door of his car shut and pulling me towards a stairwell.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I hold it up.</p><p>\u2018Ring your friend and tell her you\u2019re at my place.\u2019 He pushes through the door. \u2018And call anyone else who might be worried about you.\u2019</p><p>I can do nothing more than follow him as he takes the stairs slowly, still clasping my hand, leaving me to make the calls he\u2019s demanded. \u2018I should use my phone,\u2019 I say, fiddling with his iPhone. My clued-up nan will soon clock the strange number on the caller display and start asking questions \u2013 questions I don\u2019t want to answer or even know how to.</p><p>\u2018Your decision.\u2019 His lean shoulders shrug as he continues pulling me along behind him. When we pass floor three, my calves begin to burn and my lips part to try and get some air into my tiring lungs.</p><p>\u2018What floor are you?\u2019 I ask on a little wheeze, ashamed of my fitness level. I walk a lot, but I don\u2019t climb this many stairs on a regular basis.</p> <p>\u2018Ten,\u2019 he flips over his shoulder casually. The knowledge of six more floors deflates my lungs altogether and makes my legs seize up.</p><p>\u2018Are there no lifts?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why . . . I only have air capacity for a gasp and I let one out when he quickly scoops me up and pushes onward. I have no option but to cling onto his shoulders, my hold feeling right, my nose and eyes enjoying the closeness.</p><p>When we reach floor ten he pushes his way through the doorway into an empty corridor, then drops me to my feet and puts the key into the lock of a shiny black door. \u2018After you.\u2019 He steps to the side and gestures for me to step in, which I do \u2013 without thought, protest or asking why he\u2019s brought me here.</p><p>I feel his palm on the base of my neck, warm and comforting, as I slowly make my way down the hallway, circling a huge round table, until the hallway opens up into a massive, marble-infested space with vaulted ceilings and colossal pieces of art at every turn, all paintings of London architecture. It\u2019s not the grandness of the apartment or the sea of cream marble that holds me rapt. It\u2019s those paintings \u2013 six of them, all carefully hung in selected spaces where they can be appreciated the most. They\u2019re not typical or traditional; they\u2019re abstract, making it so you need to squint to see exactly what each is. But I know these buildings and landmarks too well, and as I gaze around me I identify them all \u2013 no squinting required.</p><p>I\u2019m gently guided towards the biggest cream-coloured leather couch I\u2019ve ever seen. \u2018Sit.\u2019 He pushes me down and places my bag next to me. \u2018Call your friend,\u2019 he says, leaving me to find my phone while he strides over to a large walnut cabinet and retrieves a tumbler, topping it up with a dark liquid.</p><p>I dial Sylvie, and it rings only once before her fretful voice is piercing my ears. \u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s me,\u2019 I say quietly, watching as he turns and leans against the cabinet, taking a slow mouthful of his drink.</p><p>\u2018Where are you?\u2019 It sounds like she\u2019s jogging. Her voice is slightly breathless.</p><p>\u2018At his place. I\u2019m okay.\u2019 I feel awkward explaining myself while he\u2019s watching so intently, but there\u2019s no escaping his steel gaze.</p><p>\u2018Who the f**k does he think he is?\u2019 she asks incredulously. \u2018And you\u2019re beyond stupid for going, Livy. What were you thinking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I answer honestly, because I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ve allowed him to take me, bundle me in his car, and bring me to a strange apartment. I really am beyond stupid, but even now, when I\u2019m listening to my friend rant and rave down the phone and he\u2019s staring expressionless at me, I\u2019m not frightened.</p><p>\u2018Jesus,\u2019 she huffs. \u2018What are you doing? What\u2019s he saying? What does he want?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I watch him watching me as he takes another slow sip of his drink.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t know a f**king lot, do you?\u2019 she fires, her heavy breathing settling down.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I admit. \u2018I\u2019ll call you when I get home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d better.\u2019 Her tone is threatening. \u2018If I don\u2019t get a call by midnight, then I\u2019ll be ringing the police. I took his registration.\u2019</p><p>I smile to myself, appreciative of her concern but knowing deep down that it\u2019s not required. He\u2019s not going to hurt me. \u2018I\u2019ll call you,\u2019 I assure her.</p><p>\u2018Make sure you do.\u2019 She\u2019s still agitated. \u2018And be careful,\u2019 she adds more gently.</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 I hang up and immediately dial my nan, keen to finish up and find out why he\u2019s brought me here. It doesn\u2019t take much explaining to Nan. She\u2019s delighted when I tell her that I\u2019m joining a few work friends for a coffee, as I knew she would be.</p><p>I finish up and place both my phone and his on the gigantic low glass table in front of me, then I commence twiddling the ring on my finger, wondering what to say. We\u2019re just staring at each other, him taking frequent sips of his drink, me losing myself in that potent gaze.</p><p>\u2018Would you like a drink?\u2019 he asks. \u2018Wine, brandy?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u2018Vodka?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 Alcohol is a weakness he doesn\u2019t need to know about, although I don\u2019t think that I need alcohol to send me into reckless mode with this man. \u2018Why am I here?\u2019 I finally ask the operative question. I think I know, but I want him to say the words.</p><p>His fingers tap the side of his glass thoughtfully, and he pushes his tall body away from the cabinet, slowly walking towards me. He undoes his jacket button and lowers himself until he\u2019s sitting on the table in front of me, placing his drink carefully and breaking our eye contact to see where his glass has landed before tweaking it slightly and repositioning our mobile phones. My heart rate is speeding up, even more so when he faces me and clasps me under my knees, encouraging me to shift forward on the couch until there\u2019s only a few inches between our faces. He doesn\u2019t say anything, and neither do I. Our breathy gasps colliding between our close mouths are saying all that needs to be said. We\u2019re both bursting at the seams with desire.</p><p>His face moves forward, that lock of hair falling onto his forehead, but he\u2019s not aiming for my lips. He homes in on my cheek, breathing heavy, controlled breaths into my ear. My face pushing into his is involuntary, as is the heaviness settling between my thighs.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u2019 he whispers, his grasp of my knees increasing. \u2018I\u2019ve tried my hardest, but you\u2019re a constant vision wherever I look.\u2019</p><p>I inhale deeply and find my hands rising and seeking out his thick waves, my fingers threading through them, my eyes closing. \u2018You said you couldn\u2019t be with me,\u2019 I remind him, stupidly or not. I shouldn\u2019t point out his reluctance because if he withdraws now, I think I\u2019ll lose my mind.</p><p>\u2018I still can\u2019t.\u2019 His face slides across mine until his perfect forehead is resting against my confused one. He can\u2019t have brought me here just to reinforce his previous declaration. He can\u2019t hold me like this, speak to me like this, and then do nothing.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 I murmur, praying to every god that he doesn\u2019t halt this.</p><p>His forehead rolls across mine slowly, carefully. \u2018I have a proposition.\u2019 He must sense my confusion because he pulls away and scans my face. Taking a deep breath, I brace myself. \u2018All I can offer you is one night.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t need to ask what he\u2019s talking about. The dull ache in my stomach tells me exactly what he means. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m emotionally unavailable, Livy.\u2019 He reaches up to cup my cheek, his thumb stroking smooth circles on my temple. \u2018But I have to have you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You want me for one night and nothing else?\u2019 I ask, the ache transforming into a dull pain now. Just one night? It\u2019s obscene for me to be thinking further than that, though. The best f**k of my life. That\u2019s what he said. Nothing more.</p><p>\u2018One night,\u2019 he affirms. \u2018And I\u2019m praying that you\u2019ll give it to me.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m lost in his blues, desperately hoping he\u2019ll say something else \u2013 something that\u2019ll make me feel better, because right now I\u2019m feeling cheated, which is ridiculous. I hardly know him, but the thought of only being permitted one night with this man is soul-destroying.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think I can.\u2019 My eyes fall, as does my heart. \u2018It\u2019s not fair for you to ask that of me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve never claimed to be fair, Livy.\u2019 He clasps my chin and brings my face up to his. \u2018I\u2019ve seen something and I want it. I usually take what I want, but I\u2019m giving you a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s in it for me?\u2019 I ask. \u2018What will I get out of this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You get to be worshipped by me for twenty-four hours.\u2019 His lips part and his tongue sweeps across his full bottom lip, like he\u2019s attempting to make me see what those twenty-four hours may be like. He\u2019s wasting energy. I have a very good idea what those twenty-four hours will be like.</p><p>\u2018You said you could only offer me one night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Twenty-four hours, Livy.\u2019</p> <p>I want to say yes, but my head starts shaking, my integrity taking over. If I\u2019m going to get involved with a man, it can\u2019t be like this. Every method I\u2019ve adopted to protect myself from following in my mother\u2019s footsteps will be quashed if I do this, and I can\u2019t let myself down like that. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t.\u2019 I shouldn\u2019t be apologising for my decline of his unreasonable request, but I am sorry. I want to be worshipped by him, yet not enough to set myself up for certain devastation because that\u2019s exactly what this will result in. I already feel like I\u2019m in way above my head and he hasn\u2019t even kissed me.</p><p>He visibly sags and shifts back, breaking all contact between us. I feel a little lost, which should strengthen my decision to decline his offer. One night will never be enough. \u2018I\u2019m disappointed,\u2019 he sighs. \u2018But I respect your decision.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m disappointed that he respects my decision. I want him to fight harder, convince me to say yes. I\u2019m not thinking straight. \u2018I know nothing about you.\u2019</p><p>He picks up his drink and takes a sip, drawing my eyes to his lips. \u2018If you knew more, would you reconsider?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I feel frustrated and annoyed \u2013 annoyed that he\u2019s put me in this position. It should be an easy decision, declining a stranger on such a proposition, but the longer I spend with him, even if it\u2019s bizarre and far-fetched, the more I want to retract my answer and take the twenty-four hours he\u2019s offering.</p><p>\u2018Well, you know my name now.\u2019 His lips are tipping a little, but it\u2019s nowhere near a smile.</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s all I know,\u2019 I fire back. \u2018I don\u2019t know your surname, your age, your job.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you need to know all of that to spend the night with me?\u2019 His dark eyebrows raise, his lips tipping further. If he would only smile properly, I\u2019d feel like I know him more. But should I be increasing my fascination with him if it means I\u2019ll only get more attached?</p><p>I don\u2019t know, so I shrug non-committally and drop my head, my hair falling into my lap.</p><p>\u2018My name is Miller Hart,\u2019 he starts, pulling my eyes back to his. \u2018I\u2019m twenty-nine\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 I hold my hand up, halting his flow. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t need to know.\u2019</p><p>He cocks his head, slightly amused, even if he\u2019s still not demonstrating it with his mouth. \u2018Don\u2019t need to or don\u2019t want to?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Both,\u2019 I spit shortly, feeling the rarity of anger simmering inside me again. He made me feel irritated before he suggested something so ridiculous, but now I\u2019m really feeling it. I stand, prompting him to shift back on the table and gaze up at me. \u2018Thank you for the offer, but the answer is no.\u2019 I pick up my bag and phone and make for the door, getting no further than the end of the couch before I\u2019m taken gently and pushed front forward to the wall, my bag dropping to the marble, my eyes clenching shut.</p><p>His chin is on my shoulder, his mouth at my ear. \u2018You don\u2019t sound convinced,\u2019 he whispers, raising his knee between my thighs to spread them.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not,\u2019 I confess, cursing myself for my weakness. His body moulded to my back feels too right, when I desperately want it to feel all wrong. Everything suggests that this is wrong, but the crazy rightness is making it hard to ignore the warning signs.</p><p>\u2018And that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m not letting you leave until you agree. You want me.\u2019 He turns me around and pushes his palms into the wall on either side of my head. \u2018And I want you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But just for twenty-four hours.\u2019 My voice is a panting wheeze as I fight to rein in my erratic breathing.</p><p>He nods and lazily lowers his mouth to mine. He\u2019s unsure, hesitant; I can see it in his eyes. But then he braves nibbling at my bottom lip, pecking cautiously and whispering what seems like encouraging words to himself before pushing into my mouth with his tongue until I relax and accept his soft invasion. Nothing would prevent me from moaning, relaxing into his kiss and clasping his shoulders. It\u2019s heavenly, just like I knew it would be, but this isn\u2019t assisting with my sensibility. Nevertheless, I push my doubts to the back of my mind and lose myself in him. He\u2019s worshipping me, and the thought of twenty-four hours of this nearly makes me break our kiss, just so I can scream \u2018yes!\u2019 But I don\u2019t. Despite my enjoyment and mounting desire, I concentrate on enjoying the only kiss I\u2019m ever going to receive from Miller Hart. And it\u2019s one I\u2019ll remember for the rest of my life.</p><p>He groans, pushing his groin into my tummy. His hardness throbs against me. \u2018Jesus, you taste divine. Say yes,\u2019 he mumbles into my mouth, biting at my lip. \u2018Please say yes.\u2019</p><p>I want to hold back my answer, just to drag out this exquisite kiss, but I\u2019m rapidly falling deeper with each second he spends seducing my mouth. \u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 I gasp, turning my face to the side to break our mouth contact. \u2018I\u2019d want more.\u2019 I know I\u2019ll want more, as crazy as it might seem. I\u2019ve never looked for that connection, but if I had, then this would be it \u2013 something painfully good, all-consuming . . . something special and out of my control \u2013 something that will put my previous conclusions about intimacy to shame. I\u2019ve stumbled across it by accident, when I least expected it, but it\u2019s happened and I can\u2019t fall further knowing there is no hope and nothing but heartbreak waiting for me at the end of that twenty-four hours.</p><p>He releases a frustrated growl and pushes himself away from the wall. \u2018Shit,\u2019 he curses, striding away, looking up at the ceiling. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have brought you here.\u2019</p><p>I gather my muddled mind and straighten myself out, all the time leaning against the wall to hold myself steady. \u2018No, you shouldn\u2019t have,\u2019 I agree, proud for sounding certain of that. \u2018I should go.\u2019 I gather my bag from the floor and head quickly to the door, not looking back.</p><p>When I\u2019m in the safety of the stairwell, I collapse against the wall, my breathing laboured, my body shaking. I\u2019m being sensible. I need to keep reminding myself of that. Nothing good could come of this, except memories of an incredible day and night that I\u2019ll never get to relive. It would be torture, and I refuse to tease myself, give myself a taste of something amazing \u2013 because I know it will be \u2013 just to have it robbed from me. Never. I refuse to become my mother. Resolute and satisfied with my decision, I take the stairs and find my way to a Tube station. For the first time in many years, I need an alcoholic drink.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I\u2019ve not been myself all week. It\u2019s been noticed and mentioned, but my despondent state has halted further interrogation, except from Gregory, who I\u2019m sure is reporting back to Nan, because she went from curious and pushy to concerned and sympathetic. She\u2019s also made me lemon cake every single day.</p><p>I\u2019m clearing the last table, absent-mindedly swishing my cloth from side to side when the door to the bistro swings open and I\u2019m confronted with Mr Wide Eyes.</p><p>He smiles awkwardly, shutting the door quietly behind him. \u2018Am I too late for a takeaway?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018Not at all.\u2019 I grab my tray and dump it on the counter before loading up the filter. \u2018Cappuccino?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 he says politely, his footsteps getting closer.</p><p>I busy myself, ignoring Sylvie when she passes with the bins and pauses, clearly after clocking my customer. \u2018Cute,\u2019 she says simply, before continuing on her way. She\u2019s right; he is cute, but it\u2019s too much like hard work trying to fight another man from my mind to appreciate it. Mr Wide Eyes is the type of man I should pay more attention to \u2013 if I\u2019m going to give my attention to any men \u2013 not moody, dark, enigmatic ones, who only want twenty-four hours and nothing else.</p><p>Firing up the steam pipe, I start heating the milk, swirling the jug and making a rushing hissing of noise in time with my racing mind. I pour, sprinkle, and secure the lid, then turn to deliver my perfect coffee. \u2018Two-eighty, please.\u2019 I hold my hand out.</p><p>Three pound coins are placed carefully in my palm as I stab the order through the till with my free hand. \u2018I\u2019m Luke,\u2019 he says slowly. \u2018Can I ask your name?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 I flip, tossing the coins into the drawer carelessly.</p><p>\u2018And you\u2019re involved with someone?\u2019 he asks cautiously, drawing a frown from me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve already told you that.\u2019 For the first time, I allow his charming looks to push past my mental protective wall and the images of Miller. His mousy hair is floppy, but lies just right, and his brown eyes are warm and friendly. \u2018So why are you aski\u2014\u2019 I halt mid-sentence and cast my eyes over to Sylvie, who\u2019s just pushed her way back through the bistro door, minus two rubbish bags. I hit her with a reproachful look, knowing damn well she\u2019s told Mr Wide Eyes here that I\u2019m perfectly available.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hang around to soak up my animosity, instead skulking off to the kitchen where she\u2019s safe. Mr Wide Eyes, or Luke as I now know him, is shifting nervously, blatantly ignoring my guilty friend as she disappears from sight.</p><p>\u2018My friend has a big mouth.\u2019 I hand him his change. \u2018Enjoy your coffee.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why did you fob me off?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m not available.\u2019 I repeat myself because it\u2019s still true, even if it\u2019s for a totally different reason now. I might have refused Miller\u2019s offer, but it hasn\u2019t made forgetting him any easier. My fingers reach up and rest on my lips, feeling his soft, full ones still there, lingering, tickling, biting. I sigh. \u2018It\u2019s closing time.\u2019</p><p>Luke slides a card across the counter, and taps it lightly before releasing it. \u2018I\u2019d love to take you out sometime, so if you decide you\u2019re available it would be great to hear from you.\u2019 I look up and he winks, a cheeky smile spreading across his face.</p><p>I return his small smile and watch him leave the bistro, whistling happily as he goes.</p><p>\u2018Is it safe?\u2019 Sylvie\u2019s apprehensive voice drifts in from the kitchen, and I turn to see her black-haired head popping up over the swing door.</p><p>\u2018You told him, you traitor!\u2019 I start yanking at my apron string.</p><p>\u2018It might have slipped.\u2019 She still doesn\u2019t venture into the bistro, choosing to remain protected behind the swing door. \u2018Come on, Livy. Cut him a break.\u2019 Her attention is firmly set on Luke now, after I followed through on her request to call before midnight the night Miller snatched me from the roadside. I didn\u2019t tell her the details, but my despondent state down the line told her all she needed to know \u2013 no enlightenment of shocking propositions required. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Sylvie, I\u2019m not interested,\u2019 I argue idly, shaking my apron out and hanging it on the coat pegs.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t say that about the rude f**ker in the posh AMG.\u2019 She knows she shouldn\u2019t be mentioning him, but she has a point and every right to make it. \u2018I\u2019m just saying, that\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head in complete exasperation and push past her, heading into the kitchen to grab my jacket and satchel. All of these emotions \u2013 the annoyance, the irritation, the heavy heart and the uncertainty, are all a result of one thing . . .</p><p>A man.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u2019 I call, letting Sylvie lock up on her own.</p><p>My peaceful stroll toward the bus stop is short-lived when I hear Gregory calling me. Most uncharitably I sigh, pivoting slowly and not even bothering to plaster an insincere smile on my tired face.</p><p>He\u2019s in his gardening clothes, looking all grubby with blades of grass in his messed-up hair. As soon as he reaches me, his arm drapes over my shoulder and he pulls me into his side. \u2018Going home?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve come to give you a lift.\u2019 He sounds genuine, but I know different.</p> <p>\u2018Come to take me home or come to squeeze me for information?\u2019 I retort drily, earning myself a flick of his hip into my waist.</p><p>\u2018How are you feeling?\u2019</p><p>I think carefully about what word to use in an attempt to prevent further interrogation. He knows enough and has filled Nan in, too. I won\u2019t be enlightening him on the twenty-four-hour proposition, either, which I\u2019m now in two minds over. I said no and I feel like crap, so perhaps I should just dive right in and feel like crap, anyway. But at least I\u2019ll have an experience to remember while I\u2019m feeling like crap \u2013 something to relive.</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I answer eventually, letting Gregory lead the way to his van.</p><p>\u2018If he\u2019s said he\u2019s emotionally unavailable, Livy, it can\u2019t be a good sign. You\u2019ve made the right decision not to see him again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I agree. \u2018So why can\u2019t I stop thinking about him?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Because we always fall for the wrong men.\u2019 He leans in and kisses my forehead. \u2018The ones who will mess us around and stamp all over our heart. I\u2019ve been there, done that, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve held back before falling too far. I\u2019m proud of you. You deserve better.\u2019</p><p>I smile, remembering many times when I\u2019ve held Gregory\u2019s hand after he\u2019s fallen victim to a man\u2019s charm, except Miller isn\u2019t charming \u2013 not in the least bit. It\u2019s difficult to nail exactly what it is about him, except for his spectacular looks, but that feeling . . . oh God that feeling. And what Gregory has just said is perfectly accurate. There\u2019s a lack of a mother in my life because of her poor decisions when it came to men. That alone should have me running in the other direction from him, but instead I\u2019m being drawn in. His lips are still soft on mine, my flesh is still warm from his touch and I\u2019ve lain in bed every night replaying that kiss. Nothing will ever measure up to those feelings.</p><p>I let us in the house and head with Gregory to the back kitchen. I can hear Nan and George chatting and the sounds of a wooden spoon colliding with the side of a huge metal pot \u2013 a stewpot. It\u2019s stew and dumplings tonight. I screw my face up and contemplate escaping to the local chippy. I can\u2019t stand my grandmother\u2019s stew, but it\u2019s George\u2019s favourite and George is here for supper, so it looks like I\u2019m having stew.</p><p>\u2018Gregory!\u2019 Nan dives on my g*y friend and smothers his face with her marshmallow lips. \u2018You must stay for supper.\u2019 She points to a chair before moving on to me, assaulting me with her squidgy lips too, and then placing me on a chair next to George. \u2018I do love it when we\u2019re all here,\u2019 she declares happily. \u2018Stew?\u2019</p><p>Everyone raises their hands, including me even though I don\u2019t want stew.</p><p>\u2018Sit down, Gregory,\u2019 Nan orders.</p><p>Gregory wisely sits, looking at me and George with pursed lips when he sees us both smirking at his wary move. \u2018You say no to her,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>\u2018Pardon?\u2019 Nan swings round, and we all straighten our faces and backs, like good little children.</p> <p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 we chant in unison, earning each one of us a few seconds of narrowed eyes from my dear grandmother.</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 She places the stewpot on the table. \u2018Tuck in.\u2019</p><p>George virtually dives into the pot, while I just pick at some bread, breaking off tiny bits and chewing quietly while everyone chats happily.</p><p>Miller flashes into my mind, making me blink my eyes shut. I smell him, making me hold my breath. I feel his heated touch, making me shift in my chair. I\u2019m having a mental row with myself as I try to bat away images of him, memories of him and the sound of his smooth voice.</p><p>I\u2019m failing on every level. Falling for this man could be a disaster. Everything suggests it will be, and that should be good enough, but it\u2019s not. I feel weak and vulnerable, and I hate it. Nor do I like the thought of not seeing him again.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you\u2019ve hardly touched your supper.\u2019 Nan snaps me from my daydream, tapping her spoon on the side of my bowl.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not hungry.\u2019 I push the bowl away and stand. \u2018Excuse me. I\u2019m going to bed.\u2019 I feel three sets of concerned eyes on me as I leave the kitchen, but I\u2019m past caring. Yes, Livy I-don\u2019t-ever-need-a-man Taylor has fallen, and she\u2019s fallen stupidly hard. And worst of all, she\u2019s fallen for someone she can\u2019t, and probably shouldn\u2019t, have.</p><p>I drag my heavy body up the stairs and flop into bed, not bothering to undress and not bothering to remove my make-up. It\u2019s not even dark, but burying myself under my thick quilt soon remedies that. I want silence and darkness so I can torture myself some more.</p><p>Friday drags painfully. I avoided Nan, choosing to skip breakfast and face the worried call that I knew I\u2019d get on my way to work. She wasn\u2019t happy but she can\u2019t shove cornflakes down my throat from a mile away. Del, Paul and Sylvie have all tried and failed to coax a genuine smile from me, and Luke dropped in for a coffee again, just to see if I\u2019ve changed my mind on my relationship status. He\u2019s persistent, I\u2019ll give him that, and he is cute and quite funny, too, but I\u2019m still not interested.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking of something all day long, and I keep going to ask, but then I bottle it, knowing what reaction I\u2019ll get. And I can hardly blame her. But Sylvie has his number, and I want it. We\u2019re closing up the bistro and I\u2019m running out of time. \u2018Sylvie?\u2019 I say slowly, twirling my cloth innocently. It\u2019s a silly attempt to look sweet, given what I\u2019m about to ask.</p><p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 she mimics my careful tone, full of suspicion.</p><p>\u2018Do you still have Miller\u2019s number?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 She shakes her head furiously, rushing into the kitchen. \u2018I threw it away.\u2019</p><p>I make chase, not willing to give up. \u2018But you dialled him from your phone,\u2019 I remind her, smacking into her back when she halts.</p><p>\u2018I deleted it,\u2019 she spits unconvincingly. She\u2019s going to make me beg or pin her down and steal her phone.</p><p>\u2018Please, Sylvie. I\u2019m going out of my mind.\u2019 My hands meet in front of my pleading face, forming praying hands.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 She breaks my hands apart and pushes them to my sides. \u2018I heard your voice when you\u2019d left his apartment, and I also saw your face the next day. Livy, a sweet thing like you doesn\u2019t need to be getting involved with a man like that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t stop thinking about him.\u2019 My teeth are clenched, like I\u2019m mad for admitting it. I am mad. I\u2019m mad for appearing so desperate, and I\u2019m even madder for actually being desperate.</p><p>Sylvie sidesteps me and pushes her way back into the bistro, her black bob swishing from side to side. \u2018No no no, Livy. Things happen for a reason, and if you were meant to be with . . .</p><p>I collide with her back again when she trails off and stops dead in her tracks. \u2018Stop stopping!\u2019 I yell, feeling the building frustration getting the better of me. \u2018What\u2019s the . . . It\u2019s me who trails off now, as I look past Sylvie and see Miller standing by the bistro entrance, looking smooth in a grey three-piece suit, his hair a mess of dark waves, his blue eyes crystal clear and sinking into me.</p><p>He steps forward, completely ignoring my work friend, and keeps his eyes on me. \u2018Have you finished work?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 Sylvie blurts, stepping back, pushing me with her. \u2018No, she hasn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sylvie!\u2019 I muscle my way past her with some determined effort until it\u2019s me pushing her back into the kitchen. \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 I say on a hushed whisper. That\u2019s not true at all. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>She grabs my arm and leans in. \u2018How can someone go from being so sensible to so damned insane in such a short space of time?\u2019 she asks, glancing over my shoulder. \u2018You\u2019re going to get yourself in trouble, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just leave me.\u2019</p><p>I can see she\u2019s torn, but she eventually relents, though not before tossing a warning look in Miller\u2019s direction. \u2018You\u2019re mad,\u2019 she huffs, turning on her biker boots and stomping off, leaving us alone.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I turn and face the man who\u2019s invaded every second of thinking space since Monday. \u2018Would you like a coffee?\u2019 I ask, indicating the giant machine behind me.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he answers quietly, walking forward until he\u2019s standing mere feet away from me. \u2018Take a walk with me.\u2019</p><p>A walk? \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He flicks his eyes to the kitchen entrance, clearly uncomfortable. \u2018Get your bag and jacket.\u2019</p><p>I do as he tells me, without much thought. I ignore Sylvie\u2019s stunned face as I enter the kitchen and grab my bag and jacket. \u2018I\u2019m off now,\u2019 I say, hastily leaving her ranting at Del and Paul. I hear her call me stupid and I hear Del call me a grown-up. They are both right.</p><p>Throwing my satchel across my body, I approach him and my eyes close when he clasps his palm around the base of my neck to guide me out of the bistro. I\u2019m directed across the road into the small square where he sits me on a bench and takes a seat next to me, turning his body to face mine. \u2018Have you thought about me?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018Constantly,\u2019 I admit. I\u2019m not beating around the bush. I have, and I want him to know it.</p><p>\u2018So will you spend the night with me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Still just twenty-four hours?\u2019 I clarify, and he nods. My heart falls, not that it\u2019ll stop me from agreeing. I can\u2019t possibly feel any worse than I already do.</p><p>His hand rests on my knee, squeezing gently. \u2018Twenty-four hours, no strings, no commitment and no feelings, except pleasure.\u2019 Releasing my knee, he shifts his hand to my chin and pulls my face close to his. \u2018And it will be pleasurable, Livy. I promise.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t doubt him for a second. \u2018Why do you want this?\u2019 I ask. I know women are notoriously deeper than men, but he\u2019s asking me to disregard something that I simply can\u2019t. This isn\u2019t just lust I\u2019m feeling \u2013 at least I don\u2019t think it is. I\u2019m confused. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>For the first time since I\u2019ve met him, he smiles. It\u2019s a proper smile \u2013 a beautiful smile . . . and I fall a little bit more. \u2018Because I simply have to kiss you again.\u2019 Leaning in, he gently rests his lips on mine. \u2018It\u2019s new to me. I need to taste you some more.\u2019</p><p>New? It\u2019s new to him? What, like different from his usual polished, diamond-adorned women?</p><p>\u2018And because what we can create together shouldn\u2019t be passed up, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The best f**k of my life?\u2019 I ask against his lips, feeling him smile again.</p><p>\u2018And a whole lot more.\u2019 He pulls away, leaving me feeling bereft. It might be a feeling that I should get used to. \u2018Where do you live?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I live with my elderly grandmother.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why I say elderly, maybe to justify my living arrangement. \u2018Camden.\u2019</p><p>A look of surprise flits across his perfect brow. \u2018Tell your grandmother you\u2019ll be back tomorrow night. What\u2019s the address?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What will I say?\u2019 I ask, suddenly panicked. I\u2019ve never stayed out for a whole night, and no plausible reason to do so now is coming to me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\u2019 He stands, putting his hand out to me, and I take it, letting him pull me to my feet.</p> <p>\u2018No, you don\u2019t understand.\u2019 This will be impossible to pull off. \u2018I don\u2019t stay out at night. She\u2019ll never believe me if I try to fob her off with anything other than the truth, and I can\u2019t tell her about you.\u2019 I\u2019ll kill her off with shock. Or maybe I won\u2019t. Maybe she\u2019ll dance around the kitchen, clapping her hands and thanking the Lord. Knowing Nan, it\u2019ll be the latter.</p><p>\u2018You never go out?\u2019 he frowns.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I fake nonchalance to within an inch of my life.</p><p>\u2018And you\u2019ve never stayed out overnight? Not even at a girlfriend\u2019s?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve never been embarrassed by my lifestyle . . . until now. I suddenly feel young, naive and inexperienced, which is ridiculous. I need to locate my long-lost sass. While he\u2019s promised me mind-blowing sex, what does he get out of it, because I\u2019m certainly no sex kitten who\u2019ll rock his bed. A man like this must have women forming a queue at his front door, all kitted out in satin or lace, all in stilettos and all ready to send him wild with desire.</p> <p>I shake my head, looking down to the ground. \u2018Remind me why you want to do this again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you\u2019re speaking to me, isn\u2019t it polite to look at me?\u2019 He tips my chin up. \u2018You don\u2019t seem like a self-doubter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not usually.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s changed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You.\u2019</p><p>That one word makes him shift uncomfortably, and I immediately regret saying it. \u2018Me?\u2019</p> <p>My head drops again. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not uncomfortable,\u2019 he argues quietly, \u2018but now I\u2019m wondering whether this is a good idea.\u2019</p><p>My head snaps up, panicked that he might withdraw his offer. \u2018No, I want to do this.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying but it doesn\u2019t stop me from babbling on some more. \u2018I want twenty-four hours with you.\u2019 I step into his chest and look up to his eyes \u2013 the ones I\u2019m going to lose myself in very soon, if I haven\u2019t already. \u2018I need this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why do you need it, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need it to show myself that I\u2019ve been doing things wrong for too long.\u2019 I brave a kiss and reach up on my tiptoes to push my lips to his, hoping I\u2019ll remind him of what it felt like last time, hoping he experienced the surge of energy, too. Before I can even think to engage my tongue, I\u2019m wrapped in his arms and being pulled up to his chest, our mouths fused, our bodies bonded, my heart falling further. His lips on mine and his hard body coating me feels . . . right.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019 He removes me from his embrace, holding me at arm\u2019s length and hunkering down to ensure he\u2019s got my eyes and my attention. \u2018I\u2019ve made clear how it\u2019ll be, Livy. If you can deal with that, then for the next twenty-four hours, it\u2019s just us \u2013 my body and your body doing incredible things.\u2019</p><p>I nod my head convincingly, even though I\u2019m not at all sure. I can see doubt lingering on his stunning face, which pushes me to force a smile, worried that he might pull out on our deal. I might not know what I\u2019m doing, but I certainly don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if he walks away from me now.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he says, sliding his hand around my nape and pulling me into him. \u2018I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019 He starts to guide me from the square, his palm secured firmly on my neck as he pushes me onward. I glance up to him, just to check he\u2019s there \u2013 to check that I\u2019m not dreaming.</p> <p>He\u2019s there, and he\u2019s gazing down at me, assessing me, probably analysing my mental state. Should I ask him his conclusion because I haven\u2019t the foggiest? All I know is that he\u2019s mine for the next twenty-four hours, and I am his. I just hope that I don\u2019t find myself in further desolation once my time is up. I\u2019m ignoring the voice in my head, currently screaming at me to stop this right now. I know how this\u2019ll turn out, and it\u2019s likely to be messy.</p><p>But I just can\u2019t refuse him. Or myself.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll wait here for you.\u2019 He pulls up outside my house and takes his phone from his pocket, waving it at me. \u2018I have a few calls to make.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s going to wait? And he\u2019s going to wait outside my house? No, no he can\u2019t. Bloody hell, Nan\u2019s probably sniffed him out already. I look up to the bay window at the front of our house, watching for twitching curtains. \u2018I can get a cab to your place,\u2019 I try, making a mental list of things I need to do once I get inside \u2013 shower, shave . . . everywhere, moisturise, spritz, make-up . . . tell the fattest lie I ever will.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He dismisses my offer without even looking at me. \u2018I\u2019ll wait. Go get your things.\u2019</p><p>I wince, letting myself out of his car and walking slowly, cautiously, up the path to my house, like Nan might hear me if I go any faster. I insert my key slowly. I turn it slowly. I push the door open slowly. I lift my foot slowly, ready to step inside, clenching my teeth when the door creaks.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Nan\u2019s standing three feet away, her arms folded, her foot tapping the patterned carpet. \u2018Who\u2019s that man?\u2019 she asks, her grey eyebrows raising. \u2018And why are you behaving like a cat burglar, hmmm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s my boss.\u2019 I blurt the words fast, and so begins the fattest lie I\u2019ll ever tell. \u2018I\u2019m working tonight. He\u2019s brought me home to change.\u2019</p><p>I definitely see a wave of disappointment travel across her age-worn face. \u2018Oh, well . . .\u2019 She turns, losing interest in the man outside immediately. \u2018I won\u2019t bother with supper then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 I take the stairs two at a time and burst into the bathroom, cranking the shower on and stripping down at lightning speed. Then I dive in before it\u2019s warmed up. \u2018Oh shit!\u2019 I pin myself to the side, goose pimples invading me, my body shivering uncontrollably. \u2018Shit, shit shit! Warm up!\u2019 My hand hovers under the spray, and I\u2019m frantically egging the hot water on. \u2018Come on, come on.\u2019</p><p>After far too long, it\u2019s just warm enough to bear, and I step under, making super-fast work of washing my hair, soaping everywhere and shaving . . . everywhere. By the time I\u2019ve sprinted across the landing in my towel and made it into the safety of my room, I\u2019m out of breath. Under normal circumstances, it usually takes me ten minutes flat to throw some clothes on, give my face a quick brush over with some powder, and rough dry my hair. But now I care; now I want to look nice. And I haven\u2019t got bloody time to do it.</p><p>\u2018Underwear,\u2019 I prompt myself, hurrying over to my drawers and yanking the top one open, instantly grimacing at the piles of cotton knickers and bras. I must have something \u2013 anything other than cotton, please!</p><p>After five minutes of assessing each and every piece of underwear I own, I find that I am, in fact, a cotton girl, with no lace, satin, or leather in sight. I knew that, but maybe I thought a sexy pair of something might magic their way into my drawer to save me from underwear humiliation. I was wrong, but with little else to do, I pull on my white cotton knickers and matching boring bra before blasting my hair, brushing some powder across my face and pinching my cheeks.</p><p>And now I\u2019m staring at my satchel and wondering what I need to pack. I have no lingerie or stilettos, or anything remotely sexy. What was I thinking? What was he thinking? I drop my backside on the edge of the bed and my head in my hands, my heavy hair falling forward and forming a waterfall to my knees. I should stay here and hope he gets fed up with waiting and leaves, because all of a sudden, this doesn\u2019t seem like such a good idea. In fact, it\u2019s the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever had, and happy with that conclusion I crawl under the covers of my bed and hide my face in a pillow.</p><p>He\u2019s rich, he\u2019s stunning, he\u2019s refined, if a bit stand-offish, and he wants me for twenty-four hours? He needs his head tested. These thoughts plague my mind as I hide from the world, until I reach a perfectly solid conclusion; he must have arm candy throwing themselves at his feet daily \u2013 hell, I\u2019ve seen one already \u2013 and they must all be dripping in diamonds, designer handbags and shoes that cost more than my monthly wage, so maybe he wants to try something a little different, something like me \u2013 an average waitress, who buggers up coffee and throws trays of expensive champagne everywhere. I push my face further into the pillow and groan. \u2018Stupid, stupid, stupid woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No you\u2019re not.\u2019</p><p>I bolt upright and see him sitting in the armchair in the corner of my room, legs crossed at the ankles, his elbow resting on the arm, his chin in his palm. \u2018What the hell?\u2019 I jump up and run to my bedroom door, swinging it open to check for old ears pushed up against the wood. Nothing, but I don\u2019t feel any better. Nan must have let him in. \u2018How did you get up here?\u2019 I slam the door and flinch when it reverberates through the house.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s perfectly collected, not in the least bit affected by my flustered state. \u2018Your grandmother should take security a little more seriously.\u2019 He rubs his index finger slowly across his stubbled chin, his eyes taking a leisurely jaunt down my body.</p><p>It\u2019s only now I realise that I\u2019m standing in my underwear, and my arms instinctively cross over my chest, attempting in vain to conceal my modesty from his roving eye. I\u2019m horrified, even more so when his lips tip at the edge and his eyes sparkle as they land on mine.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d better lose your bashfulness, Livy.\u2019 He stands, casually strolling over to me, sliding his hands in his grey trouser pockets. His chest meets mine, and he looks down at me, not touching with his hands, but touching with absolutely everything else. \u2018Then again, I quite like your shyness.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m shaking \u2013 physically shaking, and no amount of pep talking is halting it. I want to appear confident, nonchalant and carefree, but I don\u2019t know where to start. Decent underwear might be a good place.</p><p>He bends down, getting his face in the line of my dropped sight, and pulls my falling hair from my shoulders, holding it from my face. Lifting my gaze, only very slightly, I quickly find his. \u2018My twenty-four hours don\u2019t start until I get you in my bed.\u2019</p><p>I feel my brow completely furrow. \u2018You\u2019re really going to time it?\u2019 I ask, wondering if he\u2019ll produce a stopwatch.</p><p>\u2018Well.\u2019 One of his hands drops my hair, and he looks down at his expensive watch. \u2018It\u2019s six-thirty now. By the time I get you uptown in rush hour, it\u2019ll be approximately seven-thirty. I have a charity ball tomorrow evening around seven-thirty, so I\u2019ve timed this just perfectly.\u2019</p><p>Yes, he has timed it perfectly. So when the clock strikes seven-thirty, do I get tossed out on my arse? Do I turn into a pumpkin? I feel jilted already and we haven\u2019t even started, so what am I going to feel like come seven-thirty tomorrow evening? Like shit, that\u2019s what \u2013 rejected, unworthy, depressed and abandoned. I open my mouth to call a stop on the whole diabolical arrangement, but then I hear the sound of old footsteps clumping up the stairs.</p><p>\u2018Oh shit, my nan\u2019s coming!\u2019 My palms meet his suit-covered chest and push into him, guiding him back towards a built-in cupboard. I\u2019m panicking, but I\u2019m still appreciating the solidness beneath my flat palms. It makes my steps falter and my heart jump wildly. I glance up at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Feel good?\u2019 he asks, sliding his palms around my back and circling my waist. I hold my breath, then I hear the creaking again. It snaps me right out of my lustful state.</p><p>\u2018You need to hide.\u2019</p><p>He snorts his disgust and moves his grip to my wrists, detaching me from his chest. \u2018I\u2019m not hiding anywhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller, please, she\u2019ll have heart failure if she catches you in here.\u2019 I feel beyond stupid for making him do this, but I can\u2019t let my grandmother barge into my room and see him. I know she\u2019ll go into seizure, and I know it\u2019ll be in shock, but it won\u2019t be shock of the ordinary kind. No, Nan will pass out for a few seconds, then she\u2019ll throw a bloody party. I release a frustrated, suppressed yell, forgetting all embarrassment with regards to my lack of attire, and give him pleading eyes. \u2018She\u2019ll get excited,\u2019 I explain. \u2018She prays to the Lord Almighty every day for my self-discovery.\u2019 I\u2019m running out of time. I can hear floorboards creaking as she gets closer to the door of my room. \u2018Please.\u2019 My na**d shoulders sag, defeated. I can barely do this to myself, let alone to my elderly grandmother. It would be cruel to build her hopes up with a complete non-starter. \u2018I won\u2019t ask for anything else, just please don\u2019t let her see you.\u2019</p> <p>His lips form a straight line and his head drops forward a little, the wayward lock of dark hair falling onto his brow, and without a word, he releases me and moves across my room, but he doesn\u2019t step into the cupboard; he goes behind my floor-length curtains. I can\u2019t see him, so I don\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u2018Olivia Taylor!\u2019</p><p>I swing around and find Nan in the doorway, her eyes roaming all over my room, like she knows I\u2019m hiding something. \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 I ask, silently scolding myself for my poor choice of words. What\u2019s up? I would never say that, and her suspicious face notes this, too.</p><p>Her eyes narrow, making me feel even more conspicuous. \u2018That man\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018What man?\u2019 I need to shut up and let her spit it out, not intercept her and make her even more suspicious.</p> <p>\u2018That man in the car outside,\u2019 she continues, resting her hand on the doorknob. \u2018Your boss.\u2019</p><p>I must visibly relax because she runs her navy eyes over my semi-naked form, knowing plastered all over her face. She still thinks he\u2019s out there, which is just perfect. \u2018What about him?\u2019 I pull my skinny jeans from my drawer and hop in, shimmying them up my legs and fastening the fly before snatching a white over-sized T-shirt from the back of my dressing table chair.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s gone.\u2019</p><p>I freeze with my T-shirt halfway over my head, one arm fed through a sleeve and my hair caught in the neck. \u2018Where?\u2019 I ask, no other words springing to mind.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know, but one second he\u2019s there, and I know because I could see the top of his head through the slightly open window, then I turn to tell George that he has one of those fancy Mercedes things, and when I look back . . . poof, he\u2019s gone. But that swanky car is still there\u2019 \u2013 her foot starts tapping \u2013 \u2018and parked illegally, I might add.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m immobilised by guilt. She\u2019s like Miss bloody Marple. \u2018He\u2019s probably nipped to the shop,\u2019 I say, untangling myself from my T-shirt and pulling it down my body. I make quick work of shoving my feet in my hot-pink Converse. Christ, I\u2019ve got to get him out yet, and with Ironside on the case, it\u2019s looking like a job and a half.</p> <p>\u2018The shop?\u2019 She laughs. \u2018The nearest is a mile away. He\u2019d drive.\u2019</p><p>I fight to prevent an irritated screech escaping. \u2018What does it matter where he\u2019s gone?\u2019 I ask, then dive right in with the building of my greatest lie. \u2018Oh, and I\u2019m staying at Sylvie\u2019s tonight. She\u2019s a work friend.\u2019</p><p>My shoulders rise in anticipation for her gasp of shock, but it doesn\u2019t come, and that has me turning to see if she\u2019s still in my room. She is, and she\u2019s grinning. \u2018Really?\u2019 she asks, her eyes twinkling in delight as she runs them down my static form. \u2018You\u2019re not dressed for work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll change when I get there.\u2019 My voice is high and squeaky as I busy myself, collecting toiletries and packing what I\u2019ll need for twenty-four hours with Miller Hart, which isn\u2019t a lot, I expect. \u2018The event I\u2019m working at tonight doesn\u2019t finish until midnight, and Sylvie lives close by so I may as well just crash there.\u2019 I\u2019m a fool and completely wasting my breath. It\u2019s only now, when I\u2019m zipping up my bag and chucking it onto my shoulder, that I remember he\u2019s in my room. What must he be thinking? I won\u2019t blame him if he walks out this very instant. This performance by my nan has nothing to do with her disapproving of a man in my life. She just doesn\u2019t like the fact that she doesn\u2019t know about it, that\u2019s all. And she isn\u2019t going to know, not officially, anyway. The silence spreading between us is a mutual understanding of that. Gregory has told her I\u2019m taken by someone, and she can\u2019t bear that I\u2019ve not confided in her. It would be hard enough spilling if I were to get involved with a regular guy, under regular circumstances, but Miller? And with our twenty-four hour agreement? No, it goes against everything I know, and I\u2019m ashamed of myself because of it. While Nan has been begging me to sow my wild oats, I don\u2019t think she quite meant as wild as my mother.</p><p>She gazes at me, her old navy eyes thoughtful. \u2018I\u2019m glad,\u2019 she says softly. \u2018You can\u2019t hide from your mother\u2019s history for ever.\u2019</p><p>I shrink a little, but not wanting to extend this line of conversation, especially with Miller hiding behind the curtains, I just nod my head at her, my silent way of saying yes. She nods in return and slowly backs out of my room, all cool and casual, but I know she\u2019ll be rushing back to the lounge window to see if the man has returned to his swanky car. My bedroom door shuts and Miller appears from behind the curtain. I\u2019ve never been so embarrassed, and the interested look on his face only enhances it, even if it\u2019s nice to see him display a facial expression other than the completely serious one that I\u2019ve become used to.</p><p>\u2018Your grandmother is a busybody, yes?\u2019 He\u2019s really amused by her interrogation performance, yet I can also see curiosity lingering on that perfect face.</p><p>Straightening myself out, just for something to do other than feed his amusement and his curiosity, I shrug, feeling smaller than ever. \u2018She\u2019s entertaining,\u2019 I flip, my eyes darting across the floor. I want the ground to swallow me whole right now.</p> <p>He\u2019s pushed up against me in a second. \u2018I felt like a teenager.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you hide behind a lot of curtains back then?\u2019 I step away to gain some breathing space, but my attempted escape is in complete vain.</p><p>He moves forward. \u2018Are you ready, Olivia Taylor?\u2019</p><p>I get the feeling he doesn\u2019t just mean to leave. Am I ready? And for what? \u2018Yes,\u2019 I say, decidedly staunch, not quite knowing where the word spoken with such confidence comes from. I stare at him, unwilling to be the first to look away. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going or what I\u2019ll experience while I\u2019m there, but I know that I want to go . . . with him.</p><p>His lovely lips give an almost undetectable smile, telling me he knows I\u2019m feigning confidence, but I keep my eyes on his, unwavering. He leans down, getting us nose to nose, then blinks slowly, parts his lips slowly, drops his eyes to my mouth slowly, and then he increases my heart rate further by singeing my bare arm with his delicate touch. Nothing extraordinary, but the feeling is beyond extraordinary, like nothing I\u2019ve felt before . . . until I met him.</p><p>He dips his head, coming so close I can\u2019t help closing my eyes. I\u2019m dizzy and exhilarated all at once, feeling his tongue trace my bottom lip.</p><p>\u2018If I start, I won\u2019t stop,\u2019 he murmurs, pulling away. \u2018I need to get you in my bed.\u2019 He grasps my nape and twists his hand slightly, forcing me to turn away from him and walk forward.</p><p>\u2018My nan.\u2019 I barely splutter the words out in my wanton state. \u2018She can\u2019t see you.\u2019 I\u2019m led across the landing and down the stairs \u2013 me cautious, him hasty.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll wait in the car.\u2019 He releases me from his grasp and strides to the front door, opening it and shutting it with no regard for my peeking grandmother.</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I shout, panicked, knowing she\u2019ll have her face squished against the glass of the window looking for him. \u2018Nan!\u2019 I need to get her away before Miller appears from the recess of the front door. \u2018Nan!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bloody hell, girl!\u2019 She appears in the doorway with George in tow, looking at my frozen form with worried eyes. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019</p><p>With a blank mind and blank face, I step forward and kiss her cheek. \u2018Nothing. See you tomorrow.\u2019 I don\u2019t hang around. I leave my nan frowning and George muttering something about a strange woman, and run down the pathway to the shiny black Mercedes, diving in and sinking into my seat. \u2018Go,\u2019 I press impatiently.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. The car remains idle at the kerb, and he remains idle in his seat, showing no sign of rushing away from my house as I\u2019ve demanded. His tall, suited frame is relaxed, one hand draped casually on the wheel as he looks at me, completely serious, his steely blues giving nothing away. What\u2019s he thinking? I break the eye connection, but only because I want to confirm what I already know. I look up to the front window of my house and see the curtains twitching. I sag further in my seat.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the matter, Livy?\u2019 Miller asks, reaching over to rest his hand on my thigh. \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>My eyes are on his big, manly hand, my flesh burning beneath it. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have come in,\u2019 I say quietly. \u2018You may have found it amusing, but you\u2019ve just made this even harder.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, it\u2019s polite to look at someone when you\u2019re speaking to them.\u2019 He clasps my chin and pulls, making me face him. \u2018I apologise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s done now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing about the next twenty-four hours is going to be difficult, Livy.\u2019 His hand slides across my cheek tenderly, pushing me to nuzzle into it. \u2018I know being with you will be the easiest thing that I\u2019ve ever done.\u2019</p><p>It might very well be easy, but I can\u2019t see the aftermath being easy. No, I foresee a mountain of hurt on my part and easiness on his. I\u2019m not myself around him. The sensible woman I\u2019ve moulded myself into has gone from one extreme to the other. Nan\u2019s at that window, Miller\u2019s hand is stroking my cheek sweetly, and I can\u2019t even muster up the energy to stop him.</p><p>\u2018The windows are tinted,\u2019 he whispers, slowly moving forward and resting his soft lips on mine.</p><p>That may be so; however, he\u2019s not my boss, and my cute nan knows that very well. But I\u2019ll deal with the interrogation when I get home tomorrow. I\u2019m suddenly not so concerned. I\u2019ve been distracted from my sensible self again.</p><p>\u2018Are you ready?\u2019 He asks the question again, but this time I just nod against him. I\u2019m not ready to be heartbroken at all.</p><p>The drive back to Miller\u2019s apartment is quiet. The only sound in the air surrounding us is Gary Jules singing about a mad world. I don\u2019t know much about Miller, but I\u2019ve figured out that he must come from good stock. His speech is refined, his clothing of the highest quality, and he lives in Belgravia. He pulls up outside the building and is out of the car and on my side without delay, opening my door and ushering me out.</p><p>\u2018Have it cleaned,\u2019 he orders, detaching his car key from the key ring and handing it to the green-suited valet.</p><p>\u2018Sir.\u2019 The valet tips his hat, then climbs into Miller\u2019s car, immediately pressing a button that brings him closer to the wheel.</p><p>\u2018Walk.\u2019 He takes my bag and settles his hand on the base of my neck again as he guides me through the giant glass revolving door and into a mirror-invested lobby. Everywhere I look, we\u2019re there, me being guided, looking petite and apprehensive, and him pushing me onward, looking tall and powerful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We bypass the rows of mirrored elevators, heading for the stairwell. \u2018Are the lifts broken?\u2019 I ask as I\u2019m steered through the doors and pushed up the stairs.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m not lazy.\u2019 He cuts me off, leaving no room for further questioning, and continues to hold my nape as we take the stairs.</p> <p>He might not be lazy, but he\u2019s seriously crazy. Four flights of stairs in and my calf muscles are burning again. I\u2019m struggling to keep up. I battle on for one more flight, and I\u2019m just about to call for a break when he turns and picks me up, obviously aware of my breathlessness. My arms around his neck feel right, as comforting as they did before, as he continues with me draped across his arms like it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. Our faces are close, his smell manly, and he keeps his eyes set firmly forward until we\u2019re outside his shiny black front door.</p><p>Miller drops me to my feet, hands me my bag and takes hold of my nape, using his free hand to get the door open, but as the view inside his apartment hits me, I suddenly want to run away. I see the art, the wall where he restrained me, and the couch where he sat me. The images are all vivid, and so are my feelings of helplessness. If I cross this threshold, I\u2019ll be at Miller Hart\u2019s mercy and I don\u2019t even think my long-lost sass will assist me . . . if I manage to find it.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure I\u2014\u2019 I start backing away from the door, uncertainty abruptly plaguing me, sensibility worming its way into my confused brain. But the fiery determination in his clear eyes is telling me that I\u2019m going nowhere and so does the increased grip of his hand on my nape.</p><p>\u2018Livy, I\u2019m not going to jump you as soon as I get you inside.\u2019 His hand shifts down to my upper arm but he doesn\u2019t restrain me now. \u2018Calm down.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m trying to, but my heart won\u2019t let up and neither will the shakes. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t be.\u2019 He steps away from me, giving me access to the entrance of his apartment. \u2018I\u2019d like you to go inside, but only if you want to spend the night with me,\u2019 he says slowly, pulling my gaze to his. \u2018And I want you to turn and leave if you\u2019re not sure because I can\u2019t do this unless I know you\u2019re one hundred per cent with me.\u2019 His face is straight but I detect an element of pleading behind the impassive blue gaze of his eyes.</p><p>\u2018I just don\u2019t understand why you want me,\u2019 I admit, feeling insecure and vulnerable.</p><p>I know what I look like; I\u2019m reminded every time someone stares at me or comments on my unique eyes, but I also know that I have very little to offer a man, apart from something pleasant to look at. My mother\u2019s beauty was her downfall, and I never want it to be mine. I\u2019m at risk of losing my self-respect, just like she did. I\u2019ve made it so there\u2019s nothing to know. Who would want to give any attention to a girl who offers no intrigue or interest beyond her looks? I know exactly who: men who want nothing more than a pretty woman in their bed, which is exactly why I deprive myself of the potential of being loved. Not lusted after, but loved. I never want to be my mother, yet here I am, tinkering too close for comfort on the edge of debasement.</p><p>I can tell that he\u2019s thinking hard about how to answer my question, like he knows it\u2019ll influence my decision to stay or leave. I\u2019m willing him to make his next words count. \u2018I\u2019ve told you, Livy.\u2019 He gestures me inside. \u2018You fascinate me.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s the right answer but I slowly walk into his apartment, and I definitely hear a quiet, relieved exhale of breath from behind me. I circle the round table in his entrance hall, placing my bag on the white marble as I pass, before coming to a stop, not knowing whether to sit myself on the couch or go into the kitchen. There\u2019s an air of awkwardness surrounding us and despite his words in the car, it\u2019s difficult.</p><p>He walks ahead of me and shrugs off his suit jacket, laying it neatly over the back of a chair before making his way to the drinks cabinet. \u2018Would you like a drink?\u2019 he asks, pouring some dark liquid into a tumbler.</p> <p>\u2018No.\u2019 I shake my head, even though he\u2019s not facing me.</p><p>\u2018Water?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sit down, Livy,\u2019 he orders, turning and gesturing towards the couch.</p><p>I follow his pointed hand and take my reluctant body to the large cream-coloured leather couch while he leans against the cabinet, slowly sipping his drink. No matter what he does with those lips, whether it\u2019s speaking or simply taking a sip of a drink, it\u2019s distracting. They move so slowly, almost sensuously . . . deliberately.</p><p>I\u2019m desperately concentrating on regulating my thundering heartbeat but I lose the battle completely when he moves towards me and sits on the coffee table in front of me, his elbows braced on his knees, his drink suspended in front of his lips, his eyes simmering with all sorts of promises. \u2018I need to ask you something,\u2019 he says quietly.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I blurt the word quickly, worriedly.</p><p>His glass lifts slowly but those eyes stay on mine. \u2018Are you a virgin?\u2019 he asks before tipping the tumbler to his lips.</p> <p>\u2018No!\u2019 I recoil, mortified that he\u2019s taken my reluctance as an indication of that. But in truth, I wish I was.</p><p>\u2018Why are you so offended by my question?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m twenty-four years old.\u2019 I shift uncomfortably in my seated position, diverting my eyes away from his inquisitive stare. I can feel my face heating, and I want to grab one of his fancy silk cushions to cover it.</p><p>\u2018When was the last time you had sex, Livy?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m dying on the spot. What does it matter when I last slept with someone? Running seems like the best option for me but my reason for escaping has changed.</p><p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 he prompts, placing his drink down, the chink of glass on glass making me jump slightly. \u2018Will you please look at me when I\u2019m speaking to you?\u2019</p><p>His sternness irritates me, and that\u2019s the only reason I do as I\u2019m told and look at him. \u2018My history has nothing to do with you,\u2019 I say quietly, resisting the temptation to snatch his drink and down it.</p><p>\u2018I simply asked you a question.\u2019 His surprise at my sudden spunk is clear. \u2018It\u2019s usually polite to answer a question when you\u2019re asked one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s down to my discretion whether I answer any questions that I\u2019m asked, and I don\u2019t see what relevance your question has.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My question has plenty of relevance, Livy, as will your answer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019</p><p>He looks down at his glass and swivels it on the table for a few moments before slowly returning his eyes to mine. They cut straight through me. \u2018It will determine whether I f**k you hard immediately, or break you in first.\u2019</p><p>I gasp, my eyes widening at his obnoxiousness, not that he\u2019s affected by my shock or reaction to his crass words. He simply takes his tumbler and has another slow sip of the dark liquid, keeping his unrevealing eyes on me.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like repeating myself, but I\u2019ll make an exception,\u2019 he states. \u2018When was the last time you had sex?\u2019</p><p>My tongue is knotted in my mouth as I remain under his watchful eyes. I don\u2019t want to tell him. I don\u2019t want him to think that I\u2019m even more pathetic than he must think already.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take your reluctance to answer as an indication that it\u2019s been a while.\u2019 He cocks his head and that lock of hair falls onto his forehead, momentarily distracting me from my humiliation. \u2018Well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seven years,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018Happy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 His response is swift and genuine, yet the stunned eyes are evident. \u2018I have no idea how that\u2019s possible, but it pleases me immensely.\u2019 He grabs my chin and lifts. \u2018And I\u2019m talking to you, Livy, so look at me.\u2019 I follow through on his instruction until our eye contact is restored. \u2018I guess that means I\u2019ll be breaking you in.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t gasp this time but my blood instantly heats, sending my pulse rate through the roof, replacing embarrassment with want. I want him more than I know I should.</p><p>Meeting his intoxicating stare with my own driven gaze, I send instructions to the muscles in my arms to lift and feel him, but before I can engage them, my phone starts squealing from my bag.</p><p>\u2018You should answer it.\u2019 He sits back, giving me space to leave the intimacy of his closeness. \u2018Let her know that you\u2019re still alive.\u2019 There\u2019s no amusement on his face, but I hear it in his tone.</p><p>I stand quickly, keen to reassure my inquisitive grandmother that all is well. I don\u2019t look at the screen before I answer, but I should\u2019ve. \u2018Hi!\u2019 I greet, way too chirpy, given my circumstances.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 The voice on the end of the line prompts me to pull my phone from my ear and look at the screen, even though I know damn well who it is.</p><p>I sigh, picturing Nan frantically dialling Gregory to inform him of the events earlier this evening. \u2018Hi.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That man. Who is he?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My boss.\u2019 I squeeze my eyes shut, hoping he buys it, but he scoffs disbelievingly, which quickly tells me I\u2019ve failed to fool him.</p><p>\u2018Livy, give me a break! Who is he?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stuttering all over my words, frantically searching my mind for some rubbish to feed him. \u2018Just . . . he\u2019s . . . it doesn\u2019t matter!\u2019 I snap, starting to pace. Gregory won\u2019t be happy, not after our conversations about Miller Hart.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s the coffee-hater, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 His tone is accusing, spiking my irritation.</p><p>\u2018Maybe,\u2019 I retort. \u2018Maybe not.\u2019 Why I\u2019ve added that is a mystery. Of course it\u2019s the coffee-hater. Who else would it be?</p><p>I\u2019m so busy trying to fob off my friend I don\u2019t notice the coffee-hater looming behind me until his chin is on my shoulder, his breath heavy in my ear. I gasp as I turn around and, stupidly or not, I hang up on Gregory.</p><p>Miller\u2019s brow is a knot of confusion. \u2018That was a man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s rude to eavesdrop.\u2019 I stab at the reject button of my phone when it starts ringing again.</p><p>\u2018That may be so.\u2019 He holds his drink up, one finger detached from the glass and pointing at me. \u2018But like I said, that was a man. Who is he?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s none of your business,\u2019 I say, fidgeting and diverting my eyes from his accusing blues.</p><p>\u2018If I\u2019m taking you to my bed, then it is my business, Livy,\u2019 he points out. \u2018Will you please look at me when I\u2019m speaking to you?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t. I keep my eyes on the floor, silently wondering why I don\u2019t just tell him who it was. It\u2019s not who he thinks it is, so what does it matter? I\u2019ve got nothing to hide but his demand for the information is unearthing a childish rebelliousness in me. Or it could be my sass. I don\u2019t need to find it because it seems to come out to play willingly around this man, which is undoubtedly a good job.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 He hunkers down and captures my eyes, his brow raised in authority. \u2018If there\u2019s an obstruction then I\u2019ll happily eliminate it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s a friend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What did he want?\u2019</p><p>\u2018To know where I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because my grandmother has obviously told him that you were at the house and he has put two and two together and come up with Miller.\u2019 My mortification is growing by the second.</p><p>\u2018He knows about me?\u2019 he asks, those dark brows showing no sign of lowering.</p><p>\u2018Yes, he knows about you.\u2019 This is getting stupid. \u2018Can I use your bathroom?\u2019 I ask, wanting to escape and gather myself.</p><p>\u2018You may.\u2019 His glass extends from his body and points toward a corridor leading off the lounge. \u2018Third door on the right.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t waste time absorbing his questioning look. I follow his pointed glass, turning my phone off when it rings again, and let myself into the third door on the right, immediately collapsing against the back. But my exasperation is interrupted as I take in the colossal space in front of me. It\u2019s not a bathroom. It\u2019s a bedroom.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>I straighten up and scan the space, noting the obscene leather-framed bed, the gigantic chandelier suspended from the ceiling, and the floor-to-ceiling windows, with the most amazing view across the city. I shouldn\u2019t be so stunned. I knew his place was palatial, but this is something else. I see two doors across the room, and deciding that one should be a bathroom, I make my way across the squidgy cream carpet and open the first one I come to, forcing my eyes to avoid the huge bed. It\u2019s not a bathroom, but it is a wardrobe, if such a vast space could be classed as a wardrobe. The square room has floor-to-ceiling mahogany cupboards and shelves circling the three walls with a freestanding cabinet in the centre and a couch backing onto it. The surface of the cabinet displays dozens of small jewellery boxes, all open and exhibiting an array of cufflinks, watches and tie pins. I get the feeling that if I moved one of those boxes, he\u2019d know. I quickly shut the door and hurry to the next one, pushing my way into the most ridiculously regal bathroom I\u2019ve ever seen. I gasp, my eyes bugging. A giant claw-foot tub sits proudly by the massive window, with intricate gold taps and steps leading up to it, and the shower walls are adorned in a mosaic of cream and gold tiles. I try to take it all in. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much. It\u2019s like a show home. After washing my hands, I wipe up carefully and straighten the towels, not wanting to leave anything out of place.</p><p>As I exit his bedroom I freeze, coming face to face with Miller. He\u2019s frowning again. \u2018Snooping?\u2019 he asks.</p> <p>\u2018No! I was using the bathroom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not the bathroom; that\u2019s my bedroom.\u2019</p><p>I look down the corridor, counting two doors before the one I\u2019m standing outside of. \u2018You said third door on my right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and that would be the next door.\u2019 He points to the next door, and I look, completely confused.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I turn and point in the other direction. \u2018One, two, three.\u2019 I indicate the door behind me. \u2018Third door on my right.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The first door is a cupboard.\u2019</p><p>I can feel that irritation rising again. \u2018It\u2019s still a door,\u2019 I point out. \u2018And I wasn\u2019t snooping.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 He shrugs his perfect shoulders and slowly blinks those perfect eyes, before taking his perfection in its entirety and strolling down the corridor. \u2018This way,\u2019 he calls over his shoulder.</p><p>Irritation flares. Who does he think he is? My Converse start a moody march down the corridor in pursuit of him, but when I arrive in the lounge, he\u2019s not there. I gaze around to the various doorways, leading to God only knows where, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen. All of these unfamiliar emotions are driving me insane.</p><p>Irritation, confusion . . . desire, want, lust.</p><p>I stomp across to the hallway, yank my bag from the table and head for the door.</p> <p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 His smooth tone tickles my skin and I turn to see him with a refilled glass.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m leaving. This was a stupid idea.\u2019</p><p>He walks forward, a little surprised. \u2018You made a silly mistake by taking the wrong door and that\u2019s a cause to leave?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you make me want to leave,\u2019 I counter. \u2018The door has nothing to do with it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I make you uncomfortable?\u2019 he asks. I can detect a little concern in his voice.</p><p>\u2018Yes, you do,\u2019 I confirm. He makes me very uncomfortable, and on so many levels, which begs the question why I\u2019m here.</p><p>He walks forward and takes my hand, tugging gently until I allow him to pull me back into the lounge. \u2018Sit,\u2019 he orders, pushing me down onto the couch. He takes my bag and phone and places them neatly on the table before squatting in front of me. He has me with those eyes again. \u2018I apologise for making you feel uncomfortable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I whisper, my eyes dropping to his parted lips.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m going to make you feel less uncomfortable.\u2019</p><p>I nod because I\u2019m too rapt by the slow motions of his lips as he speaks, but my vision is broken when he rises and puts his glass on the table, tweaking it slightly before collecting his jacket and leaving the room. I follow his back, frowning, and hear a door open and close. What\u2019s he doing? My puzzled face flicks around the room, admiring the art briefly and thinking his apartment is too neat and perfect to actually live in, before I\u2019m back to wondering again. Then I hear the door open and close, and I nearly choke on my own tongue when he strolls back into the room, wearing a pair of black, loose sports shorts \u2013 nothing else, just some shorts. Yes, his suit-adorned perfection is a little intimidating, but bloody hell, this won\u2019t help. Now I just feel even more inadequate and even more lustful, my hands mentally exploring the sharpness of his chest and stomach, my lips meeting the tanned smoothness of his defined shoulders, and my arms snaking around his tight waist.</p><p>He\u2019s back in front of me, lowering himself to the table and picking up his drink. \u2018Better?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>I\u2019m sure if I could manage to rip my enthralled eyes off his torso I would find a look of superiority, but I can\u2019t knock him for it. He is by far superior. \u2018No.\u2019 I drag my eyes up his body until I see him tipping his drink to those lips. Slowly. \u2018How would this make me feel comfortable?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m casual.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you\u2019re half naked.\u2019 I take another glimpse, my eyes greedy for him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m still making you feel uncomfortable?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>He sighs and gets up, striding from the room again, but he doesn\u2019t head towards his bedroom. He goes in the direction of the kitchen. I hear doors opening and closing for a few moments before he\u2019s back with me, sitting on the table in front of me with a tray in his hand. He places it down next to him, and I note that it\u2019s full of rocks and ice.</p><p>\u2018What are they?\u2019 I ask, leaning forward to watch him. He swivels the tray, selects a rock and repositions his body forward, holding it out to me.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s see if we can loosen you up, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How? What are they?\u2019 I nod to the rock in his hand, now noticing that it\u2019s concave on one side and has some sort of jelly shimmering in the pearlescent shell.</p><p>\u2018Oysters. Open up.\u2019 He inches forward and I inch back, my face screwing up in disgust.</p><p>\u2018No, thank you,\u2019 I say politely. I don\u2019t know much about the shellfish, but I do know they\u2019re obscenely expensive and, supposedly, an aphrodisiac. I don\u2019t plan on finding out, though, because they look repulsive.</p><p>\u2018Have you tried them before?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then you must.\u2019 He moves in closer, not giving me much more retreating space. \u2018Open.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You try first,\u2019 I suggest, trying to buy myself some time.</p><p>He shakes his head, a little exasperated. \u2018As you wish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>He watches me as he slowly tips the oyster to his mouth, his head falling back, but his eyes holding mine. His neck lengthens and his throat is taut and totally kissable. Then he swallows painfully slowly and an unfamiliar bang lands between my thighs, making me shift. Oh f**k, he looks too sexy. I feel hot.</p><p>He dumps the rock, grabs the front of my T-shirt in his fist and yanks me forward onto his mouth, catching me by complete surprise, but there is nothing I can or want to do to stop him. His hungry invasion is met with equal intent from me. I find his na**d shoulders and relish in my first experience of his bare flesh under my palms. It\u2019s better than I imagined. His tongue is working through my mouth fervently, and I can do nothing more than accept, tasting the saltiness of the oyster, until he breaks our kiss and removes my hands from his shoulders, him panting, me gasping.</p><p>\u2018That wasn\u2019t a result of the oyster,\u2019 he heaves, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, pulling me forward, his nose meeting mine. \u2018That was a result of you sitting here in front of me with a look of pure desire in your exquisite eyes.\u2019</p><p>I want to tell him that he has that look too, but I quickly stop myself, considering, perhaps, that he may just look at all women like that, or maybe it\u2019s just the way he looks full stop. I don\u2019t know what to say, so I say nothing, instead choosing to continue with my fitful breaths as he holds me in place.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve just paid you a compliment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I murmur.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome. Are you ready to let me worship you, Olivia Taylor?\u2019</p><p>I nod as he slowly moves forward, his blues flicking from my mouth to my eyes constantly until his lips are lightly brushing over mine, but this time he\u2019s relaxed and tender with his taking, gently seducing my mouth as he rises, encouraging me to stand with him, before he holds my nape once more and starts walking forward, forcing me to step back. I let him guide me until we\u2019re entering his bedroom and I\u2019m feeling his bed at the back of my knees, and the whole time he holds our mouths together. He\u2019s an extraordinary kisser, overwhelmingly good, like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. If this is a sign of things to come, then I hope the next twenty-four hours last for ever. I\u2019m bursting at the seams with desire, matching him. Sensibility has vanished again.</p><p>His hand leaves my neck and grasps the hem of my T-shirt, lifting it and breaking our mouth contact to get it past my head so I\u2019m forced to release his shoulders and lift my arms. My lingering concern for my lack of sexy underwear is long forgotten. I can\u2019t seem to focus on anything except him, his passion and his energy. It\u2019s all-consuming, leaving no room for anxiousness or hesitation. Or, more importantly, that sensible gene that seems to have disappeared into thin air under his attention.</p><p>\u2018Do you feel better?\u2019 he asks, breathing down on me, his groin pressing into my stomach.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I gasp, clenching my eyes shut, trying to comprehend what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t deprive me of your eyes, Livy.\u2019 His hands encase my cheeks. \u2018Open.\u2019</p><p>I do. I open my eyes, my line of sight leading me straight to shimmering blues.</p><p>Leaning in, he kisses me sweetly. \u2018I have to keep reminding myself that I need to take this slowly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I assure him, reaching up and resting the flats of my hands on his torso. He\u2019s being a gentleman, and I\u2019m grateful, but I\u2019m not sure that I want him to take it slowly. The desire ripping through me is getting hard to control.</p><p>He pulls away and smiles, and I fall some more. \u2018I\u2019m looking forward to indulging in you slowly.\u2019 He reaches down and starts to unbutton the fly of my jeans. \u2018Really slowly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I ask, stupidly or not.</p><p>\u2018Because something as beautiful as this should be savoured, not rushed. Kick your shoes off.\u2019</p><p>I do as I\u2019m bid and watch as he drops to his knees and peels the denim from my legs, tossing my jeans to the side before he hooks his fingers in the top of my knickers. I\u2019m looking down at him as he draws them from my legs slowly, prompting me to lift each leg in turn so he can rid me of my white cotton. Reaching forward with his mouth, he kisses me softly, just north of the apex of my thighs, and I noticeably tense, but not because I\u2019m nervous. I don\u2019t feel any worries. He\u2019s being so careful with me, but the heavy ache, low in my stomach, is intensifying with every second that passes.</p><p>He rises to his feet and reaches around my back, finding the clasp of my bra, his mouth resting by my ear. \u2018Are you on birth control?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head no, hoping it won\u2019t deter him. My periods are regular and light and I\u2019ve not exactly been sexually active. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he whispers, pulling my bra from my body. \u2018Take my shorts off.\u2019</p><p>His instruction makes me hesitate, the potential of him fully na**d unearthing a little bit of nervousness, which is crazy when I\u2019m completely nude myself.</p><p>His hands are suddenly on mine and guiding them to the waistband of his shorts. \u2018Stay with me, Livy.\u2019 His words drive me into action and I slowly, carefully, push his shorts down his muscled thighs, not daring to look down. I keep my eyes on his superb face, finding it comforting. I can\u2019t, however, avoid the feel of him when he\u2019s free from his shorts and skimming my stomach. I quietly gasp, involuntarily stepping back from him, but he moves with me, his hand sliding around my waist and cupping my bum. \u2018Easy,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018Relax, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I drop my head, feeling stupid and frustrated with myself. Those doubts are creeping in again, and he must sense it too because I\u2019m lifted to his chest and walked to the bed, then laid down carefully before he takes something from the top drawer of the bedside table and positions himself over me, astride my waist, his hard, hot penis directly in my line of sight. I\u2019m fixated, even more so when he rises to his knees and clasps himself. I flick my eyes briefly to his face, seeing him looking down, his lips parted and that wave loose on his forehead. It\u2019s a pleasurable sight, but watching him rip the packet of the condom open with his teeth and slowly roll it down his shaft with ease is a light year past pleasurable, which only leaves me wondering what\u2019s to come.</p> <p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 he asks, planting his palms on either side of my head and nudging my thighs open with his knee.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I nod as I speak, not quite certain what to do with my hands, which are redundant by my sides, but then I feel him at my opening and they fly up to his chest on a gasp.</p><p>He\u2019s staring at me, and my eyes refuse to leave him, even though I desperately want to clench them shut and hold my breath. \u2018Ready?\u2019</p><p>I nod again, and he pushes forward gently, slowly breaching my entrance and sliding into me on a loud exhale of air. Pain sears through me, making me quietly whimper and dig my short nails into his shoulders. I know my face is etched with discomfort, and there\u2019s nothing that I can do to stop it. It hurts.</p><p>\u2018Jesus,\u2019 he gasps. \u2018Jesus, Livy, you\u2019re tight.\u2019 The strained expression on his face tells me he\u2019s in pain, too. \u2018Am I hurting you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No!\u2019 I yelp.</p><p>\u2018Livy, tell me so I can fix it. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u2019 He\u2019s braced on his arms, holding still, waiting for me to respond.</p><p>\u2018It hurts a little,\u2019 I admit on a despairing rush of breath.</p><p>\u2018I can tell.\u2019 He eases back gently but doesn\u2019t pull out completely. \u2018I have puncture wounds in my shoulders to prove it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I immediately release him from my vicious grip, and he pushes forward again, only halfway this time.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be. Save your biting and scratching for when I f**k you.\u2019 He smirks, and my eyes widen. \u2018Come on, Livy.\u2019 He retreats slowly and rocks gently back in. \u2018Don\u2019t be bashful. We\u2019re sharing the most intimate act together.\u2019</p> <p>I find my h*ps lifting, wanting him to plunge deeper, now that the pain has subsided a little.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re egging me on.\u2019 He drops to his elbows and gets mouth to mouth with me, easing back and pushing in a little further, circling his groin. \u2018Tell me how it feels.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good!\u2019 I breathe, inviting him to increase his pace with another tip of my hips.</p><p>\u2018I concur.\u2019 He rests his lips over mine and teases my mouth with a brief dash of his tongue. It\u2019s too much. I attempt to capture his lips but he pulls away. \u2018Slowly,\u2019 he murmurs, swaying in and out perfectly, gazing down at me and blinking lazily to match his gentle thrusting. This really is intimate, and he\u2019s breaking me in, just like he promised. The quietness surrounding us is only slightly pierced by our matching, quiet, irregular puffs of air. Right now, I\u2019m wondering why I\u2019ve deprived myself of this feeling. This is nothing like I remember. This is how sex should be \u2013 two people sharing in each other\u2019s pleasure, not sprinting to the finish line with no consideration for the other person, which is just how I remember my drunken encounters to be. This is worlds away. This is special. This is what I want. I know I shouldn\u2019t be thinking that, especially since I\u2019ve agreed to twenty-four hours and nothing more, but if I\u2019ll have this to remember \u2013 him staring down at me, him feeling me, him worshipping me, then I think that I can cope with the aftermath.</p><p>I feel internal muscles that I never knew existed contract around him, sensitising me to each delicious drive, pushing me onward to . . . something. I don\u2019t know what, but I know it\u2019s going to be good.</p><p>He leans down and kisses my nose, then moves to my lips. \u2018You\u2019re tensing inside. Are you going to come?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t know?\u2019 he gasps. \u2018You\u2019ve never come?\u2019</p> <p>I shake my head under his mouth, not feeling in the slightest bit embarrassed. I\u2019m too distracted by the lush heaviness weighing down between my thighs, getting heavier with each gentle thrust of his hips. I\u2019ve never cl**axed when I\u2019ve slept with a man. Each encounter disgusted me, made me wonder what my mother found so hard to resist. I couldn\u2019t see what pleasure could come of it \u2013 I never realised it could be like this. I feel like all rationality is being stripped away.</p><p>\u2018Oh, f**king hell!\u2019 His face pulls away from mine, his h*ps jerking forward, a little less controlled. \u2018You\u2019ve never had an orgasm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I grapple at his shoulders, my head shaking despairingly. The pain has completely gone now. Oh God, it\u2019s gone and in its place is something else \u2013 something . . . \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, you sweet thing.\u2019 His drives are controlled again, but slightly firmer \u2013 more precise and consistent. \u2018Livy, you\u2019ve just made me a very happy man.\u2019</p><p>My nails dig in again. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m being bombarded with hot sparks stabbing at my epicentre. \u2018Oh!\u2019</p><p>He drops his face to mine and kisses me softly. I\u2019m not soft, though. I\u2019m hungry, and my frantic mouth action is proof of it. \u2018Slow down,\u2019 he mumbles, sounding desperate, trying to guide me by kissing me purposely slow.</p><p>I\u2019m turning light-headed; my eyes are rolling and my hands are now grasping his mass of dark waves. But I don\u2019t slow down. I can\u2019t. I feel a sense of urgency as the pressure builds and builds with every wonderful push of his hips.</p><p>\u2018Here it comes.\u2019 He breaks away from my mouth and re-braces himself on his arms, pumping firmly, leaving me with no mouth to devour and no hair to knot my fingers in. \u2018How does it feel, Livy? Tell me.\u2019 His jaw is tense, his eyes suddenly deadly serious.</p><p>\u2018Good!\u2019</p><p>\u2018How good?\u2019 He pleasures me with more and more and more.</p><p>\u2018Too good!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you ready to come?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know!\u2019 Is that what this is? I feel out of control, almost out of my mind.</p><p>\u2018Oh, sweet girl, you\u2019ve not lived.\u2019 His pace picks up and so does the pressure down below. My hands brace on his forearms and push, taking me further up the bed, and my head starts to urgently shake from side to side.</p><p>\u2018Oh God!\u2019 I yelp. \u2018Oh shit!\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s it, Livy!\u2019 It\u2019s becoming frantic \u2013 our breathing, the shouting, the sweating and tensing and bracing. But he still maintains that steady, easy pace. \u2018Let it go.\u2019</p><p>I have no idea what happens. The room starts spinning, a nuclear bomb goes off between my thighs and I scream. I can\u2019t stop it. My arms flop behind my head and Miller lowers himself on top of me, barking his cl**ax into my hair, panting and slipping over my wet skin. The throb, him inside me and me around him is comforting and so is his fitful breathing in my ear.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I gasp, not even feeling stupid for showing my appreciation. He\u2019s the one who keeps reminding me of my manners and what he\u2019s just done to me deserves some gratitude. Bloody hell, that was past even my highest expectations.</p><p>\u2018No, thank you,\u2019 he breathes, biting at my ear. \u2018The pleasure was all mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Trust me, it was mine,\u2019 I insist, smiling when I feel him grinning against my ear. I\u2019m desperate to see it, so I turn my face into him, finding the most amazing sight \u2013 a full-blown, boyish grin, making his eyes sparkle like crazy and revealing a dimple that I\u2019ve never noticed before. What I\u2019m seeing right now is a million miles away from the coffee-hating, clipped, refined, powerful man who has utterly captivated me. \u2018You look cute when you grin.\u2019</p><p>It disappears from his face immediately, a heavy frown replacing it. \u2018Cute?\u2019</p><p>That probably wasn\u2019t the best choice of a word for such a manly man, but he did look cute. Not now, because he\u2019s not grinning any more, but that tip of his lips, the revealing of that dimple and the sparkling of his blue eyes showed me a completely different man, a man who I can tell doesn\u2019t appear very often. \u2018You don\u2019t smile very much,\u2019 I say, feeling a little brave. \u2018You should make the effort. You look less intimidating when you smile.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019ve gone from being cute to being intimidating?\u2019 He shifts onto his forearms and brings his face to mine, nose to nose, forehead to forehead.</p><p>I nod my head, making his nod, too. \u2018You\u2019re a little intimidating.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or maybe you\u2019re too sweet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you\u2019re too intimidating,\u2019 I affirm, feeling him throbbing inside me. All edginess has left me, leaving me feeling calm and serene. It\u2019s a lovely sensation, and he made it.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll agree to disagree.\u2019 He\u2019s back to intimidating, but my serenity is still intact. It\u2019ll take a lot to pull me from this relaxed state of mind.</p><p>Easing out of me, he looks down between my thighs and pulls the condom off. \u2018Consider yourself broken in, Livy.\u2019</p><p>My face screws up at his lack of tact. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 He shifts down the bed and nestles between my thighs, looking up at me. \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I answer hesitantly. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just checking if you need a break. Say the word and I\u2019ll stop, okay?\u2019 He rests his lips over the apex of my thighs, encouraging my receding orgasm to resurrect. I start twitching. I need more recovery time.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I whisper, dropping my head back to the pillow and gazing up to the high ceiling. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever tell him to stop. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I blurt when I feel something hot and wet meet the tip of my buzzing clit. My head flies up, my stomach muscles tense and my hands fist in the sheets by my side. My outburst is ignored and he sits up, taking my leg and bending and lifting it so he can kiss the sole of my foot. I want to throw my head back, curse and shout, but I\u2019m immobilised by those damn clear eyes as he watches me struggling to cope with his tongue running up my ankle and onto my lower leg. \u2018That feels nice,\u2019 I confess as he inches his way upward until he finds my tummy and starts trailing his lips across my navel and then back down the other side.</p><p>\u2018Would you like me to continue?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I wheeze, my leg twitching, my muscles firming up.</p><p>\u2018Then I shall.\u2019 He nibbles the inside of my thigh. \u2018Soon, my mouth will be here,\u2019 he says quietly, pushing a finger into me, just a little. \u2018Would you like that?\u2019</p><p>I nod my answer and he circles, enticing a long, low moan from me. \u2018Oh, God,\u2019 I breathe, pulling at the covers, yanking one side up and letting it float down over my face.</p><p>He almost laughs as he pulls the sheets from my face, but my eyes remain firmly shut, even when I feel him moving up the bed until he\u2019s settled half on me, his finger still submerged. \u2018Open.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head shakes adamantly, my brain focused only on the sensation of his finger inside me. He\u2019s not moving, yet I\u2019m still pulsing incessantly around him, but then I feel his lips on the side of my mouth and my face turns towards the source of the heat, opening up to him, my thighs spreading wider, invitingly. I hum. It\u2019s low and broken, a clear sign of my pleasure, but I want him to know. I want him to hear how I feel.</p><p>\u2018I love that sound,\u2019 he whispers, withdrawing his finger and slowly thrusting forward with two. I whimper. \u2018There it is again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s good,\u2019 I tell him quietly against his lips. \u2018Really good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll agree on that one.\u2019 His lips leave my mouth and start trailing down between my modest br**sts and onto my stomach, his fingers still pushing forward and pulling away neatly, carefully. \u2018It would\u2019ve been a crime if you had declined this, Livy.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know!\u2019 I gasp, my stomach curling and knotting, my body movements becoming erratic.</p><p>\u2018To think I could\u2019ve missed out on this.\u2019 His fingers are suddenly gone and he\u2019s moving fast.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 My upper body flies up when he separates my folds and skims my clitoris with a light dash of his tongue. \u2018Ohhhhhhh,\u2019 I fall back to the bed, my palms covering my face, my legs shifting around him.</p><p>He nestles further into me, the hotness of his mouth completely encasing me and sucking gently. I recognise the signs now. I recognise the heaviness in my groin, the regular heartbeat in my clitoris and the need to tense everywhere. I\u2019m going to cl**ax again. \u2018Miller!\u2019 I cry, my hands finding my hair and gripping hard.</p><p>He releases me from his mouth and strokes a wickedly firm trail with his tongue, right up the centre of my cleft. \u2018Good?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes!\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s suddenly on his knees and his hands slide underneath me, his palms cupping my bum, and with one pull the whole of my lower body is raised from the bed. \u2018Get your legs over my shoulders,\u2019 he demands, helping me shift them until they\u2019re draped over his body. He holds me with ease and pulls me forward until I\u2019m held to his lips. \u2018You taste incredible.\u2019 His mouth starts a torturous dance across my sensitive lips, plunging into my centre and sucking on my clitoris. \u2018Exquisite, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t acknowledge that. I\u2019ve been tossed into sensory excess, my body struggling to deal with the onslaught of pleasure. This is unknown territory. This is beyond any stretch of my imagination. I feel like I\u2019m having an out-of-body experience.</p><p>My calves push into his back, pulling him closer, and his hands slide all over me, stroking and massaging me softly. I rip my eyes open and look up at him in his knelt position, holding me to his mouth, his blues pointing down at me. That look shoves me over the edge. My back bows and my fists slam into the mattress on either side of me. I want to scream.</p><p>\u2018Let it go, Livy,\u2019 he mumbles against my flesh. And I do.</p><p>I stop trying to suppress the pressure in my lungs and let it all out on a loud scream of his name, my thighs tensing around his face, my head thrown back. \u2018Oh God, oh God, oh God!\u2019 I pant, trying to think clearly. It\u2019s no good. Nothing can get past the wall of shock as my body goes lax and my mind goes blank. I\u2019ve lost control of everything. My mind. My body. My heart. He\u2019s hijacking every part of me. I\u2019m at his mercy. And I like it.</p> <p>I\u2019m eased back down to the bed, and I do nothing to help as he positions me on my side and lies behind me, pulling me into the hardness of his chest. \u2018What about you?\u2019 I breathe, feeling him hard against my back.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll let you recover first. I could be a while. Let\u2019s just cuddle.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I whisper, wondering how long a while is. \u2018You want to cuddle?\u2019 I never in a million years expected cuddling to be included in my twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u2018Cuddling\u2019s my thing with you, Olivia Taylor. I just want to hold you. Close your eyes and enjoy the silence.\u2019 He gathers my masses of honey hair and pulls it out of his way so he can access my back, then he starts a hypnotising, slow routine of lazy kisses over my skin. It makes my eyes heavier, finding immense comfort from the attention and his warmth coating every part of my back as he gives me his thing.</p><p>It makes me realise that I\u2019ve existed in solitary.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I come to in a dusky darkness, completely na**d and completely disorientated. It takes me a few moments to gather my bearings and when I do, I smile. I feel relaxed. I feel at peace. I feel sated and comfortable, but when I roll onto my side, he\u2019s not there.</p><p>I sit up and gaze around his bedroom. Should I look for him? Should I stay put and wait for him to return? What should I do? I have just enough time for a trip to the bathroom, ensuring I leave everything exactly how I found it, before the door opens and Miller appears. He has his black shorts on again, and his semi-naked perfection attacks my sleepy eyes, making me blink repeatedly just to ensure I\u2019m not dreaming. He looks at me standing and fidgeting, a sheet wrapped around me and my hair probably resembling a bird\u2019s nest.</p> <p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 he asks, walking forward. His hair looks adorable, the dark waves wild and messy, and that lock sitting perfectly in place on his forehead.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I pull the sheet in tighter, thinking maybe I should\u2019ve got dressed.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u2019 He takes the sheet and wrestles it from my grip until he\u2019s holding a corner in each hand and opening it, exposing my na**d body to shimmering blue eyes. His lips don\u2019t smile, but his eyes do. He moves into the sheet and drapes the ends over his shoulders so we\u2019re both enclosed in white cotton. \u2018How do you feel?\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018Good.\u2019 I feel more than good, but I won\u2019t admit it to him. I know why I\u2019m here and it\u2019s searing painfully on my conscience and morality each time I think about it. So I simply won\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018Just good?\u2019</p><p>I shrug. What does he want? A thousand-word essay on my current state of mind and state of body? I could probably write ten thousand words. \u2018Really good.\u2019</p><p>His hands slide around to my bottom and squeeze. \u2018Are you hungry?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not for oysters,\u2019 I blurt on a shudder.</p><p>He removes himself from the confines of the sheet and wraps me back up with the utmost care. \u2018No, not for oysters,\u2019 he agrees, pecking my lips lightly. \u2018I\u2019ll feed you something else.\u2019 His hand finds the nape of my neck over my hair, and then turns me away from him, leading me from the room.</p><p>\u2018I should get dressed,\u2019 I say, not attempting to stop him, but wanting him to know that I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with a sheet of cotton covering my modesty.</p><p>\u2018No, we\u2019ll eat, then bathe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Together?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, together.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t give my concerned tone the attention it deserves. I can shower or bathe myself. I don\u2019t need him to worship me to that extent.</p><p>I\u2019m taken into his kitchen and placed on a chair at a huge dining table, and I thank the cotton gods for the bed sheets separating my backside from the cold seat beneath me. \u2018What time is it?\u2019 I ask, silently hoping that I\u2019ve not wasted too much of my twenty-four hours sleeping.</p><p>\u2018Eleven o\u2019clock.\u2019 He opens the mirrored door of the huge double fridge and starts shifting things aside and placing things on the counter next to him. \u2018I was allowing you two hours\u2019 sleep, then I was going to poke you.\u2019 He places a bottle of champagne on the side and turns to face me. \u2018You came round just in time.\u2019</p><p>I smile, pulling my sheet in, thinking how much nicer it would\u2019ve been to wake up to those eyes glistening down at me. \u2018Do you mind if I get dressed?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>His head cocks to the side, his eyes slightly narrowed. \u2018Are you not comfortable in your skin?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I answer confidently, although I\u2019ve never found myself asking that question before now. I know that I\u2019m a little on the slender side, Nan reminds me daily, but am I really comfortable? Because the way I\u2019m holding the sheet to me would indicate otherwise.</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 He turns back toward the fridge. \u2018Then that\u2019s settled.\u2019 A glass bowl appears, piled high with big, juicy strawberries, and then he opens a cupboard which reveals row after row of precisely placed champagne flutes. He grabs two and places them in front of me, then the bowl of strawberries \u2013 all washed and hulled \u2013 before he\u2019s in another cupboard pulling down a cooling bucket and loading it with ice from the dispenser on the front of the fridge. The bucket gets placed in front of me, the champagne nestled into the ice, and then he\u2019s at the hob, putting on an oven mitt. I watch in fascination as he moves around the kitchen with complete ease, every motion precise and neat, and all done so very carefully. Nothing that he moves or puts down stays in the same position for very long. It gets turned a fraction or repositioned before he\u2019s happy and continuing with something else.</p><p>Right now he\u2019s walking towards me, holding a metal pan which is billowing steam from the glass bowl that\u2019s resting on the rim. \u2018Would you please pass me that trivet?\u2019</p><p>I look in the direction of his pointed finger and get up as quickly as the sheet covering me will allow, retrieving the metal pan stand and placing it next to the bowl of strawberries, champagne and glass flutes. \u2018There,\u2019 I say, taking my seat again and watching as he shifts the stand a few millimetres to the right before easing the hot pan onto it. I crane my neck over the pan and spy a deep puddle of melted chocolate. \u2018That looks delicious.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s next to me now, pulling a chair near and resting his backside on the seat. \u2018It tastes delicious, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can I dip?\u2019 I ask, getting my finger ready to plunge.</p><p>\u2018Your finger?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I look to him, finding dark, raised, disapproving eyebrows.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019ll be too warm.\u2019 He grabs the champagne and starts peeling away the foil. \u2018And that\u2019s why we have strawberries, anyway.\u2019</p><p>His frowning face and abrupt words make me feel childlike. \u2018So I can dip a strawberry, but not my finger?\u2019 I see him look at me out of the corner of his eye while he works the cork.</p><p>\u2018I guess so.\u2019 He brushes off my sarcasm and pours the champagne, but not before neatly placing the rubbish that he\u2019s just accumulated into a tidy little pile on a small plate.</p><p>He passes me a glass, and I start shaking my head. \u2018No, thank you.\u2019</p><p>His gasp is barely contained. \u2018Livy, this is Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2003. You don\u2019t say no to that. Take it.\u2019 He thrusts it forward, and I pull back.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want it, but thank you.\u2019</p><p>The look of shock morphs into thoughtfulness. \u2018You don\u2019t want this particular drink or any drink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Water would be good, please.\u2019 I\u2019m not going into this. \u2018I appreciate what you\u2019ve done with the strawberries and champagne, but I\u2019d rather have some water, if you don\u2019t mind.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s clearly stunned by my refusal to drink the expensive liquid, but he doesn\u2019t push it, and I\u2019m grateful. \u2018As you wish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I smile as he leaves me to replace the champagne with water.</p><p>\u2018Tell me you like strawberries,\u2019 he pleads, fetching a bottle of Evian and joining me again.</p><p>\u2018I love strawberries.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s a relief.\u2019 He unscrews the lid and pours my water into the other flute. \u2018Humour me,\u2019 he says when he catches sight of my furrowed brow. I accept the drink and watch as he takes his time selecting a strawberry before he dips it in the bowl and swirls carefully, coating the ripe fruit with dark chocolate. \u2018Open.\u2019 He clasps the seat of my chair with his spare hand and drags me closer so I\u2019m snugly fit between his thighs. His bare chest is slightly distracting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My jaw loosens automatically, mainly because I\u2019m gaping at his close beauty, and he holds my eyes as he brings the fruit to my mouth until I feel it skimming my lip. My mouth closes around it and my teeth sink in, biting a small piece from its plump flesh. \u2018Hmmm,\u2019 I hum happily and reach up to catch a trail of strawberry juice on my chin, but my wrist is seized before I get to wipe it away.</p><p>\u2018Allow me,\u2019 he whispers, edging further into me, his lips homing in on my chin and slowly licking away the juice before he slips the remaining piece past his lips. My chewing has slowed right down, matching the precise motions of his mouth. He swallows. \u2018Good?\u2019</p><p>My mouth is full, so I nod \u2013 knowing Miller\u2019s compulsion for manners \u2013 and hold my finger up to indicate a second as I chew quickly. I lick my lips and lean towards the bowl again. \u2018You need to feed me another.\u2019</p><p>His eyes twinkle as he selects another strawberry and dips and swirls again. \u2018It would be even better with champagne,\u2019 he muses, flicking his eyes to mine.</p> <p>I ignore him and place my water on the table. \u2018What chocolate is that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 He brings the strawberry to my mouth, but this time he brushes the runny chocolate across my bottom lip, and my tongue instantly leaves my mouth to clear it up. \u2018No.\u2019 He shakes his head and slides his palm around my neck, pulling me in. \u2018I get to do that,\u2019 he whispers in my face, moving in.</p><p>I don\u2019t fight him off. I let him clean up the mess that he\u2019s made and take the opportunity to rest my palms on his thighs, on either side of my knees. I smooth across the dark hairs of his legs, enjoying the feel of him, while he finishes up at my mouth, kissing the corner of my lips, the centre, and then the other corner.</p><p>\u2018What chocolate is it?\u2019 I repeat quietly, wanting to forget all sweet-tasting things and taste Miller instead.</p><p>\u2018Green and Black\u2019s.\u2019 He offers me the strawberry and I take it, holding it between my teeth. \u2018It has to be a minimum of eighty per cent cocoa.\u2019 The strawberry that I\u2019m holding is preventing me from asking why, so I frown instead, prompting him to go on. \u2018The bitterness of the chocolate coupled with the sweetness of the strawberry is what makes it so special. Add champagne and you have a perfect combination. And the strawberries simply have to be British.\u2019 He leans in and bites the strawberry that\u2019s wedged between my teeth and juice explodes between us.</p> <p>I don\u2019t care about the juice all over my chin, or that my mouth is full. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He finishes chewing and swallows. \u2018Because they\u2019re the sweetest you can buy.\u2019 He slips his hands under my thighs and lifts, pulling me forward so I\u2019m astride him on the chair. He takes excruciatingly long to clean me up. It makes my skin heat and my breath catch constantly in my throat as I try to contain the urge to pounce on him. The sheet is yanked away, exposing my full nakedness to him. \u2018Bath time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to bathe me,\u2019 I object, wondering how far he\u2019ll take this worshipping business. I\u2019m feeling extremely special, but I can wash myself.</p><p>He takes my hands and rests them on his shoulders, then gathers the masses of honey locks framing my face. \u2018I absolutely do need to bathe you, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He stands, holding my bum cheeks, and takes me to the mirrored fridge. I\u2019m placed on my feet and turned away from him so my front is facing the mirror. I\u2019m staring at myself. I feel uncomfortable, especially when I flick my eyes to Miller behind me and see his gaze journeying the length of my body. My eyes fall to the floor, but quickly snap up again when his chest is pressed against me and I feel his hard length pressed into my lower back \u2013 hot and moist. His shorts are gone.</p> <p>\u2018Feeling better?\u2019 he asks, holding my eyes in the mirror and reaching around to gently cup my breast.</p><p>I nod, when I really mean to say no. He intimidates me on every level, but it\u2019s all very addictive.</p><p>He moulds my breast gently. \u2018Mouth-watering,\u2019 he whispers, his lips moving slowly. \u2018Perfectly plump.\u2019 He tweaks my nipple lightly and kisses my ear. \u2018And incredibly tasty.\u2019</p><p>My eyes close and I lean back onto him, but my blissful state is interrupted when I\u2019m lightly pushed forward and pressed against the cold mirror of the fridge, my modest boobs squished to the glass and my face turning in to rest my cheek on the cool surface.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t move.\u2019 He disappears from behind me, but is back within a few seconds, his knee pushing between my thighs and spreading them before he takes my hands, one at a time, and lifts them, flattening my palms on the mirror above my head. I\u2019m spreadeagled against the front of the fridge, pushed up to the glass, and I can only just see him in my peripheral vision. He\u2019s holding the bowl of chocolate, and before I can even stop to consider his next move, he tips the whole contents across my shoulders, the warm chocolate making my shoulders jump up in shock, the sensation of it trickling down my back, over my bottom, and down my legs, making me pray for help. It\u2019s going to take time to lick all that away, and I\u2019ve had his tongue on me before. I\u2019ll never make it through without screaming or turning to devour him. I start to tremble.</p><p>I hear the bowl being placed on the worktop behind me, and I also definitely hear the drag of glass on marble, indicating the repositioning of it. He\u2019s just tipped melted chocolate all over me and now he\u2019s worried about the positioning of a bowl?</p><p>Lifting my face from the mirror, I look for him in the reflection, finding him approaching me. His penis is solid and bouncing freely as he paces, and he has a foil packet in his hand. I gulp and rest my forehead against the glass, mentally preparing myself for the sweet torture that I\u2019m about to endure.</p><p>\u2018See? Now I really do need to bathe you.\u2019 The warmth of his palms lands on the outside of my thighs and skate over my hips, my waist, my ribs \u2013 until his hands are sitting on my shoulders, massaging me, his big hands slipping over the chocolate. My head rolls back, a moan rolls from my lips, and my stomach rolls in anticipation.</p> <p>Gliding his touch down the column of my spine, his finger slips over the cheeks of my bum and to the top of my thighs, down, down, down, until he\u2019s kneeling on the floor behind me and reaching up to stroke down my body once more. I\u2019m on high alert. I\u2019m docile, but aware \u2013 calm but frenzied . . . alive but fading.</p><p>\u2018Livy, I\u2019m not sure twenty-four hours is going to be enough,\u2019 he whispers, his fingertip circling my anklebone. My eyes close and I try to divert my mind from sending the words that I want to say to my mouth. It won\u2019t help. He\u2019s turned on, that\u2019s all \u2013 caught up in the moment.</p><p>The tip of that damn finger burns a trail up the side of my lower leg until it\u2019s at the back of my knee. My legs wobble.</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I breathe, my palms sliding over the mirrored glass.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm,\u2019 he hums, replacing his finger with his tongue, licking a wickedly teasing stroke up the back of my thigh and onto my bum. He bites down on my cheek, his teeth sinking into my flesh and sucking . . . hard.</p><p>\u2018Please.\u2019 I\u2019m begging. I\u2019m doing what I swore I\u2019d never resort to. \u2018Please, please, please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, what?\u2019 He\u2019s on my back now, working up the centre of my spine, licking, sucking and biting as he makes his journey. \u2018Tell me what you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You,\u2019 I pant. \u2018I want you.\u2019 I\u2019m shameless, but that luscious heaviness is building again, heat racing through my veins, leaving no room for shyness.</p><p>\u2018As I want you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can have me.\u2019 I turn my head when he clasps my nape and twists his grip, finding clear eyes that could rival the bluest of tropical waters.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand how something so beautiful can be so pure.\u2019 His eyes skate all over my face, wonder gushing from the heat of his stare. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 He kisses me so delicately, his hands roaming everywhere, until they\u2019re spreading chocolate up my arms and encasing my balled fists with his palms.</p><p>I know the answer to his question, but he\u2019s not directly asked, so I should avoid enlightening him. That\u2019s not what this is about. For him, it\u2019s fulfilling his fascination. For me, it\u2019s about remedying a problem that I\u2019ve inflicted on myself \u2013 I have to keep telling myself that.</p><p>\u2018Turn around so I can see you,\u2019 he says against my lips, helping me swivel. When my chocolate-drenched back is pushed up against the fridge, slipping and sliding, he steps back and gives me an all-over visual assessment. I\u2019m not shy because I\u2019m too busy absorbing the mountain of chocolate-covered perfection before me \u2013 wide shoulders, tight h*ps and strong thighs . . . a thick, long column protruding from his groin. My mouth waters, my eyes fixed on that one area, despite the copious amounts of other hard perfection for my eyes to feast on. I want to taste him.</p><p>My eyes shoot to his when he steps forward, seeing a straight face, as usual, giving nothing away. \u2018Where is that mind wandering to?\u2019 he asks, reaching down and taking a firm grip of his cock, pulling my eyes downward and my breath backward. I choke on a gasp.</p><p>Now I\u2019m nervous, and my lack of response is a clear sign of this. Stupidly, I don\u2019t want to disappoint him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have had plenty of sweet lips wrapped around him, but I bet they all knew what they were doing. \u2018I\u2019m . . . can . . . it\u2019s . . .\u2019 I stutter and stammer all over the place, prompting him to relieve me of my awkwardness by burying his face under my neck and pushing up until my head\u2019s forced back and I\u2019m looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u2018You need to loosen up some more. I thought we were getting somewhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We are.\u2019</p><p>He drops me, leaving me weak and wobbly while he rips open the condom and makes quick work of rolling it on. I don\u2019t like it. I feel like it\u2019s a crime for him to be covering his beauty. \u2018I really wish we could do this flesh on flesh,\u2019 he muses, glancing up at me. \u2018But I wouldn\u2019t be much of a gentleman if I knocked you up, would I?\u2019</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t, but whatever\u2019s gentlemanly about keeping me as a sex toy for a day? Or telling me that I\u2019ll get the best f**k of my life? He\u2019s contradicted that promise. There has been nothing close to f**king since I arrived. He\u2019s been a gentleman through and through \u2013 a caring, attentive, considerate lover.</p><p>I\u2019m falling fast \u2013 too fast. And his gentlemanly approach is not helping.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 His soft rasp pulls my eyes open. I hadn\u2019t realised they were shut. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 He moves in and gets his face level with mine, stroking my cheek.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I shake my head mildly, offering a small smile.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll stop. We don\u2019t have . . .\u2019 He pauses and slips into thought for a few moments. \u2018I\u2019ll have to accept it if you\u2019ve had enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I blurt, a little panicked. I\u2019m fighting off unwanted hesitance. I\u2019m having flashes of reluctance, despite my craving for this man. But he\u2019s too tempting. He\u2019s forbidden fruit. I\u2019ve experienced him worshipping me, and even though I know it\u2019ll be bad for me, I want more. \u2018I don\u2019t want you to accept it.\u2019 Did I just say that out loud?</p><p>The wave of confusion on his dark stubbled face, mixed with a little relief, tells me I did. \u2018You want to go on?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I confirm, more calmly, more controlled, even if I\u2019m not feeling it. I\u2019m still sizzling with heat and want, and it\u2019s all for this beautiful, respectful man before me. I gather some confidence, my hesitancy irritating me, and lift my chocolate-coated arms to place my hands on his smooth chest. \u2018I want you again.\u2019 I take a deep breath and drop my mouth to the flesh between my palms. \u2018I want you to make me feel alive.\u2019</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what he does.</p><p>\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he exhales, grasping me under my thighs and lifting me to his h*ps where my legs seem to automatically curl around his tight waist. \u2018I would\u2019ve accepted it, but I wouldn\u2019t have been particularly happy about it.\u2019 He gently pushes me up against the fridge and takes his hand between our bodies. \u2018I can\u2019t seem to get enough of you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My back straightens, my arms finding the back of his neck when I feel the blunt head of his impressive manhood push against my entrance. \u2018You can have as much as you like,\u2019 I whisper quietly.</p><p>\u2018And I will while you\u2019re here.\u2019 The words kill me, but only very briefly because I\u2019m distracted from his sobering declaration when he pushes into me on a hiss. \u2018Oh Jesus, you\u2019ve moulded to me already.\u2019 His face falls into my hair while he gathers himself and I adjust to him inside me. He\u2019s right. Every muscle and void seems to shape around him like liquid. There\u2019s absolutely no pain, just crippling pleasure, more so when he draws back and pushes forward slowly, keeping his face buried in my neck. \u2018You feel too f**king good.\u2019</p><p>My heart is in my mouth. I can\u2019t speak. My body seems to react mechanically to him, creating feelings, sensations and thoughts, none of which I can prevent. \u2018Please, just f**k me,\u2019 I beg, hoping a lack of sentiment and intimacy might cure my building problem. \u2018You\u2019ve broken me in.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Savoured, not rushed.\u2019 He reveals his face to me, and I notice chocolate coating his chin. \u2018I\u2019ve already explained that to you.\u2019 His words are reinforced with a slow, continuous, meticulous pumping of his hips, over and over and over. \u2018This is good, yes?\u2019</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u2018I concur.\u2019 His grip on my thighs increases, and he lowers his mouth to mine. \u2018I\u2019m dragging this out for as long as possible.\u2019</p><p>I accept his kiss, falling into the steady flow of his tongue\u2019s delicate sweeps. This is easy. I have no reluctance. Following him is the easiest thing that I\u2019ve ever done. Our mouths are moving like we\u2019ve practised this kiss over and over, like this is the most natural thing in the world. It feels like it is. He feels so right to me, despite the fact that we\u2019re worlds apart in every element of our lives \u2013 him, the powerful, confident, abrupt businessman, and me, the boring, unsure, sweet waitress. Opposites attract has never been so appropriate. My direction of thought is valid and should probably be of concern, but not now, not when he\u2019s making me feel like this. My blood is heated, I\u2019m crippled by pleasure, and I feel more alive than ever before.</p><p>He\u2019s patient, thorough. His gyrating h*ps are going to be the death of me. My hands are wildly feeling him everywhere they can reach, my legs are aching and heavy, but I don\u2019t care. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I say into his mouth, \u2018it\u2019s coming.\u2019</p><p>He bites my lip and sucks, throwing me into sensation overload. \u2018I can feel it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Hmmm . . . I attack his mouth forcefully, my hands moving to his hair and pulling. I need to loosen my iron grip of his hips, but with the pulsations between my thighs hammering violently, I can\u2019t concentrate on anything else. My body movements are spontaneous. No instructions are filtering through. Everything is happening, but I\u2019m not telling it to. \u2018Please, please, please,\u2019 I beg. \u2018Faster.\u2019 The need for him to tip me over the edge has lowered me to more shameless begging \u2013 that and the desperate need to make this something other than tender lovemaking. He\u2019s holding me in limbo. I need to let go.</p><p>\u2018No, Livy.\u2019 He pacifies me softly but adamantly. \u2018I\u2019m not ready yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 This is torture. Pure, evil torture.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he counters, pushing into me, upholding his balanced rhythm. \u2018This is too good. You don\u2019t call the shots.\u2019</p><p>My temper surfaces and I brazenly tighten my fists in his hair and yank his head from my lips. I\u2019m panting, and so is he, but it doesn\u2019t hamper those hip movements. His hair is wet, his lips parted and the usual stray wave has been joined by a few more. I want him to slam me into the fridge. I want him to swear and curse at me for my viciousness. I want him to f**k me.</p><p>\u2018Livy, this isn\u2019t stopping anytime soon, so rein it in.\u2019</p> <p>I gasp at those words and silently will him to follow them up with a powerful smash of his body into mine, but he doesn\u2019t, damn him; he keeps his control. I yank his hair again, attempting to pull some fierceness from him, but he just smiles his full-on beautiful beam . . . so I pull some more.</p><p>\u2018Vicious,\u2019 he mouths, still not giving me what I want, still easing gently into me.</p><p>I throw my head back and yell in frustration, ensuring I keep my fist clenched in his hair.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you can mistreat me all you like. We\u2019re doing this my way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t take any more,\u2019 I cry.</p><p>\u2018Would you like me to stop?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does it hurt?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019m just driving you crazy?\u2019</p><p>I drop my head, accepting his careful pumping, still bubbling, and now sweating. I find his eyes, noting that familiar degree of arrogance. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I grate.</p><p>\u2018Is it wrong for me to be delighted by that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 My teeth are clenching now.</p><p>His faint smile transforms into a sly smirk, and his eyes glisten. \u2018I\u2019m not going to apologise, but lucky for you, now I\u2019m ready.\u2019</p><p>And with that, he lifts me, gains more leverage and eases back before gliding smoothly into me and holding himself deep and high on a strained groan, shaking against me.</p><p>It does the job.</p><p>I convulse in his arms, my body becoming limp, my mind spacing out and my hands finally freeing their hold of his hair. I\u2019m not trying to, but my internal wall is grabbing onto him with every pulse he delivers, elongating the waves of pleasure riding through me.</p><p>While I\u2019m quite happy being held against the fridge, limp and useless, Miller decides he\u2019s not so happy to hold me there. He folds down to the floor until I\u2019m splattered on his chest, and then rolls over to get me beneath him. He watches me fighting to gain control of my short breath, then takes his mouth to my nipple and sucks hard, biting down and squeezing the surrounding flesh with his hand. \u2018Glad you took me up on my offer?\u2019 he asks, sounding confident of the answer I\u2019ll give.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I exhale, drawing my knee up and willing some strength into my arm to lift and stroke the back of his head.</p><p>\u2018Of course you are.\u2019 He kisses his way up my body until he\u2019s at my lips, nibbling tenderly. \u2018Shower time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Leave me here,\u2019 I puff, my arms flopping to my sides. \u2018I don\u2019t have the energy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019ll do all the hard work. I said I\u2019d worship you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You also said you\u2019d f**k me,\u2019 I remind him.</p><p>He releases my lip from his grip and pulls back, thinking hard. \u2018I also said I\u2019d break you in first.\u2019</p><p>Surprisingly to me, I don\u2019t even blush. \u2018I think we can safely say you can tick that item off your list, so now you can f**k me.\u2019 What the hell has gotten into me?</p><p>Obviously, Miller is wondering the very same thing because his eyebrows have just jumped up in shock, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Perhaps I\u2019ve stunned him into silence. His brow furrows slightly as he starts to climb off me, and after disposing of the condom and wiping the bottoms of his feet, he quickly pulls me up and takes his customary hold of my nape. Then he starts guiding me towards his bedroom. \u2018Trust me, you don\u2019t want me to f**k you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because what we just shared was far more enjoyable.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s right, and though I know it\u2019s stupid of me, I don\u2019t want to add Miller to my list of meaningless encounters. \u2018Your kitchen is wrecked.\u2019 I point to the chocolate-coated floor and fridge, but he doesn\u2019t follow my indication to look, pushing me onward instead.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t look.\u2019 His eyes turn dark, and he shakes his head. \u2018I won\u2019t sleep.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling, even though I know it won\u2019t be appreciated. He\u2019s a clean freak. He has odd ways, with the constant repositioning of things, but after being here and seeing that immaculate wardrobe, I think he might even be a little obsessive about it.</p><p>Just as we breach the entrance to his bedroom, I\u2019m swiftly scooped up and carried across the room. I\u2019m a little shocked, but the rightness of it prevents me from saying anything. He\u2019s so strong and impeccably formed, a true masterpiece of a man, and he feels as good as he looks. When I\u2019m placed on my feet just inside the bathroom doorway, I glance back into his bedroom and quickly reach a swift conclusion. The soles of my feet are covered in chocolate. His are not. He didn\u2019t want to mess up his carpet. He\u2019s pottering around the bathroom, all particular about where he puts things \u2013 the towels, the toiletries \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t give me a second glance as he passes me, going back into the bedroom, leaving me feeling small and awkward. I frown to myself and wrap my arms around my na**d body, while I stand silently gazing around the immense bathroom until he\u2019s eventually back. He turns the shower on and tests the water. He has no problem with nudity, and it\u2019s hardly surprising. There\u2019s absolutely nothing for him to be shy about.</p><p>\u2018After you.\u2019 He sweeps his arm out, gesturing toward the mega shower space.</p><p>I\u2019m hesitant, however I manage to find direction and shuffle forward, na**d and coated in chocolate. I glace up at an impassive face as I pass him. He\u2019s all formal and cold, a complete about-turn from five minutes ago.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I murmur, stepping under the hot spray and immediately looking down, seeing chocolate water pooling at my feet. I\u2019m alone for a few moments, keeping my eyes down until his feet appear in my field of vision. Even they are perfect. My eyes start a slow climb up his body, studying every perfect, hard inch, until I\u2019m watching him squirt soap onto his palm. Those palms are going to be on me any second, but judging by the look on his face, this isn\u2019t going to be a steamy shower scene. He\u2019s concentrating too hard on the massaging of suds between his hands.</p><p>Without a word, he crouches in front of me and starts rubbing the shower cream into my thighs, slowly washing away the chocolate. I can do no more than watch quietly, but the lack of speaking is making me feel uncomfortable. \u2018What do you do for a living?\u2019 I ask, trying to break the awkward silence.</p><p>He pauses, but quickly picks up his pace again. \u2018I don\u2019t think we should get into personal chit-chat, given our arrangement, Livy.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t look at me, choosing to remain focused on my clean-up. I wish I had kept quiet because those words haven\u2019t relieved my unease; I just feel even more awkward. I\u2019m compelled to know more about him, but he\u2019s right. The knowledge will serve no purpose and will only make this cosier than it\u2019s supposed to be.</p><p>He continues to sweep those splendid hands all over my skin, not saying a word or even looking at me. After the intimacy of our night so far, this is difficult and unwelcome. It\u2019s like we\u2019re strangers. Well, we are, yet the man kneeling before me is the only person on God\u2019s earth whom I\u2019ve shared myself with. Not my past or any troubles, but my sober body and my vulnerability. He\u2019s made me question my approach to life and men. He\u2019s lured me in with a false sense of security, and now he\u2019s carrying on like this is business, not pleasure.</p><p>I\u2019m perplexed, but I shouldn\u2019t be. I knew the deal, yet his tenderness and the fact that he absolutely has not f**ked me, perhaps gave me false hope of this being more, which is obscene. He\u2019s really a stranger and an unpredictable, moody, intimidating one at that.</p><p>My speeding thoughts are interrupted when his hands make it to my shoulders, the firmness of his thumbs working into my flesh deliciously. And he\u2019s now looking at me, his face still straight and his hair sopping wet, looking longer with the water weighing down his waves. Lowering his face, he kisses me gently but sweetly before resuming the task of ridding my body of chocolate.</p><p>What was that?</p><p>A tender display of affection? A caring gesture? Natural instinct? Or was it just a friendly kiss? The heat of our mouths together suggested otherwise, but his face doesn\u2019t. I should leave. I\u2019m not sure how I thought this evening would pan out, but I should have thought harder, and then I\u2019m sure that I would\u2019ve passed his offer up. This shouldn\u2019t be me, and I\u2019ve swiftly been dragged from awe to resentment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m just about to declare my intention to halt our arrangement when he speaks. \u2018Tell me how it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ve not been taken by a man in seven years,\u2019 he asks, pushing some wet hair from my face.</p><p>I sigh, dropping my face until it\u2019s quickly forced back to his. \u2018I . . .\u2019 Whatever can I say? \u2018It\u2019s just that . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go on,\u2019 he pushes soothingly.</p><p>I find avoiding his question easy when I suddenly recall his previous statement. \u2018Given our \u201carrangement\u201d, I thought we weren\u2019t going to do chit-chat.\u2019</p> <p>His frown matches mine. He looks embarrassed. \u2018So I did.\u2019 My neck is gripped by his hand over my wet hair and I\u2019m directed from the shower. \u2018Forgive me.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m still frowning as he dries me off with a towel, and then takes my neck again, leading me from the bathroom towards his giant leather bed. It\u2019s dressed beautifully, all plush with deep-red crushed velvet and gold scatter cushions placed delicately. I didn\u2019t notice it before, but I know it couldn\u2019t have been this neat when I got up earlier, so it\u2019s been remade. I don\u2019t want to ruin the preciseness of it again, but Miller releases me and starts taking the cushions and placing them neatly in a chest at the end of the bed before he draws back the quilt and nods for me to climb in.</p><p>I step forward cautiously and slowly clamber onto the huge bed, feeling like the princess and the pea. Nestling down, I watch as he slips in beside me and plumps his pillow before resting his head and snaking his arm around my waist, gently tugging me towards his body. I move instinctively into the warmth of his chest, knowing this is wrong. I know it\u2019s wrong, even more so when he takes my hand, kisses my knuckles, and then places my palm on his chest and lays his over it, beginning a guided caress of his skin.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet. I can hear my mind ticking over with endless hopeful thoughts. And I think I might hear his, too, but there\u2019s an invisible strain now, and this invisible strain between us is far outweighing the great things that have come before. His heart is beating steadily under my ear, and the odd squeeze of his hand around mine is a gesture of comfort, but I\u2019m never going to be able to sleep, even though my body is exhausted and my brain drained.</p><p>Miller suddenly shifts, and I\u2019m removed from his chest and positioned neatly to the side. \u2018Stay here,\u2019 he whispers, kissing my forehead before removing his na**d body from the bed and slipping his shorts on. He leaves the room, and I prop myself up on my elbows and watch as the door closes quietly behind him. It has to be the early hours of the morning. What is he doing? The absence of the awkward silence should be making me feel better. But it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m nude, sore between the thighs, and I\u2019m tucked up neatly in a stranger\u2019s bed, but I can do no more than lie back and stare up at the ceiling with only my unwelcome thoughts to keep me company. He makes me feel wonderful and alive, and in the next breath, awkward and an inconvenience.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019m there, but when I hear a few bangs and definitely a polite curse, I can stay no more. I shuffle to the edge of the bed, taking the sheet with me, and pad across the bedroom, gingerly letting myself into the corridor and wandering quietly towards the source of the commotion. The noises and muttered curses get clearer and clearer until I\u2019m standing in the doorway of the kitchen looking at Miller wiping down the fridge\u2019s mirrored doors.</p><p>What should be making me stagger in disbelief is Miller\u2019s frantic hand swirling a cloth over the surface, but it\u2019s the muscles of his back, all rippling and sharp, that have my breath catching and my hand darting out to the door frame to steady myself. He can\u2019t be real. He\u2019s a hallucination \u2013 a dream or a mirage. I would be sure of this, if I wasn\u2019t so . . . broken in.</p><p>\u2018Fucking mess!\u2019 he hisses to himself, plunging his hand into a bucket of soapy water and wringing the cloth out. \u2018What the f**k was I thinking? Fuck!\u2019 He slaps the cloth on the mirrored doors again, continuing to curse and rub frantically.</p><p>\u2018Everything okay?\u2019 I ask quietly, smiling like crazy on the inside. Miller likes everything just like him; perfect.</p><p>He swings round, surprised but scowling. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you in bed?\u2019 The cloth gets thrown viciously into the bucket. \u2018You should be resting.\u2019</p><p>My sheet gets pulled in closer, like I\u2019m using it as a protective shield. He\u2019s mad, but is he mad with me or with the smeared mirror of the fridge? I start backing away, a little wary.</p> <p>\u2018Fuck.\u2019 He hangs his head in shame, shaking it a little and ruffling his dark mop with a frustrated swipe of his hand. \u2018Please, forgive me.\u2019 His eyes lift and gush with genuine regret. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have spoken to you like that. It was wrong of me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it was,\u2019 I agree. \u2018I\u2019m not here to be snapped at.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just . . .\u2019 He looks at the fridge and clenches his eyes shut, like it hurts him to see the smears. Then he sighs and walks forward, holding his hands out, silently asking my permission to touch me. Stupidly or not, I nod, and he visibly relaxes. He wastes no time and crowds me, pulling me close and sinking his nose into my damp hair. The comfort it gives me can\u2019t be ignored. When he said that he wouldn\u2019t sleep, he really meant it. He didn\u2019t look at the mess when I hinted at it, but clearly it was playing on his mind, tormenting him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he repeats, kissing my hair.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t like mess.\u2019 I don\u2019t ask it as a question because it\u2019s painfully clear, and I\u2019m not giving him the opportunity to insult me by denying it.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m house proud,\u2019 he counters, turning me and pushing me back towards the bedroom.</p><p>Every step we take, I\u2019m reminded of my palatial surroundings. \u2018Don\u2019t you have a cleaner?\u2019 I ask, thinking a businessman who lives in a place like this, dresses like Miller and drives a prestigious car, would at least have a housekeeper.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I\u2019m unwrapped from the sheet and lifted into bed. \u2018I like doing it myself.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You like cleaning?\u2019 I blurt, shocked. He really can\u2019t be real.</p><p>His lips tip at the corners, making me feel a whole lot better about the events, words and feelings that have come after our intimacies. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say I like it.\u2019 He slips in beside me and pulls me in, tangling our na**d legs. \u2018I suppose you could call me a domestic god.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m smiling now, too, and my hand is having a field day with free access to his bare chest. \u2018I never would\u2019ve thought it,\u2019 I muse.</p><p>\u2018You should try to stop thinking too much. People overthink things, making them bigger deals than they actually are.\u2019 He speaks softly, almost nonchalantly, but there\u2019s more meaning to those words, I know there is.</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing specific.\u2019 He pecks the top of my head. \u2018I was just being general.\u2019</p><p>He wasn\u2019t being general at all, but I say no more. His reversed mood has calmed my earlier unease, and I\u2019m letting the security of his body encasing me ease me into a peaceful slumber. It\u2019s not long before my eyes slowly close and the last sound I hear is Miller humming something hypnotising and soft in my ear.</p><p>In a panic, my eyes snap open and I bolt upright in bed. It\u2019s completely dark. Brushing my wild hair from my face, I take a few moments to backtrack and it all comes back to me . . . or was I dreaming?</p><p>I pat around on the bed, feeling nothing but soft bedding and a pillow with no head on it. This bed is enormous, but I wouldn\u2019t lose a whole man in it. \u2018Miller?\u2019 I whisper timidly, then feel down my body, noting no clothing. I always sleep in my knickers. I\u2019m not dreaming, and I don\u2019t know whether to be relieved or frightened by that. I stumble out of the bed and feel my way around the wall. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I curse, smacking my shin on something hard. I rub away the stab of pain and shift further, meeting something with my head. The crash pierces the silence, and I fumble with something attacking me. \u2018Bollocks!\u2019 I lose the battle to hold whatever has hit me and let it fall, wincing when it smashes, before rubbing my forehead. \u2018Bloody hell.\u2019</p><p>I expect Miller to appear from wherever he\u2019s hiding to investigate the commotion, but after standing in silence for ever, hoping he\u2019ll flick a switch that\u2019ll bless me with light, I\u2019m still blind. I resume my tentative groping of the wall in the darkness until I feel something resembling a switch. I flick it on, blinking back the harsh invasion of artificial light. Of course I\u2019m alone, and I\u2019m also naked. I note the cabinet that I smacked my shin on and the floor-standing lamp that I bumped my head on, which is now resting against the cabinet, smashed into a million pieces. I hurry back to the bed and grab the bedding, wrapping it around me as I walk back towards the door. He\u2019s probably cleaning the fridge again, but once I\u2019ve found my way into the kitchen, I find no Miller cleaning. In fact, I find no Miller at all. Nowhere. I circle his apartment twice, opening and closing doors, or all that will open. There\u2019s one that won\u2019t. I jiggle the handle but it doesn\u2019t shift so I gently tap and wait. Nothing. I head back to his bedroom with a completely furrowed brow. Where\u2019s he gone?</p><p>Sitting on the side of his bed, I wonder what to do, and for the first time the full force of my stupidity smacks me hard in the face. I\u2019m in a strange apartment, na**d in the middle of the night, after having crazy, no-emotions, reckless sex with a stranger. Sensible, wise Livy has just pulled a stunt worthy of an award. I\u2019ve let myself down.</p><p>I look around for my clothes, but they\u2019re nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u2018Fucking hell!\u2019 I curse to myself. What the hell has he done with them? Logic descends too quickly and I find myself in front of the cabinet, removing the lamp and pulling a drawer open, finding neat piles of men\u2019s clothes. It doesn\u2019t deter me. I pull the next open, then the next and the next, until I\u2019m on my knees at the bottom drawer, staring at my clothes, all neatly folded, with my Converse positioned deftly next to them, laces tucked in. I laugh to myself, pull my belongings free from the drawer, and quickly dress myself.</p><p>As I turn to exit, I notice a piece of paper on the bed. I don\u2019t want to believe that he\u2019s left me a pillow note, and I should probably leave without reading it, but I\u2019m just too damn curious. Miller makes me curious, and that\u2019s a bad thing because everyone knows that curiosity killed the bloody cat. I hate myself for it but I hurry over and snatch it up, angry before I\u2019ve even read it.</p><p>Livy,</p><p>I\u2019ve had to nip out. I won\u2019t be long so please do not leave.</p><p>If you need me, call me. I\u2019ve stored my number in your phone.</p><p>Miller</p><p>x</p><p>Stupidly, I sigh at the sight of a kiss after his name. Then I get mighty irritated. He\u2019s had to nip out? Who nips out in the middle of the night? I go in search of my phone to establish exactly what time it is. I find my bag and phone on the glass coffee table, and after turning it on and ignoring dozens of missed calls from Gregory and three text messages advising me that I\u2019m in trouble, the screen tells me it\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the morning. Three?</p><p>My phone is spun repeatedly in my grasp as I contemplate what could\u2019ve called him away at this time. An emergency, perhaps? Something could\u2019ve happened to a member of his family. He could be at a hospital or picking up a drunken sister from a nightclub. Does he have a sister? All sorts of reasons are dancing in my head, but when my phone starts ringing in my hand and I look down and see his name flashing on my screen, I stop wondering because I\u2019m about to find out.</p><p>I connect the call. \u2018Hello?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re awake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, yes, and you\u2019re not here.\u2019 I sit down on the sofa. \u2018Is everything okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it\u2019s fine.\u2019 He\u2019s speaking quietly. Maybe he is in a hospital. \u2018I\u2019ll be back soon so just relax in bed, okay?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Relax in bed? \u2018I was just leaving.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 He\u2019s not whispering any more.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not here, so there\u2019s little point in me staying.\u2019 This isn\u2019t being worshipped; this is being abandoned.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a big point!\u2019 he argues, and I hear a door slam in the background. \u2018Just stay where you are.\u2019 He sounds fretful.</p> <p>\u2018Miller, are you okay?\u2019 I ask. \u2018Has something happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then what\u2019s called you out in the middle of the night?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just business, Livy. Go back to bed.\u2019</p><p>The word \u2018business\u2019 spikes unwarranted resentment in me. \u2018Are you with that woman?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What makes you say that?\u2019</p><p>His question has transformed that resentment into suspicion. \u2018Because you said \u201cbusiness\u201d.\u2019 With all of the mind-blanking worshipping, I\u2019d forgotten about the black-haired beauty.</p><p>\u2018No, please. Just get back in bed.\u2019</p><p>I flop back against the sofa. \u2018I won\u2019t sleep. This wasn\u2019t part of the deal, Miller. I don\u2019t want to be alone in a strange apartment.\u2019 The absurdity of my words makes me physically kick myself. Yes, because I\u2019m happier in a strange apartment with a strange man, who makes me lose all sensibility.</p><p>\u2018The deal was for one night, Olivia. Twenty-four hours, and I\u2019m annoyed enough at having to lose a few of those. If you\u2019re not in that bed when I get home, then I\u2019ll . . .</p><p>I sit up. \u2018You\u2019ll what?\u2019 I ask, hearing his panicked, fitful breaths down the line.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll what?\u2019 I hiss impatiently, standing and picking up my bag. Is he threatening me?</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll find you and put you back in it!\u2019 he snaps.</p><p>I actually laugh. \u2018Are you listening to yourself?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 His tone has calmed. \u2018It\u2019s not courteous to break a deal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We didn\u2019t shake on it.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, we f**ked on it.\u2019</p><p>I gasp, scowl, and choke all at once. \u2018I thought you were a gentleman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whatever gave you that idea?\u2019</p><p>My mouth snaps shut as I consider his question. Our first meeting never suggested that he\u2019s a gentleman, and neither did our following encounters, but his attentiveness and manners since I\u2019ve been here have. There has been no f**king, not in any sense of the word.</p><p>A horrid realisation dawns. I really have been very stupid. He\u2019s seduced me, and he\u2019s done it brilliantly. \u2018I have no idea, but I\u2019m clearly mistaken. Thank you for the countless orgasms.\u2019 I hear him shouting my name as I pull the phone away from my ear and hang up. I\u2019m stunned by my own brazenness, but Miller Hart spikes my inner spunk. And that\u2019s dangerous territory to be falling into, but essential to maintain when dealing with this confounding man. Throwing my satchel over my shoulder, I head for his front door, rejecting the incoming call before turning off my phone.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep a wink, despite being in the comfort of my own bed. After sneaking into the house like a professional cat burglar, I tiptoed up the stairs, avoided all of the creaking floorboards, and crossed the landing stealthily until I was in the safety of my own room. Then I lay there in the darkness for the remaining few hours of night, looking blankly and blindly up at the ceiling.</p><p>Now the birds are tweeting, I can hear Nan downstairs pottering around in the kitchen, and I have no desire to face the day. My mind is awash with images, thoughts and conclusions, none of which I want to waste brain space on. But no matter how hard I\u2019m trying, I just can\u2019t boot him out of my jumbled head.</p><p>Leaning over to my bedside table, I unplug my phone from the charger and brave turning it on. There\u2019s another five missed calls from Gregory, one from Miller and a voicemail. I don\u2019t want to hear what either man has to say, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from tormenting myself further and listening to the damn message. It\u2019s my worried friend \u0327 not Miller.</p><p>\u2018Olivia Taylor, you and I are going to be having some very strong words when I get hold of you. What are you thinking, baby girl? For crying out loud! I thought you were the sensible one out of the two of us. You\u2019d better call me, or I\u2019ll be paying a visit to Nan, and I\u2019ll be telling her of your transgressions! He could be a ra**st, an axe murderer! Holy shit, you stupid woman! I\u2019m not a happy bunny!\u2019</p><p>He sounds totally exasperated, the drama queen. And I know he won\u2019t spill to Nan because he knows, just as well as I do, that she\u2019ll be rejoicing, not despairing. Empty threats, that\u2019s all his message is. Part true, but over the top and completely knocked out of perspective.</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>A little.</p><p>Not in the least bit.</p><p>He\u2019s one hundred per cent right, and he doesn\u2019t know the half of it. I am an idiot. I call him before he goes into seizure, and he answers immediately, sounding like he may already be suffering meltdown. \u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m alive.\u2019 I fall back to my pillow. \u2018Take a few deep breaths, Gregory.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t take the piss! I\u2019ve been working through the night trying to find out where he lives.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re overreacting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think I am!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t find him, then?\u2019 I ask, pulling my quilt up further and snuggling down.</p><p>\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t have much to go on, did I? I googled \u201cMiller\u201d but I don\u2019t think he grinds crops for a living.\u2019</p><p>I laugh to myself. \u2018I don\u2019t know what he does for a living.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well it doesn\u2019t matter because you won\u2019t be seeing him again. What went down? Did you shag him? Where are you? Have you lost your f**king mind?!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m not laughing any more. \u2018None of your business, none of your business, I\u2019m at home and yes, I have lost my bloody mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018None of my business?\u2019 he screeches, all high-pitched. \u2018Livy, I\u2019ve busted my balls for years, trying to pry you from that stupid shell you hide away in. I\u2019ve introduced you to endless decent men, all of which were mad for you, but you flat-out refused to even entertain the idea of a friendly drink or, at a stretch, dinner. Letting a man wine and dine you doesn\u2019t make you your mother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up!\u2019 I hiss, the mention of my mother spiking too much venom that\u2019s evident in my tone.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but what is it about this cocksucker that\u2019s turned you into an irresponsible, reckless twat?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re the only cocksucker I know,\u2019 I accuse quietly, because I\u2019m at a loss at what else to say. I have been pretty reckless, just like my moth\u2014 \u2018And he\u2019s not a criminal or a murderer. He\u2019s a gentleman.\u2019 Sometimes, I add to myself.</p><p>\u2018What happened? Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He worshipped me,\u2019 I confess. He\u2019ll nag me stupid, so I may as well come clean. It\u2019s done now. No going back.</p><p>\u2018\u201cWorshipped\u201d?\u2019 Gregory\u2019s voice is barely a whisper, and I see him in my mind\u2019s eye halting whatever he may be doing on the other end of the phone.</p><p>\u2018Yes, he\u2019s ruined it for all those who will come after.\u2019 He really has. Nothing will compare. No man will match his skill, attentiveness and passion. I\u2019m totally buggered.</p><p>\u2018Oh Lord.\u2019 He\u2019s still whispering. \u2018That good?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Blissful, Gregory. I feel cheated. While he promised twenty-four hours, I only got eight. I annoyingly want the re\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whoa! Rewind! Re-fucking-wind!\u2019 he yells, making me jump in my bed. \u2018Back the f**k up! What\u2019s this about twenty-four hours? Twenty-four hours for what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018To worship me.\u2019 I turn onto my side, transferring my phone to the other ear. \u2018He offered me that time because it\u2019s all he could.\u2019 I cannot believe that I\u2019m divulging all of this information to Gregory. This has to get the gold, especially given that it\u2019s me who we\u2019re juicing it up about.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u2019 I can see the shock on his face when I close my eyes. \u2018I need to see you. I\u2019m on my way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no!\u2019 I sit up urgently. \u2018Nan doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here. I snuck back in.\u2019</p><p>Gregory laughs. \u2018Baby girl, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your nan knows exactly where you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because she\u2019s the one who called me to say you were home.\u2019 There\u2019s a degree of smugness in his tone.</p><p>I look to the heavens for strength. I should\u2019ve bloody known. \u2018Then why did you pick my brain about where I am?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I wanted to see if my soulmate had developed a habit of lying, as well as being a dumb-arse. I\u2019m glad to have it confirmed that you\u2019re only the latter. I\u2019m on my way.\u2019 He hangs up, and as soon as I drop my phone to the bed, I hear the familiar sound of creaking floorboards, so I hastily crawl under the covers and hold my breath.</p><p>The door opens, but I remain like a statue, out of view, eyes clenched shut and holding my breath \u2013 not that I expect it to deter her. I bet she\u2019s dying to get the scoop, the nosy old bat.</p><p>There\u2019s total silence, but I know she\u2019s there, and then I feel a light brushing tickle on the sole of my foot and my leg lashes out on an uncontrolled burst of laughter. \u2018Nan!\u2019 I shout, throwing the quilt back and finding her plump body at the bottom of my bed, arms crossed, and with a dirty smirk on her old face. \u2018Don\u2019t look at me like that,\u2019 I warn.</p><p>\u2018Your boss, my arse!\u2019</p><p>\u2018He was.\u2019</p><p>She scoffs and comes to sit on the edge of the bed, putting me on high alert. \u2018Why are you telling me porky pies?\u2019 she asks.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not.\u2019 My response is feeble and my eyes, diverted from hers, are a sign of my guilt.</p><p>\u2018Livy, give your grandmother a break.\u2019 She slaps my thigh over the quilt. \u2018I might be an old lady, but my eyes and ears work just fine.\u2019</p><p>I chance a reluctant glance at her, seeing a grin being held back. I\u2019ll make her day if I confirm what she already knows. \u2018Yes, and so does your nosy mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not nosy!\u2019 she argues. \u2018I\u2019m just being . . . a concerned grandmother.\u2019</p><p>I scoff and tug the quilt from under her bum, wrapping it around myself and escaping to the bathroom. \u2018You\u2019ve nothing to be concerned about.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think I have when my sweet granddaughter lives like a recluse, and then suddenly stays out until dawn.\u2019</p><p>I cringe, quickening my pace as she follows me across the landing. My work excuse won\u2019t wash now, so I hold my tongue and make quick work of shutting the bathroom door behind me, just catching a glimpse of her grey eyebrows arched and her thin lips curved.</p><p>\u2018Is he your boyfriend?\u2019 she calls through the door.</p><p>I turn the shower on and drop my quilt. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Was he your boyfriend?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you courting him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dating. It means dating, dear.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just having sex, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I yell, flashing the door an incredulous look.</p><p>\u2018Just asking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, don\u2019t!\u2019 I step into the bath and under the hot spray, thankful for the hot water, but not for the flashbacks of my last shower. He\u2019s invading every corner of my brain, except the little part which is currently being reserved to answer Nan\u2019s unreasonable questions. I squeeze some shampoo into my palms and set about lathering up my hair, hoping I\u2019ll physically scrub the memories away as I do.</p><p>\u2018Are you in love with him?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I freeze under the water, my hands sitting idly in the mass of bubbles on my head. \u2018Don\u2019t be stupid.\u2019 I try to sound shocked, but all I achieve is a quiet, thoughtful rush of breath. I\u2019m not sure what my feelings are because they\u2019re all over the place at the moment. And they shouldn\u2019t be, especially with the knowledge of another woman. I\u2019m not in love with him, though. I\u2019m intrigued by him, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s fascinating to me.</p><p>I wait for Nan\u2019s comeback as my body remains still and my mind contemplates what she might say next. It\u2019s a long time, but I eventually hear the distant creaking of floorboards. She\u2019s gone, and she didn\u2019t challenge my unconvincing reply to her final question, which is extremely unusual.</p><p>Gregory is making up for Nan\u2019s mild interrogation. He\u2019s humoured me for a few hours, riding the open-top, hop-on-hop-off tour bus and listening to me remind him of why I love London so much, but when I\u2019m guided to the outside seating area of a cafe off Oxford Street, I know my time evading him has passed. \u2018Coffee or water?\u2019 he asks as the waiter approaches, giving me his roving eye.</p><p>\u2018Water.\u2019 I ignore the waiter and commence a nervous fiddle of the napkin, folding it neatly too many times, until it\u2019s no longer foldable.</p> <p>My friend is looking at the waiter the same way the waiter is looking at me, all bug-eyed and smiley. \u2018Water and an espresso, please, kind sir.\u2019</p><p>I grin at Gregory, making it a continuous triangle of smiles as the waiter writes down our order and backs away, missing the lady on the next table who\u2019s waving for his attention. It\u2019s overcast but muggy, and my tight jeans are sticking to my thighs.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 Gregory begins, taking the napkin from my hand, leaving me fiddling with my ring instead. \u2018He promised twenty-four hours and you only got eight.\u2019 He dives right in, no holding back.</p><p>I pout, and I hate myself for it. \u2018That\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I sigh. A few hours being distracted by the grandness of my beloved London did a wonderful job of temporarily washing him from my mind. That\u2019s the problem, though; it\u2019s just temporary.</p><p>\u2018What cut it short?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He had to nip out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I refuse to look at Gregory, like a lack of eye contact might make telling him the truth easier. It must be working because I go on, keen to get his thoughts. \u2018I woke up at three this morning and he was gone. He left a pillow note telling me he\u2019d be back, then he called but wouldn\u2019t say where he was, only that it was business. I got a little annoyed and so did he.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What was he annoyed about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I said I was leaving and it\u2019s ill-mannered to break a deal.\u2019 I chance a look at Gregory, finding his brown eyes wide. \u2018We didn\u2019t actually shake on it,\u2019 I finish, not adding the fact that according to Miller we f**ked on it.</p><p>\u2018He sounds like a knob,\u2019 he declares spitefully. \u2018An arrogant knob!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018He\u2019s not,\u2019 I argue quickly. \u2018Well, he can come across a little like that, but not when he had me in his arms. He really did worship me. He said he was going to f**k me, but he . . .</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Gregory screeches, leaning forward. \u2018He actually said that to you?\u2019</p><p>I sink back in my chair, thinking I should\u2019ve kept that part to myself. I don\u2019t want my friend to hate Miller, even if I do a little myself. \u2018Yes, but he didn\u2019t follow through on it. He showed me nothing but respect and . . .\u2019 I pause, stopping myself from saying such a stupid word in these circumstances.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018He was a gentleman.\u2019</p><p>Our drinks arrive and I immediately pour my water into my glass and take a long swig while I\u2019m ogled by the smiling waiter and Gregory ogles him. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 My friend beams at the waiter, making his interest known, despite the waiter\u2019s obvious sexual preference.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome. Enjoy,\u2019 the waiter says, keeping his eyes on me before he finally takes care of the woman who is again waving for his attention.</p><p>Gregory\u2019s smiling face soon alters to a scowl when his eyes land back on me. \u2018Livy, you\u2019ve already said that you saw him with a woman. I know just as well as you do that she\u2019s probably no business associate. He sounds nothing like a gentleman.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I mumble sullenly, the reminder stabbing at my falling heart. That woman is beautiful, elegant and undoubtedly as cultured and wealthy as Miller. That\u2019s his world \u2013 posh women, posh hotels, posh events, posh clothes, posh food and drink. Mine is serving that posh food and drink to those posh people. I need to forget about him. I need to remind myself how aggravated he makes me. I need to remind myself that it was meaningless sex. \u2018I won\u2019t be seeing him again.\u2019 I sigh. It wasn\u2019t meaningless sex to me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad.\u2019 Gregory smiles and takes a sip of his espresso. \u2018You deserve the whole package, not just the scraps a man\u2019s prepared to throw when he feels like it.\u2019 He reaches over and gives my hand a comforting squeeze. \u2018I think you know he\u2019s no good for you.\u2019</p><p>I smile, knowing my best friend is talking complete sense. \u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>Gregory nods and winks, sitting back in his chair, just as my phone starts ringing from my bag. I grab my satchel from the chair next to me and start rummaging through.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019ll be Nan,\u2019 I moan. \u2018She\u2019s driving me loopy.\u2019</p><p>Gregory laughs, prompting a snigger from me, too, but I soon halt my happy tittering when I note the caller\u2019s not Nan. My wide eyes fly to Gregory\u2019s.</p><p>He soon stops laughing, too. \u2018Is it him?\u2019</p><p>I nod, glancing back down to the screen, my thumb hovering over the button that\u2019ll connect me to Miller. \u2018I\u2019ve not returned his call.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Be wise, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>Be wise. Be wise. Be wise. I take a deep breath and answer. \u2018Hello.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I counter coldly and calmly, despite my speeding heart rate. The slow, rounded pronunciation of my name spikes a vivid image of his slow-moving lips.</p><p>\u2018We need to pick up where we left off. I have an engagement to keep this evening, but I\u2019ll keep tomorrow free.\u2019 He sounds formal and short, making my heart race that little bit more, but more out of irritation than desire. What am I, a business transaction?</p><p>\u2018No, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t a question, Livy. I\u2019m telling you that you\u2019ll be spending the day with me tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s very kind of you, but I\u2019m afraid I have plans.\u2019 I sound hesitant when I was aiming for sureness. I\u2019m aware that Gregory is watching and listening intently, and I\u2019m glad because I\u2019m certain that if he wasn\u2019t here to monitor the conversation, then I\u2019d be agreeing. Hearing his smooth voice, even though there\u2019s no element of friendliness to it, is bringing back all of the feelings that came before the anger of being abandoned.</p><p>\u2018Cancel them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For me, you can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I can\u2019t.\u2019 I hang up before I cave and quickly turn my phone off. \u2018Done,\u2019 I declare, shoving it in my bag.</p><p>\u2018Good girl. You know it makes sense.\u2019 Gregory smiles across the table at me. \u2018Drink up and I\u2019ll walk you home.\u2019</p><p>We say goodbye on the corner, Gregory heading off to get ready for a night out, me to go and hide in my bedroom from my prying grandmother. As I\u2019m inserting my key quietly into the lock, the door swings open and two pairs of old eyes look at me with interest \u2013 Nan trying to read me, George peering over her shoulder with a mild grin on his face. I can only imagine what\u2019s gone down in this house since I left this morning and George arrived. He\u2019ll do anything for Nan, including listening to her harp on about her boring, withdrawn granddaughter. Except this time I\u2019m not boring. And George\u2019s delight at this news is written all over his round face.</p><p>\u2018Your phone\u2019s off,\u2019 Nan fires accusingly. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>My arms drop to my sides on an over-the-top sigh before I push my way past them, heading toward the kitchen. \u2018The battery died.\u2019</p><p>Her scoff indicates her thoughts on that lie as she tracks me. \u2018Your boss stopped by.\u2019</p><p>I swing around, horrified, finding straight lips and George still grinning over her shoulder. \u2018My boss?\u2019 I ask tentatively, my damn heart pounding against my chest.</p><p>\u2018Yes, your real boss.\u2019 She watches for my reaction and she won\u2019t be disappointed. I\u2019m trying my hardest not to, but I\u2019m blushing furiously and my body has completely sagged. \u2018Nice cockney man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What did he want?\u2019 I breathe, gathering myself together.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s been trying to call you.\u2019 She fills the kettle and signals for George to sit, which he does without delay, still grinning at me. \u2018Something about a charity gala this evening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He wants me to work?\u2019 I ask hopefully, retrieving my phone and quickly turning it on.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 She continues with tea-making duties, her back to me. \u2018I did point out that it might be too much after your long shift yesterday evening.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m scowling hard at her back, and I know George\u2019s grin has just widened. \u2018Give it a rest, Nan,\u2019 I warn, stabbing at the buttons of my phone. She doesn\u2019t turn around and she doesn\u2019t answer. She\u2019s made her point, as have I.</p><p>Putting my phone to my ear, I take the stairs to escape to the sanctuary of my room. Del needs me to waitress this evening and I accept eagerly, before I\u2019m told where to be and when. I\u2019ll do anything to distract myself.</p><p>Pushing my way through the staff entrance of the hotel, I\u2019m immediately greeted by a pacing Sylvie. She\u2019s on me like a wolf, like I knew she would be. \u2018Tell me everything!\u2019</p><p>I walk past her, heading for the kitchen. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to tell.\u2019 I brush her off, reluctant to confirm that she was right. I take my apron from a smiling Del and start putting it on. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>He hands one to Sylvie, too, who snatches it and doesn\u2019t thank our boss. \u2018So you told him where to go?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say very convincingly, probably because it\u2019s part truth. I have, in effect, told him where to go. I start loading my round silver tray with glasses. \u2018So you can quit with the nagging because there\u2019s nothing to nag me about.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 she says placidly, starting to help me. \u2018Well, I\u2019m glad. He\u2019s an arrogant bastard.\u2019</p><p>I neither deny nor confirm it, instead opting to change the subject completely. I\u2019m supposed to be busying my wandering mind, not feeding it. \u2018Did you go out last night?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and I still feel like crap,\u2019 she admits, pouring the champagne. \u2018My body has craved junk food all day, and I necked something close to two litres of fat Coke.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That bad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Horrendous. I\u2019m not drinking again . . . until next week.\u2019</p><p>I laugh. \u2018What makes you bad . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t! The smell of this is turning my stomach.\u2019 She gags and holds her nose as she continues to fill the flutes. It\u2019s only now that I take a good look at her, noticing her usually shiny black bob looks a little dull, as do her usually rosy cheeks. \u2018I know. I look like shit.\u2019</p><p>I return to the tray. \u2018You really do,\u2019 I admit.</p><p>\u2018And I feel worse than I look.\u2019</p><p>Del appears, looking his usual happy self. \u2018Girls, we have members of parliament in tonight and a few diplomats. I know I don\u2019t have to tell you, but remember your manners.\u2019 He looks at Sylvie when he speaks, frowning. \u2018You really do look like crap.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, yes, I know. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t breathe on them,\u2019 she quips, breathing onto her palm and smelling. I grimace, watching her face screw up in disgust before she rootles through her pocket and shoves a Polo mint in her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t speak unless necessary.\u2019 Del shakes his head, leaving me and Sylvie to finish up with the champagne and transfer the canap\u00e9s from the Tupperware to the trays.</p><p>\u2018All set?\u2019 Sylvie asks, swinging her tray onto her shoulder.</p><p>\u2018Lead the way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great. Let\u2019s feed and water some elitists,\u2019 she grumbles, smiling sweetly at Del when he throws her a cautionary look. \u2018Would you prefer snobs?\u2019</p> <p>He points his finger at her, fighting a fond smile. \u2018No, I\u2019d prefer to have enough staff so I didn\u2019t have to resort to drafting you in. Get your arse in gear.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, sir!\u2019 She salutes him seriously and marches on, me following behind, laughing.</p><p>I don\u2019t get very far, though. And my laughing is sucked up in a second.</p><p>His face is impassive as he watches me, while I\u2019m frozen on the spot, body shaking, pulse racing. But he seems completely composed, the only clue of his thoughts being how closely he\u2019s studying me.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I whisper to myself, trying to gain control of my shaking tray as I reverse my steps, backing up into the kitchen. He\u2019s with that woman, and she\u2019s adorned in cream silk and dripping with diamonds, her hand glued to his arse, her smiling face beaming at him dreamily. Business? I feel sick \u2013 sick with jealousy, sick with pain and sick with delight at how beautiful he looks in a taupe three-piece suit. His flawlessness defies reality on every level.</p> <p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Del\u2019s concerned voice seeps into my ears and his hands rest gently on my shoulders from behind. \u2018You okay, sweetheart?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pardon?\u2019 I rip my eyes away from the painful sight across the room, and turn blankly towards my boss, registering a face to match the concern in his voice.</p><p>\u2018Christ, Livy, you\u2019re as white as a ghost.\u2019 He takes the tray from me and feels my forehead. \u2018And you\u2019re cold.\u2019</p><p>I need to leave. I can\u2019t work all night in the close proximity of Miller, especially with her draped all over him, and definitely not after last night. I\u2019m shifting on the spot, my eyes darting all over the place, my heart showing no sign of letting up. \u2018I think I might have to leave,\u2019 I whisper pitifully.</p><p>\u2018Yes, go home.\u2019 Del ushers me through the kitchen and shoves my satchel in my arms. \u2018Get in bed and sweat it out.\u2019</p><p>I nod lamely, just as Sylvie comes steaming into the kitchen with a tray full of empties, her wide eyes looking frantic and worried, even more so when she clocks my pathetic, sweating form. Her mouth opens to speak but I shake my head, not wanting her to give me away. What will Del think if he finds out that I\u2019m in this pickle because of a man?</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019ll have to work that little bit harder, Sylvie. I\u2019m sending Livy home. She\u2019s feeling ill.\u2019 Del turns me and pushes my shaking body towards the exit.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder, giving Sylvie an apologetic smile, grateful when she brushes off my guilt with a dismissive wave of her hand. \u2018Hope you feel better,\u2019 she calls.</p><p>I\u2019m sent to the mews at the back of the hotel, where deliveries are taken and the staff pop out to smoke. It\u2019s dusk and the air is heavy, just like my heart. Finding a step away from the chaos of the loading bays, I lower my backside and slump my head onto my knees, attempting to calm myself down before I drag my feet home. Forgetting my encounters with Miller Hart and the feelings I had during those encounters might be easier if I never have to see him again, but it\u2019s going to be impossible if he\u2019s around every corner that I turn.</p><p>Returning to solitary confinement seems like my best option, but I\u2019ve been teased, fed something new and appealing, and I want more. The important question, though \u2013 the question I should ask and consider seriously \u2013 is whether I\u2019m hungry for more with just Miller, or if I can find these tingling, stimulating, alive feelings with someone else, a man who wants me for longer than one night, a man who can maintain these feelings, not spike them, then quickly and cruelly replace them with inadequacy and misery.</p><p>I won\u2019t hold my breath.</p><p>I force my reluctant body to stand, looking up and coming face to face with Miller Hart. He\u2019s standing just a few feet away, legs spread and hands in his pockets. His expression is still blank, telling me nothing, but this takes nothing away from his impossible beauty. There are many things I want to say, but saying them will only prompt conversation, which will almost certainly cast me further under his spell. The only sensible move I should make right now is escaping his presence. And set on doing just that, I start walking away from him.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 he shouts, his footsteps trailing me. \u2018Livy, it\u2019s simply business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to explain yourself to me,\u2019 I declare softly. That was no body language of a business associate. \u2018Please don\u2019t follow me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m talking to you, Livy,\u2019 he warns.</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m choosing not to listen.\u2019 My nerves are keeping my tone timid and weak when I really want to inject some spunk into it, but the strength required to do so is being used to walk away.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you owe me sixteen hours.\u2019</p><p>His cheek makes me falter mid-stride, but doesn\u2019t stop me completely. \u2018I owe you nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 His body lands in front of me, blocking my path, so I quickly sidestep him, not allowing my eyes to divert from their focus point: the main road ahead. \u2018Livy.\u2019 He\u2019s grabbing at me now but I shake him off, silent but firm. \u2018Where are your f**king manners?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care for them with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well you should.\u2019 He takes hold of me, more forcefully this time, and secures me in place. \u2018You agreed to twenty-four hours.\u2019</p><p>I refuse to look at him, and I\u2019m also refusing to speak. There\u2019s plenty I want to say, but showing my emotions \u2013 physically and audibly \u2013 would be a grave mistake, so I remain still and silent while he stares down at my non-responsive form. I\u2019m frustrating him. His overpowering hold on the tops of my arms is confirming it, and so is the rise and fall of his suit-covered chest. I\u2019ve crawled into a shell, and I don\u2019t plan on coming out. I\u2019m safer here \u2013 safe from him.</p><p>He drops his face into my line of sight, so I drop my gaze further to the ground to avoid him. Looking into his crystal-clear blues will derail me in a split second. \u2018Livy, when I\u2019m talking to you, I\u2019d like you to look at me.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t. I ignore his request and concentrate on remaining unreceptive, hoping he\u2019ll get bored, decide I\u2019m not worth the effort, and leave me alone. I need him to leave me alone. There\u2019s a beautiful woman inside, clearly willing, so why is he wasting time out here on me?</p><p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>My eyes close, picturing those lips speaking my name quietly . . . slowly.</p><p>\u2018Please look at me,\u2019 he orders gently.</p><p>My head starts shaking in my own private darkness as I battle to keep my protective shield in place \u2013 the Miller shield.</p><p>\u2018Let me see you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He stoops further, pushing his face into my neck. \u2018Let me have my time with you.\u2019</p><p>I want to stop him. I don\u2019t want to stop him. I want to feel alive again but I don\u2019t want to feel lifeless again. I want him more than I know I should.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t had nearly enough. I need more.\u2019 His lips find my cheek and his palm feels out the back of my head, his fingers combing through my hair and holding me in place. \u2018I want to drown in you, Livy.\u2019 His lips reach mine and the feel of them catapults me instantly to the night before. The shield shatters and a suppressed sob slips past my lips, my eyes squeezing shut to prevent the tears from trickling down my cheeks. \u2018Open your mouth,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>My jaw relaxes at his gentle demand, giving him free rein on my senses, and his tongue slips slowly and softly past my lips, sweeping a sweet circle of my mouth, his body moving in closer to mine. There\u2019s not a part of my front that\u2019s not touching him. I go slack, my head tilting to give him better access, and my hands lift of their own accord, feeling up his sides until they\u2019re on his shoulders. He\u2019s set a painfully slow, tender pace, and I\u2019m following, massaging his tongue with mine and failing to do what I know I should.</p><p>\u2018See how easy it is?\u2019 he asks, slowly pulling away and pecking my lips.</p><p>I nod, agreeing, because it really is, but now his lips are off mine, sensibility seems to kick in. \u2018Who\u2019s that woman?\u2019 I ask, stepping back. \u2018Was this the prior engagement that you were talking about? A date?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s business, Livy. Just business.\u2019</p><p>I step back again. \u2018And business involves having her hand glued to your backside?\u2019 I have no right to sound so accusing. He\u2019s played his cards.</p><p>His head cocks, a tiny hint of a frown surfacing. \u2018Sometimes I have to accept a bit of familiarity in the name of business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What business?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve spoken of this before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get personal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve had sex. You don\u2019t get more personal than that,\u2019 I argue.</p><p>\u2018I mean emotionally, not physically, Livy.\u2019</p><p>His words confirm my thoughts. Damn women and their deepness, and damn men for their hollowness. Just sex; I must remember that. These feelings are spiked by lust and nothing more. \u2018I\u2019m not this kind of person, Miller. I don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m trying to convince here.</p><p>He steps forward and runs his hand behind my neck, taking his signature hold. \u2018Maybe that\u2019s what I find so fascinating.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or perhaps you\u2019re just finding it an entertaining challenge.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If that\u2019s the case,\u2019 he drops a soft kiss on my cheek, \u2018then I think we can safely say that I\u2019ve conquered you.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s absolutely right. He\u2019s conquered me, and he\u2019s the only man who has. \u2018I need to go.\u2019 I start backing away, just as his phone starts ringing from his pocket. He reaches in and glances at the screen, then to me. I can see that he\u2019s torn as he watches me leave. \u2018You should take that call.\u2019 I nod at his phone, hoping he\u2019ll decline and fulfil his promise to put me back in his bed. If I escape now, then that\u2019s it. I\u2019m turning my back for good, and I\u2019ll find the strength to resist him. But if he stops me, comes with me, then I\u2019m going to be spending the next sixteen hours being worshipped again. I want to do both, but his decision is going to decide for me. Someone else\u2019s choice is going to determine my destiny. And I can tell by the look on his face that he knows this, too.</p><p>My heart constricts when he answers the call, even though I know that it\u2019s undeniably the best outcome for my destiny. \u2018I\u2019m on my way,\u2019 he says quietly before cutting the call and watching me spreading the distance between us. I smile a little before turning my back on Miller Hart and mentally forming a plan to eradicate him from my mind altogether.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Monday morning greets me, and I feel no better. I wallowed in self-pity all day yesterday, choosing to stay in bed, with Nan poking her head around my door to check on me every now and then. I\u2019ve never feigned illness but I\u2019m making up for that now. My grandmother is super suspicious but keeping her thoughts to herself for once. It\u2019s a novelty, and a welcome one. My phone has rung twice, my only two friends in the world calling to check up on me, but I cut off any lengthy conversation. I could tell they\u2019re suspicious, too \u2013 Sylvie most, having witnessed my meltdown. I\u2019m not much of an actress. In fact, I\u2019m rubbish at it, even cringing myself when I heard my unconvincing voice telling them that I felt rotten with a queasy stomach and cold shivers. Deciding that I need one more day to pull myself together, I call Del to tell him I feel no better.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Nan\u2019s wary voice drifts through my door. \u2018I\u2019ve made breakfast. You\u2019ll be late for work.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not going,\u2019 I call, trying to croak and failing.</p><p>The door opens and she gingerly creeps in, giving my quilt-covered body the once-over. \u2018Are you still feeling ill?\u2019 she asks.</p><p>\u2018Terrible,\u2019 I mutter.</p><p>She hums thoughtfully, picking up my discarded jeans and folding them neatly. \u2018I\u2019m going shopping. Would you like to come?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Livy, come on,\u2019 she sighs. \u2018You can help me pick a pineapple for George\u2019s upside-down cake.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You need help picking a pineapple?\u2019</p><p>She huffs her frustration and pulls the quilt back, exposing my semi-naked body to her inquisitive eyes and the cool morning air of my bedroom. \u2018Olivia Taylor, you are getting out of that bed and you\u2019re coming to help me pick a pineapple for George\u2019s upside-down cake. Get up!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m ill.\u2019 I try to retrieve my covers and fail. She looks determined, which means this is a sure losing situation for me.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not stupid.\u2019 She waves a wrinkled finger at me. \u2018You need to snap out of this, right now! There\u2019s nothing less attractive than a woman wallowing in self-pity, especially over a man. Screw him! Pick yourself up, dust yourself down, and bloody get on with it, my girl!\u2019 She grabs my stunned body and physically hoofs me up from the bed. \u2018Get that skinny arse showered. You\u2019re coming shopping.\u2019 She stomps out, slamming the door behind her, leaving me speechless and wide-eyed.</p><p>\u2018That was a little harsh,\u2019 I say to absolutely no one, hearing her stomping feet taking the stairs. She\u2019s never spoken to me like that in her life. But I\u2019ve never given her reason to. It\u2019s always me faffing around her, although I\u2019m certainly not as brutal in my pep talks as she was just then. This is hilariously ironic. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s constantly nagged me about living a little. I did, and look where it\u2019s got me. Still stunned and not daring to retreat to the safety of my bed, I walk cautiously across the landing to take a shower.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re going to Harrods to buy a pineapple?\u2019 I ask, holding Nan\u2019s elbow as we cross the road towards the grand, green-canopied building.</p><p>Nan raises her hand to a truck driving at us, halting it dead in its tracks, despite it having the right of way. I wave a thank you, while Nan continues across the road, tugging her shopping trolley behind her. \u2018I might buy some double cream, too.\u2019</p><p>I catch up with her and pull the door open. \u2018Going to town, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 My eyebrows waggle suggestively, which she completely ignores, instead marching on in the direction of the food hall.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a pineapple.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That we could\u2019ve bought from the local Tesco Express,\u2019 I retort, goading her.</p><p>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t be the same. Besides, the ones from here are perfectly formed and the skins are shiny.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m trying to keep up with her, and everyone\u2019s moving out of the way of the elderly, determined woman marching through the store pulling a shopping trolley behind her. \u2018You\u2019ll be cutting the skin off!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter. Here we are!\u2019 She halts at the entrance of the food hall, and I watch as her shoulders rise and drop slowly on a satisfied sigh. \u2018The meat counter!\u2019 She\u2019s off again. \u2018Get a basket, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I sag, exasperated, and reach for a shopping basket, then go and join her in front of the glass meat counter. \u2018I thought you wanted a pineapple.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do. I\u2019m just browsing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Browsing meat?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, my girl. This isn\u2019t just meat.\u2019</p> <p>I follow her admiring stare to the perfectly displayed lumps of pork, beef and lamb. \u2018What is it then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well,\u2019 her wrinkled brow furrows, \u2018it\u2019s posh meat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What, like well-spoken meat?\u2019 I\u2019m trying hard not to grin as I point to a steak. \u2018Or did that cow shit in a toilet instead of a field?\u2019</p><p>Nan gasps and swings infuriated eyes to me. \u2018You can\u2019t use that language in Harrods!\u2019 Her eyes shoot around, checking if any attention is on us. It is. The old woman next to Nan is looking at me in disgust. \u2018What\u2019s got into you?\u2019 Nan straightens her floppy hat and hits me with warning eyes.</p><p>I\u2019m still fighting a grin. \u2018Where are the pineapples?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Over there.\u2019 She points, and I follow her finger to another glass cabinet, formed in a square and showcasing the best-looking fruit I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re only your standard fruits \u2013 apples, pears and suchlike, but they are the most beautiful apples and pears I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 so beautiful, my face is pushed up to the glass counter to check if they\u2019re real. The colours are vivid and the skins polished. They literally look way too good to eat.</p><p>\u2018Oh, look at that pineapple!\u2019 Nan sings, and I do. Her enthusiasm is warranted. It\u2019s a stunning pineapple. \u2018Oh, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan, it\u2019s too pretty to hack up and shove in a cake.\u2019 I join her by the supermodel of pineapples. \u2018And it\u2019s fifteen quid!\u2019 My palm slaps against my mouth, and Nan\u2019s hand slaps my shoulder.</p><p>\u2018Will you shut up?\u2019 she hisses. \u2018I should\u2019ve left you at home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry, but fifteen pounds, Nan? Surely you\u2019re not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I am.\u2019 She straightens her shoulders and waves to get the attention of the server, her hand movements rivalling the Queen\u2019s. \u2018I would like a pineapple,\u2019 she tells him, all posh and proper.</p><p>\u2018Yes, madam.\u2019</p><p>I stare at her in disbelief. \u2018Does being in Harrods Food Hall put a plum in your mouth?\u2019</p><p>She flicks me a sideways glance. \u2018Whatever are you talking about?\u2019</p><p>I start laughing. \u2018That. The voice. Come on, Nan!\u2019</p><p>She leans in discreetly. \u2018I do not have a plum in my mouth!\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018Yes you do. A huge, great big plum, and it\u2019s making you sound like the Queen with respiratory problems.\u2019</p><p>Nan\u2019s beautiful pineapple is handed delicately over the counter and she takes it, gently placing it in the basket I\u2019m holding.</p><p>\u2018Ooh, be gentle,\u2019 I whisper, laughing to myself.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not too old to lie over my knee,\u2019 Nan threatens, increasing my laughter.</p><p>\u2018Would you like to do it here?\u2019 I make my face serious. \u2018You could polish my arse while you\u2019re at it so I match your pretty pineapple.\u2019 I snort on a suppressed laugh.</p><p>\u2018Shut up!\u2019 she snaps. \u2018And be careful with my pineapple!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m at the point of doubling over as I watch Nan straighten her scowling face before turning back to the gentleman who served her. \u2018Could you remind me where I might find the double cream?\u2019</p><p>I start falling all over Harrods Food Hall in hysterics as I watch Nan\u2019s hand movements and listen to her fake posh voice. Remind her? She\u2019s never bought double cream from Harrods in her bloody life!</p><p>\u2018Certainly, madam.\u2019 He directs us to the back of the hall where the fridges are stocked with posh dairy. Nan\u2019s back straightens and she\u2019s smiling and nodding politely at everyone we pass, while I titter, shake and hold my aching stomach from laughing too hard.</p><p>I\u2019m still chuckling as I watch her read the back of every pot of cream on the shelf, humming to herself. She shouldn\u2019t bother with the ingredients and should maybe pay more attention to the price. Deciding that I need to calm myself down before my nan swings at me, I start taking deep breaths as I wait for her to choose, but my shoulders won\u2019t let up, and I can\u2019t help my eyes from looking down at the perfect, shiny pineapple, reminding me of why I\u2019m in stitches.</p><p>I jump when I feel hot breath in my ear and turn, still laughing until I see whose breath it is. \u2018You look incredibly beautiful when you laugh,\u2019 he says quietly.</p><p>I stop immediately and back up, but I should\u2019ve stayed put because I\u2019ve just bumped into Nan, causing her to huff some more and swing around. \u2018What?\u2019 she spits before she clocks my company. \u2018Oh my . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 Miller closes the distance, getting way too close, and puts his hand out. \u2018You must be Livy\u2019s famous nan.\u2019</p><p>I die on the spot. She\u2019s going to lap this up good and proper. \u2018Yes.\u2019 She still sounds like she has a plum in her mouth. \u2018And you\u2019re Livy\u2019s boss?\u2019 she asks, placing her hand neatly in Miller\u2019s, flicking me a questioning look.</p><p>\u2018I think you know that I\u2019m not Olivia\u2019s boss, Mrs . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Taylor!\u2019 she practically screeches, delighted that he\u2019s confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m Miller Hart. It\u2019s a pleasure, Mrs Taylor.\u2019 He kisses the back of her hand \u2013 he actually kisses the back of her bloody hand!</p><p>Nan giggles like a schoolgirl and now that my heart is over the shock, it starts a steady thump in my chest. He\u2019s adorned in a three-piece grey suit, white shirt, and silver tie . . . in Harrods. \u2018Shopping?\u2019 I manage to breathe.</p><p>He regards me intently as he releases Nan\u2019s wrinkled hand and holds up two suit bags. \u2018I was just collecting some new suits and an enchanting laugh caught my attention.\u2019</p><p>I ignore his compliment. \u2018Because you don\u2019t have enough suits?\u2019 I ask, remembering the rows and rows of matching jackets, trousers and waistcoats lining the three walls of his wardrobe. I\u2019ve never seen him in the same one twice.</p><p>\u2018You can never have enough suits, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I agree!\u2019 Nan trills. \u2018It\u2019s so refreshing to see a young man so well turned out. These youngsters who have jeans sagging around their arses, their underwear out for the world to see. I just don\u2019t understand it.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s slight amusement is clear. \u2018I concur.\u2019 He nods thoughtfully, flicking his eyes to mine while I consider how silly it sounds, referring to him as a young man. He is, but his persona hints to a much wiser, more lived-in man. He acts older than his years, even if he looks perfectly gorgeous at twenty-nine. \u2018That\u2019s a delicious-looking pineapple.\u2019 He nods at the basket in my hand.</p><p>\u2018My thoughts exactly!\u2019 Nan sings delightedly, agreeing with him again. \u2018Worth every penny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is,\u2019 Miller replies. \u2018The food here is sublime. You must try the caviar.\u2019 He reaches out to a nearby shelf and takes a jar, showing it to Nan. \u2018It\u2019s exceptional.\u2019</p><p>I can do nothing more than watch in shock as Nan has a good look at the jar, nodding her unknown agreement as they chat away in Harrods Food Hall. I want to curl up in a ball and hide.</p><p>\u2018So how are you and my lovely granddaughter acquainted?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Lovely being the operative word, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019 Miller asks, placing the jar back and tweaking it so the label is positioned just so. He doesn\u2019t stop there. He runs his hand across each jar flanking the one he\u2019s just placed, straightening them all up.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a doll.\u2019 Nan elbows me discreetly while Miller finishes up with the shelf display.</p><p>\u2018That she is.\u2019 He gazes at me, and I feel my face heat under his intense stare. \u2018She makes the best coffee in London.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do I?\u2019 I blurt. The lying bastard. He\u2019s on the charm offensive.</p><p>\u2018Yes; I was most disappointed when I dropped in today to find you\u2019re off sick.\u2019</p><p>My redness increases. \u2018I\u2019m feeling better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad. Your colleague isn\u2019t as friendly as you.\u2019 His words carry a double meaning. He\u2019s playing games and it\u2019s irritating the hell out of me. Friendly or easy? If Nan wasn\u2019t here, I\u2019d be asking that very question, but she is here and I need to remove her and myself from this painfully difficult situation.</p><p>I take her elbow. \u2018We should get going, Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Should we?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I try to tug her onward, but she makes herself a dead weight. \u2018It was nice to see you.\u2019 I smile tightly at Miller, tugging harder. \u2018Come on, Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you like to join me for dinner tonight?\u2019 Miller asks with a sense of urgency to his tone that probably only I can detect.</p><p>I stop trying to remove my static nan and flash him a questioning look. He\u2019s trying to get his remaining time allowance, and he\u2019s using my grandmother to his advantage, the conniving twat. \u2018No, thank you.\u2019 I can feel Nan\u2019s shocked stare drilling into me.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you must take the gentleman up on his invitation to dinner,\u2019 Nan claims incredulously. \u2018It\u2019s very kind of him to offer.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t often,\u2019 Miller interjects quietly, like I should be grateful. It only increases my irritation as I fight to recall why I vowed not to see him again. It\u2019s hard when my wayward mind is presenting me with a stream of images of our na**d bodies entwined and a replay of the comforting words exchanged.</p><p>\u2018See!\u2019 Nan screeches in my ear, making me wince. The plum has gone and desperation has set in. She plasters a stupid smile on her face as she returns to Miller. \u2018She\u2019d love to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t, but thank you.\u2019 I try to pull my annoying grandmother away from my heart\u2019s annoying nemesis, but the stubborn old bat refuses to budge. \u2018Come on,\u2019 I plead.</p><p>\u2018I would be delighted if you would reconsider.\u2019 Miller\u2019s soft rasp halts my battle with Nan\u2019s motionless form, and I hear her sigh dreamily, gazing at the annoyingly handsome man who\u2019s cornered me. But then her dreamy gaze turns into slight confusion and I follow her stare to see what\u2019s caused her sudden change in expression. There\u2019s a well-manicured hand resting on Miller\u2019s shoulder with a dusky-pink silk tie suspended from it, cascading down Miller\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u2018This one will go perfectly.\u2019 The silky-smooth voice is familiar. I don\u2019t need to see the stunning face to confirm who that hand belongs to, so I lift my gaze from the silk tie to Miller\u2019s eyes instead. His jaw is tight, his tall body still. \u2018What do you think?\u2019 she asks.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 Miller replies quietly, keeping his eyes on me.</p><p>Nan is silent, I\u2019m silent, and Miller is saying very little, but then the woman steps out from behind him, stroking the tie and the silence is broken. \u2018What do you think?\u2019 she asks Nan, who nods, not giving the tie a glance, instead keeping her eyes on this beautiful woman who has appeared from nowhere. \u2018And you?\u2019 She directs her question at me, toying with the diamond-encrusted cross that\u2019s always suspended from her delicate neck. I can see a threatening look through the layers of expensive make-up. She\u2019s marking her territory. She\u2019s no business associate.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s lovely,\u2019 I whisper, dropping the basket and deciding to abandon my nan in favour of retreat. I\u2019m not being held to ransom in front of my old grandmother and I\u2019m not being subjected to looks of inferiority by that perfect woman. Every corner I turn, he\u2019s there. This is hopeless.</p><p>I weave my numb body through the various departments until I break free of the confinements of the colossal store and drag in some fresh air, resting my back against the wall outside. I\u2019m angry, sad and irritated. I\u2019m a jumbled bag of mixed emotions and confusing thoughts. My heart and my head have never disagreed or battled so furiously.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Hyde Park sorts me out. I sit on the grass with a sandwich and a can of Coke and watch the world go by for a few hours. I think about how lucky the people wandering past me are to have such a beautiful place to roam. Then I count at least twenty different breeds of dog in less than twenty minutes and think how lucky they are to have such a wonderful stomping ground. Children are squealing, mothers are chatting and laughing, and runners are prancing by. I feel better, like something familiar and desired has successfully eliminated something unfamiliar and undesired.</p> <p>Undesired, undesired . . . completely desired.</p><p>I sigh and unfold my seated body from the ground, swinging my satchel onto my shoulder and throwing my rubbish in the litter bin.</p><p>Then I take the familiar journey home.</p><p>Nan\u2019s frantic by the time I fall through the front door. Really frantic. I feel guilty, even if I should actually be feeling rather mad with her. \u2018Oh my goodness!\u2019 She dives on me, not giving me the chance to dump my bag by the coat stand in the hall. \u2018Livy, I\u2019ve been so worried. It\u2019s seven o\u2019clock!\u2019</p><p>I embrace her hold, the guilt taking a firmer grip. \u2018I\u2019m twenty-four years old,\u2019 I sigh.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t disappear on me, Olivia. My heart can\u2019t take it.\u2019</p><p>Now guilt is crippling me. \u2018I had a picnic in the park.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you just left!\u2019 She separates us and holds me at a distance. \u2018It was incredibly rude, Livy.\u2019 I can see from her sudden annoyance that her earlier panic has completely diminished.</p> <p>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to have dinner with him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not? He seemed like such a gentleman.\u2019</p><p>I resist snorting my disgust. She wouldn\u2019t think that if she knew the ins and outs. \u2018He was with another woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a business associate!\u2019 she gushes, almost excited to clear up the misunderstanding. \u2018Nice woman.\u2019</p><p>I cannot believe she bought that. She\u2019s too cute. Business associates don\u2019t shop for silk ties together. \u2018Can we leave it there?\u2019 I drop my bag and skulk past her, making my way to the kitchen, getting a waft of something delicious as I enter. \u2018What are you cooking?\u2019 I ask, finding George at the table. \u2018Hi, George.\u2019 I sit next to him.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t turn your mobile telephone off, Livy,\u2019 he scolds quietly. \u2018I\u2019ve endured hours of Josephine repeatedly dialling and cursing in between cooking supper.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019 I ask again.</p><p>\u2018Beef Wellington,\u2019 Nan chirps up as she follows behind me. \u2018With dauphinoise potatoes and steamed baby carrots.\u2019</p><p>I throw a confused look at George, but he just shrugs and picks up his paper. \u2018Beef Wellington?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t give my questioning tone the attention it deserves. What happened to stew and dumplings or a chicken roast? \u2018Thought I\u2019d try something new. I hope you\u2019re hungry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A little,\u2019 I admit. \u2018Is that wine?\u2019 I ask, clocking two bottles of red and two bottles of white on the worktop.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 She flies across the kitchen and grabs the white bottles, shoving them quickly in the fridge before opening the red. \u2018These need to breathe.\u2019</p><p>Shifting in my chair, I chance a glance at George, hoping to get something from him, but he\u2019s undoubtedly doing what he\u2019s been told by sitting still and shutting up. He knows that I\u2019m looking at him. I can tell because his eyes are running too quickly across the text of the paper for him to truly be reading it. I knock his knee with mine, but I\u2019m flat-out ignored, Nan\u2019s male companion choosing to shift his legs to avoid another purposeful nudge.</p><p>\u2018Nan\u2014\u2019 The doorbell interrupts me, my head swinging towards the hallway.</p><p>\u2018Oh, that\u2019ll be Gregory.\u2019 She opens the oven and sticks a long metal stick in the middle of a huge chunk of pastry. \u2018Will you answer it, please, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You invited Gregory?\u2019 I ask, pushing my chair away from the table.</p><p>\u2018Yes! Look at all of this food.\u2019 She removes the rod from the meat and purses her lips as she checks the temperature on the dial. \u2018Nearly done,\u2019 she declares.</p><p>I leave Nan and George and jog down the hallway to let Gregory in, hoping Nan hasn\u2019t been gossiping with him again. \u2018Am I missing a special occasion?\u2019 I ask as I throw the front door open.</p><p>My smile falls away immediately.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing here?\u2019 That damn irritation flares dangerously.</p><p>\u2018Your grandmother invited me.\u2019 Miller\u2019s arms are filled with flowers and a Harrods bag. \u2018Are you going to invite me in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m not.\u2019 I step outside and pull the door shut so Nan can\u2019t hear our conversation. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s completely unruffled by my ruffled state. \u2018Being polite and accepting a dinner invitation.\u2019 There\u2019s no humour in his tone. \u2018I have manners.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I step closer, my shock and exasperation crossing the line into anger. My damn conniving grandmother. \u2018You have a nerve, that\u2019s what you have. This has to stop. I don\u2019t want you for twenty-four hours.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You want longer?\u2019</p><p>I recoil. \u2018No!\u2019 How much longer?</p><p>\u2018Oh . . .\u2019 He looks unsure of himself and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen this in him. It straightens my back and makes my eyes narrow questioningly.</p><p>\u2018Do you?\u2019 I whisper the question on a skip of my heartbeat, my mind going into overdrive.</p><p>His uncertainty flashes to frustration in a nanosecond, making me wonder if it\u2019s directed at me or whether he\u2019s frustrated with himself. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s the latter. \u2018We agreed no personal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you declared that part of the deal.\u2019</p><p>His eyes fly up, shocked. \u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And does it still stand?\u2019 I ask, trying so hard to appear confident and strong, when I\u2019m crumbling on the inside, bracing myself for his answer.</p><p>\u2018It still stands.\u2019 His voice is resolute, but his expression isn\u2019t. That\u2019s not enough for me to build my hopes on, though.</p><p>\u2018Then we\u2019re done here.\u2019 I turn on my Converse and push my defeated body through the door, meeting Nan as I do. \u2018It\u2019s a salesman,\u2019 I say, not letting her pass me. My plan is never going to work, I know that. She invited him, and she knew the second the doorbell chimed who it was.</p><p>I put up little resistance when I\u2019m barged from her path, letting her open the front door, where Miller is striding slowly away from the house. \u2018Miller!\u2019 she calls. \u2018Wherever are you going?\u2019</p><p>He turns and looks at me, and as much as I\u2019m willing a threatening look to materialise on my face, it\u2019s just not happening. We just stare at each other for the longest time before he gives Nan a small nod. \u2018It was really very kind of you, Mrs Taylor, but\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no!\u2019 Nan doesn\u2019t give him the opportunity to make his excuses. She marches down the path, not in the least bit intimidated by his tall, powerful frame, and takes his elbow, leading him into the house. \u2018I\u2019ve prepared a blinding supper, and you\u2019ll stay to eat it.\u2019 Miller is pushed into the narrow hallway where, with three people, it\u2019s all very cosy. \u2018Livy will take your jacket.\u2019 Nan leaves us and marches back to the kitchen, barking a short instruction at George as she enters.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll leave if you want me to. I don\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable.\u2019 He makes no move to drop the things from his hands and remove his jacket. \u2018Your grandmother is quite a woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She is,\u2019 I answer quietly. \u2018And you always make me feel uncomfortable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come home with me and I\u2019ll put some shorts on.\u2019</p><p>My eyes widen at the thought of Miller bare-chested and barefoot. \u2018That didn\u2019t make me comfortable,\u2019 I point out. He knows that.</p><p>\u2018What I did to you following the removal of my clothes did, though.\u2019 That lock of hair slips down on cue, as if backing up his words, making them more suggestive.</p><p>I shift on the spot. \u2018That won\u2019t happen again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean, Livy,\u2019 he counters softly.</p><p>My eyes fly to his, and he moves in, the flowers that he\u2019s holding touching the front of my tea dress. \u2018You\u2019re using my own grandmother against me,\u2019 I breathe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You leave me no choice.\u2019 He dips and rests his lips over mine, sending a delicious warmth to my core to match the heat of his mouth on mine.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not playing fair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never claimed to play by the rules, Livy. And anyway, all of my rules were obliterated the second I laid my hands on you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What rules?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve forgotten.\u2019 He takes my mouth gently, pushing the flowers further into my chest, the cellophane encasing them crinkling loudly, but I\u2019m too consumed to care whether the noise attracts the attention of my nosy nan. My senses are saturated, my blood is heated, and I\u2019m reminded of the incredible feelings that Miller Hart draws from me. \u2018Feel me,\u2019 he moans against my mouth.</p><p>Without thought, my hand slowly moves down between our bodies, bypassing the flowers and Harrods bag, until I\u2019m brushing my knuckles over the long, hard length of him. His deep groan emboldens me, my hand turning to feel, stroke and squeeze over the top of his trousers.</p><p>\u2018You do that,\u2019 he growls. \u2018And for as long as you do this to me, you\u2019re obliged to remedy it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t happen if you didn\u2019t see me,\u2019 I gasp, biting at his lip, not bothered by his arrogant declaration.</p><p>\u2018Livy, I only have to think of you and I\u2019m solid. Seeing you makes me ache. You\u2019re coming home with me tonight, and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u2019 His lips press harder to mine.</p> <p>\u2018That woman was with you again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How many times do we have to go over this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you often go clothes shopping with female business associates?\u2019 I ask around his unrelenting lips.</p><p>He pulls away, panting, his hair in disarray. Those blue eyes will be the death of me. \u2018Why can\u2019t you trust me on this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re too secretive,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018I don\u2019t want you to have this hold over me.\u2019</p><p>He leans in and kisses my forehead tenderly, lovingly. His words don\u2019t match his actions. It\u2019s so confusing to me. \u2018It\u2019s not a hold if you accept it, sweet girl.\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019d be inconceivably stupid to trust this man. It\u2019s not so much the woman; my conscience seems quite happy to overlook her. It\u2019s my destiny. My heart. I\u2019m falling too hard and too fast.</p><p>He steps away, glancing down at his groin area before adjusting himself. \u2018I have to face a sweet old lady with this, and it\u2019s entirely your fault.\u2019 He lifts almost mischievous eyes to mine, throwing me off course again. It\u2019s another expression from Miller Hart that\u2019s alien to me. \u2018Ready?\u2019 he asks, sliding his palm around my neck and turning me towards the kitchen.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t think I am ready, but I say yes anyway, knowing what I\u2019m going to find in the kitchen. And I\u2019m right on the money. Nan is smiling smugly and George\u2019s eyes have just popped out of his head at the sight of Miller guiding me. I gesture to my nan\u2019s long-suffering male companion. \u2018Miller, this is George, my nan\u2019s friend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pleasure.\u2019 Miller offloads the flowers and bag, rather than letting go of me, and accepts George\u2019s hand, giving it a firm, manly shake. \u2018That\u2019s a rather dashing shirt you have on there, George.\u2019 Miller nods at George\u2019s striped chest genuinely.</p><p>\u2018You know, I think so, too,\u2019 George agrees, stroking down his front.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t notice this before. George is in his Sunday best, usually reserved for bingo or church. Nan really is a conniving old bat. I cast my eyes over to her, noticing her floating, floral, button-up dress, also usually reserved for Sunday best. Looking down at myself, I note that I am far from practically dressed in my creased tea dress and hot-pink Converse, and suddenly uncomfortable with that, I pipe up.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just going to use the bathroom.\u2019 I\u2019m not going anywhere until Miller releases me from his grasp, but he doesn\u2019t seem in much of a hurry to do so.</p><p>Instead, he picks up the bouquet, a mass of yellow roses, and hands them to Nan, followed by the Harrods bag. \u2018Just a few things to say thank you for your hospitality.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oohh!\u2019 Nan shoves her nose into the bouquet, then her face into the bag. \u2018Oh my, caviar! Oh, George, look!\u2019 She drops the roses on the table and presents George with the tiniest jar. \u2018Seventy pounds for that little thing,\u2019 she whispers, but I don\u2019t know why because we\u2019re standing mere feet away and can hear her perfectly. I\u2019m horrified. The plum is a distant memory and so is her decorum.</p><p>\u2018Seventy quid?\u2019 George chokes. \u2018For fish eggs? Well, slap me sideways!\u2019</p><p>I sag under Miller\u2019s hold, and then feel him start to massage my nape over my hair. \u2018I\u2019m going to use the bathroom,\u2019 I repeat, twisting myself out from his grip.</p><p>\u2018Miller, you shouldn\u2019t have.\u2019 Nan removes a bottle of Dom P\u00e9rignon and flashes it at George with a gaping mouth.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s my pleasure,\u2019 Miller replies.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 Nan pulls my attention back to the table. \u2018Have you offered to take Miller\u2019s jacket?\u2019</p><p>Turning tired eyes onto him, I smile, sickeningly sweetly. \u2018Can I take your jacket, sir?\u2019 I resist curtsying, and detect an amused glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u2018You may.\u2019 He shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to me, while I marvel at his shirt and waistcoat-covered chest. He knows that I\u2019m staring at him, picturing his na**d chest. He leans in, dropping his mouth to my ear. \u2018Don\u2019t look at me like that, Livy,\u2019 he warns. \u2018I can barely contain myself as it is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019 I\u2019m honest in my quiet reply as I leave the kitchen, fanning my face before neatly draping his jacket over mine on the coat stand. I smooth it down and take the stairs, falling into my bedroom and darting around like a woman possessed, stripping, spraying, re-dressing and freshening my make-up. Glancing in the mirror, I think about how far removed I am from Miller\u2019s business associate. But this is me. If it goes with my Converse, then it\u2019s a contender, and my white shirt dress, scattered with red rosebuds, matches my cherry-red Converse perfectly. There\u2019s another woman and what\u2019s worrying is my ability to ignore the obviousness of the situation. I want him. Not only has he fractured my sensibility, he\u2019s also chased away my conscience.</p><p>Giving myself a mental stinger of a slap, I ruffle my mass of blond and hurry downstairs, suddenly worried by what Nan and George might be saying to Miller.</p><p>They\u2019re not in the kitchen. I backtrack, heading for the lounge, but that\u2019s empty too. I hear chatter coming from the dining room \u2013 the dining room that\u2019s only used on very special occasions. The last time we ate in the dining room was on my twenty-first birthday, over three years ago. That\u2019s how special we\u2019re talking. I make my way to the oak-stained door and peer in, seeing the huge mahogany table that dominates the room is beautifully laid, using all of Nan\u2019s Royal Doulton crockery, cut crystal wine glasses and silver cutlery.</p><p>And she\u2019s put my heart\u2019s nemesis at the head of the table, where nobody has had the pleasure ever before. That was my granddad\u2019s place at the table, and not even George has been allowed the honour.</p><p>\u2018Here she is.\u2019 Miller stands and pulls out the empty chair to his left. \u2018Come, sit.\u2019</p><p>I walk slowly and thoughtfully over, ignoring Nan\u2019s beaming face, and take my seat. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I say as he tucks me under the table before resuming position next to me.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve changed,\u2019 he observes, turning the plate at his setting a few millimetres clockwise.</p><p>\u2018I was a little creased.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You look beautiful.\u2019 He smiles, nearly making me pass out at the sight of it, that lovely dimple making a rare appearance.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018My pleasure.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off me, and even though mine are firmly set on his, I know Nan and George are watching us.</p><p>\u2018Wine?\u2019 Nan asks, interrupting our moment and distracting Miller\u2019s eyes from mine. I\u2019m instantly resentful.</p><p>\u2018Please, allow me.\u2019 Miller rises and my gaze rises with him, my eyes seeming to lift for ever until his body has straightened. He doesn\u2019t lean across the table to reach for the wine. No, he steps out and circles, collecting the wine from the ice bucket and standing on my grandmother\u2019s right side to pour.</p><p>\u2018Thank you very much.\u2019 Nan flashes George a wide-eyed, excited stare, and then turns her navy blues onto me. She\u2019s getting way too excited, just like I knew she would, and it\u2019s playing heavily on my mind for the brief moments that I\u2019m distracted from Miller. Like right now when Nan is beaming at me, so elated by our guest\u2019s presence and impeccable manners.</p><p>Miller makes his way around the table, filling George\u2019s glass too, before he reaches me. He doesn\u2019t ask me if I\u2019d like some, he just goes right ahead and pours, despite knowing damn well that I\u2019ve politely declined all alcohol when it\u2019s been offered to me previously. I\u2019m not going to pretend that he\u2019s ignorant to it. He\u2019s too smart \u2013 way, way too smart.</p><p>\u2018Right.\u2019 George stands as Miller takes his seat. \u2018I\u2019ll do the honours.\u2019 He takes the carving knife and starts to neatly slice through Nan\u2019s masterpiece. \u2018Josephine, this looks spectacular.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It really does,\u2019 Miller agrees, taking a sip of his wine and replacing it, his fingers scissoring and resting on the base of the glass, the crystal stem towering from between his middle and index finger. I study his resting hand closely, concentrating hard, waiting for it.</p><p>And there it is. It\u2019s minuscule, but he shifts the glass a very tiny bit to the right. It\u2019s probably barely noticeable to anyone except my scrutinising stare, and I smile as I raise my eyes, finding him watching me studying him.</p><p>He cocks his head, his eyes narrowing but twinkling wildly. \u2018What?\u2019 he mouths, drawing my attention to his lips. The bastard licks them, prompting me to make a grab for my glass and take a sip \u2013 anything to distract me. It\u2019s not until I swallow that I realise what I\u2019ve done, the unaccustomed taste making me shudder as it slides down my throat. My glass hits the table a bit too harshly, and I know Miller has just glanced at me curiously.</p><p>A piece of beef Wellington lands on my plate. \u2018Help yourself to potatoes and carrots, Livy,\u2019 Nan says, holding her plate up for George to transfer some crumbly pastry to. \u2018Let\u2019s fatten you up.\u2019</p><p>I spoon some carrots and potatoes onto my plate before putting some on Miller\u2019s. \u2018I don\u2019t need fattening up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You could gain a few pounds,\u2019 Miller declares, pulling my incredulous face back to him as George finishes his plate off with the Wellington. \u2018Just an observation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you, Miller,\u2019 Nan huffs smugly, raising a glass to toast their agreement. \u2018She\u2019s always been skinny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m slender, not skinny,\u2019 I argue, lobbing Miller a warning look and getting a hint of a smile. In a very juvenile fit of revenge, I discreetly reach over and casually start twisting his wine glass by the stem, pulling it a fraction towards me. \u2018Is that nice?\u2019 I ask, nodding at his forkful of beef.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s delicious,\u2019 he confirms, placing his knife perfectly perpendicular with the edge of the table, and then resting his hand over mine, slowly removing it and repositioning his glass. He picks his knife back up and resumes with his dinner. \u2018The best Wellington I\u2019ve tasted, Mrs Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 Nan blushes, a rarity, but my heart\u2019s nemesis is making my nan\u2019s heart flutter, too. \u2018It was very easy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It didn\u2019t look it,\u2019 George grumbles. \u2018You were flapping all afternoon, Josephine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was not flapping!\u2019</p><p>I start picking at my carrots, chewing slowly as I listen to Nan and George quarrel, leaving one hand free to move Miller\u2019s wine glass again. He looks at me out of the corner of his eye, and then places his knife down again before reclaiming his glass and putting it where it needs to be. I\u2019m restraining my grin. He even eats precisely, cutting his food into perfectly sized pieces and ensuring all of the prongs of the fork are pushed into each piece at a right angle before taking the fork to his mouth. He chews slowly, too. Everything he does is with such thought, and it\u2019s spellbinding. My hand creeps across the table again. I\u2019m intrigued by this anal need to have things just so, but this time I don\u2019t make it to the glass. My hand is seized midway across the table and held between us, looking nothing more than a loving hold of my hand. His grasp is firm, though, not that anyone would notice unless they were on the receiving end of the grip. And I am. And it\u2019s a very harsh grip \u2013 a warning grip. I\u2019m being told off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018What do you do for a living, Miller?\u2019 Nan asks, delighting me. Yes, what does Miller Hart do for a living? I doubt he\u2019ll tell my sweet grandmother that he doesn\u2019t want to get into personal talk when he\u2019s sitting at the head of her dinner table.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t bore you with that, Mrs Taylor. It\u2019s mind-numbing.\u2019</p><p>I was wrong. He hasn\u2019t directly brushed her off, but he\u2019s succeeded in a roundabout way. \u2018I\u2019d like to know,\u2019 I push, feeling brave, even when his grip on my hand tightens by another notch.</p><p>He blinks slowly, then raises his eyes slowly. \u2018I like to keep business and pleasure separate, Livy. You know that.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Very sensible,\u2019 George mumbles around his food, pointing his fork at Miller. \u2018I\u2019ve lived by that saying my whole life.\u2019</p><p>My pluck is being beaten down by Miller\u2019s look and worst of all, by those words. I\u2019m pretty much a business transaction \u2013 a deal, an agreement or an arrangement. Call it what you like, it doesn\u2019t change the meaning. So, technically, Miller\u2019s words are a pile of shit.</p><p>I flex my hand in his grip and he eases up, raising his eyebrows as he does. \u2018You should eat,\u2019 he prompts. \u2018It really is delicious.\u2019</p><p>Taking my hand out of his, I follow through on his order and resume my meal, but I\u2019m not at all comfortable. Miller shouldn\u2019t have accepted my grandmother\u2019s dinner invitation. This is personal. He\u2019s invading my privacy, my security. He is the one who made his intention to keep things physical clear, yet here he is, immersing himself in my world, albeit a small world, but it\u2019s my world, nevertheless. And this is not being physical.</p><p>Just as I think that, I feel his leg brush against my knee, snapping me from my wandering mind and bringing me back to the table. I gaze up at him as I try to eat, seeing him looking at Nan, listening intently to her rambling on. I don\u2019t know what about because all I can hear are replays of Miller\u2019s words.</p> <p>\u2018For as long as you do this to me, you\u2019re obliged to remedy it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All of my rules were obliterated the second I laid my hands on you.\u2019</p><p>What rules, and how long will I do that to him? I want to affect him. I want to make his body respond to me like mine does to him. Once I\u2019m past the moral pull that\u2019s trying to yank me away from his potency, it\u2019s all very easy \u2013 too easy . . . frighteningly easy.</p><p>\u2018That was bloody scrumptious, Josephine,\u2019 George declares, the clatter of his cutlery against his plate breaking the distant hum of chatter. I\u2019ve been dragged back to the present, where Miller is still here, and Nan is now scowling at her friend for his clumsiness. \u2018Sorry,\u2019 George says timidly.</p><p>\u2018If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u2019 Miller\u2019s cutlery gets placed accurately on his empty plate, before he dabs at his mouth with his embroidered napkin. \u2018Would you mind if I use your bathroom?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 Nan sings at him. \u2018It\u2019s the door at the top of the stairs.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 He stands, folding the napkin and placing it to the side of his plate before tucking his chair under the table and leaving the room.</p><p>Nan\u2019s eyes follow Miller as he leaves. \u2018Would you look at the buns on that,\u2019 she muses, just as his back disappears.</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I splutter, mortified.</p><p>\u2018Tight, perfectly formed. Livy, you are letting that man take you to dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will you behave!\u2019 I look down at my plate, noting my barely touched beef. I can\u2019t possibly eat. I feel like I\u2019m in a trance. \u2018I\u2019ll clear the table,\u2019 I say, reaching over for Miller\u2019s plate.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll help.\u2019 George makes to stand but I place my hand on his shoulder and apply a little pressure, encouraging him to remain seated.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine, George. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t argue, instead topping up the wine glasses.</p> <p>\u2018Get the pineapple upside-down cake!\u2019 Nan calls to my back.</p><p>With a handful of stacked plates, I make my way to the kitchen, eager to escape the lingering presence of Miller, even though he\u2019s no longer in the room. I didn\u2019t refuse when he told me that I\u2019ll be going home with him tonight, and I should\u2019ve. What will I say to Nan? There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that he\u2019s the cause for my recent mood swings. My mind has never been so jumbled. I\u2019m not in control, nothing is making sense, and I\u2019m not accustomed to any of these feelings. But what is most mystifying to me is the man who\u2019s the cause of my derailment. An unfathomable, beautiful man who screams heartache on every level.</p><p>Physical.</p><p>No feelings.</p><p>No emotion.</p><p>Just one night.</p><p>Twenty-four hours, of which I still owe him sixteen. That\u2019s twice as long as what I\u2019ve already experienced \u2013 double the sensations and desires . . . double the pain when we\u2019re done.</p><p>\u2018I can hear you think.\u2019</p><p>I jump and swing around, still with the stack of plates in my hand. \u2018You startled me,\u2019 I breathe, placing the crockery on the work surface.</p><p>\u2018I apologise,\u2019 he says sincerely, strolling over to me. I don\u2019t mean to, but I back up. \u2018Are you overthinking things again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I call it being prudent.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Prudent?\u2019 he asks, standing in front of me now. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t call it that.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m looking up at his face but desperately trying to avoid those eyes. \u2018No?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He takes a gentle hold of my chin, encouraging me to look at him. \u2018I call it being foolish.\u2019</p><p>Our eyes connect and so do our lips, but he only rests them over mine. There would be nothing foolish about avoiding Miller Hart. \u2018I can\u2019t read you,\u2019 I say quietly, but my words don\u2019t make him pull away with concern.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to be read, Livy. I want to be flooded in the pleasure you give me.\u2019</p><p>I liquefy against him, despite the fact that his words have only reinforced what I already know. I want to be flooded in the pleasure that he gives me, too, but I don\u2019t want the feelings that come afterwards. I can\u2019t cope with them. \u2018You\u2019re making this really difficult.\u2019</p><p>His arm creeps around to my lower back and strokes up until he\u2019s on my neck. \u2018No. I\u2019m making it all very simple. Overthinking makes it difficult, and you\u2019re overthinking.\u2019 He kisses my cheek and nuzzles into my neck. \u2018Let me take you to bed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018By doing that, I\u2019ll be something I swore I\u2019d never be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 He spreads delicate kisses across my neck, and he\u2019s doing it because he knows I\u2019m torn. He\u2019s a smart man. He\u2019s scrambling my senses, but worst of all, my mind.</p><p>\u2018At a man\u2019s mercy.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s definitely a slight falter in the trailing of his lips. I\u2019m not imagining it. He removes himself from the sanctuary of my neck and studies me thoughtfully. So much time passes \u2013 enough for my mind to linger on many of the touches he\u2019s blessed me with, the kisses we\u2019ve shared and the passion we\u2019ve created together. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching it all in his eyes, making me wonder if he\u2019s reliving those moments, too. He eventually reaches up and runs his knuckles softly down my cheek. \u2018If there is anyone at the mercy of someone here, Livy, then it is me at yours.\u2019 His eyes divert to my lips and lazily start moving in. And I do nothing to stop him.</p><p>I don\u2019t see a man at my mercy. I see a man who wants something and seems prepared to do anything to get it.</p><p>\u2018We should get back to the table.\u2019 I try to break away from him, turning my face away from his.</p><p>\u2018Not until you say you\u2019re leaving with me.\u2019 He surprises me by lifting me from my feet and sitting me on the counter. Laying his hands on the tops of my thighs, he leans in and looks at me, waiting for my agreement. \u2018Say it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes you do.\u2019 He gets nose to nose with me. \u2018You\u2019ve never wanted anything so much in your life.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s right, but that doesn\u2019t make it wise. \u2018You\u2019re very confident.\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head on a mild curve of his mouth and reaches up to drag his thumb across my bottom lip. \u2018You may be trying to convince both of us with words, but everything else is telling me different.\u2019 He slips his finger into his mouth and sucks it, then runs a moist trail down my throat, over my breast and onto my stomach before his hand disappears up my dress and between my legs. My jaw tightens, my back straightens and my core starts pulsing, willing him to touch me there. My body is betraying me on every level, and he knows it. \u2018I think I\u2019ll find warmth.\u2019 He inches closer to the apex of my thighs, and my head falls forward, meeting his forehead. \u2018I think I\u2019ll find wetness,\u2019 he whispers, his finger slipping into the side of my knickers and spreading that wetness around. \u2018I think if I enter you now, your greedy muscles will grab on and never let go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do it.\u2019 The words leave my mouth without thought, my hands lifting and grabbing the tops of his arms. \u2018Please do it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do anything you want me to, but I\u2019ll be doing it in my bed.\u2019 He kisses me hard on the lips and removes his hand, pulling the hem of my dress down. \u2018I have manners. I\u2019m not about to disrespect your grandmother by taking you here. Can you control yourself while we eat pineapple cake?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can I control myself?\u2019 I ask on a breathy whisper, looking down to his groin. I don\u2019t need to see it to know it\u2019s there. He\u2019s solid and rubbing against my leg.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m struggling, believe me.\u2019 He readjusts himself and lifts me down from the counter, then sets about arranging my hair neatly over my shoulders. \u2018Let\u2019s see how fast I can eat pineapple cake. Do you want to get an overnight bag?\u2019</p><p>No, actually, I don\u2019t. I want him to lose his manners. I attempt in vain to compose my pent-up state, but all of the heat from down below is rising to my face at the thought of facing Nan and George. \u2018I\u2019ll grab some things after dessert.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He takes my nape and directs me from the kitchen, the warmth of his hold intensifying my want. I want him so badly. I want this enigmatic man, who conducts himself so well but contradicts every gentlemanly act in the next breath. He\u2019s a fraud, that\u2019s what he is.</p><p>An actor.</p><p>A conceited man, cleverly disguised as a gentleman.</p><p>Which makes him the worst kind of enemy that my heart could find.</p><p>\u2018Here they are!\u2019 Nan claps, jumping up. \u2018Where\u2019s the pineapple upside-down cake?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I go to turn but quickly realise that with Miller still holding my neck firmly in his grasp, I\u2019m going nowhere.</p><p>\u2018No matter.\u2019 Nan waves her hand at my empty chair. \u2018Sit down, I\u2019ll get it.\u2019</p><p>Miller practically places me on the chair before tucking me in, almost like he has a compulsion to have me just so, as well as everything else that he touches. \u2018Comfortable?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My pleasure.\u2019 He takes his seat beside me and rearranges everything at his place setting before taking his recently shifted glass of wine and taking a slow sip.</p><p>\u2018Oohhh, pineapple upside-down cake!\u2019 George rubs his hands together and licks his lips. \u2018My favourite! Miller, you might die of pleasure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, George, we bought the pineapple from Harrods.\u2019 I shouldn\u2019t be telling him this. Nan will kill me, but she\u2019s not the only one who can play matchmaker. \u2018She paid fifteen pounds for it, and that was before she invited Miller for dinner.\u2019</p><p>He gasps, but then a thoughtful smile spreads across his face. It warms me to the core. \u2018She knows how to spoil a man. Wonderful woman, your grandmother, Livy. Wonderful woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She is,\u2019 I agree quietly. She\u2019s as annoying as hell, but a wonderful woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Pineapple upside-down cake!\u2019 Nan calls, walking in proudly with a silver platter in her hands. She places it in the middle of the table and everyone cranes their necks over, admiring the masterpiece. \u2018This is my best to date. Would you like to try some of my pineapple upside-down cake, Miller?\u2019 she asks.</p><p>\u2018I would love to, Mrs Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s so good you\u2019ll inhale it in a second,\u2019 I say casually, picking up my spoon and flicking my eyes to Miller. He takes the bowl from Nan when she hands it over the table and places it down before turning it a few millimetres clockwise.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve no doubt I will.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t look at me and he doesn\u2019t begin eating. He waits politely for Nan to serve everyone else before she takes a seat and picks up her spoon. His manners won\u2019t allow him to fulfil his suggestion to eat quickly either. He just can\u2019t help himself.</p> <p>His spoon is lifted and sunk into the cake, breaking a piece away. Then he scoops it up with ultimate precision and pops it in his mouth. My eyes make the journey, following his spoon from his bowl to his lips, my own spoon hovering in front of me. His whole being is a ridiculously strong magnet to my eyes and I\u2019m beginning to give up trying to resist him. It seems my eyes are craving him as much as my body.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 he asks, studying me staring at him as he takes another bite. Not even his awareness to my shameless gawking deters me.</p><p>\u2018Yes, I\u2019m fine. I was just thinking that I\u2019ve never seen anyone eat one of my grandmother\u2019s cakes so slowly.\u2019 I\u2019m shocked by my suggestive observation and Miller coughing, his hand flying to his mouth, is an indication that he is, too. I\u2019m glad. I have a feeling that I\u2019ll need to match his poise if I\u2019m devoting another sixteen hours to him, so I may as well start now.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 Nan\u2019s concerned voice hits my ears. I\u2019m sure her old face will display concern, too, but I won\u2019t look to confirm it because seeing Miller flustered is too much of a novelty to miss any of it.</p><p>He finishes chewing, sets his spoon down and wipes his mouth. \u2018I apologise.\u2019 He picks up his glass and gazes over to me, lifting it to his lips. \u2018Beautiful things should be savoured, Livy, not rushed.\u2019 He sips his wine, and I feel his foot brush up my leg under the table. I shock myself further by flashing him a secret smile and remaining composed.</p> <p>\u2018It really is beautiful, Nan.\u2019 I mimic Miller and take a mouthful, chewing slowly, swallowing slowly, then licking my lips slowly. And I know my unabashed string of actions have had the desired effect because my skin is being singed by his blue glare. \u2018Did you enjoy it, George?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did I ever!\u2019 He leans back in his chair and rubs his belly on a satisfied huff of air. \u2018I may need to undo my top button.\u2019</p><p>\u2018George!\u2019 Nan hisses, reaching over and slapping his arm. \u2018We\u2019re at the dinner table.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never usually bothers you,\u2019 he grumbles.</p><p>\u2018Yes, well, we have a guest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is your home, Mrs Taylor,\u2019 Miller interjects. \u2018And I\u2019m privileged to be welcomed into it. That was the best beef Wellington I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of tasting.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 Nan waves a dismissive hand over the table. \u2018You\u2019re too kind, Miller.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s a brown-noser, that\u2019s what he is. \u2018Better than my coffee?\u2019 I\u2019m throwing innuendos all over the place, but I simply cannot help it.</p><p>\u2018Your coffee was like nothing I\u2019ve tasted before,\u2019 he retorts softly, raising his eyebrows at me. \u2018I hope you\u2019ll have one ready for me tomorrow around noon when I\u2019m passing.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head on an amused smile, enjoying our private exchange. \u2018Americano, four shots, two sugars and topped up halfway.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I look forward to it.\u2019 He gives me a hint of the smile I long to see again, the one I\u2019ve seen only a few times since I\u2019ve known him. \u2018Mrs Taylor, would you object if I were to ask Olivia to join me for drinks at my home?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m staggered by his confidence, and why didn\u2019t he ask me? My grandmother wouldn\u2019t say no, anyway. No, she\u2019ll probably try desperately to find a silk negligee in my underwear drawer to stuff into my bag on my way out. She\u2019ll be looking in vain.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d love to,\u2019 I answer, halting the potential of the decision being made for me. I\u2019m a grown woman. I make my own decisions. I\u2019m the master of my own destiny.</p><p>\u2018How very chivalrous of you to ask.\u2019 Nan\u2019s excitement is clear but a bit of a gut wrench. She\u2019s building hopes on the basis of what very little she knows of the man sitting at her table. The whole story would put her in an early grave. \u2018We\u2019ll clear up and you two go and have fun!\u2019</p> <p>My chair is being pulled out from behind me before I can drop my spoon, and I\u2019m on my feet, being directed towards Nan and George\u2019s end of the table without delay. \u2018Mrs Taylor, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not at all!\u2019 She stands and lets Miller peck each of her cheeks while she widens her eyes at me. \u2018It\u2019s been a wonderful evening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I concur,\u2019 he says, holding his spare hand out to George. \u2018It\u2019s been a pleasure to meet you, George.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 George is on his feet, taking position beside Nan and the opportunity, while she\u2019s in such a good mood, to slip his arm around her waist. \u2018Lovely evening.\u2019 He takes Miller\u2019s hand.</p><p>I\u2019m silently begging them to hurry with the polite exchanges. Dinner has been a painfully long process of secret, suggestive remarks and sneaky touches. The pent-up lust in me is both unfamiliar and quite unsettling, but the overwhelming need to release it all is blocking any intelligence that I have, and I have lots of intelligence to block. I\u2019m a smart woman . . . except when Miller is around.</p><p>I feel the soothing kneading of his fingers into my nape, completely obliterating that intelligence. I\u2019m not going to try and find it because it\u2019s long gone, leaving me vulnerable and desperate.</p><p>I kiss Nan and George and allow Miller to guide me from the dining room. He doesn\u2019t let his hold of me drop as he takes his jacket from the stand, and then unhooks my denim jacket, too. \u2018Do you want to get some things?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I answer quickly, not wanting to delay things further.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t argue, swiftly opening the front door and pushing me onward. He opens the door of his car and places me in the seat, shutting it quickly and pacing around the front to get in. Starting the engine, he pulls smoothly away from the kerb, and I look up to my house, seeing the curtains twitching. I can only imagine the conversation going on between George and Nan right now, but that thought trails off when Depeche Mode\u2019s \u2018Enjoy the Silence\u2019 creeps from the speakers, making my brow knit as I remember him telling me to do exactly that.</p><p>\u2018You were extremely naughty during dinner, Livy.\u2019</p><p>My head swings to face him. Naughty? \u2018You\u2019re the one who cornered me in the kitchen,\u2019 I remind him.</p><p>\u2018I was securing my evening\u2019s prospects.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a prospect?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you\u2019re a foregone conclusion.\u2019 He keeps his eyes on the road, his face straight. Does he realise what he\u2019s saying?</p><p>\u2018You make me sound like a tart.\u2019 My jaw is clenched and so are my fists, my lust dissipating in a split second at those words. I may have stamped all over my rules in recent weeks, but I am not, and never will be, a tart. \u2018I\u2019d like you to take me home.\u2019</p><p>He takes a hard left, prompting me to grab the door, and we\u2019re suddenly driving down an alleyway, flanked by loading bays for shops on either side. It\u2019s dusk, it\u2019s eerie and it\u2019s deserted. \u2018You\u2019re my foregone conclusion, Livy. No one else\u2019s.\u2019 Skidding to a halt, he unbuckles his seatbelt, then mine, and I\u2019m quickly being yanked across the car onto his lap.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I ask, shocked, the track making me shudder as it continues to invade my hearing as Miller invades all my other senses.</p><p>Eyes.</p><p>Nose.</p><p>Touch.</p><p>And soon taste.</p><p>His seat is shifted back, giving him more room to pull my dress up to my waist. \u2018I\u2019m doing what you\u2019ve been begging me to do throughout dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t begging.\u2019 My voice has dropped to a husky whisper. I don\u2019t recognise it.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you were most certainly begging. Lift yourself up,\u2019 he orders, taking my hips, encouraging me.</p><p>I put up no resistance, pushing on my knees and rising. \u2018I thought you were waiting to put me back in your bed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would have, had you not teased and tortured me for the past hour. There\u2019s only so much I can take.\u2019 A condom appears from nowhere and he takes it between his teeth before reaching down and unfastening his trousers. \u2018I realise how cheap this is but I really cannot wait.\u2019 His penis breaks free from his trousers, hard and ready, and he makes fast work of ripping the packet open with his teeth and rolling it on.</p><p>I can\u2019t find my breath. My hands are holding the seat on either side of his head and I\u2019m completely rapt as I watch him sheathe himself. Fizzles of heat are stabbing at the pit of my belly, working their way down to my groin, and I\u2019m mentally egging him on, wanting him to hurry. I\u2019ve lost control and my impatience is evident, more so when I gaze up at him and find misty blue eyes and moist, parted lips.</p><p>Pulling my cotton knickers aside, he guides himself to my opening, brushing the inside of my thigh, making me pull in a sharp breath. \u2018Lower slowly,\u2019 he whispers, replacing one hand on my hip.</p><p>Trying to rein in the temptation to crash down, I slowly inch my way down, letting the air from my lungs gush from my mouth, my head falling back, my fingers digging into the leather on the seat behind him. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good God!\u2019 he barks, his h*ps shaking. \u2018I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. Stay where you are.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m completely impaled on him. I can feel the tip of his arousal in the deepest part of me, and I\u2019m shaking like a leaf. Uncontrollable shakes. My body is alive, desperate to fly into action and instigate further pleasure. \u2018Move.\u2019 My head drops, finding Miller\u2019s head resting back, his eyes low and staring into our laps. His hair is a wavy, damp mess, crying for me to feel it. So I do. I lace my fingers through his waves and play with it, stroking and pulling. \u2018Please move.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do whatever you want, Livy.\u2019 He clenches my h*ps and grinds deeply, spiking a low, alluring moan from me. \u2018Jesus, that damn sound you make.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want you to,\u2019 he says, circling firmly, making me moan some more. \u2018I could listen to it for the rest of my days.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m a fevered mess of longing. He even makes love precisely, each rotation, circle and grind a perfectly executed move, building me up perfectly. I\u2019ll never get enough of this. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I pant, pushing short, uncontrolled breaths through my lips.</p><p>\u2018Tell me what you want.\u2019 He lifts me and pulls me back down slowly, his eyes clenching shut. \u2018Tell me how you want me, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t care. Each time he\u2019s worshipped me it has been perfectly perfect. He can do no wrong. \u2018I want it all,\u2019 I breathe, meaning so much more than just movement. I want to feel this good for ever, and I\u2019m not sure that any other man will do it for me. \u2018Kiss me,\u2019 I beg as he slides me back up and guides me down, rotating his hips, grinding firmly. I\u2019m losing my mind. My hands are tightening in his hair, my knees on his waist.</p><p>His eyes lift, his hand finds its place on my nape, and I\u2019m pulled forward slowly, accurately, with no rush or impatience. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing it. \u2018You\u2019ve knocked me sideways, Olivia Taylor,\u2019 he murmurs, claiming my lips gently. \u2018You\u2019re making me question everything I thought I knew.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want to agree because I feel the same, but my mouth is too busy relishing the attention of his soft, worshipping lips. I do, however, note that his declaration can only be a good thing. Maybe he won\u2019t let me walk away after our time is up. I\u2019m hoping he won\u2019t let me walk away because I\u2019ve given myself up to him again, despite my better judgement. But saying no to Miller Hart doesn\u2019t seem to be something I can do . . . or I simply won\u2019t do.</p><p>\u2018Can you feel it, Livy?\u2019 he asks between tentative, delicate circles of his tongue. \u2018Doesn\u2019t it feel like nothing else?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I bite his lip and plunge my tongue back into his mouth, moaning and pushing my body into him, feeling twinges in the tip of my sex, the hints of an orgasm powering forward. It makes me harden our kiss as the desperation to nail it down derails my determination to follow his leisurely lead.</p><p>\u2018Calm,\u2019 he moans. \u2018Take it easy.\u2019</p> <p>I try, but he\u2019s starting to thump inside me, swelling and throbbing, pushing me on. I start shaking my head against his lips. \u2018You feel too good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 He breaks our kiss but maintains the flow of his body into mine, taking over completely to stop me hurrying things along. \u2018Savour it.\u2019</p><p>My eyes close and my head rolls back on my shoulders as I try to gather the strength required to follow his guidance. I\u2019m amazed by his self-control. Every piece of him is gushing with desperation to match mine \u2013 his eyes smoking, his body shaking, his sex throbbing, his face damp with sweat. Yet he seems to find it so easy to tolerate the painful pleasure that he inflicts on us both.</p><p>\u2018Shit, I wish I had you in my bed,\u2019 he moans. \u2018Don\u2019t hide your beautiful face from me, Livy. Show me.\u2019</p><p>My body starts to spasm with an orgasm I couldn\u2019t delay even if I wanted to. My hand flies out, my palm slapping against the window, but it instantly starts slipping all over the condensation on the glass, doing nothing to stabilise me.</p> <p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 He grabs my hair and yanks my head forward. Things are frantic, but his rhythm is still slow and exact. \u2018When I ask you to look at me, you look at me!\u2019 His h*ps thrust up, and I gulp back air as my hearing is flooded by the rush of roaring blood to my head, slightly distorting the music surrounding us. \u2018Here it comes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, faster,\u2019 I beg. \u2018Make it happen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s happening.\u2019 His grip tightens and he directs me back to his mouth, kissing me to my peak as I grapple with the sleeves of his shirt. My world implodes and every nerve ending pulses viciously as I groan, low and satisfied into his mouth while Miller throbs within me.</p><p>\u2018Another sixteen hours isn\u2019t enough for me,\u2019 I confess quietly, my intense physical feelings only enhancing my emotional state of mind. \u2018You can\u2019t do this to me.\u2019 My overworked lips drag across his stubble until they\u2019re glued to his neck, my head heavy, my body limp.</p><p>\u2018Have you considered what you\u2019re doing to me?\u2019 he asks quietly. \u2018You seem to be under the impression that this is all very easy for me.\u2019</p><p>I remain with my face hiding in the crook of his neck, finding it easier to offload my thoughts when I don\u2019t have to look at him. \u2018I\u2019m surrendering myself to you. I\u2019m doing what you\u2019ve asked of me.\u2019 My voice is low and weak, a mixture of exhaustion and timidity.</p> <p>\u2018Livy, I\u2019m not going to pretend I know what\u2019s happening.\u2019 He pulls me from my hiding place and cups my hot cheeks in his hands. His face is serious and there\u2019s unquestionably a hint of confusion. \u2018But it\u2019s happening and I think we\u2019re both powerless to stop it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you going to walk away from me?\u2019 I feel stupid asking this question of a man I\u2019ve known for such a short time, but something is pulling us both together, and it\u2019s not just his persistence. It\u2019s something invisible, powerful and determined.</p><p>He takes a long pull of breath and tugs me down to his chest, giving me his thing. His strong arms surrounding me easily put me in the safest place that I\u2019ve ever been. \u2018I\u2019m going to take you home and worship you.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s not an answer, but it\u2019s not a yes either. This is special, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve found it incredibly easy to avoid these feelings for so long, but I\u2019m incapable of stopping myself from falling for Miller Hart, and even though I don\u2019t quite understand him, I want to pursue this. I want to discover myself. But most of all, I want to discover him \u2013 all of him. The morsels he\u2019s fed me so far have mostly irritated me or angered me, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye with this part-time gentleman.</p><p>And I want to know it all.</p><p>Breaking free of his chest, I slowly lift myself from his lap, his semi-erection slipping free as I do. That alone makes me feel half complete. I settle in the passenger seat and gaze out of the window to the murky, litter-crowded alleyway while he sorts himself out next to me and the music fades to nothing. A small part of my mind is willing me to walk away now before he has the opportunity to do just that to me, but I find it easy to ignore it. I\u2019m not going to be walking anywhere unless I\u2019m forced to. There\u2019s only one thing that I\u2019ve ever been determined to do, and that\u2019s avoid putting myself in this situation. Now I find myself determined to stay here, no matter what the cost to my falling heart.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I have the stamina to get to the seventh floor this time, before Miller carries me up the rest of the stairs. It\u2019s no wonder his physique looks like it belongs to a mythical god.</p> <p>\u2018Would you like a drink?\u2019 He\u2019s returned to sharp and formal, but his manners are still intact. The door is held open for me, and I slip in, immediately noticing a huge spray of fresh flowers on the round table.</p><p>\u2018No, thank you.\u2019 I circle the table slowly and break the threshold into the lounge, glancing around at the paintings adorning the walls.</p><p>\u2018Water?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, sit.\u2019 He indicates the sofa. \u2018I\u2019ll just hang these,\u2019 he says, holding up our jackets.</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 Things are strained, our honest words causing a friction that I want to be rid of. Then soft music is with me and I look around, wondering where it\u2019s coming from while absorbing the calmness of the beats and the gentle tones of the male\u2019s voice. I recognise it. It\u2019s Passenger\u2019s \u2018Let Her Go\u2019. My mind starts racing.</p><p>Miller returns, his waistcoat and tie removed, his collar unbuttoned. He pours some dark liquid into a tumbler, and I notice the label this time. It\u2019s Scotch. He takes a seat on the coffee table in front of me again and sips slowly, but then he almost frowns at the glass before tipping the neat alcohol down his throat and placing the glass on the table.</p><p>As I knew he would, he tweaks the position then clasps his hands together, looking at me thoughtfully. I\u2019m immediately wary of that look. \u2018Why don\u2019t you drink, Livy?\u2019</p><p>I was right to be worried. He keeps saying he doesn\u2019t want to get personal, yet he has no problem asking me personal questions or invading my personal space, namely my home and my dinner table. I don\u2019t say that, though, because what I actually want is for this to get really personal. I don\u2019t just want to share my body with him. \u2018I don\u2019t trust myself.\u2019</p><p>His eyebrows jump up, surprised. \u2018You don\u2019t trust yourself?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m squirming, my eyes darting around the room, despite my desire to share this with him. It\u2019s just finding the courage to form the words that I\u2019ve refused to utter for so long.</p><p>\u2018Livy, how many times do we need to go through this? When I\u2019m talking to you, you look at me. When I ask you a question, you answer.\u2019 He takes my jaw gently and forces me to face him. \u2018Why don\u2019t you trust yourself?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a different person with alcohol in my system.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure I like the sound of that.\u2019 He didn\u2019t need to tell me that. His eyes are telling me all by themselves.</p><p>I feel my face flush, probably heating the tips of his fingers. \u2018It doesn\u2019t agree with me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elaborate,\u2019 he demands harshly, his lips pursed.</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 I try to pull my face from his grip, suddenly not so keen to share a part of my personal, his approach to my news the reason for my change of heart. I don\u2019t need to feel any more ashamed.</p><p>\u2018That was a question, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, that was an order,\u2019 I snap defensively, managing to break free from his hold. \u2018One that I\u2019m choosing not to elaborate on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re being cagey.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re being intrusive.\u2019</p><p>He recoils a little but quickly gathers himself. \u2018I\u2019m being intuitive here, and I\u2019m going to suggest that the only times you\u2019ve had sex were when you were intoxicated.\u2019</p><p>My colour deepens. \u2018Your instincts are correct,\u2019 I mutter. \u2018Is that all, or would you like a run-by-run account of who, what, where and when?\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need for insolence.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With you, Miller, there is.\u2019</p><p>He narrows bright blues on me, but doesn\u2019t scold me for my bad manners. \u2018I want a run-by-run account.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your mother.\u2019 Those words make me instantly stiffen, and by the look on his face, he\u2019s noticed. \u2018When I was forced to hide in your room, your grandmother mentioned your mother\u2019s history.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it does.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She was a prostitute.\u2019 The words fall from my mouth automatically, taking me by surprise, and I chance a glimpse at Miller to gauge his reaction.</p><p>He goes to speak but only achieves a stunned rush of air. I\u2019ve shocked him, as I knew I would, but I wish he\u2019d at least say something . . . anything. He doesn\u2019t, but I do.</p><p>\u2018She abandoned me. She dumped me on my grandparents in favour of a life of sex, alcohol and expensive gifts.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s watching me closely. I\u2019m desperate to know what he\u2019s thinking. I know it can\u2019t be good. \u2018Tell me what happened to her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve told you.\u2019</p><p>He tweaks his glass again and returns his gaze to me. \u2018All you\u2019ve told me is that she accepted money in return for . . . entertainment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And that\u2019s all there is to know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So where is she now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dead, probably,\u2019 I spit nastily. \u2018I really don\u2019t care.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dead?\u2019 he gasps, showing more emotion. I\u2019m pulling reactions from him left, right and centre now.</p><p>\u2018Probably,\u2019 I shrug. \u2018She chased a rainbow. Every man who had her fell for her, but no one was ever adequate, not even me.\u2019</p><p>His face softens, sympathy washing over his features. \u2018What makes you think she\u2019s dead?\u2019</p><p>I take a deep breath of confidence, ready to explain something that I\u2019ve avoided explaining to anyone ever. \u2018She fell into the wrong man\u2019s hands too many times and I have a bank account loaded with years of earnings that hasn\u2019t been touched since she\u2019s been gone. I was only six, but I remember my grandparents constantly arguing over her.\u2019 My mind is instantly bombarded by images of my granddad\u2019s anguish and my nan crying. \u2018She would disappear for days regularly, but then she didn\u2019t come back. My granddad called the police after three days. They investigated, questioned her current beau and the many men before him, but with her history they closed the case. I was a little girl, I didn\u2019t understand, but when I was seventeen I found her journal. It told me everything \u2013 in vivid detail.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I . . .\u2019 He clearly doesn\u2019t know what to say, so I go on. I feel a sense of relief offloading it all, even if it means he\u2019ll walk away from me.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to be anything like my mother. I don\u2019t want to drink and have sex with no feelings. It\u2019s nothing, except degrading and meaningless.\u2019 I realise what I\u2019ve said the second it falls from my lips, but I\u2019ve given Miller no reason to believe there are no feelings from my side. \u2018She chose that lifestyle over her family.\u2019 I surprise myself by keeping my voice steady and strong, even if hearing it aloud for the first time ever causes me physical pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miller\u2019s cheeks puff, letting out a rush of air, and he takes his empty glass and frowns at it.</p><p>\u2018Shocked?\u2019 I ask, thinking I could do with one of those shorts.</p><p>He looks at me like I\u2019m daft, then stands and paces back to the drinks cabinet, pouring more whisky into his tumbler, this time halfway as opposed to the usual two fingers. And then he surprises me by pouring another glass before resuming his position opposite me. He hands me the fresh glass. \u2018Have a drink.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m a little stunned at the glass being waved under my nose. \u2018I told you\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Olivia, you can have a drink without getting mindlessly drunk.\u2019</p><p>Cautiously reaching forward, I take the glass. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Welcome,\u2019 he practically grunts before knocking back his drink. \u2018Your father?\u2019</p><p>I have to stop myself from spilling a sardonic laugh and shrug my answer instead, making him exhale over the rim of his glass.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t know?\u2019</p> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u2018I hate your mother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, shocked, considering I may have just misheard him.</p><p>\u2018I hate her,\u2019 he repeats, venom dripping from his voice.</p><p>\u2018So do I.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. Then we both hate your mother. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u2019</p> <p>Not knowing quite what to say, I sit quietly, watching him drift in and out of thought, taking breaths as if intending to say something, but thinking better of it. There\u2019s nothing that he can say. It\u2019s ugly, and no reassuring words will pretty it up. That\u2019s my history. I can\u2019t change who my mother was, what she did, and I can\u2019t change how I\u2019ve allowed it to impact on my life.</p><p>He eventually speaks, but it\u2019s not a question I expected. \u2018So I\u2019m your only sober lover?\u2019</p><p>I nod and rest back on the couch, putting space between us but finding it impossible to look away from him.</p><p>\u2018And did you enjoy it?\u2019</p><p>This is a stupid question. \u2018It scares me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I scare you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How you make me feel scares me. I don\u2019t know myself around you,\u2019 I whisper, slowly showing him all my cards.</p><p>He places his glass accurately on the table and lowers to his knees in front of me. \u2018I make you feel alive.\u2019 He slides his hands around my back and pulls me forward until our faces are close, our breaths mingling in the small space between our mouths. \u2018I\u2019m not a tender or gentle kind of man, Olivia,\u2019 he says, like he\u2019s trying to make me feel better by sharing a little piece of him. \u2018Women want me for one thing alone, and that\u2019s because I\u2019ve given them no reason to expect anything more.\u2019</p> <p>A million words dance on my lips, all desperate to form a sentence and spill from my mouth, but I don\u2019t want to be hasty. \u2018Expect nothing more than the best f**k of their life,\u2019 I state quietly.</p><p>\u2018Precisely.\u2019 He rids me of my glass and takes my hands, draping them over his shoulders.</p><p>\u2018You promised me that,\u2019 I remind him.</p><p>The lids of his eyes slowly drop. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can fulfil that promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are you saying?\u2019 I ask, willing him to confirm that I\u2019m not imagining things, or that he\u2019s saying this out of sympathy. His shoulders drop a little with a tired exhale, but he keeps his eyes down, keeping quiet, too. \u2018It\u2019s polite to answer someone when they ask you a question,\u2019 I murmur, making his head lift in surprise. I don\u2019t shy away. I want him to confirm what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m saying I want to worship you.\u2019 His head tilts and moves forward, capturing my lips as he rises, taking me with him. He\u2019s the one being cagey now, but I won\u2019t rush an admission from him. I can wait, and in the meantime, he\u2019ll worship me.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised when he takes us down to the couch and manoeuvres until he\u2019s on his back, positioning me between his spread thighs so I\u2019m sprawled up the centre of his body. Our clothes are all still in place and he doesn\u2019t attempt to remove them, seemingly content with just kissing the living daylights out of me. His dark stubble is coarse on my skin, counteracting the subtle movements of his lips, but through my absolute blissful state I hardly register the scratchy feel. With Miller, things just happen naturally. He leads and I follow. I don\u2019t need to think, I just do, which is why I\u2019m now unbuttoning his shirt so I can feel the heat of his flesh under my palms. Moaning around his lips, I get the first spark of his heat mixed with mine as my hands slip across his stomach, rising and falling subtly with the ripples of his abdominals.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s that sweet sound again,\u2019 he says on a murmur, gathering my masses of blond that is pouring all around his head. \u2018It\u2019s addictive. You are addictive.\u2019</p><p>His pleasure spurs me on, my mouth visiting everywhere on his stunning face until I\u2019m at his neck, taking a hit of that intoxicating, manly scent. \u2018You smell so good.\u2019 I work my way down to his chest, my movements just happening without thought or instruction. His ni**les are tight, and my tongue homes in, circling and licking, making him shift and moan beneath me. His sounds of pleasure only embolden me and his solid length pushing into my stomach reminds me of where I want to be. I want to taste him. I want to feel him in my mouth.</p><p>\u2018Oh shit, Livy. Where are you going?\u2019 He raises his head and looks down at me, then clasps his head in his hands. \u2018You don\u2019t have to do that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to.\u2019 I run my palm over his trousers, clasp his zip and gently tug it down as I watch him watching me.</p><p>\u2018No, please, it\u2019s okay, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I. Want. To.\u2019</p><p>His eyes are unsure, his hands visibly tightening on his head as he flops back down to the pillow. \u2018Take it easy.\u2019</p><p>I smile to myself, feeling confident, loving his vulnerability and loving how right this feels. He hasn\u2019t run away from my shameful history. I undo his button and tug down his trousers, sitting up on my knees to rid him of them. It leaves him in a fine pair of black boxer shorts that cling everywhere. They look too good to remove, but what\u2019s underneath spurs me on. I chuck his trousers on the floor and tuck my fingers into the waistband before slowly drawing them down his muscular thighs, glancing up at his face, and then focusing on his thick, solid cock, resting on his lower stomach. My tongue involuntarily leaves my mouth and swipes across my bottom lip as I admire him in all of his magnificent masculinity. I don\u2019t feel intimidated by the pulsing solidness of him. I feel excited.</p><p>Throwing his boxers to join his trousers on the floor, I scoot down and make myself comfortable, my hands lying on his hips, my nose practically resting on the underside of his penis. I\u2019m staring down, watching him twitch, my mouth dropping open as I breathe heavily onto him. His h*ps lift slowly, pushing himself towards me, making me pull in a steady breath of air.</p><p>\u2018Livy, sweet Jesus, I can feel the heat of your breath.\u2019 He lifts his head and hits me with hungry eyes. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just . . . I glance back down.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019 His acceptance is easy. It makes me feel stupid, and with those words, my tongue leaves my mouth and I get my first taste of Miller Hart. I follow my instincts and lick straight up his shaft lightly, climbing onto my knees as I do. I\u2019ve never tasted anything quite like it.</p><p>\u2018Oh, f**kkkkkkk.\u2019 His head falls back and his palms cover his face, which I take as a good sign, so I take him in my hand and pull him up, noting a pearl of white liquid beading on the very tip. I lick it off, really getting a good taste.</p><p>I gasp a little, working hard to keep my confidence. He looks so thick and long. I\u2019ll never take it all. My earlier poise is slipping but I\u2019m desperate not to look like a complete idiot. I curse silently to myself, hating my hesitance, and take him into my mouth, plunging until he hits the back of my throat.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 His h*ps fly up, pushing him further into me, making me gag and retreat quickly. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 he blurts on a suppressed bark. \u2018Shit, Livy, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>Frustrated with myself, I don\u2019t delay getting him back into my mouth, this time only taking him halfway before pulling back and working my way down again. The smoothness of him is a surprise. It feels nice \u2013 his heat, his hardness beneath the smooth skin.</p><p>I\u2019m working up into a comfortable rhythm, his moans of pleasure encouraging me as my hand roams freely, feeling his chest, his thighs, his stomach.</p><p>\u2018Livy, stop now.\u2019 His stomach muscles tense as he rises into a sitting position, his knees rising too, and dropping outwards, leaving me kneeling between his spread legs, my head in his lap. \u2018Stop.\u2019 His hands are in my hair, gently guiding me up and down slowly, patiently. He\u2019s telling me to stop, but seeming to encourage me too. \u2018Oh, Jesus,\u2019 he chokes as I feel one hand leave my head, feeling the zip of my dress being slowly drawn down my spine. \u2018Lift up,\u2019 he says, pulling at the hem of my dress.</p><p>Feeling a little cheated, I do as I\u2019m told and drop him from my mouth, lifting my backside from the backs of my feet and my hands into the air. My dress is pulled up as I look down at him, loving the mess of his hair, all falling freely, the waves enhanced from his sexed-up state. He disappears from sight for just a few seconds while he gets my dress past my face before throwing it carelessly on the floor and reaching around my back to unfasten my bra. He slowly drags it down my arms and drops it before taking my h*ps gently and leaning forward to place his lips on my stomach. Reaching down, I start to push his shirt from his shoulders, keen to get him fully na**d and feel all of him, and he obliges, releasing one hand from my body at a time to allow the removal of his remaining clothes, but keeping his mouth on my stomach, nibbling lazily across to my hip.</p><p>\u2018Your skin is exquisite, Livy.\u2019 His voice is rough and low. \u2018You are exquisite.\u2019</p><p>My hands find his hair, and I look down at the back of his head as he takes his time working his mouth all over my navel. As always, it\u2019s slow, soft and precise, making my body hum and my eyes close dreamily. Nothing about our intimacies suggests that this is just sex \u2013 not one thing. I may not be au fait with sexual relationships, but I know this is more than sex. This has to be more than sex.</p><p>I\u2019m happy enough to kneel in front of his sitting body and let him indulge himself for as long as he likes. His hands are everywhere, cupping my bottom, trailing delicately up my spine and drifting down to the backs of my thighs. I feel his thumbs slip into the sides of my knickers and tug, pulling them down until they\u2019re at my knees, unable to go any further. Dropping my head and opening my eyes, I find him looking up at me. His eyes are screaming desire as he lazily blinks, like his dark lashes are too heavy and it\u2019s an effort to reopen them.</p><p>\u2018How about I lock the door and we stay here for ever?\u2019 he suggests on a low murmur, encouraging me to shift one leg at a time to allow him to remove my knickers. \u2018Forget about the world outside those doors and stay here with me.\u2019</p><p>I settle back down on my knees, my bum resting on my heels. \u2018For ever would be much longer than one night.\u2019</p><p>His lips twitch and he extends his hand, rubbing his thumb across my nipple. I look down, reminding myself of my lack of br**sts, not that he seems at all bothered. \u2018So it would,\u2019 he muses, keeping his focus on his thumb circling the dark rim around my hard nub. \u2018It was a stupid deal.\u2019</p><p>My heart skips too many beats, my spirits lifting to crazy heights. \u2018We didn\u2019t shake on it,\u2019 I remind him. \u2018And we definitely haven\u2019t f**ked on it.\u2019</p><p>He sends me dizzy when he smiles at my breast, and then lifts his blue gaze to mine. \u2018I concur.\u2019 He reaches up and pulls me down so we\u2019re nose to nose. I\u2019m powerless to prevent the small smile plaguing my lips as a result of those words and the look on his face. \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite broken in enough yet.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I concur.\u2019 My smile widens. We both know that I am more than broken in. This is an implicit, mutual acknowledgement and agreement. He wants me for longer, just as much as I want him. We have both been taken aback by this fascination. \u2018Will you break me in some more now?\u2019 I ask innocently, lifting and unfolding my legs, putting myself in his lap.</p><p>He helps me, guiding my legs around his back before holding my bum in his palms and pulling me in. \u2018I think I\u2019m under obligation to do so.\u2019 He pecks my lips. \u2018And I always fulfil my obligations, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I breathe, homing in on his lips and lacing my fingers together behind his neck.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm,\u2019 he sighs, swinging his legs off the couch and standing, cradling me against his body like I\u2019m nothing more than a feather. He paces to his bedroom, and when we enter, he takes me straight to his bed and kneels on the end, walking on his knees to the top before turning and resting his back against the headboard, me on his lap.</p> <p>He leans over and opens the top drawer of his bedside table, pulling out a condom and handing it to me. \u2018Put this on me.\u2019</p><p>I hate myself for stiffening on his lap. I don\u2019t have the first idea of how to go about putting one on. \u2018It\u2019s okay, you can do it.\u2019 I try to look unbothered, rather than scared.</p><p>\u2018But I want you to.\u2019 He pushes me further down his lap, exposing his rigid length and taking hold of it, standing it vertical from his body before handing the foil packet to me. \u2018Take it.\u2019</p><p>I look at him and he nods reassuringly, so I tentatively reach forward and take it from him.</p><p>\u2018Open,\u2019 he orders. \u2018Rest it on top and roll it down gently.\u2019</p> <p>My hesitance is obvious as I carefully rip the packet open and slide the condom out, fiddling with it in my fingers. Having a silent, stern word with myself, I take a deep breath and follow his instructions, resting the loop over the broad head of his erection.</p><p>\u2018Hold the tip,\u2019 he breathes, lying back and watching intently.</p><p>Taking the end between my finger and thumb, I use my other hand to roll the condom down his length until I can roll no more. Again, I\u2019m annoyed at having to conceal him.</p><p>\u2018Nothing to it.\u2019 He smiles up at my concentrating face and pulls me back onto his lap, so far forward that he can raise his knees a little behind me. I\u2019m encouraged to lift up and he takes his arousal to my opening, both of us panting as I lower down. I\u2019m thrown straight into utter ecstasy, immediately holding my breath and pushing my palms into his shoulders.</p><p>I whimper as he bucks within me. I\u2019m on top, and I know movement will only happen when I instigate it, but I can\u2019t move yet. I\u2019m completely filled, but then his legs straighten out and he goes deeper. \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 I gasp, my arms going straight and rigid against him, my chin dropping to my chest.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in control, Livy,\u2019 he breathes. \u2018If it hurts, ease up.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t hurt.\u2019 I circle my h*ps to demonstrate. \u2018Holy shit!\u2019 I\u2019m bombarded by scorching hot shots of pleasure, the friction rubbing my most sensitive spot just right. It prompts me to circle again. \u2018It feels good.\u2019 My arms relax and my grip shifts to his face, encasing his cheeks in my palms as I rotate my h*ps around and around, again and again.</p><p>I\u2019m urged forward, our foreheads meeting, the passion from both of our eyes colliding. \u2018This must be heaven,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018There\u2019s no other explanation. Pinch me.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t pinch him. I lift up and ease down on a firm grind instead, making damn sure he knows that I\u2019m real. My determination is boosting my confidence. The pressure of him filling me is sending me out of my mind, taking me to pleasurable places that I never realised existed. He does this to me, and judging by the constant moans seeping from those lips, I do it to him, too. I pull back, still circling, still grinding, so I can see his face in its entirety. His hair is everywhere, the wayward locks wet on his forehead, the soft curls on his nape flicking out, defined by the dampness. I love it.</p><p>He watches me, his lips slightly parted and sweat trailing his temples. \u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 he asks me, shifting his hands to my thighs. \u2018Tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m thinking that you only have thirteen hours left.\u2019 I undertake a perfect, overly firm grind as I speak. I\u2019m being cunning, but I\u2019ve lost all of my inhibitions.</p><p>His eyes narrow on a slight pout, and then the bastard jolts upwards, knocking my cockiness completely off-kilter. \u2018You\u2019ve been here an hour, maximum. I have fifteen hours.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dinner was two hours.\u2019 I groan, my head becoming heavy, but I\u2019m still relentlessly working him. That luscious warmth is spreading over every inch of my skin, telling me I\u2019m on my way.</p><p>\u2018Dinner doesn\u2019t count.\u2019 He transfers a hand to my hair, combing through with his fingers and finding my nape under the wild, damp strands. \u2018I couldn\u2019t touch you during dinner.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re making up rules now!\u2019 I blurt. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you going to come, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes! Please don\u2019t say you\u2019re not ready,\u2019 I beg, my legs squeezing against his sides.</p><p>\u2018Fuck, I\u2019m always ready for you.\u2019 He sits up and heads straight for my neck, latching on with his mouth, kissing and biting. \u2018Let it go.\u2019</p><p>I do. Every muscle constricts and I yell, my head falling back and dangling freely while I shudder around him, my mind a complete fuzz of jumbled thoughts.</p><p>\u2018Jesus!\u2019 he shouts, surprising me, even through my numb, blissed-out state. \u2018Livy, you\u2019re pulsing around me.\u2019 He guides my non-responsive body on him. I\u2019m useless, except for the relentless muscles gripping greedily onto Miller inside me.</p><p>He cl**axes with a loud groan and an uncontrolled buck of his hips. I\u2019m just swaying in his hold, relying on him to hold me up. \u2018You do serious things to me, Olivia Taylor. Serious, serious things. Let me see your face.\u2019 He helps me pull my limp head up, but I don\u2019t stay upright for long, my chest falling forward and forcing him back to the headboard. He doesn\u2019t complain. He lets me burrow into his neck and leaves me to catch my breath. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 he asks with slight amusement in his tone.</p><p>I can\u2019t speak, so I nod, my hands stroking down his biceps as he drags his palms all over my back. The only sound is strained breaths, mostly emanating from me. But it\u2019s comfortable. It feels right.</p><p>\u2018Are you thirsty?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head no and burrow deeper, content to remain exactly where I am, grateful for his acceptance of me.</p><p>\u2018Have you lost your voice?\u2019</p><p>I nod, but then I feel him jerking underneath me. He\u2019s laughing and I desperately want to see it, so I spring to life, scrambling from his chest and quickly getting his face in my field of vision. It\u2019s straight, and his eyes are wide with shock.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 he asks, all concerned, scanning my face.</p><p>I gather all of the air in my lungs and use it to form a sentence. \u2018You were laughing at me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t laughing at you.\u2019 He\u2019s all defensive, clearly thinking that I\u2019m insulted, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m delighted, but pissed off I missed it.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019ve never seen or heard you laugh.\u2019</p><p>He looks uncomfortable all of a sudden. \u2018Maybe that\u2019s because there\u2019s not much to laugh about.\u2019</p><p>I feel my brows meet in the middle. I get the impression that Miller Hart doesn\u2019t laugh very often. He barely smiles either. \u2018You\u2019re too serious,\u2019 I say, sounding more accusatory than the simple observation that it was meant to be.</p><p>\u2018Life is serious.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you laugh in the pub with your friends?\u2019 I ask, trying to imagine Miller drinking a pint in a spit and sawdust pub. I can\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t frequent pubs.\u2019 He almost looks offended by my question.</p><p>\u2018What about friends?\u2019 I press, finding it hard to imagine Miller laughing and joking with anyone full stop, with or without a pub added to the mix.</p><p>\u2018I believe we may be getting personal,\u2019 He snubs me completely, making me choke. After everything I\u2019ve shared?</p><p>\u2018You pressured me into sharing something very personal, and I told you. When someone asks you a question, it\u2019s polite to answer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s my prerogative to\u2014\u2019</p><p>I cut him off with a dramatic roll of my eyes and fail to halt my mischievous hand from slipping up to his armpit. He watches me suspiciously, his eyes following my hand until I\u2019m tickling him there.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even flinch, just raises his eyebrows cockily. \u2018Afraid not.\u2019 He\u2019s straight-faced but smug, making me more persistent, so I walk my fingers across his collarbone to his stubbled chin and attack him with wriggling fingers, but still nothing. He shrugs. \u2018I\u2019m not ticklish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everyone\u2019s ticklish somewhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not me.\u2019</p><p>My eyes narrow and my fingers creep down to his stomach, giving a little dig in the hard, muscled area of his abdomen. He remains impassive and unaffected by my tactics. I sigh. \u2018Feet?\u2019 He shakes his head slowly, making me sigh deeper. \u2018I wish you\u2019d express yourself more.\u2019 I crawl back up his body and settle to his side, propping my head up on a bent elbow as he shifts to mirror me.</p><p>\u2018I think that I express myself just fine.\u2019 His hand reaches over, taking a lock of my blond, and he starts twirling it between his fingers. \u2018I love your hair,\u2019 he muses, watching his slow-playing fingers.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s unruly and unmanageable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s perfect. Don\u2019t ever cut it off.\u2019 His hand slides around my nape and tugs me closer so there are just a few inches between our faces. My eyes are torn, not knowing whether to focus on his eyes or his lips.</p><p>They choose his lips. \u2018I love your mouth,\u2019 I confess, inching forward and resting mine over his. My bravery is increasing, my ability to express myself with this expressionless man becoming easy.</p><p>\u2018My mouth loves your body,\u2019 he mumbles, pulling me in further.</p><p>\u2018My body loves your hands,\u2019 I counter, falling into the relaxed movement of his tongue.</p><p>\u2018My hands love how you feel under their touch.\u2019</p><p>I hum as he glides those hands to my stomach, onto my hip and down my thigh. The smoothness of his palms defies his masculinity. They\u2019re clean, soft and have no rough calluses, hinting to a life free of manual labour. He\u2019s always in suits, always impeccably turned out, and his manners are faultless \u2013 even with his moody arrogance. Everything about Miller is mystifying, but incredibly enticing, and the invisible pull that\u2019s constantly yanking me towards him is confounding and aggravating, but impossible to resist. And in this moment, when he\u2019s worshipping me, feeling me and taking me so tenderly, I conclude that Miller Hart does express himself. He\u2019s expressing himself right now. He does it like this. He may not laugh or smile much, or give me any facial expressions when we\u2019re talking to tell me what he\u2019s thinking, but his whole physical being tells me his emotional state. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m mistaking it for feelings, not just fascination.</p><p>I\u2019m a little annoyed when he breaks our kiss and pulls away, gazing at me quietly before turning me away from him and pulling me back against his chest. \u2018Get some sleep, sweet girl,\u2019 he whispers, burying his nose in my wild blond.</p><p>Falling asleep with a man wrapped around me is not something I\u2019m used to, but with his soft breaths in my ear and him humming that soft melody quietly, I find slumber too easily, smiling to myself when I feel him break away and get out of bed.</p><p>He\u2019s going to tidy up.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>He\u2019s standing in the doorway to his bedroom in his suit trousers and shirt, fixing his tie, while my arms are wrapped protectively around my na**d body. I would pull the covers over me, but the side of the bed that he slept on has been made and I don\u2019t want to disturb it. His hair is wet and his face unshaved, and though he looks divine, I\u2019m hurt that he\u2019s not still in bed with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Will you join me for breakfast?\u2019 he asks, undoing his tie and starting again.</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I answer quietly, hating the awkwardness closing him off from me. I\u2019m surprised to have woken up to daylight. When I dozed off last night, I was certain that I\u2019d only be given a few hours\u2019 recovery time before Miller woke me up to recommence worshipping me . . . or, more to the point, I was hoping he\u2019d wake me up. I\u2019m disappointed, and I\u2019m trying not to make it obvious.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I glance around the room for my clothes because I know they won\u2019t be anywhere in sight. \u2018Where are my clothes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Take a shower. I\u2019ll prepare breakfast.\u2019 He strolls over to his wardrobe and appears moments later, buttoning up his waistcoat. \u2018I need to leave in thirty minutes. Your clothes are in the bottom drawer.\u2019</p> <p>I shift uncomfortably, wondering what\u2019s changed. He\u2019s more closed off than ever before. Has he spent all night thinking, validating exactly what I\u2019ve told him? \u2018Okay,\u2019 I confirm, not able to think of anything else to say. He\u2019s barely even looking at me. I feel cheap and worthless, something that I\u2019ve fought to avoid for years.</p><p>Not saying another word, he gets his suit jacket from the wardrobe and leaves me in his bedroom, feeling slighted and confused. I desperately want to escape the uneasiness, but I really don\u2019t want to, too. I want to stay and loosen him up again, make him see me, not the illegitimate child of a hooker, but it doesn\u2019t sound like I have much choice. He needs to leave in thirty minutes, and I need to shower before I join him for breakfast, which is limiting my time further.</p><p>Jumping up na**d from the bed, I rush into the bathroom to shower. I use his body wash, working it in firmly, like some way to keep him with me. Reluctantly rinsing off, I step out of the shower and pull one of the crisp, perfectly folded towels from the shelf and dry myself in record time before throwing my clothes on.</p><p>I traipse through his apartment, finding him in front of the mirror in the hallway, messing with his tie again. \u2018Your tie is fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s skew-whiff,\u2019 he grumbles, yanking it free from his neck. \u2018Fuck it!\u2019</p> <p>I watch as he stalks past me into the kitchen. I follow, a little bemused, and I shouldn\u2019t be shocked when I find him standing in front of an ironing board, but I am. He lays the tie neatly, then with the utmost concentration he glides the iron across the blue silk before flicking the switch on the socket and draping the tie around his neck. He sets about putting away the board and iron, then returns to the mirror and starts the meticulous task of fastening his tie again, all as if I\u2019m not even here.</p><p>\u2018Better,\u2019 he affirms, pulling his collar down and looking over to me.</p><p>\u2018Your tie is wonky.\u2019</p><p>He frowns and turns back to the mirror, giving it a little jiggle. \u2018It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it\u2019s perfect, Miller,\u2019 I mutter, making my way into the kitchen.</p><p>I admire the selection of breads, preserves and fruit. But I\u2019m not hungry. My stomach is a knot of anxiety, and his formality isn\u2019t easing my trepidation.</p> <p>\u2018What would you like?\u2019 he asks, taking up his seat.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll just have some melon, please.\u2019</p><p>He nods and takes a bowl, spooning some of the fruit in and handing me a fork. \u2018Coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, thank you.\u2019 I take the fork, and then the bowl, setting it down as neatly as I can.</p><p>\u2018Orange juice? It\u2019s freshly squeezed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, thank you.\u2019</p><p>He pours me some juice and tops his coffee up from the glass pot. \u2018I forgot to thank you for smashing my lamp,\u2019 he muses, lifting his cup slowly and watching me as he takes a sip.</p><p>I feel my face burn up under his accusing stare, my stomach knotting further. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I shift on my chair, my eyes dropping to my bowl. \u2018It was dark. I couldn\u2019t see.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re forgiven.\u2019</p><p>My eyes fly up on a small laugh. \u2018Why, thank you. You\u2019re forgiven for leaving me in the dark.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should\u2019ve stayed in bed,\u2019 he retorts, sitting comfortably back on his chair. \u2018You made an incredible mess.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry. The next time you abandon me in the middle of the night, I\u2019ll have my night-vision goggles at hand.\u2019</p><p>His eyebrows jump up in surprise, but I know it\u2019s not because of my sarcasm. \u2018\u201cAbandon\u201d?\u2019</p><p>I cringe, diverting my eyes away from him. I should think before I speak, especially in the presence of Miller Hart. \u2018That came out wrong.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hope so. I left you sleeping. I didn\u2019t abandon you.\u2019 He continues with his French toast, leaving those words lingering unwanted in the awkward air surrounding us \u2013 unwanted by me, anyway. \u2018Eat up and I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why do you hope so?\u2019 I ask, feeling anger flare. \u2018So I don\u2019t tarnish you with the same brush as I do my pathetic mother?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pathetic?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, spineless. Selfish.\u2019</p><p>He blinks his shock, twitching in his chair. \u2018We have a deal for twenty-four hours,\u2019 he fires across the table.</p><p>My teeth grit as I lean forward. I can see with one hundred per cent clarity that I\u2019m drawing anger from this normally impassive man with my accusation. Yet what\u2019s not clear is whether he\u2019s angry with me or himself. \u2018What was yesterday? In the car and last night? An act? You\u2019re pathetic!\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s eyes darken and a flash of anger crosses his face. \u2018Don\u2019t push me, sweet girl. My temper isn\u2019t something you should toy with. We had an arrangement and I was ensuring it was fulfilled.\u2019</p><p>My falling heart splinters painfully, remembering a very different man from last night. An accepting man. A loving man. The man sitting opposite me now is confounding. I\u2019ve never seen Miller Hart lose his temper. I\u2019ve seen him get agitated and I\u2019ve heard him curse \u2013 mostly when something isn\u2019t Miller-perfect \u2013 but the look in his eyes right now tells me I\u2019ve seen nothing. That coupled with his serious warning also tells me I really don\u2019t want to.</p><p>I stand abruptly, my body seeming to engage before my brain does, and walk away, letting myself out of his apartment and taking the stairs to the lobby. The doorman nods as I pass through, and when I emerge into the fresh morning air, I let out a heavy sigh. The smell and sound of London doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>\u2018I was talking to you.\u2019 Miller\u2019s annoyed tone hits me from behind, but it doesn\u2019t prompt me to find my manners and turn to acknowledge him. \u2018Livy, I said that I was talking to you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what did you say?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>He appears in my line of sight and stands in front of me, regarding me closely. \u2018I don\u2019t like repeating myself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like your mood swings.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have mood swings.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you do. I don\u2019t know where I am with you. One minute you\u2019re sweet and attentive, the next you\u2019re cold and short.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s thinking hard about my words, and it\u2019s a good few moments of staring at each other before he finally utters some himself. \u2018We were getting too close to personal.\u2019</p><p>I pull in a long breath and hold it, desperately trying to stop myself from shouting at him. I knew this was coming from the second I opened my eyes this morning. But it still hurts like hell. \u2018Is this anything to do with your business associate, or is it just me and my sordid history?\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer, choosing to watch me silently instead.</p><p>\u2018I should never have given you more of me,\u2019 I whisper quietly.</p><p>\u2018Probably not,\u2019 he agrees without hesitation. It cuts too deep, and I force myself to walk away before I lose control of the building emotion. I will not cry on him. I plug my ear buds in, select random on my iPod and have a quiet laugh to myself when Massive Attack\u2019s \u2018Unfinished Sympathy\u2019 fills my ears, keeping me company all the way home.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t look any better, Livy,\u2019 Del says, giving me the once-over with concerned eyes. \u2018Perhaps you should go home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I force a reassuring smile, but struggle terribly. Nan is at home, and I need to be distracted, not interrogated.</p><p>She was all smiles when I walked through the front door this morning, until she registered my face. Then the questions started, but I quickly escaped to my bedroom, leaving her pacing the landing outside my room, tossing the odd question through the door, all of which I brushed off. I shouldn\u2019t feel annoyed with Nan; I should reserve it all for Miller, but if she hadn\u2019t poked her old nose in and invited him to dinner, then last night wouldn\u2019t have happened and I wouldn\u2019t currently be in turmoil.</p><p>\u2018I feel much better, honestly.\u2019 I escape the kitchen and dodge Sylvie at the till, who\u2019s been trying to nail me down all morning. Luckily for me, we\u2019re busy, so I can evade all interrogation for the meantime and busy myself clearing tables and serving coffee.</p><p>On my break, I accept the tuna mayo sandwich that\u2019s handed to me by Paul, but choose to eat it on the go, knowing that taking a timeout will lure Sylvie over to press me for answers. It\u2019s cunning, but my head aches with constant thoughts of him and talking will certainly spur tears. I refuse to cry over a man, especially a man who can be so cold.</p><p>\u2018Are you enjoying that?\u2019 Paul asks on a smile, tossing some wet lettuce leaves in a colander.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 I chew and swallow, then wipe my mouth of any stray mayonnaise. \u2018It\u2019s delicious,\u2019 I say truthfully, looking over the other half that I\u2019m yet to eat. \u2018There\u2019s something different about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, but don\u2019t ask me what because I\u2019ll never tell.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Secret family recipe?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got it. Del will never let me leave as long as the Tuna Crunch is his bestseller and I\u2019m the only sucker who knows how to make it.\u2019 He winks and scatters the lettuce between the prepared mixed seeded bread slices that have been coated with Paul\u2019s secret recipe. \u2018Here. These are for table four.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 I push my back through the swing doors of the kitchen, skulk past Sylvie and head for table four. \u2018Two Tuna Crunch sandwiches on seeded,\u2019 I say, sliding the plates onto the table. \u2018Enjoy.\u2019</p><p>Both businessmen express their gratitude with a thank you and I leave them to eat, meeting Sylvie in the kitchen when I push my way back through the swing door. She has her hands on her hips. It\u2019s not a good sign.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t look better, but you\u2019re not ill,\u2019 she snipes, moving slightly to let me pass. \u2018What gives?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 I sound way too defensive, and I immediately chastise myself for it. \u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He followed you out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 My shoulders tense. I know full well what Sylvie is talking about, but it\u2019s not an area of conversation that I want to indulge in. I feel raw, tender, and speaking of him will only enhance that.</p><p>\u2018After you nearly passed out and Del sent you home, he followed you out. I would\u2019ve come to find you, but I was kind of rushed off my feet. What happened?\u2019</p><p>I still don\u2019t face her, choosing to take my time loading the dishwasher. I could leave, but that would mean facing her and I won\u2019t hold my breath that she\u2019ll let me pass. \u2018Nothing happened. I walked away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I figured as much when he returned with a face like thunder and turned up at the bistro yesterday.\u2019</p><p>He was angry? Strangely, that delights me. \u2018There you have it, then,\u2019 I flip casually, grabbing a tray but delaying my return to the bistro front. She\u2019s not finished yet and she\u2019s still in my way.</p><p>\u2018He was with that woman again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She was all over him.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a lump forming in my throat. \u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But he was clearly distracted.\u2019</p><p>Swinging around, I finally face her, discovering the expression that I knew I would; narrowed eyes and bright-pink pursed lips. \u2018Why are you telling me this?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>She shrugs, her short black bob skimming her shoulders. \u2018He\u2019s bad news.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know that,\u2019 I mutter. \u2018Why do you think I walked away? I\u2019m not stupid.\u2019 I should slap myself for my obscenely inaccurate comment. I\u2019m very stupid.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re moping.\u2019 Her questioning eyes are burning holes through me, and quite rightly, too.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not moping, Sylvie,\u2019 I argue feebly. \u2018Do you mind if I get back to work?\u2019</p><p>She sighs, moving out of my way. \u2018You\u2019re too sweet, Livy. A man like that will eat you alive.\u2019</p><p>I close my eyes and take a deep breath as I move past her. She doesn\u2019t need to know about last night\u2019s cosy family dinner, and I wholeheartedly wish that there was nothing to tell.</p> <p>My week doesn\u2019t improve. Nan has been back to Harrods twice with the excuse that George thought her special pineapple upside-down cake was so delicious, she simply had to make it again . . . twice. Her secret hopes of bumping into Miller on the off-chance that he may be there buying more suits had nothing to do with her compulsion to spend thirty quid on two pineapples. I\u2019ve avoided Gregory at all costs after receiving a terse voicemail from him advising me that Nan has been blabbering and he thinks I\u2019m stupid. I know all of this.</p><p>I skip breakfast and slip out of the front door, eager to avoid Nan and even keener to get my Friday done and dusted. I have plans to lose myself in the grandeur of London this weekend, and I can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s just what I need.</p><p>I pace down the street, my long black jersey dress swishing around my ankles, my face warm under the morning sunshine. As ever, my hair is doing what it damn well pleases, and today it\u2019s wavier than usual as I slept on it wet.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>Without any instruction, my pace quickens, not that I\u2019m going to get very far. He sounds pissed off.</p><p>\u2018Baby girl, you\u2019d better stop right now or there will be trouble!\u2019</p> <p>I halt dead in my tracks, knowing that I\u2019m already in trouble, and wait for him to catch up to me. \u2018Morning!\u2019 My overenthusiastic greeting isn\u2019t going to wash, and when he lands in front of me, his handsome face distorted with displeasure, I can\u2019t help scowling back. \u2018What?\u2019 I snap, making him jump back in shock. I feel irritated with my best friend, yet I have absolutely no right to be. It\u2019s Friday, but he\u2019s in ripped jeans and a tight T-shirt, and he\u2019s wearing a baseball cap. Where are his gardening clothes?</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t what me!\u2019 he snaps right back. \u2018What happened to staying away?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I tried!\u2019 I screech. \u2018I bloody tried, but we bumped into him in Harrods and Nan invited him to bloody dinner!\u2019</p><p>Gregory jumps back some more, stunned by my unusual outburst, but his chiselled, scowling face softens. \u2018You didn\u2019t have to leave with him, though,\u2019 he points out softly. \u2018And you definitely didn\u2019t have to stay at his place.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well I did, and I bloody wish I hadn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ahh, Livy.\u2019 He steps forward and wraps me in his arms. \u2018You should have answered my calls.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you could just tell me off?\u2019 I mumble into his T-shirt. \u2018I already know that I\u2019m an idiot. I don\u2019t need it confirmed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It near on killed me to see Nan so excited,\u2019 he says on a sigh. \u2018Shit, Livy, she was ready to go and buy a hat.\u2019</p> <p>I laugh because if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d cry. \u2018Please don\u2019t. I can\u2019t take it much more, Gregory. He only sat at her dinner table for an hour or two. She was gushing all over him, and now she\u2019s all confused and wondering why I\u2019m not seeing him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cocksucker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I keep telling you, you\u2019re the only cocksucker I know.\u2019 I feel him laugh a little, but when he pulls me from his chest, his face is serious.</p><p>\u2018Why did you leave with him?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t say no when he\u2019s with me,\u2019 I sigh sullenly. \u2018Things just happen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you\u2019ve not seen him all week?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>His blond brows rise. \u2018Why not?\u2019</p><p>Damn it, I want to say that I walked away off my own back, but Gregory will rumble me in a nanosecond. \u2018It was wonderful, and then it was awful. He was sweet, and then he was an arsehole.\u2019 I brace myself. \u2018I told him about my mum.\u2019</p><p>I can see the surprise on Gregory\u2019s face, and there is definitely a bit of hurt mixed in there, too. He knows that I absolutely never speak of her, not even with him, and I know he wishes I did. He collects himself and forces the hurt plaguing his face to morph into contempt. \u2018Cocksucker,\u2019 he spits. \u2018Complete knob-head. You need to be stronger, baby girl. A sweet thing like you will be walked all over by a man like that.\u2019</p><p>My nostrils flare and I bite my tongue to prevent my natural reaction to that statement from slipping past my lips. And fail. \u2018Oh, bollocks to the lot of you,\u2019 I grumble, making him recoil in shock. I push past him and stomp off down the street.</p><p>\u2018See, that\u2019s what I want more of. A little spunk!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck off!\u2019 I yell, shocking myself with my vulgar language.</p><p>\u2018Ooh, yes, carry on, you filthy-mouthed bitch!\u2019</p><p>I gasp and swing around, finding him grinning from ear to ear. \u2018Wanker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tosser.\u2019</p><p>He grins some more. \u2018Dog.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shirt-lifter,\u2019 I retort.</p><p>\u2018Tart.\u2019</p><p>I recoil, horrified. \u2018I am not a tart!\u2019</p><p>He pales instantly, realising his mistake. \u2018Shit, Livy, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t bother!\u2019 I storm off, my blood boiling with rage at his insensitive, careless remark. \u2018And don\u2019t follow me, Gregory!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ahhhh, I didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He scoops me up, preventing me from running away. \u2018A stupid word slipped.\u2019 He walks on with me draped across his arms, and I reach up and pull his hair. \u2018Twat.\u2019</p><p>Grinning, he leans down and kisses my cheek. \u2018I had a date last Sunday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Another?\u2019 I roll my eyes and firm up my grip of his shoulders. \u2018Who\u2019s the lucky guy this time?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually, it was our fourth date. His name\u2019s Ben.\u2019 A thoughtful, dreamy look washes over Gregory\u2019s face, making me pay more attention. It\u2019s been a few years since he\u2019s had this look.</p><p>\u2018And . . .\u2019 I push, wondering how he managed to keep four dates with the same man quiet. I can\u2019t challenge him on it, though. Not after my lack of sharing.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s cute. I might like you to meet him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, really. He\u2019s a freelance events planner. I\u2019ve told him all about you, and he\u2019d like to meet you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 I tilt my head, and he gives me a shy smile. \u2018Ohhhh . . .\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018Yes, ohhhhh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Benjamin?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nooo.\u2019 He narrows playful eyes, continuing with his even strides down the street with me still bobbing up and down in his arms. \u2018Just Ben will do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Benjamin and Gregory,\u2019 I muse thoughtfully. \u2018It has a nice ring to it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ben and Greg sounds much better. Why do you insist on calling me Gregory? Even Nan does it. It makes me sound like a poofter,\u2019 he grumbles.</p><p>\u2018You are a poofter!\u2019 I laugh, getting a set of teeth sunk into my neck for my trouble. \u2018Stop it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019 He sets me on my feet and links arms with me. \u2018Let\u2019s get your sweet arse to work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you working today?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope. I finished my recent project early, and I have a haircut.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 I grin up at him. \u2018A whole day off work for a haircut?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up. I told you. I finished my project early.\u2019</p><p>I smile, wondering why I\u2019ve alienated myself from my treasured Gregory all week. I feel a million times better already.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>No one at work actually asks me if I\u2019m all right because it\u2019s obvious that I am. Or are they just stunned into silence by my chirpiness? Am I being over the top? I don\u2019t even care. Gregory has lifted my spirits. I should\u2019ve seen him earlier in the week.</p><p>\u2018Service!\u2019 Paul yells, prompting me to skip over with my tray, ready to be loaded up. \u2018What are you all smiley about?\u2019 he laughs, sliding a Tuna Crunch onto my tray.</p><p>Sylvie dumps a load of empties nearby and joins us by the hotplates. \u2018Don\u2019t question it, Paul. Just embrace it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Friday.\u2019 I shrug, twirling and sashaying out of the kitchen with a smile on my face. As I approach the table, I\u2019m confronted with a huge beam, courtesy of Mr Wide-Eyed Luke. My good mood prevents me from being anything but polite, and I find myself smiling back at him. \u2018Tuna Crunch?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s me,\u2019 he pipes up as I slide it onto the table. \u2018You look especially lovely today.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes, but I\u2019m still smiling. \u2018Thank you. Can I get you another drink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m good.\u2019 He sits back in his chair, his warm brown eyes friendly as they regard me. \u2018I\u2019m still after a date.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are?\u2019 I feel myself blush a little and in an attempt to hide it, I start clearing the next table.</p><p>\u2018Can I take you out?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m wiping the table furiously, my hand rotating just as fast as my mind. \u2018Yes.\u2019 The word falls from my mouth without me realising, until I hear it with my own ears.</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 He sounds as shocked as I feel.</p><p>The table is spotless, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from rubbing the cloth over the wood some more. Did I really just accept a date? \u2018Sure,\u2019 I confirm, shocking myself further.</p><p>\u2018Great!\u2019</p><p>I try to cool down my burning cheeks before I turn to face my . . . date. He\u2019s really smiling now, and he\u2019s scribbling down his number on a napkin. It draws an unwanted memory, which I quickly toss to the back of my mind. I can go on a date with Luke. Actually, I need to go on a date with Luke. \u2018When were you thinking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tonight?\u2019 He looks up at me hopefully, handing me the napkin.</p><p>I take it, pushing my doubts away. I can\u2019t go on like I have, even more so after my encounters with Miller Hart. I need to start living, forget about him, my mother, and start living . . . sensibly. \u2018Tonight,\u2019 I confirm. \u2018Time, place?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eight outside Selfridges? There\u2019s a little bar down the side street. You\u2019ll love it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great. I look forward to it.\u2019 I collect my tray and leave Luke smiling around the first bite of his Tuna Crunch.</p><p>\u2018Hey, you\u2019re not going to stand me up, are you?\u2019 he calls, his words muffled by his full mouth. That stupid little thing alone reminds me of manners and . . .</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be there,\u2019 I assure him on a smile, his mouthful of sandwich while he talks only spurring me on. He might not be in the same league as Miller Hart, but he\u2019s still cute, and his carefree attitude and lack of manners is even more reason to accept his offer.</p><p>When I push my way through the swing door, Sylvie\u2019s pink lips are smirking at me. \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you!\u2019 she sings in my face.</p><p>\u2018Oh, stop it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, really, I am. He\u2019s cute and normal.\u2019 She starts to help me unload the tray, the big smile on her face pulling one from me. \u2018Think of it as new beginnings.\u2019</p><p>I frown, wondering if I should do exactly that. I\u2019ve not known Sylvie for very long, although it seems like years. \u2018I\u2019m just going on a date, Sylvie.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Oh, I know. But I also know that Olivia Taylor doesn\u2019t do dating. It\u2019s just what you need.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What I need is for you to stop making such a fuss about it.\u2019 I laugh. By need, she means that I need to get over someone, but I\u2019m slowly concluding that I am, in fact, already over someone. Someone doesn\u2019t have a name. Someone doesn\u2019t even exist. Someone is long forgotten.</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay.\u2019 Sylvie holds her hands up, still grinning, still delighted. \u2018What are you going to wear?\u2019</p><p>I feel my face pale as I consider Sylvie\u2019s question. \u2018Oh God, what am I going to wear?\u2019 My wardrobe is full of Converse in every colour, piles and piles of jeans and endless tea dresses, but they are floaty and girly, not tight and sexy.</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t panic.\u2019 She holds my shoulders and gives me serious eyes. \u2018We\u2019ll go shopping after work. We\u2019ll only have an hour, but I think I\u2019ll come up with something.\u2019</p><p>I look down at Sylvie\u2019s skin-tight black jeans and chunky, studded boots and wonder if I should go shopping with her. But then I have a thought. \u2018No, don\u2019t worry!\u2019 I break free of Sylvie\u2019s hold and hunt down my satchel, finding my phone. \u2018Gregory is off work today. He\u2019ll come.\u2019 I don\u2019t even consider that I may have offended Sylvie until she heaves an exasperated sigh of relief.</p><p>\u2018Thank f**k for that!\u2019 She flops against the worktop. \u2018I would\u2019ve endured Topshop for you, Livy, but it would have been pure hell.\u2019 Her brow puckers. \u2018Gregory? As in a bloke?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, my best friend. He\u2019s got terrific fashion sense.\u2019</p><p>She looks suspicious. \u2018He\u2019s g*y, isn\u2019t he?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Only eighty per cent.\u2019 I run out the exit door from the kitchen to the back alley and dial Gregory as I pace up and down.</p><p>\u2018Baby girl!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have a date tonight!\u2019 I blurt. \u2018And I have nothing to wear. You have to help me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018With him?\u2019 Gregory spits. \u2018I\u2019m doing nothing except pinning you down. You\u2019re not going out with that prick!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no, no! It\u2019s Mr Wide Eyes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Luke. A guy who\u2019s been asking for a few weeks. I figured why not.\u2019 I shrug to myself, and I can practically hear the excitement bubbling down the line before Gregory\u2019s even spoken. Then he does speak, confirming my suspicions.</p><p>\u2018Oh my God!\u2019 he shrieks. \u2018Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! What time do you finish work?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Five. And I\u2019m meeting Luke at eight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Buy an outfit and get you ready in three hours?\u2019 he gasps. \u2018Bloody hell, it\u2019ll be a challenge, but it\u2019s doable. I\u2019ll meet you at work at five.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 I hang up and rush back into the kitchen before my absence is noticed by Del. It\u2019ll be a rush, but I have every faith in Gregory. He has impeccable taste.</p><p>As soon as Del\u2019s gone for the day, I run to grab my satchel and denim jacket, giving Sylvie a kiss on the cheek and throwing a wave at Paul, leaving them laughing in the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Good luck!\u2019 Sylvie calls.</p><p>\u2018Thank you!\u2019 I burst into the fresh air and find Gregory waiting across the road.</p> <p>He waves his arms frantically, signalling for me to hurry. \u2018We have three hours to dress you, preen you, and deliver you to your date. That\u2019s my mission, and I choose to accept it.\u2019 He grins and throws his arm around me, leading me quickly towards Oxford Street.</p><p>\u2018You look cheerful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am,\u2019 I admit. Surprisingly to me, I\u2019m looking forward to going on a date. \u2018Nice hair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks.\u2019 His hand glides over his scalp on a smile, prompting one from me.</p><p>\u2018Isn\u2019t it sad that I\u2019ve never actually been on a date?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it\u2019s tragic.\u2019</p><p>I nudge him in the side. \u2018You\u2019ve been on enough for both of us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, that\u2019s tragic, too. But I might be a one-man guy soon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you already?\u2019 I ask, hoping Gregory isn\u2019t about to be crapped all over. He\u2019s stupidly good-looking, and should probably hold all of the cards when it comes to a relationship, but he\u2019s too nice and he\u2019s paid for it in the past. He\u2019s a player when single but devoted when captured.</p><p>\u2018You have to remain open to offers, Livy.\u2019 He sounds resolute, but that look is there again, and it\u2019s screaming fallen.</p><p>I\u2019m utterly exhausted by the time we get home. I\u2019ve spent practically every penny I\u2019ve earned since working at Del\u2019s, and I have three outfits \u2013 all short and not really me \u2013 and two pairs of shoes, neither of which are Converse. It\u2019s a waste. I\u2019ll probably only wear one pair of the shoes this evening, and as for the dresses . . . well, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.</p><p>I\u2019m standing in my towel in front of my wardrobe, running my eyes over each of my new outfits.</p><p>\u2018It has to be the black one.\u2019 Gregory skates his hand down the short tight dress on a sigh. \u2018Yes, this one and the black pointed stilettos.\u2019</p><p>I feel a little overwhelmed as I look at the dress, then down to the shoes. It\u2019s been a long, long while since I\u2019ve worn heels. \u2018I\u2019m scared,\u2019 I murmur quietly.</p><p>\u2018Rubbish!\u2019 He dismisses my worry on a snort and heads for the bed, picking up some of the fancy underwear he forced me to buy. We both wasted at least twenty minutes in La Senza arguing over the lacy matching sets, one of which he\u2019s currently having a thorough inspection of. He\u2019s right, though. I can\u2019t wear white cotton under these sorts of dresses. \u2018You know, I might be eighty per cent g*y, but there\u2019s something about a woman in sexy underwear.\u2019 He chucks the set at me. \u2018Put them on, then.\u2019</p><p>I keep my mouth shut for fear of objecting and shimmy into the knickers while deftly holding my towel in place. The bra\u2019s not so straightforward, and I end up turning away from Gregory, who doesn\u2019t seem in the least bit perturbed by the potential of copping a load of my nakedness.</p><p>He starts laughing as he watches me battling with the bra, and I grumble to myself, not amused by his amusement as I arrange my poor excuse of a chest into the cups. I look down, surprised to see something close to a cle**age.</p><p>\u2018See,\u2019 Gregory says, grabbing the towel and whipping it away. \u2018Push-up bras are the best things ever invented.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Gregory!\u2019 I cross my arms over my chest, feeling shy and exposed, as he moves to stand in front of me.</p><p>His eyes are slightly bugged as he drags them down my petite frame. \u2018Fucking hell, Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it!\u2019 I attempt in vain to steal the towel back, but he\u2019s having none of it. \u2018Give me it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You look steaming.\u2019 His mouth is open, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re supposed to be g*y!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I still appreciate a woman\u2019s form, and you\u2019ve got form, baby girl.\u2019 He throws the towel on the bed. \u2018If you can\u2019t stand in front of me in your underwear, then who can you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going on a date, nothing more.\u2019 I escape Gregory\u2019s appreciative stare and grab my hair dryer. \u2018Will you stop looking at me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 He seems to shake himself back to life before plugging in some hair-styling device: straighteners, I think. \u2018What are you going to drink?\u2019</p><p>The question catches me off guard. I\u2019ve not thought that far ahead. Accepting a date, getting ready for the date, and getting myself to the date has been enough for me to get my head around. What I\u2019m going to drink and talk about while I\u2019m actually on the date hasn\u2019t entered my head. \u2018Water!\u2019 I shout over the roar of my hair dryer.</p><p>He recoils, a disgusted look all over his face. \u2018You can\u2019t go on a date and drink water!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m scowling across the room at him, not that he\u2019s bothered. \u2018I don\u2019t need alcohol.\u2019</p><p>His shoulders drop dramatically, as does his arse to my bed. \u2018Livy, have a glass of wine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Listen, the fact that I\u2019m going out with a man should be enough, so don\u2019t start pressing me on drinking.\u2019 I flip my head upside down and blast my blond everywhere. \u2018Baby steps, Gregory,\u2019 I add, thinking that I need to keep my wits about me, and alcohol won\u2019t help me do that. But I didn\u2019t need alcohol in the equation to make me lose my mind in the company of Miller Ha\u2014</p><p>I throw my head back up in the hope of physically tossing the thought from my mind. It works, but it has nothing to do with head tossing and everything to do with Gregory gawking at me. \u2018Sorry!\u2019 he blurts, immediately busying himself with unpacking my shoes.</p><p>I drop my dryer and look dubiously at the straighteners that are steaming on a heat mat on the carpet. They look dangerous. \u2018I think I might leave my hair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no,\u2019 he pouts. \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to see your hair straight and sleek.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He won\u2019t recognise me,\u2019 I complain. \u2018You\u2019re sticking me in that dress and these heels, and now you want to iron my hair, too.\u2019 I start rubbing some E45 into my face. \u2018He asked me on a date, not the polished thing that you\u2019re trying to create.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wouldn\u2019t be a polished thing,\u2019 he objects. \u2018You\u2019d be you, just enhanced. I think you should surrender all decisions to me.\u2019 He stands and fetches the dress, taking it off the hanger.</p><p>\u2018How do you know what a man wants from a woman?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve gone out with women.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not for over two years,\u2019 I point out, remembering each and every time that he has, and it was always after a break-up with a guy.</p><p>He shrugs nonchalantly and holds the dress up. \u2018How did this become about me?\u2019 he asks. \u2018Shut up and slip that neat little body into this delightful dress.\u2019 He jiggles his eyebrows cheekily, and I reluctantly drag myself over to him, letting him put the dress over my head and down my body. \u2018There.\u2019 He steps back and gives me the once-over while I slip my feet into the painfully high shoes.</p><p>I look down at myself, seeing the black dress clinging to every curve that I don\u2019t have and my feet at a stupidly high angle. I feel unsteady. \u2018I\u2019m not sure,\u2019 I say, feeling far too overdressed. When Gregory doesn\u2019t respond to my wavering, I look up, seeing a dumbstruck face. \u2018Do I look stupid?\u2019</p><p>He snaps his gaping mouth shut and seems to mentally slap himself. \u2018Er . . . no . . . I . . . He starts laughing. \u2018Fucking hell, I have a hard-on.\u2019</p><p>I huff, flaming red instantly. \u2018Gregory!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 He starts adjusting his groin, prompting me to swing around to escape the view, which subsequently prompts me to stagger in the stupid heels. I hear Gregory gasp. \u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit!\u2019 I go over on my ankle, losing a shoe, then proceed to hop around like a demented kangaroo. \u2018Shit, that hurt!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh God!\u2019 Gregory is clearly in pieces behind me, the bastard. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I snap, kicking the other shoe off. \u2018I\u2019m not wearing them!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, don\u2019t be like that. I\u2019ll control myself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re bloody g*y!\u2019 I yell, picking up a shoe and waving it around above my head. \u2018I can\u2019t walk in these.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve hardly tried!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You put them on and tell me how easy it is.\u2019 I chuck the shoe at him, and he laughs as he catches it.</p><p>\u2018Livy, that would make me a drag queen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Be a drag queen, then!\u2019</p><p>Gregory loses control altogether and collapses on my bed in a helpless fit of laughter. \u2018You\u2019re making me cry!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bastard,\u2019 I spit, yanking the dress off. \u2018Where are my Converse?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You can\u2019t.\u2019 He dives up, immediately noticing that the dress has been ditched, as well as the shoes. \u2018Oh no! You looked fabulous.\u2019 His eyes run down my semi-nakedness.</p><p>\u2018Yes, but I couldn\u2019t walk,\u2019 I mutter, stomping over to my wardrobe. This irritation is a good enough reason alone to maintain my boring lifestyle. I\u2019ve been bombarded with new situations recently, and for the most part I\u2019ve mainly felt angry, pissed off, or useless throughout. Why the hell am I doing this to myself?</p><p>I viciously yank down a cream layered dress and shove it on, quickly realising that my underwear is black and you can see the damn stuff through the material, so I set about removing everything all over again, telling Gregory to stick his face in the pillow so I can do it all quickly and comfortably. When I\u2019m done, I have my white cotton underwear back on, my cream dress in place, my denim jacket over the top, and my navy Converse gracing my feet. I feel so much better.</p><p>\u2018Ready,\u2019 I declare, quickly brushing over my cheeks with some blusher and putting a pink sheen on my lips.</p> <p>\u2018What a waste of a shopping trip,\u2019 Gregory mutters, removing himself from my bed and strolling over. \u2018You looked lovely.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t I now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, yes, you always look lovely, but you looked less of a walkover in the black number. It would\u2019ve empowered you \u2013 given you confidence.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m happy the way I am,\u2019 I counter, wondering if that\u2019s strictly true. I don\u2019t even know any more. My head\u2019s not been my own in recent weeks. It\u2019s thinking things I never considered and making my body do things I definitely never considered.</p><p>\u2018I just want you to express yourself a little more, like you did just then.\u2019 He grins at me as he fluffs my hair.</p> <p>\u2018You want me to be mad?\u2019 I ask, because that\u2019s exactly how I feel. Moody. Irritable. Pressured.</p><p>\u2018No, I want some sass to surface. I know it\u2019s there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sass is dangerous.\u2019 I brush him off and transfer my things from my satchel to a more suitable across-the-body bag. \u2018Let\u2019s go before I change my mind,\u2019 I mutter, ignoring his grumbles of disapproval as I march out onto the landing.</p><p>I thank all of the Converse gods as I walk down the stairs in my stable flats, but soon stop smiling when I find Nan pacing restlessly at the bottom of them. George is moving out of her way each time she performs an about-turn, pinning himself against the wall of the hallway to avoid being run down.</p><p>\u2018Here she is!\u2019 George says, clearly relieved that his body dodging will soon come to an end. \u2018And doesn\u2019t she look lovely?\u2019</p><p>I halt on the bottom step and watch Nan give me an all-over assessment, then flick her eyes over my shoulders, homing straight in on Gregory. \u2018You said heels,\u2019 she says in disbelief. \u2018You said a lovely black dress and heels to match.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I tried,\u2019 Gregory mumbles grumpily behind me, and I swing around to fire an accusing glare at him. He meets my accusing glare with his own. \u2018You try avoiding a Nan-style interrogation.\u2019</p><p>I sigh my frustration and take the last step, pushing my way past my grandmother, keen to escape all of the bloody fuss. \u2018Bye.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have fun!\u2019 Nan calls. \u2018Is this one really better than that Miller?\u2019 I hear her ask quietly.</p><p>\u2018Much!\u2019 Gregory assures her confidently. It just makes me walk faster. How the hell does he know? He\u2019s not met either of them.</p><p>\u2018See,\u2019 George laughs. \u2018Now, where\u2019s my pineapple upside-down cake?\u2019</p><p>I march onward, grateful for my flats and looking forward to my date because it gets me out of the house and away from Nan, an uncharitable thought, but Lord, give me strength! A quiet life was an easy life, kind of, except for the odd grumble about my reclusiveness. Now it\u2019s a constant stream of questions and brain-picking. It\u2019s painful.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 Gregory catches up to me as I reach the end of the road. \u2018You look dead cute.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to try to make me feel better. I feel fine, no thanks to you.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re grumpy today.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No thanks to you.\u2019 I let out a girly squeal as I\u2019m hoofed from the pavement. \u2018Will you pack it in!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sass,\u2019 he says simply. \u2018You can have it without being a bitch, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You deserve it. Put me down.\u2019</p><p>He places me on my feet and straightens me out. \u2018I\u2019m headed in the other direction, so I\u2019ll love you and leave you.\u2019 He leans down and pecks my cheek. \u2018Be good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s a really stupid thing to say to me.\u2019 I jab his shoulder in an attempt to restore our normality.</p><p>\u2018Well, yes, it usually would be, but my best friend has developed a stupid gene in recent weeks.\u2019 He jabs my shoulder right back.</p><p>He\u2019s right; I have, but I\u2019ve also lost that gene again, so he has nothing to worry about, and neither do I. \u2018I\u2019m going on a friendly date, that\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And a little snog wouldn\u2019t hurt, but no hanky-panky until I\u2019ve met him. I need to check him out.\u2019 He grabs my shoulders and turns me around. \u2018Off you trot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call you,\u2019 I say as I start to leave him behind.</p><p>\u2018Only if you\u2019re not too busy,\u2019 he calls back, earning himself a roll of my eyes that he can\u2019t see to appreciate.</p><p>It\u2019s ten minutes to eight when I arrive at Selfridges. Oxford Street is still bustling, even at this hour, so I prop myself up against the shopfront and watch the world go by, making my best effort to look casual and at ease. I know I\u2019m failing.</p><p>After five minutes of waiting, I decide that fiddling with my phone will make me look much more relaxed, so I rootle through my bag and start a text to Gregory, just to pass the time.</p><p>How long do I wait?</p><p>I click send, and my phone starts ringing almost immediately, Gregory\u2019s name flashing up. \u2018Hi,\u2019 I answer, grateful he called because actually being on the phone is an even better way to appear relaxed.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not there yet?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, but it\u2019s not even eight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Doesn\u2019t matter!\u2019 he exclaims. \u2018Damn it, I should\u2019ve made you late. It\u2019s the number-one rule of dating.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What is?\u2019 I ask, changing my standing position to lean on my shoulder rather than my back.</p><p>\u2018The woman has to be late. Everyone knows that.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t sound happy.</p><p>I smile to the crowd of strangers scurrying by. \u2018So what happens when the two people dating are men? Who\u2019s the one to be late then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very funny, baby girl. Very funny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable question.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop diverting the conversation to me. Is he there yet?\u2019</p><p>I glance back, my eyes darting around briefly, but find no Luke. \u2018Nope. How long should I wait?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate him already,\u2019 Gregory grumbles. \u2018Two pricks in two weeks. You\u2019re on fire!\u2019</p><p>I laugh to myself, silently agreeing with my aggravated friend, although I\u2019ll never tell him so. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I roll onto my back against the glass and sigh. \u2018You\u2019ve still not answered my question. How long should I\u2014\u2019 My tongue dries up in a second as I watch a car cruise past, my head turning to follow its path down Oxford Street. There must be thousands of black Mercedes driving around London, so why am I so drawn to this one? The tinted windows? The AMG plate on the wing?</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Gregory snaps me back to the present. \u2018Livy, you there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say, watching as the Mercedes slows and then pulls a highly illegal three-point turn in the road before driving back toward me.</p><p>\u2018Is he there?\u2019 Gregory asks.</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I squeak. \u2018I should go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Better late than never,\u2019 he mutters. \u2018Have fun.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will do.\u2019 I barely push the words past the lump in my throat and quickly hang up, turning to face the other way, like it might look as if I\u2019m unaware. Should I leave? What if Luke turns up and I\u2019ve gone? You can\u2019t park on Oxford Street so he can\u2019t stop. If it\u2019s even him. It might not be. Shit, I know it is. I push my body away from the glass and quickly weigh up my options, but before my brain makes an informed decision, my feet are in action and carrying me away from my distress. I walk with purpose, taking deep breaths, concentrating hard on maintaining my even pace.</p><p>I close my eyes when I see the car pass me slowly, and only reopen them again when I\u2019m barged from the side by an impatient businessman, who proceeds to ridicule me for not looking where I\u2019m going. I can\u2019t even find the power to apologise, instead picking up my stride again, but then I notice the car has stopped and I stop, too. I watch as the door to the driver\u2019s side opens. His body flows from the car like liquid, rising to his full height before pushing the door shut and buttoning up the jacket of his grey suit. His black shirt and tie compliment his dark waves, and his jaw is covered in stubble. He looks magnificent. I feel conquered, and he hasn\u2019t even made it to me yet. What does he want? Why has he stopped?</p><p>I fight some balanced thoughts into my mind and I\u2019m in action again, turning away from him and walking fast. \u2018Livy!\u2019 I can hear his footsteps coming after me, the sound of expensive shoes beating heavily on the concrete behind me, even over the bustling sounds of London surrounding me. \u2018Livy, wait!\u2019</p><p>The jolt of surprise that kicked my feet into action turns to irritation as I listen to him shouting my name, like I owe him the time of day. I stop and face him, feeling more determined than irritated when I finally meet his eyes.</p><p>He skids to a stop on his fancy shoes and straightens his jacket out, just standing in front of me, making no attempt to speak. I\u2019m not saying anything, because I have nothing to say, and, in fact, I hope he doesn\u2019t speak because then I won\u2019t have to encounter those lips moving slowly and listen to the smoothness of that voice. I\u2019m safer when he\u2019s silent and unmoving . . . or remotely safer than when he\u2019s touching me or talking to me, at least.</p><p>I\u2019m not safe at all.</p><p>He steps forward, like he knows what I\u2019m thinking. \u2018You\u2019re waiting for someone. Who?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, just keeping my eyes glued to his.</p><p>\u2018I asked you a question, Livy.\u2019 He takes another step forward, his growing closeness registering as a danger, yet I stay exactly where I am when I should be moving away. \u2018You know I hate repeating myself. Please answer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have a date.\u2019 I try for cool detachment, but I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ve completely succeeded. I\u2019m too pissed off.</p><p>\u2018With a man?\u2019 he asks, and I can practically see his hackles rise.</p><p>\u2018Yes, with a man.\u2019</p><p>His normally expressionless face is suddenly a wealth of emotion. He\u2019s very clearly not happy. The knowledge spurs my self-assurance. I don\u2019t want to feel the small pang of hope that\u2019s fluttering in my stomach, but there is no denying it\u2019s there.</p><p>\u2018Is that all?\u2019 I ask, my voice stronger.</p><p>\u2018So now you\u2019re dating?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I say simply, because I am, and like an omen, I hear the not-so-familiar calling of my name.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Luke appears by my side.</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 I lean in and kiss his cheek. \u2018Are you ready?\u2019</p><p>He flicks his eyes to Miller, who I notice is rigid and silent as he watches me greet Luke. \u2018Hi.\u2019 Luke holds his hand out to Miller, and I\u2019m surprised when he takes it, giving Luke a firm shake, his manners never failing him.</p><p>\u2018Hello. Miller Hart.\u2019 He nods, jaw tense, and I see my date wince before Miller quickly releases Luke\u2019s hand, then rearranges his perfectly neat jacket. I\u2019m definitely not imagining the subtle rise and fall of his broad chest or his eyes darkening with anger. I can almost hear something ticking inside him, like an unexploded bomb. He\u2019s mad and his murderous eyes nailed on Luke begin to worry me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Luke Mason,\u2019 Luke replies, shaking his hand. \u2018Nice to meet you. Are you a friend of Livy\u2019s?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, just an acquaintance.\u2019 I jump in quickly, eager to remove Luke from such palpable fury. \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great.\u2019 Luke holds his arm out for me to link, and I do, letting him lead me away from the horridly awkward situation. \u2018I thought we\u2019d try the Lion around the corner. It\u2019s had a makeover, apparently,\u2019 Luke tells me, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>\u2018Great,\u2019 I reply, not helping myself from glancing over my shoulder too, and instantly wishing that I hadn\u2019t. He\u2019s standing, just watching me walk away with another man, his face cold, his body rigid.</p> <p>We soon turn a corner, and when I feel Luke look down at me I feel guilt start to take hold. I don\u2019t know why. A date, that\u2019s all. And is my guilt because of an oblivious Luke or a clearly affected Miller?</p><p>\u2018He was a bit of a strange one,\u2019 Luke muses. I hum my agreement, pulling his gaze down to me. \u2018You look lovely,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a few minutes late. I should\u2019ve skipped the cab and jumped on the Tube.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re here now.\u2019</p><p>He smiles, and it\u2019s a cute smile, one that warms his already friendly face. \u2018It\u2019s just up here, look.\u2019 He indicates up the street. \u2018I\u2019m hearing great things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s new?\u2019 I ask.</p> <p>\u2018No, just refurbished. It\u2019s now a wine bar, not a typical London pub.\u2019 He checks for traffic and quickly guides me across the road. \u2018I do love a good old-fashioned pub, though.\u2019</p><p>I smile, thinking that I could definitely imagine Luke in a spit and sawdust pub, drinking a pint and laughing with his mates. He\u2019s normal, just a regular guy \u2013 the type of guy who I should be investing in, now it\u2019s become apparent that I am, in fact, investing my time in men.</p><p>Luke opens the door, ushering me in, and then leads me to a table at the rear of the bar on a raised mezzanine floor. \u2018What would you like to drink?\u2019 he asks, indicating for me to sit.</p><p>It\u2019s that question, and while I felt perfectly fine about asking for a water when I was with Gregory, I now feel young and stupid. \u2018Wine,\u2019 I say quickly before I can convince myself that it\u2019s a bad idea. Besides, I feel like I need a drink. Damn Miller Hart.</p><p>\u2018Red, white, pink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018White, thank you.\u2019 I try to appear unaffected and completely comfortable in my surroundings, but seeing Miller again has nudged me back to unbalanced and unsure. I\u2019m wobbly, thinking of his face when he saw Luke.</p> <p>\u2018White it is.\u2019 Luke smiles and heads for the bar, leaving me alone at the table, feeling like a fish out of water. The bar is busy, mostly with men in suits who look like they\u2019ve come straight from the office. Their loud chatter and laughing is evidence of their length of time here, with ties loosened and jackets disappearing.</p><p>I appreciate the stylish decor of the place, but not the noise. Shouldn\u2019t a first date be something to eat somewhere quiet where you can talk and get to know each other?</p><p>\u2018Here.\u2019 A glass of wine slides towards me, and I instinctively slide back on my chair instead of picking it up and thanking him for it. Luke sits opposite me, pint in hand, and takes his first swig, gasping appreciatively before placing it down. \u2018I\u2019m really glad you agreed to have a drink with me,\u2019 he says. \u2018I was about to give up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad I came.\u2019</p><p>He smiles. \u2018So tell me about yourself.\u2019</p><p>I force my hands to join and rest on the table where I fiddle with my ring and give myself a quick mental kick up the arse. Of course he\u2019s going to ask questions. That\u2019s what normal people do on dates, not offer unreasonable propositions. So taking a deep breath, I bite the bullet and divulge a piece of me to someone new, something that I\u2019ve never done, or ever thought I would do.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve only recently started working at the bistro. I was looking after my grandmother before that.\u2019 It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a start.</p><p>\u2018Oh, did she die?\u2019 he asks, looking uncomfortable.</p> <p>\u2018No,\u2019 I laugh. \u2018She\u2019s far from dead, trust me.\u2019</p><p>Luke laughs, too. \u2018That\u2019s a relief. For a moment there I thought I\u2019d put my foot in it. Why were you looking after her?\u2019</p><p>This question isn\u2019t so easy to answer and the truth too complicated. \u2018She was unwell for a while, that\u2019s all.\u2019 I\u2019m ashamed of myself, but at least I\u2019ve shared a little piece of me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be. She\u2019s fine now,\u2019 I say, thinking Nan would love to hear me admit that.</p><p>\u2018So what do you do for fun?\u2019</p><p>My hesitance is obvious. I do nothing, in truth. I don\u2019t have an army of girlfriends, I don\u2019t socialise, I don\u2019t have any hobbies, and because I\u2019ve never put myself in a situation where someone might want to know, I\u2019ve never considered how utterly cut off and isolated I actually am. I always knew it \u2013 God, I aimed for it, but now, when I want to come across as an interesting person, I\u2019m stumped. I have nothing to offer this conversation. I have nothing to offer a friendship or a relationship.</p><p>I panic. \u2018I go to the gym, go out with my friends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I do the gym at least three times a week. Which one do you go to?\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s getting worse. My lies are leading to further questioning, which means further lies. This is not the best way to start a friendship. I take my wine and raise it to my lips, a desperate tactic to buy me more time while I frantically search my mind for a local gym. I can think of none. \u2018The one in Mayfair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Virgin?\u2019</p><p>The relief of Luke answering my question for me is obvious. \u2018Yes, Virgin.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I go there! I\u2019ve never seen you.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m in physical pain. \u2018I tend to go pretty early.\u2019 I need to divert this conversation quickly before I tell any more lies. \u2018What about you? What do you do?\u2019</p><p>He accepts my request for information and dives right in with a detailed report of him and his life. Over the next half-hour, I learn so much about Luke. He has a lot to tell, and I don\u2019t doubt that all he\u2019s saying is the truth and is as interesting as it seems, unlike my poor attempt to express me and my life. He\u2019s a stockbroker and lives with his mate, Charlie, after splitting with his girlfriend of four years, but he\u2019s in the process of buying his own place. He\u2019s twenty-five, far closer to me in age, and genuinely a nice, stable, sensible bloke. I like him.</p><p>\u2018So no ex-boyfriend I should be wary of?\u2019 he asks, finishing his pint.</p><p>I\u2019m enjoying listening to him. I\u2019m engrossed, contributing the odd opinion or thought, but it\u2019s mainly Luke talking, and I\u2019m happy with that.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I shake my head and take a tiny sip of my wine.</p><p>\u2018There must be someone,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018A girl who looks like you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was looking after my grandmother. I didn\u2019t have time for dating.\u2019</p><p>He slumps back in his chair. \u2018Wow! I\u2019m stunned.\u2019</p><p>My relaxed state has been shifted back to uncomfortable now the conversation has reverted to me. \u2018Don\u2019t be,\u2019 I say quietly, fiddling with my glass.</p><p>The look on his face tells me he\u2019s curious, but he doesn\u2019t press further. \u2018Okay.\u2019 He smiles. \u2018I\u2019ll get another drink. Same again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, thanks.\u2019</p><p>He nods thoughtfully, probably wondering what the hell he\u2019s doing wasting his time on a guarded, ambiguous waitress, and makes his way to the bar, shifting through the crowd to get to the front. Letting out an aggravated sigh, I flop back on my chair and twirl my glass, scolding myself for . . . everything. My life approach, focus and direction need some serious rethinking. But I don\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>I jump a mile when I feel hot breath in my ear and a firm grip of my nape. \u2018Come with me.\u2019</p><p>I stiffen under his hold, my eyes darting to the bar to see where Luke is. I can\u2019t see him, but that\u2019s not to say he can\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u2018Get up, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I ask, ignoring the heat that\u2019s being injected into the flesh of my neck from his touch.</p><p>He takes a grip of my upper arm with his free hand and pulls me to my feet, then starts pushing me to the back of the bar. \u2018I haven\u2019t a f**king clue what I\u2019m doing, but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself from doing it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller, please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please stop doing this.\u2019 I\u2019m begging quietly when I should be fighting him off and slapping his face. \u2018I\u2019m on a date.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say that.\u2019 He grinds the words out and I\u2019m sure if I could see his face, it would look pissed off. But I can\u2019t see his face because he\u2019s behind me and his grip on my nape is preventing me from turning. He pushes on, leaving me no choice but to scuttle to keep up with his long, determined strides.</p><p>The fire exit door is pushed open and kicked closed, and I\u2019m spun around and pressed gently up against the wall, his hard body pushing into me. \u2018Are you going to sleep with him?\u2019 His lips are straight, his eyes piercing. He\u2019s still mad.</p><p>Of course I\u2019m not, but that has nothing to do with him. \u2018That\u2019s none of your business.\u2019 I raise my chin in a little act of defiance, fully aware that I\u2019m provoking him. I could\u2019ve said no, but I\u2019m too curious about what he\u2019s going to do. I\u2019m not falling to my knees to please him, to tell him what he wants to hear.</p><p>I want to, though.</p><p>I want to swear that I\u2019ll never look at another man again, as long as he worships me for ever. His tall body flush against mine, his clear eyes burning into me, and his parted lips releasing subtle steams of air are all coaxing those inconceivable feelings to the surface. I\u2019m starting to quiver under him.</p><p>I want him.</p><p>He brings his lips closer to mine. \u2018I asked you a question.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m choosing not to answer,\u2019 I breathe, pushing myself further back. \u2018I\u2019ve had to endure seeing you on a date more than once.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve explained that a hundred times. You know how much I hate repeating myself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then perhaps you should explain yourself better,\u2019 I retort.</p><p>\u2018Why is there a glass of wine on your table?\u2019</p><p>\u2018None of your business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m making it my business.\u2019 He presses in further, pushing a breathy gasp from my lips. \u2018You\u2019re planning on sleeping with him, and I\u2019m not going to let that happen.\u2019</p><p>I turn my head away from him, losing the desire and gaining some irritation. \u2018You can\u2019t stop me.\u2019 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying.</p><p>\u2018You still owe me four hours, Livy.\u2019</p><p>My head swings back towards him in shock. \u2018You expect me to commit another four hours to you, just so you can turn cold and hard-hearted on me again? I shared something with you. You made me feel safe.\u2019</p><p>His lips purse and his breathing becomes heavier, more forced, like he\u2019s trying to control himself. \u2018You are safe with me,\u2019 he growls. \u2018And yes, I do expect you give me more. I want the rest of the time that you owe me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not going to get it,\u2019 I proclaim confidently, disgusted with his absurd demand. \u2018Do you really think I owe you anything?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re coming home with me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m not.\u2019 I fight the urge to scream yes. \u2018And you didn\u2019t answer my question.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m choosing not to.\u2019 He hunkers down and levels his lips with mine. \u2018Let me taste you again.\u2019</p><p>The desire is fighting its way forward. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let me take you to my bed.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head desperately and clench my eyes shut, wanting to let him, but knowing it would be a gargantuan mistake. \u2018No, not so you can toss me out again.\u2019 I feel the warmth of his mouth closing in, but I don\u2019t turn my head.</p><p>I wait.</p><p>I let it happen.</p><p>And when the moist softness of his lips connects with mine, I go lax and open up to him on a low moan, my hands finding his shoulders, my head tilting to give him full access. I blank out. My intelligence has been blocked again.</p> <p>\u2018There are sparks,\u2019 he mumbles, \u2018full-on, electric sparks, and we\u2019re creating them.\u2019 He pecks my lips. \u2018Don\u2019t deprive us of this.\u2019 He kisses his way into my neck and nibbles up to my ear. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just four hours?\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>\u2018Stop overthinking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not overthinking. I can barely think at all when you\u2019re near me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I like that.\u2019 He encases my neck with his palms and tilts my face up. His stunning features cripple me. \u2018Let it happen.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I already did, more than once, and you turned distant on me every time. Will it be like that again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No one knows what\u2019s going to happen in the future, Livy.\u2019 His lips move slowly, holding my attention at his mouth.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s a poor answer,\u2019 I murmur. \u2018And you can tell me what will happen because you\u2019re in control of it.\u2019 Annoyingly, I\u2019ve laid my cards \u2013 I\u2019ve made it perfectly clear that I want more than he\u2019s willing to give.</p><p>\u2018I really can\u2019t.\u2019 He moves in to kiss me, but I force my face to the side, leaving him hovering over my cheek. \u2018Let me taste you, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I have to resist him, and his vague answer to my question gives me the strength I need to do it. \u2018You\u2019ve already had too much.\u2019 If I fall now, there will be no getting up. By accepting this, I\u2019m giving him the power to turn his back after he\u2019s taken what he wants, and I would never have a valid reason to hold it against him, because I allowed it . . . again.</p><p>\u2018Have you?\u2019 he asks. \u2018Have you had enough of me, Livy?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Too much.\u2019 I push him away. \u2018Way too much, Miller.\u2019</p><p>He curses and runs his hand through his hair. \u2018I\u2019m not letting you go home with that man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And how will you stop me?\u2019 I ask quietly. He doesn\u2019t want me, but he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to have me either. I don\u2019t understand him, and I\u2019m not going to let him swallow me up again, just so he can spit me back out.</p><p>\u2018He won\u2019t make you feel like I can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean used?\u2019 I retort. \u2018You make me feel used. I\u2019ve never exposed myself emotionally to a man before, and I did you. I\u2019ve built up a pile of regrets in my life, Miller. And you\u2019re at the top of it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u2019 He reaches forward and runs his knuckles across my cheek. \u2018How can you regret something that was so beautiful?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Easily.\u2019 I take his hand from my cheek and drop it gently to his side. \u2018I can regret it easily when I know I\u2019ll never have it again.\u2019 I shuffle past him, ensuring there\u2019s no contact, and start my journey home.</p><p>\u2018You can have it again,\u2019 he calls. \u2018We can have that again, Olivia.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Not just for four hours,\u2019 I reply, clenching my eyes shut. \u2018I\u2019d rather not have it at all.\u2019 My feet are moving, but I can\u2019t feel them, and I\u2019m vaguely aware that I have a date inside the bar, who\u2019s certainly wondering where I\u2019ve got to. But I can\u2019t go back inside and feign a good mood, not when I\u2019m feeling so utterly broken. So I text Luke a feeble excuse about Nan falling ill. Then I drag myself home.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u2018How did it go?\u2019 Gregory asks when I call him the next morning. No \u2018hello\u2019 or \u2018how are ya doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s nice,\u2019 I admit, \u2018but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be seeing him again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t I surprised?\u2019 he grunts, as I hear shuffling in the background.</p><p>\u2018Where are you?\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s a lengthy silence, then a few more shuffles, and definitely the sound of a door closing. \u2018I caught up with Ben last night,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>\u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 I grin down the phone. \u2018Dirty stop-out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t like that. We went out and had coffee back at his place.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And breakfast.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, yeah, and breakfast.\u2019 He\u2019s smiling around his words, making my own grin widen. \u2018Listen. You know I said Ben wanted to meet you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do recall.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, there\u2019s an opening of a nightclub tonight. Ben\u2019s been planning it for weeks and he\u2019s invited me. He wants you to join us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me?\u2019 I blurt. \u2018In a nightclub?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, come on. It\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s a dead plush place called Ice. Please say yes.\u2019 His beseeching voice won\u2019t shift me. I can\u2019t think of anything worse than subjecting myself to a London nightclub. And anyway, three\u2019s a crowd.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think so, Gregory.\u2019 I shake my head to myself.</p><p>\u2018Oh, baby girl,\u2019 he groans. If I could see him, I know he\u2019d be pouting. \u2018It\u2019ll take your mind off things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What makes you think my mind needs taking off things?\u2019 I ask. \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019</p><p>He almost growls. \u2018Cut the crap, Livy. I\u2019m not taking no for an answer. You\u2019re coming and that\u2019s it. And there will be no Converse, either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019m definitely not coming,\u2019 I grumble. \u2018You\u2019re not putting me in those heels again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you are. And yes, I am!\u2019 he snaps. \u2018You\u2019ve got so much to offer the world, Livy. I\u2019m not letting you waste any more time. This isn\u2019t a practice session, you know. One life, baby girl. Just one. You\u2019re coming out tonight, and you\u2019re going to make an effort of it, too. Put those heels on and walk around the house in them all day if that\u2019s what it takes. I\u2019ll be there at eight to pick you up. I expect you to be ready.\u2019 He hangs up, leaving me with my phone at my ear and my mouth open, ready to object. He\u2019s never spoken to me like that before. I\u2019m shocked, but wondering if I\u2019ve just received the kick up the arse I deserve, and which has been a long time coming.</p><p>Too many years have been wasted; too much time spent pretending to be content with my closed-off life. Not any more. Miller Hart may have sent me into unfamiliar emotional turmoil, but he\u2019s also made me realise that I have so much more to offer the world. No more closing myself off and hiding away, too afraid to be vulnerable \u2013 too afraid of becoming my mother.</p><p>I jump off the bed and slip my feet into the black stilettos and start pacing around my room, concentrating on walking with poise and with my head held high, not looking down at the ridiculous angle that my usually flat feet are at. While I\u2019m doing this, I search Google on my phone for local gyms \u2013 not Virgin \u2013 and I call to arrange an induction for Tuesday evening. Then I try the stairs, taking them carefully and at a slight angle to maintain my ladylike posture and gracefulness. I\u2019m doing well.</p><p>Walking down the hall, I smile when I hit the wooden floor of the kitchen, having got here without a stumble, stagger, or slip.</p><p>Nan swings around at the sound of heels clicking on the floor, her mouth falling open.</p><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 I ask, taking a little turn to demonstrate my stability, to both my nan and myself. \u2018Obviously with a dress,\u2019 I add, registering my pyjama shorts.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Livy.\u2019 She clutches the tea towel to her chest on a sigh. \u2018I remember the days when I pranced around in high heels like they were flats. I have bunions to prove it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I doubt I\u2019ll be prancing, Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you have another date with the nice young man?\u2019 She looks hopeful as she takes a seat at the kitchen table.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure whether she means Miller, who she\u2019s met, or Luke, who she hasn\u2019t. \u2018I have a date with two men tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Two?\u2019 Her old, navy eyes widen. \u2018Livy, sweetheart, I know I said live a little, but I didn\u2019t\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Relax.\u2019 I roll my eyes, thinking she should know better, but then again, her boring, introvert granddaughter has been out more times this week than in her whole life. \u2018It\u2019s Gregory and his new boyfriend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How lovely!\u2019 she sings, but then her wrinkled brow puckers some more. \u2018You\u2019re not going to one of those g*y bars, are you?\u2019</p><p>I laugh. \u2018No, it\u2019s a new place uptown. Tonight\u2019s the opening, and Gregory\u2019s new fellow has been organising it. He\u2019s invited me.\u2019</p><p>I can tell by her face that she\u2019s delighted, but she\u2019s going to make a fuss, anyway. \u2018Nails!\u2019 she screeches, knocking me back a step in my heels.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You must paint your nails.\u2019</p><p>I look down at my short, tidy, bare nails. \u2018What colour?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, what are you wearing?\u2019 she asks, and I wonder if many twenty-four-year-olds seek this kind of advice from their grandmother.</p><p>\u2018Gregory made me buy a black dress, but it\u2019s a little short and I\u2019m sure I could\u2019ve done with the next size up. It\u2019s tight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 She zooms up, all excited and enthusiastic about my night out. \u2018I have pillar-box red!\u2019</p><p>She disappears from the kitchen and moves up the stairs, faster than I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s only moments before she\u2019s back, shaking a bottle of red nail polish in her wrinkled hand.</p><p>\u2018I save it for special occasions,\u2019 she says, pushing me down onto a chair and taking one next to me.</p><p>I can do no more than watch as she takes her time, neatly coating each of my nails, blowing little streams of air over my fingers when she\u2019s done. Sitting back in her chair, she tilts her head and I follow her gaze down to my fingers, wriggling them for a few moments before bringing them closer and running my eyes over them. \u2018They\u2019re very . . . red.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s very classy. You can\u2019t go wrong with red nails and a black dress.\u2019 Her mind seems to wander, and I smile fondly at my grandmother, childhood memories of her and my gramps flooding my mind.</p><p>\u2018Do you remember when Gramps took us to the Dorchester for your birthday, Nan?\u2019 I ask. I was ten years old and in complete awe of the affluence. Gramps wore a suit, Nan a floral two-piece skirt and jacket, and I was treated to a navy-blue dungaree dress, which was covered in large white polka dots. Gramps always loved it when the women in his life wore navy blue. He said it made our already stunning eyes look like bottomless pits of sapphires.</p><p>My grandmother takes a long pull of air and forces a smile, when I know that she really would like to shed a tear. \u2018That was the first time I painted your nails. Granddad wasn\u2019t happy.\u2019</p><p>I return her smile, remembering all too well the stern word he had in her ear. \u2018He was even less happy when you tinted my lips with your red lipstick.\u2019</p><p>She laughs. \u2018He was a man of principles and set firmly in his ways. He didn\u2019t understand a woman\u2019s need to cake her face in make-up, which made it all the more difficult for him to deal with your . . .\u2019 She trails off and quickly starts screwing on the lid of the polish.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019 I place my hand over hers and give it a little squeeze. \u2018I remember.\u2019 I may have only been a small child, but I remember vivid shouting matches, slamming doors, and Gramps with his head in his hands on many occasions. I didn\u2019t understand it at the time, but maturity has brought it all home, making everything painfully clear. That and the journal I found.</p><p>\u2018She was too beautiful and too easily led.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I agree, but I don\u2019t think she was easily led at all. I\u2019ve concluded that that\u2019s what Nan has told herself over the years to deal with her loss. I\u2019m happy to let her have that.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 She shifts her hand carefully to avoid smudging my polish, so she\u2019s the one gripping mine, and it\u2019s a firm grip \u2013 a reassuring grip. \u2018Everything about you is your mother, but not this.\u2019 She taps her temple with her index finger. \u2018You mustn\u2019t be afraid of becoming her. It\u2019ll just be another life wasted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I admit. My own underlying reasons to avoid a repeat of my mother\u2019s life are good enough, but remembering my grandparents\u2019 devastation has only ever sealed it.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve completely shut yourself down, Livy. I know I was, well, a little bit of a handful after your granddad died, but I\u2019m fine now \u2013 have been for some time, sweetheart.\u2019 She raises grey eyebrows at me, desperate for me to acknowledge it. \u2018I\u2019ll never get over losing them both, but I can still live. You haven\u2019t experienced half of what life has to offer, Olivia. You were such a spirited child and teenager until you found\u2014\u2019 she halts, and I know it\u2019s because she can\u2019t say the words. She\u2019s talking about the journal, the frighteningly vivid accounts of my mother\u2019s life.</p> <p>\u2018It was safer that way,\u2019 I murmur.</p><p>\u2018It was unhealthy that way, sweetheart.\u2019 She lifts my hand and kisses it lovingly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m beginning to see that.\u2019 I take a deep breath of confidence. \u2018That man, the one who came for dinner . . .\u2019 I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t use his name. \u2018He unearthed something in me, Nan. It\u2019ll never go anywhere, but I\u2019m glad I met him because he\u2019s made me realise what life could be if I let it.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t divulge any more than that, and I also don\u2019t confess that given the chance, I would have whatever that is with him, if only he would let me. It\u2019s not the sex; it\u2019s the connection, the feeling of complete refuge that beats anything I\u2019ve attempted to achieve on my own. It defies sensibility, really. Miller Hart is irrational, arduous and temperamental, but the times between those irritating moments are inconceivably blissful and serene. I want to, but I have no faith in finding those feelings with another man.</p><p>Nan looks at me thoughtfully, keeping her firm grip of my hand. \u2018Why will it not go anywhere?\u2019 she asks.</p> <p>I\u2019m honest and she must see it for what it is, anyway. She\u2019s not stupid. \u2018Because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really available,\u2019 I say quietly.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Livy,\u2019 Nan sighs. \u2018We can\u2019t help who we fall for. Come here.\u2019 She stands up and pulls me into her arms, giving me a big squeeze. The tension and uncertainty seems to drain right out of me under her hold. \u2018In every experience we have in life, we have to find a positive. I can see many positives coming from your encounter with Miller, sweetheart.\u2019</p><p>I hum my agreement into her shoulder, but wonder if I\u2019ll be in any fit state to embrace these supposed opportunities. He\u2019s already successfully intercepted one date. If I\u2019m going to continue to resist Miller Hart, I need to maintain my willpower and grow some resilience. The sass the Taylor girls are renowned for has eluded me, but I\u2019m on a mission to relocate it. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s popped up now and then recently, but I need to grab on to it and never let go.</p><p>I squint as a camera is shoved in my face and Nan blinds me with the flash. \u2018Get a grip, Nan,\u2019 I moan, pulling down the hem of my ridiculous dress. I\u2019ve been standing in front of the mirror for twenty minutes deliberating on the dramatic transformation. All day, all bloody day, I\u2019ve spent waxing, plucking, painting, smoothing and straightening. I\u2019m exhausted.</p><p>\u2018See, George!\u2019 Nan snaps a few more shots. \u2018Sassy!\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes at a smiling George and pull my hem down again. \u2018Stop it now.\u2019 I push the camera from my face, feeling like a teenager going to a prom. It was inevitable, but the fuss is just making me feel even more conspicuous.</p> <p>\u2018You look spectacular, Livy!\u2019 George laughs, taking the camera from Nan and ignoring her appalled glare. \u2018Leave the poor woman alone, Josephine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you, George,\u2019 I say, again pulling down my dress.</p><p>\u2018Stop tugging at your dress.\u2019 Nan smacks my hands away. \u2018Walk tall, chin high. Keep fidgeting and you\u2019ll look out of place and uncomfortable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh God, I\u2019m going.\u2019 I grab my stupidly small bag and make for the door, desperate to escape the over-the-top reactions to my . . . enhanced look. I slam the door harder than I mean to and click on my heels down the path, hearing Nan shout at George as I do. I smile, pull my shoulders back, and set on my way, shoving my bag under my arm and resisting the urge to pull the hem of my dress down again.</p><p>I\u2019m only a few paces into my strut when I see Gregory in the distance, walking towards me. He falters slightly mid-stride, and I know that if I was close enough, I would see him squinting. Strangely, this reaction doesn\u2019t make me feel conspicuous; it makes me feel bold, so I raise my chin and make my best attempt of impersonating a model on the catwalk. I don\u2019t know if I pull it off, but it makes Gregory grin from ear to ear and wolf whistle from fifty yards away.</p><p>\u2018Hot stuff!\u2019 He halts and spreads his legs, holding his hands out to me. \u2018Fuck me, I\u2019ll be fighting them off!\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t even blush. I perform a perfectly executed twirl before throwing my arms around his neck. \u2018I\u2019ve been practising all day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can tell.\u2019 He removes me from his body and runs his eyes up and down me, then smooths my hair and smiles. \u2018Straight and sleek. You look even more gorgeous than normal. Holy shit, look at those legs!\u2019</p> <p>I glance down at my legs, seeing curves I never have before. \u2018I feel good,\u2019 I admit.</p><p>His arm falls around me and he pulls me into his side. \u2018Well, you should, because you look amazing. Were you leaving without me?\u2019 he asks, starting us towards the main road to get a cab.</p><p>\u2018No, I couldn\u2019t stand it in there any more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can imagine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re looking very dapper.\u2019 I give the sleeve of his pink shirt a little tug. \u2018Trying to impress?\u2019 I glance up at him, finding a restrained grin. It makes me smile.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need to try, Livy.\u2019 He\u2019s cocky. \u2018Promise me something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll call me Greg tonight.\u2019</p><p>My smile widens and my arm snakes around his waist. \u2018I\u2019ll call you Greg if you call me sassy lady.\u2019</p><p>He laughs. \u2018Sassy lady?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, baby girl, sweet girl, lovely girl . . .\u2019 I realize my error immediately.</p><p>\u2018Who calls you sweet girl?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 I put the stoppers on his enquiry immediately, and I also put the stoppers on my trail of thought. \u2018The point is I\u2019m not a girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018All righty, then. Sassy lady it is.\u2019 He leans in and kisses my forehead. \u2018You\u2019ll never know how happy I am right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you\u2019re about to meet Benjamin?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Ben.\u2019 He nudges me with his hip. \u2018And no, not because of Ben. Because of you.\u2019</p><p>I look up at my treasured friend and smile. \u2018I\u2019m happy, too,\u2019 I reply thoughtfully.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>I have my first predicament in the short dress. Gregory slides from the cab with ease while I\u2019m deliberating the best way to exit without flashing my fancy black knickers. I hold the hem of my dress with both hands, but my clutch drops from under my arm.</p><p>\u2018Shit,\u2019 I curse, scooping it up.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t practise this part, did you?\u2019 Gregory teases, putting one hand out for my bag and his other for my hand. \u2018To the side. Step out to the side.\u2019</p><p>I hand over my bag and take his hand, following his instruction and lowering my right foot from the cab, finding it rather easy to exit without bending or giving any passers-by an eyeful. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As graceful as a swan.\u2019 He winks and tucks my bag under my arm. \u2018Ready?\u2019</p><p>I refuel on confidence by taking a long inhalation of air. \u2018Ready,\u2019 I confirm, looking up at the building, seeing blue lights climbing up the glass front and a red carpet stretched down the side, with piles and piles of people waiting to be granted access.</p><p>I\u2019m a little awestruck. Robin Thicke\u2019s \u2018Blurred Lines\u2019 is pouring from the open glass doors, blue lights are flashing inside, and doormen are keeping guard, marking clipboards before letting people in.</p><p>My hand is grasped and I\u2019m pulled towards the front of the queue. I don\u2019t miss the filthy looks being thrown in our direction by the waiting clientele. \u2018Gregory, there\u2019s a line,\u2019 I whisper loudly, just as we land in front of a doorman holding a clipboard.</p><p>\u2018Greg Macy and Olivia Taylor, guests of Ben White,\u2019 Gregory states confidently, while I\u2019m wincing under the fierce, stabbing eyes of the queue haters.</p><p>The doorman flicks the pages and glides down the list of names, eventually grunting and unhooking the thick rope linking two metal posts together. \u2018Champagne bar\u2019s on the first floor at the back to your left. Mr White is in the VIP area there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Gregory nods, pulling me forward and pushing me gently through the door. \u2018VIP area,\u2019 he whispers in my ear. \u2018And you just called me Gregory, sassy lady.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019 I glance around, seeing various levels, all accessed by frosted-glass stairs with illuminated blue lights guiding the way. Well-dressed people are everywhere, draped over the glass balustrades, not a pint of beer or a bottle in sight . . . except champagne. Behind all of the bars \u2013 three I\u2019ve seen so far \u2013 are stacks and stacks of champagne bottles. I\u2019ve never tasted the stuff, but it looks like I might do soon.</p><p>\u2018This way.\u2019 Gregory escorts me up the glass steps, and the practical side of me can\u2019t help considering the damage that could be done if someone was to fall down them. My heels chink sweetly, though, and I look down and admire them, smiling and finding my butt swaying a little more. \u2018Are you strutting?\u2019 Gregory giggles and smacks my backside. \u2018Work it, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>I turn and scowl around my grin. \u2018Sassy,\u2019 I say, sticking my nose in the air, making my friend break out into a proper laugh.</p><p>\u2018You most certainly are.\u2019</p><p>We reach the top of the stairs and head left as directed, reaching the champagne bar, which is ironic because all I saw at the other bars was champagne, too, making all of the bars champagne bars. \u2018What would you like?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Coke,\u2019 I say casually, looking around to avoid meeting my friend\u2019s outraged eyes.</p><p>He scoffs, but doesn\u2019t retaliate, instead leaning over the bar and ordering two glasses of champagne. The club is crammed full already, and there were at least a few hundred people in the line outside. Gregory wasn\u2019t kidding when he said it was dead plush, and the name reflects the ambience. If it wasn\u2019t so full with people generating heat, I think I\u2019d feel cold.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I take the glass being handed to me and waft it under my nose, taking a hit of a bitter smell. The strawberry floating on top takes my attention away from the aroma that\u2019s invading my nose and switches my mind to a place where I really don\u2019t want it to go.</p><p>Strawberries \u2013 British, for the sweetness.</p><p>Chocolate \u2013 at least eighty per cent cocoa, for the bitterness.</p><p>Champagne to round it off.</p><p>I jump, a little startled when Gregory nudges me. \u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 I bat the thoughts of sweet and bitter away, along with the thought of Miller\u2019s hot tongue, slow-moving mouth, and hard, warm body. \u2018Swanky place.\u2019 I raise my glass a little and take the plunge, sipping my first ever taste of champagne. \u2018Hmmm,\u2019 I hum as the cool, sparkling liquid slides down my throat like silk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I cannot believe you\u2019ve never tasted it.\u2019 Gregory shakes his head as he tips the glass to his lips. \u2018Heaven in a glass.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is,\u2019 I agree, swirling it in my hand. \u2018So he put you on the guest list, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t bite to my teasing. \u2018I\u2019m not queuing like cattle.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a snob.\u2019 I laugh. \u2018Can I eat this strawberry?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, but don\u2019t be plunging your fingers into the glass. Be a lady about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do I get it out, then?\u2019 I frown down at the narrow glass, wondering if my fingers will even fit in, but not daring to find out.</p><p>\u2018Tip it in.\u2019 Gregory demonstrates, tilting the flute to his lips and catching the strawberry in his mouth when it slides down the glass. \u2018Best to wait until you\u2019ve finished the champagne,\u2019 he adds as he munches through the fruit.</p><p>\u2018You have a big mouth.\u2019 I sip more, not prepared to hurry my way through. Not drinking for so long has undoubtedly made me a lightweight.</p><p>\u2018Oh, you have no idea, baby girl.\u2019</p> <p>My nose wrinkles in distaste. \u2018And I don\u2019t want to, Gregory,\u2019 I retort, earning myself a grin through a glare.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s Greg!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sassy lady!\u2019 I bump his thigh with my bum. \u2018Where\u2019s Benjamin, anyway?\u2019 I ask, intrigued by the man who\u2019s captured my Gregory so fully.</p><p>\u2018Ben is over there.\u2019 He points discreetly with his glass, and I follow, looking through the crowd and seeing too many men to even begin to work it out. \u2018Which one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018In the VIP area. Black suit, fair hair.\u2019</p><p>I flick my eyes over a crowd of men, all chatting in the closed-off section near to the bar, laughing and regularly slapping each other\u2019s backs. City boys. Then my eyes land on a well-built man. I can literally see his muscles bulging through his suit. I\u2019m surprised. He\u2019s not my best friend\u2019s usual taste, but again, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting one of Gregory\u2019s partners.</p> <p>\u2018He\u2019s . . . I try to figure out the right words to describe him. Colossal. Pumped. \u2018Large,\u2019 I finally settle on.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s a fitness freak.\u2019</p><p>I look up and see Gregory with a small smile on his face as he gazes over to Ben. \u2018So are you,\u2019 I point out. Gregory\u2019s physique isn\u2019t anything to be ashamed of, not in the least, but Ben\u2019s . . . well, he\u2019s a mammoth of a fine man, but not to the point of being unattractive. I can see the appeal.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m an amateur in the gym compared to Ben. We\u2019re talking every day, sassy lady.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you going to go over?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He almost laughs. \u2018I don\u2019t do the chasing, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you\u2019ve been on dates. He invited you and put you on the guest list.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, he\u2019s chasing.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Playing hard to get?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Treat them mean and all that.\u2019 He places his fingertip on the base of my glass and applies a little pressure. \u2018You\u2019ll get that strawberry now.\u2019</p><p>I look down and find I\u2019ve sipped my way through my first glass and I can, indeed, get to the strawberry. I tilt and sigh as I sink my teeth into the sweet fruit. \u2018Delicious.\u2019 Just like the ones . . .</p><p>\u2018Another?\u2019 He doesn\u2019t wait for my answer. He takes my hand and leads me to the bar, which is a giant plank of clear glass, displaying bottles of champagne on ice beneath. \u2018Two more.\u2019 He signals to the waiter, who swiftly presents Gregory with two full glasses, before our empties are taken and I\u2019m being led away.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you have to pay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Launch night. It\u2019s all free, but don\u2019t get too carried away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, he\u2019s spotted us.\u2019 Gregory starts to mildly fidget, and I look across the bar, finding Ben on his way over, smiling brightly. \u2018Remember, sassy lady. It\u2019s Greg.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 I say, keeping my eyes on Ben\u2019s big frame approaching.</p><p>\u2018Greg,\u2019 Ben says formally when he arrives. \u2018Glad you could make it.\u2019 He extends his hand and Gregory takes it, shaking firmly.</p><p>\u2018Good to see you,\u2019 my friend replies, dropping Ben\u2019s hand and shoving his in his pocket. \u2018This is Livy.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help my brow from wrinkling in confusion. \u2018Hi.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The famous Livy.\u2019 He leans in and kisses my cheek. \u2018Thank you for coming.\u2019 He pulls away, and I get my first proper look at him as I focus on his face and not his formal actions or bulked physique. He\u2019s handsome in a rugged kind of way.</p><p>\u2018Thank you for inviting me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem.\u2019 He slaps Gregory on the shoulder. \u2018I wish I could talk a bit more, mate, but there are a million people here to speak to. Maybe later?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Later.\u2019 Gregory nods.</p><p>\u2018Great.\u2019 Ben smiles warmly at me. \u2018Pleasure to meet you, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 I say quietly, flicking my eyes from one man to the other before watching Ben\u2019s back disappear into the crowd. \u2018He\u2019s not come out!\u2019 I swing my body towards Gregory. \u2018No one knows he\u2019s g*y!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shhhh,\u2019 Gregory hisses. \u2018He\u2019s waiting for the right time.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. Gregory has been upfront and honest about his sexuality ever since he came out in high school, and he\u2019s ridiculed those who haven\u2019t been true to themselves. \u2018These dates: you didn\u2019t go out at all, did you?\u2019</p><p>Gregory refuses to meet my eyes, his fidgeting becoming less mild. He looks downright uncomfortable. \u2018No,\u2019 he replies quietly.</p><p>My heart squeezes a little for my best friend. This is no different from a woman seeing a married man, who constantly assures her that he\u2019ll leave his wife for her. And my role tonight is suddenly too clear. What a shitbag! \u2018How old is he?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Twenty-seven.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long has he known himself?\u2019 I press, not liking what I\u2019m hearing.</p><p>\u2018He says he\u2019s always known.\u2019</p><p>Gregory\u2019s answer only cements it for me. If he\u2019s always known and he still hasn\u2019t revealed his true sexual status, then what makes Gregory think that he will now? I don\u2019t say that, though, because judging by the look on my friend\u2019s face, he\u2019s already asked himself that question. Gregory doesn\u2019t act camp or feel the need to display his sexual preference for all to see, but he\u2019s not ashamed of it, either. After spending just a minute with Ben, I can tell it\u2019s not the case for him, and when I look across the bar and see him making an over-the-top display of greeting a woman, my thoughts are only confirmed.</p><p>I glance back to Gregory and see that his line of sight is pointed that way too, and in an attempt to distract him, I ask for another drink by waving my empty glass under his nose.</p><p>\u2018More?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s going down very well.\u2019 I go to hand my glass over, but quickly notice the strawberry. \u2018Oh, wait.\u2019 I tilt and catch the fruit, then give up my glass.</p><p>While Gregory fetches more drinks, I wander over to the glass-panelled gallery and lean over, observing the masses of well-groomed men and chicly dressed women below. This place is an exclusive, high-end club and reserved only for London\u2019s elite. This should make me feel even more uncomfortable, but it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m just glad I came, because with Ben avoiding Gregory in public places, he would\u2019ve been floating around on his own like a plum.</p><p>\u2018Here.\u2019 A flute appears over my shoulder. \u2018What are you looking at?\u2019</p><p>\u2018All of these rich people.\u2019 I turn around and rest my bum against the glass. \u2018Is it a private club?\u2019</p><p>Gregory laughs. \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p><p>I hum my acknowledgement. \u2018And Ben organised the opening?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, he\u2019s renowned in his field.\u2019 He leans his elbows on a tall glass table close by. \u2018Don\u2019t you notice it?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>I look around. \u2018Notice what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The looks.\u2019 He nods to a group of men close by, all staring over at us, not bothering to hide their interest, even though I have male company. Gregory could be my boyfriend for all they know.</p><p>I turn my back on them and find Gregory still looking over at the group, but for a whole different reason. \u2018Stop gawking,\u2019 I say, taking another sip of champagne.</p><p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 His eyes land on me. \u2018Shall we go and explore?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, let\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on, then.\u2019 He straightens and places his palm in the small of my back to lead me.</p><p>On our way up a flight of glass stairs, I look down to the bottom floor and notice Ben has gone, and I wonder whether that\u2019s why we\u2019re on the move.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a garden bar,\u2019 Gregory tells me.</p><p>\u2018Then why are we going up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s on the roof.\u2019 He directs me to the left and up some more stairs, where a wall of glass comes into view, and beyond, London by night in all of its glory.</p><p>\u2018Oh wow!\u2019 I breathe. \u2018Look at that!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Impressive, eh?\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s more than impressive. \u2018Would you de-friend me if I took pictures?\u2019 I ask, ready to hand him my drink so I can riffle through my bag for my phone.</p><p>\u2018Yes, I would. Let\u2019s just do what everyone else is doing \u2013 drink and enjoy the view.\u2019</p><p>I feel cheated, wanting to snap away just in case my memory doesn\u2019t store an accurate image of what I\u2019m looking at. I\u2019m used to London, its architecture and its grandeur, but I\u2019ve never seen it looking quite like this. \u2018So how did you meet Ben?\u2019 I ask, tearing my eyes away from the stunning view. Gregory gestures around us with a how\u2019d-ya-think look all over his handsome face, and for the first time, I take in the garden where we\u2019ve landed. I gasp a little. \u2018You did this?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did.\u2019 His chest swells proudly. \u2018Designed it, created it, and finished it. It\u2019s my best project to date.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s incredible,\u2019 I muse, starting to absorb all of the little but significant details \u2013 the small touches that really bring it to life. The side walls are nothing more than compacted box plants, the tiny leaves lush and green, with ice-blue twinkle lights embedded in the shrubbery. And the topiary trees are all trimmed into neat circles with lights woven through the foliage. \u2018Is the grass real?\u2019 I ask, padding my feet and noticing my heels aren\u2019t sinking in.</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s imitation, but so authentic you\u2019d never know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is,\u2019 I agree. \u2018I love the furniture.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmmm. The theme was ice, as you\u2019ve probably gathered. I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I was going to create a lush, functional outside space on that brief, but I\u2019m pretty pleased.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should be.\u2019 I reach up and kiss his cheek. \u2018It\u2019s fabulous, just like you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018You\u2019re making me blush.\u2019</p><p>I giggle with him, and then cast my eyes over to take another hit of the outlook, but my eyes don\u2019t make it to the open air and view beyond because they find Ben first. And they find him stuck to a woman\u2019s mouth. I wince and quickly try to work out my best move, but I can think of nothing except downing my fresh drink and shoving it in Gregory\u2019s face.</p><p>\u2018Another?\u2019 he asks incredulously. \u2018Calm down, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I assure him, taking his elbow, but he doesn\u2019t shift, and as I glance up, I see that he\u2019s found what I\u2019m trying to get him away from. \u2018Greg?\u2019 His eyes slowly fall to mine, and I see too much misery to take the softly-softly approach, so I tug at him until he\u2019s forced to move. \u2018Let\u2019s get a drink.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes, let\u2019s.\u2019 He grinds the words out, shifting his arms from my grip and taking my hand.</p><p>I\u2019m led with purpose back down the two flights of stairs and to the bar where Gregory orders two champagnes. In the short time that we\u2019ve been away, the atmosphere has cranked up a few notches and people are starting to move to the round dance floor, drinks in hand. The music seems louder, too, and there\u2019s definitely a shift in the reserved environment as the champagne flows freely \u2013 and for free \u2013 and Daft Punk, featuring Pharrell Williams, pumps through the speakers.</p><p>\u2018Drink up.\u2019 Gregory doesn\u2019t pass me just a flute this time. It\u2019s a shot, and my eyes dart to his. \u2018Come on,\u2019 he pleads.</p><p>My reluctance is clear. I\u2019ve had a few glasses of champagne and I feel okay, but that shouldn\u2019t be a green light to start throwing shots down my neck. \u2018Greg . . .\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Come on. I won\u2019t let anything happen, Livy,\u2019 he assures me, and stupidly or not, I take the glass and knock it with his before tipping the contents down my throat. The burn is instant and so is the reminder of all the times I\u2019ve drunk before.</p><p>I gasp and slam my shot glass down before taking the flute and downing the more pleasant champagne. \u2018That was nasty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was tequila, but you forgot the salt and lemon.\u2019 He holds up a salt shaker and a wedge of fresh lemon before carrying out the practice the right way, licking the back of his hand, sprinkling the salt, licking again, downing the liquid, and sinking his teeth into the wedge. \u2018It\u2019s much better this way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should\u2019ve stopped me,\u2019 I complain, struggling to rid my mouth of the rancid taste.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t give me a chance,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018Let\u2019s do another.\u2019 He orders another and this time I see through the sequence correctly, following Greg\u2019s lead.</p> <p>I shudder at the lingering flavour, but then I\u2019m shuddering for a whole other reason when a familiar beat takes over the current track. I instantly look to see Gregory\u2019s wide, delighted eyes.</p><p>\u2018Carte Blanche,\u2019 I whisper, my mind bombarded with memories of Gregory creating a disco in my bedroom all of the times I refused to go to an actual club.</p><p>\u2018How apt,\u2019 Gregory confirms, a grin spreading across his face. \u2018\u201cVeracocha\u201d! Our tune, baby girl!\u2019 We both down another champagne before my hand is grasped and I\u2019m being dragged to the floor. I don\u2019t object. I wouldn\u2019t. Gregory\u2019s smiling, and after what has just transpired, this is a good thing.</p><p>He pushes us through the crowd until we\u2019re joining the flurry of other dancers who all appreciate the classic anthem as much as we do. Strobe lighting darts around us, flitting across the faces of people and intensifying my feel-good mood. We both slip into the groove, hands in the air, bodies swaying, twisting and twirling each other around the floor, laughing as we do. It\u2019s a novelty and a good one. I\u2019m having fun.</p><p>Gregory pulls me into his chest and puts his mouth to my ear so I can hear him over the music and cheering. \u2018I\u2019m giving it three minutes for a bloke to move in on you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m dancing with a man,\u2019 I laugh. \u2018He\u2019d have to be pretty cocksure.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Give me a break,\u2019 he scoffs. \u2018We\u2019re clearly not dating.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m about to disagree, but I see Ben approaching behind Gregory, smiling and greeting people as he passes through the dance-floor crowd. I want to drag my friend away, but I\u2019m also curious how this will play out. Ben doesn\u2019t know that we saw him, and I\u2019m wondering how Gregory will handle it. Breaking away from him, I move back, ensuring I keep my smile and Gregory\u2019s attention.</p><p>As Ben nears, I watch him studying Gregory\u2019s body discreetly, still greeting people, still smiling. There\u2019s no mistaking the intended body contact as he passes my friend, his arm sliding around his waist in a subtle gesture made to look like he\u2019s trying to pass without bumping into him, but the look on Ben\u2019s face is screaming desire and the sudden shift in Gregory from easy, fluid movements to stiff awkwardness is obvious. Will he push him away or give him a dirty look?</p><p>No. He loosens up immediately when he sees Ben and falls right back into his previous ease as the tracks slows momentarily before dramatically cranking up ten gears and blasting the clubbers into complete elation. We\u2019re in a triangle, both Ben and Gregory smiling and dancing, but the sexual sparks flying off each man is tangible. They\u2019re not touching, nor are they looking at each other all lusty, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s obvious. Ben is playing it risky.</p><p>Gregory moves towards me, smiling. \u2018There\u2019s a man about to take hold of you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is there?\u2019 I go to turn, but I\u2019m stopped when Gregory grabs my shoulders.</p><p>\u2018Trust me on this. Let him.\u2019 He fans his face and releases me, and I tense from top to toe, bracing myself. Gregory has great taste in men, but shouldn\u2019t I at least get a say in who takes hold of me? Or should I just let this happen \u2013 stay in control, but let it happen?</p><p>It\u2019s his h*ps I feel first, pushing into my lower back. Then there\u2019s his hand sliding around my stomach. My moves fall straight into his set pace without thought, and my hand rests over his on my navel. Gregory is smiling brightly, but I have no compulsion to turn and get a glimpse of my dance partner because \u2013 probably due to the alcohol \u2013 he feels good . . . comfortable . . . right.</p> <p>My eyes close when I feel hot breath at my ear. \u2018Sweet girl, you\u2019ve floored me.\u2019</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>I\u2019m very suddenly aware of internal sparks firing off wildly. I gasp, my eyes flying open, and I try to turn, getting absolutely nowhere. His groin pushes into my lower back, his grip of my waist firming up, as is what\u2019s beneath his trousers. I\u2019ve been thrown into panic, all the feelings that he provokes attacking me relentlessly.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t try to escape me,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018I won\u2019t let it happen this time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller, let me go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Over my dead body.\u2019 He sweeps my hair to one side and wastes no time getting his lips on my neck, injecting fire through my flesh, straight into my bloodstream. \u2018Your dress is very short.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And?\u2019 I breathe, digging my fingernails into his arm.</p><p>\u2018And I like it.\u2019 His hand slides over my hip, onto my bum and down to the hem of my dress. \u2018Because it means I can do this.\u2019 He kisses my neck, skating his hand under my dress and pushing his finger past the seam of my knickers. My bottom flies back on a small cry, colliding with his groin. He bites my neck. \u2018You\u2019re drenched.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it,\u2019 I beg, feeling all rationality running away from me under his touch.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, stop it, stop it, stop, it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No . . . he breathes. \u2018No . . . He circles his groin confidently. \u2018No, Livy.\u2019</p><p>His finger enters me and my face distorts with a mixture of pleasure and desperation, my internal muscles grabbing onto him. My head is drifting to one side, letting him at me, and the fingers of my hand resting over his are squeezing hard, prompting his palm to shift and his fingers to lace through mine, constricting firmly. I know I\u2019m falling, and through my desperate desire I look for Gregory for help. But he\u2019s gone.</p><p>And so is Ben.</p><p>Fury flames, Gregory\u2019s promise to not let anything happen only stoking it further. He\u2019s let something happen, and he\u2019s let it happen with the worst man. I struggle in Miller\u2019s hold until he\u2019s left little option but to release me or manhandle me to the floor, and I swing around, my hair whipping my face. I glare at him, ignoring his impossible beauty. He\u2019s in his usual finery, minus the jacket, and the sleeves of his shirt are rolled up in the most casual, unlike-Miller fashion. His waistcoat is still buttoned, though, and his hair is a stunning mop of waves. His piercing blue eyes are stabbing at my flesh accusingly.</p><p>\u2018I said no,\u2019 I say through gritted teeth. \u2018Not now, not for four hours, not ever.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll see,\u2019 he retorts confidently, stepping forward. \u2018You might be repeatedly saying the word no, Olivia Taylor. But this . . .\u2019 he runs his fingertip over my breast and onto my stomach, forcing me to gulp down air to control my shakes, \u2018this is always telling me yes.\u2019</p><p>My legs are in motion before my brain sends any instruction, which quickly makes me conclude that this is natural instinct. Escape. Get away before I lose my mind and my integrity and let him cast me aside again. I find myself at the bar before I\u2019ve even registered what direction I\u2019m headed in. I order a drink, quickly taking it from the barman\u2019s hand and turning as I take a swig.</p><p>Miller is standing right in front of me. His jaw is tense as he nods over my shoulder to the barman. Then, as if by magic, a tumbler is passed over my shoulder into Miller\u2019s waiting hand. My gaze falls to his lips as he takes a slow sip while he watches me, as if he knows what that mouth does to me. I\u2019m mesmerised by it. Totally rapt. Then he licks his lips and not knowing what else to do, but knowing that I\u2019m likely to kiss him if I remain here, I run again, this time up the stairs and around the galleried walkway, looking through the glass for any sign of Gregory. I need to find him, the stupid pain in the arse that he is.</p><p>I\u2019m so busy looking for my friend in the space below I don\u2019t notice where I\u2019m going and walk straight into a body. The sharp angles of the chest under the shirt and waistcoat are too familiar. \u2018Livy, what are you doing?\u2019 he asks, almost tiredly, like I\u2019m fighting a losing battle. I fear I might be.</p><p>\u2018Trying to get away from you,\u2019 I say calmly, making his jaw tense in annoyance. \u2018Please move.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, Livy.\u2019 He mouths the words extra slowly, making it impossible to rip my eyes away from his lips. \u2018How much have you had to drink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s none of your business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s my business when you\u2019re drinking in my club.\u2019</p><p>My mouth falls open, but he maintains his straight, unhappy expression. \u2018This is your bar?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and it\u2019s part of my responsibility to ensure my clients are . . . behaving.\u2019 He moves in again. \u2018You\u2019re not behaving, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Throw me out, then.\u2019 I challenge him. \u2018Have me escorted from the premises. I don\u2019t f**king care.\u2019</p><p>His eyes narrow fiercely. \u2018The only place you\u2019re being thrown is in my f**king bed.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s me who moves in now, getting my face up close to his, like I\u2019m going to kiss him. It takes every effort not to connect our mouths, like I\u2019m fighting a powerful magnet hauling me in. He\u2019s thinking that, too. His lips have parted, and he\u2019s looking down at me, his eyes full of desire. \u2018Go to hell,\u2019 I say evenly and calmly, almost on a murmur.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by my own coolness, not that I let it be known. I meet his shocked eyes with confidence, not backing down, and take another slow, long glug of my drink. But it\u2019s quickly snatched from my hand. \u2018I think you\u2019ve had enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you\u2019re right. I have had enough. Of you!\u2019 I turn on my stilettos and walk away, on a mission to find Gregory, rescue him from a stupid situation, and leave to escape my own diabolical position.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 he calls after me.</p><p>I blank him, walking on, venturing down some stairs, around a few corners, into the toilets, and the whole time he\u2019s tailing me, just following me as I pace calmly around his club.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he shouts over the music. \u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>I ignore him, thinking of where else I can possibly look. I\u2019ve been everywhere, except . . .</p><p>I don\u2019t even think about what I\u2019m doing when I viciously yank the door of the disabled toilet open. Not until I hear the sound of the metal lock hitting the tiled floor and I\u2019m standing staring at Gregory bent over the sink with his jeans around his ankles. Ben, who has a firm hold of my friend\u2019s hips, is pounding forward on constant barks. Neither one seems to have noticed me, nor the rise in noise level, both men utterly consumed in each other. My hand flies to my mouth in shock and I walk back, meeting Miller\u2019s chest, but he pushes me in and slams the door behind us, snapping Ben and Gregory from their private euphoria. It\u2019s not private now, and both men seem to pull themselves together, fear, embarrassment, shame, discomfiture all taking hold, with each of them rushing to make themselves decent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn to Miller. \u2018We should go,\u2019 I prompt, pushing my hands into his chest. \u2018Miller.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s just staring at Gregory and Ben, brows heavy, lips straight. \u2018I have a cheque for your work on the roof terrace in my office, Greg.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mr Hart.\u2019 Gregory nods, his face flushing.</p><p>\u2018And I have one for you, too.\u2019 Miller looks to Ben, who\u2019s clearly mortified. I feel for them both, and I hate Miller for making them feel so small. \u2018I would kindly ask you not to use the washrooms of my club as a knocking shop. This is a private, exclusive establishment. Your respect would be greatly appreciated.\u2019</p> <p>I nearly choke. Respect? He\u2019s just had his hand up my dress in the middle of the dance floor. I need to leave before I gun for one of these three men. I have a grievance with them all. I let myself out, shocked by so many things in such a short space of time. My head is swimming with alcohol, the feeling of losing control beginning to worry me.</p><p>As I stagger down the corridor, I see a man approaching, his roving eye trailing lustfully up and down my body. I know that look. And I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s smarmy. He brushes past me and smirks. \u2018I\u2019ve been watching you,\u2019 he purrs, eyes burning with want.</p><p>I should continue walking, but flashbacks have halted my movements, my brain not prepared to home in on any instructions to make me walk away and is instead making me see things stored at the back of my mind that I\u2019ve hidden for many years.</p><p>He growls and pushes me into the wall. I freeze. Nothing will work. Then he smashes his lips to mine and the bad memories multiply, but before I have a chance to find the mental and physical strength to fight him off, he\u2019s absent and I\u2019m left heaving, propped up against the wall, watching Miller physically restrain the struggling man.</p><p>\u2018What the f**k?\u2019 the guy yells. \u2018Get the f**k off me!\u2019</p> <p>Miller calmly removes his iPhone from his pocket and presses just one button. \u2018Outer on floor one. Toilets.\u2019</p><p>The guy continues to struggle, but he\u2019s held firmly in place with little effort from Miller, who\u2019s staring at me, his face completely impassive. But he\u2019s mad. I can see it in the steely gloss of his blue eyes. There\u2019s rage \u2013 hot rage, and I\u2019m not at all comfortable seeing it. I start an unsteady walk away, moving to the side of the corridor when two huge doormen come barrelling towards me. I glance over my shoulder to weigh up my situation and see them take over Miller\u2019s hold of the guy, leaving Miller to straighten his shirt and waistcoat before his eyes lift and find mine. He\u2019s fuming, a telling sweat shimmering on his brow. He starts to shake his head slowly as he strides forward, his hair now falling onto his forehead from his exertion. I know I won\u2019t get far, but I\u2019ll make it to the bar. I need another drink, so I hurry, quickly reaching my intended destination and ordering a champagne, necking it before the empty is snatched from my grasp and his hand is locked on my nape, leading me away, my feet moving fast to keep up with his long strides behind me.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not getting your four hours!\u2019 I shout desperately.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t f**king want them,\u2019 he growls, roughly pushing me on. The declaration pricks at my chest repeatedly.</p><p>Many people nod, smile, and speak to Miller as he pushes me through the bar, but he doesn\u2019t stop for anyone, not even acknowledging them. I can\u2019t see his face to confirm it, but the wary looks on all of the faces we pass tell me all I need to know. His grip of my neck is tight over my hair, and he makes no attempt to ease up, even though he must be aware of the pressure of it. We\u2019re heading for the entrance of the bar, the glow of big glass doors coming into view with people still lining up to gain entry.</p><p>Something catches my eye and I do a double-take, spotting Miller\u2019s business associate. She\u2019s staring open-mouthed at Miller manhandling me, her drink at her lips ready to sip, clearly shocked by what she\u2019s witnessing. Even through my tipsiness, I manage for the first time to wonder what Miller is telling her about me.</p> <p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 I hear Gregory from behind and try to turn, to no avail.</p><p>\u2018Keep walking,\u2019 he orders.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>Miller halts and swings around, taking me with him. \u2018She\u2019s coming with me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 Gregory shakes his head, moving forward, looking at me. \u2018Coffee-hater?\u2019 he asks and I nod, making Gregory\u2019s face flame with guilt. He fed me to the lion, and then skulked off to have his later with Ben.</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I answer, confirming he is exactly who Gregory thinks, but wondering how he didn\u2019t know that already if he\u2019s been working for him.</p><p>\u2018You can stay and have a drink,\u2019 Miller says calmly, \u2018or I can have you removed from my club \u2013 your choice.\u2019 Miller\u2019s words, although calm, are threatening, but I have no doubt that he\u2019ll follow through on his threat.</p><p>\u2018If I\u2019m leaving, then Livy\u2019s coming with me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Wrong.\u2019 Miller fires back simply and confidently. \u2018Your lover will probably ask you to do the sensible thing and let me take her.\u2019 He\u2019s playing dirty.</p><p>Ben appears from behind Gregory, his face washed out and full of apprehension. \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 he asks Miller.</p><p>\u2018That depends on whether you make a big deal of this. I\u2019m going to my office with Olivia, and you two are going back to the bar to enjoy a drink on me.\u2019</p><p>Gregory and Ben both flick cautious eyes to me and Miller, both clearly in turmoil. It makes me speak up.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay,\u2019 I say quietly. \u2018Go have a drink.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 Gregory steps forward. \u2018Not after what you\u2019ve told me, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay,\u2019 I repeat slowly, before looking up at Miller in a silent indication to lead on. His grip eases instantly, his anger receding, and his fingers start kneading my flesh, working some life back into the stiffness.</p><p>\u2018Miller?\u2019</p><p>I cast my eyes to the left and see the woman. She\u2019s followed us and her cherry-red, pursed lips tell me she recognises me despite the makeover. Then I look up to Miller. He looks totally detached as he stares at her. This is awkward, the tension ricocheting between all five of us tangible, and for very different reasons. I feel like an interloper, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from letting Miller guide me away from the awful scene.</p><p>He\u2019s silent as he leads me down some stairs and through a maze of corridors until we\u2019re at a door, where he curses while bashing in a code on the metal keypad before pushing his way through. I expect to be released after he\u2019s kicked it shut, but he doesn\u2019t let up, instead directing me to a big white desk and spinning me around. He pushes me onto my back, pulls my thighs apart and lays himself all over me, grabbing my cheeks in his hands and forcing his lips to mine, his tongue pushing past and starting an impossibly smooth rotation in my mouth. I want to ask him what the hell he\u2019s doing, but I know I\u2019m going to savour this. I won\u2019t, however, savour the heated words that I know will be exchanged following this kiss, so I accept it. I accept him. With this kiss, I\u2019m accepting everything that he has done tonight and before that, when he\u2019s played with my heart \u2013 filled it, and then quickly drained it again, leaving it a mass of aching muscle in my chest.</p><p>He moans, and my hands skate their way up his back until they\u2019re resting on the back of his head, pushing him in closer to me. \u2018I\u2019m not letting you do this to me again,\u2019 I mumble weakly around his lips.</p><p>His mouth working mine doesn\u2019t let up, and I don\u2019t try to stop him, despite my words. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of letting me, Livy.\u2019 He pushes his groin into my core, putting more friction on my pulsing flesh. I whimper, searching for the willpower to stop this. \u2018This is happening.\u2019 He bites my lip and sucks it, pulling back and looking down at me. He moves my hair from my face. \u2018We\u2019ve already accepted this. It can\u2019t be stopped.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can stop it, just like you have plenty of times,\u2019 I breathe on a whisper. \u2018I should stop it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you shouldn\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you, and I should never have stopped it either.\u2019 His eyes run over my face and he dips, kissing me tenderly. \u2018What has happened to you, my sweet girl?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You,\u2019 I accuse. \u2018You\u2019ve happened to me.\u2019 He\u2019s made me reckless and irrational. He may make me feel alive, but he makes me feel lifeless just as quickly. I\u2019m playing the devil\u2019s advocate with this man disguised as a gentleman, and I hate myself for not being stronger, for not stopping it. How many times can I do this to myself, and how many times will he do this to me?</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like this.\u2019 He pulls my hand from his back and looks down at my red nail polish. \u2018And I don\u2019t like this.\u2019 He drags his thumb over my red lips as he watches me. \u2018I want my Livy back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your Livy?\u2019 My brain engages fast, my heartbeat quickening. He wants the old Livy back so he can walk all over her again. Is that it? \u2018I\u2019m not yours.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wrong. You are very much mine.\u2019 He pushes himself up and clasps my hand, pulling me up to a sitting position. \u2018I\u2019m leaving this office to tell your friend that you\u2019re coming home with me. He\u2019s going to want to speak to you, so you\u2019ll answer your phone when he calls.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m coming?\u2019 I slip off the desk, and he immediately places me back on it.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He points over my shoulder. \u2018You\u2019re going into that bathroom, and you\u2019re going to remove that shit from your face.\u2019</p><p>I recoil, but he\u2019s not perturbed. \u2018Are you going to go out there and tell that woman that I\u2019m going home with you?\u2019 I grate, anger bubbling as he watches me closely.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he answers simply and swiftly. Just yes? I have nothing to say to that, drunkenness blocking all rational thinking, and when he\u2019s finished studying my dumbstruck face he walks out, shutting the door behind him. I know I hear a lock click into place, so I jump down from his desk and run over to the door, jiggling the handle, fully aware that I\u2019m wasting my time. He\u2019s locked me in.</p><p>I don\u2019t go to the bathroom; I go to the glass drinks cabinet, seeing some champagne on ice and two used glasses, neatly placed at just the right angle. That\u2019s Miller\u2019s doing, but the rim of one glass caked in cherry-red lipstick isn\u2019t. I start to shake with fury and grab a glass, pouring in some champagne and downing it before refilling my glass and tipping that down quickly, too. I\u2019m drunk enough, I don\u2019t need this, but control is slipping rapidly away.</p><p>Just as Miller promised, my phone starts bleeping from my bag and I retrieve it from the desk, fishing around and finding Gregory\u2019s name on the screen. \u2018Hello.\u2019 I try to sound cool and collected, when I want to scream down the phone, vent and lash out.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re leaving with him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019 I don\u2019t need to be worrying him further, and I definitely won\u2019t be leaving with Miller. \u2018You didn\u2019t know his name?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he sighs. \u2018Just Mr Hart, uptight f**ker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You told me to let him take me on the dance floor!\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s because he\u2019s f**king hot!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or so you could have your later with Ben?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A little dance, that\u2019s all. I wouldn\u2019t have let it go further.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You did!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have no excuse,\u2019 he mumbles. \u2018I\u2019m pissed off, but regardless of that, it\u2019s a moot f**king point now, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s the f**king coffee-hater and you\u2019re already in love with the jumped-up twat!\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not a twat!\u2019 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. I can think of far harsher words to use and Miller would be all of them right now.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like this,\u2019 Gregory grunts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I didn\u2019t like what I was subjected to earlier, either, Gregory.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s silence down the line for a few moments before he speaks. \u2018Sassy,\u2019 he retorts sullenly. \u2018Please hold on to that if you\u2019re giving him more of your time, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will,\u2019 I assure him. \u2018I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll call you. Is Ben okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, he\u2019s still not got his colour back.\u2019 He laughs, lightening the mood. \u2018He\u2019ll live.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Okay. I\u2019ll speak to you tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You will,\u2019 he confirms. \u2018Be careful.\u2019</p><p>I exhale deeply and hang up, slumping my arse on the edge of Miller\u2019s desk, where there\u2019s no paperwork, pen, computer or stationery, just a cordless phone set precisely to the side. His chair is tucked under, perfectly straight, and as I gaze around the whole room, the preciseness of everything registers. It\u2019s just like his home. Everything has a place.</p><p>Except me.</p><p>He owns a nightclub?</p> <p>My head snaps up when the mechanism on the door sounds and he\u2019s back, looking satisfied, until he sees my face. \u2018I asked you to do something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will you force me if I don\u2019t?\u2019 I challenge, the alcohol injecting some bravery into me.</p><p>He seems confused by my question. \u2018I would never force you to do anything I know you don\u2019t want to, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You forced me down here,\u2019 I point out.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t force you. You could\u2019ve battled with me or struggled from my hold if you\u2019d really wanted to.\u2019 He runs his hand through his hair and takes a deep breath, then brings himself to me and pushes my thighs open, standing between them. His finger slides under my chin and pulls my face to his, but he\u2019s a little blurred. I squint, frustrated that I can\u2019t fully appreciate his features. \u2018You\u2019re drunk,\u2019 he says softly.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s your fault.\u2019 I\u2019m beginning to slur.</p> <p>\u2018Then I apologise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you tell your girlfriend about me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s not my damn girlfriend, Livy. But yes, I told her about you.\u2019</p><p>The thought thrills me, but if he\u2019s felt the need to tell her, then there\u2019s more to it than business.</p><p>\u2018Is she an ex?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck, no!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why the need to tell her about me, then? What business is it of hers?\u2019</p><p>\u2018None!\u2019 He\u2019s exasperated. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s quite satisfying to see something more than a straight face and clipped tone.</p> <p>\u2018Why do you keep doing this?\u2019 I ask, pulling away. \u2018You\u2019re tender, sweet and affectionate, then hard and cruel.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not ha\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you are,\u2019 I interrupt him, and I don\u2019t care if I get chastised for my lack of manners. It wasn\u2019t very polite of him to manhandle me down here, but he still did it, and he\u2019s right, I could\u2019ve tried harder to stop him. But I didn\u2019t. \u2018Are you finally going to f**k me?\u2019 I ask, barefaced and completely even.</p><p>He recoils, repulsion plaguing his face. \u2018You\u2019re drunk,\u2019 he hisses. \u2018I\u2019m not doing anything to you when you\u2019re drunk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He pushes his face to mine, his jaw ticking. \u2018Because I\u2019ll never do anything less than worship you, that is why.\u2019 Taking a moment to calm down, his eyes close briefly and reopen lazily. He hits me with a determined gaze. \u2018I\u2019ll never be a drunken fumble, Olivia. Every time I take you, you\u2019ll remember it. Each and every moment will be etched on that beautiful mind of yours for ever.\u2019 He gently taps my temple. \u2018Every kiss. Every touch. Every word.\u2019</p><p>My heart rate accelerates. It\u2019s too late, but I say it anyway. \u2018I don\u2019t want it to be that way.\u2019 He\u2019s already got a permanent residence in my mind.</p><p>\u2018Tough luck, because that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t have to be,\u2019 I goad, wondering where these confident words and tones are coming from and if I really mean them.</p><p>\u2018Yes, it does. It has to be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I\u2019m beginning to sway a little, and he notices because he takes my arm to steady me. \u2018I\u2019m fine!\u2019 I slur insolently. \u2018And you haven\u2019t answered my question.\u2019</p><p>He clenches his eyes shut, and then slowly opens them, blasting me back with blue puddles of sincerity. \u2018Because that is how it is for me.\u2019</p><p>I swallow, hoping my drunkenness isn\u2019t making me hear things. I have no reply, not now, perhaps not even when I\u2019m sober. \u2018You want me.\u2019 My drunken mind still wants him to say the words.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and makes a point of burning through my eyes with his gaze. \u2018I. Want. You,\u2019 he confirms slowly . . . clearly. \u2018Give me my thing.\u2019</p><p>I throw my arms around his neck and pull him in, giving him his thing.</p><p>A cuddle.</p><p>My heart is free-falling.</p><p>He holds me for the longest time, stroking my back and combing my hair with his fingers. I could fall asleep. He\u2019s sighing repeatedly into my neck, constantly kissing me and squeezing me to him.</p><p>\u2018Can I take you back to my bed?\u2019 he asks quietly.</p><p>\u2018For four hours?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think you know that I want a lot longer than four hours, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He surrenders his thing and palms my bum, sliding me from his desk and up to his body. \u2018I wish you had never covered your face.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s make-up. It doesn\u2019t cover, it enhances.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a pure, natural beauty, sweet girl.\u2019 He turns and starts for the door, but detours to the drinks cabinet to rearrange the champagne flutes first. \u2018I\u2019d like it to stay that way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You want me to be timid and merciful.\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head lightly and opens the door to his office, setting me on my feet and taking his signature hold of my nape. \u2018No, I just don\u2019t want you behaving so recklessly and giving those lips to another man to taste.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to.\u2019 I stagger, prompting Miller to grab my upper arm to steady me.</p><p>\u2018You need to be more careful,\u2019 he warns, and he\u2019s right. I realise that, even through my drunkenness. So I prevent my drunken insolence from resurfacing.</p><p>As we walk down the corridor and back up the stairs to the main club, I feel my stupid drinking binge really take hold. People are a wish-wash of blurred, slowed movements and the loud music is a bombardment of pain on my ears. I wobble on my heels, feeling Miller look down at me.</p><p>\u2018Livy, are you okay?\u2019</p><p>I nod, my head not quite doing what I\u2019m telling it to, making my movement more of a limp roll on my neck. Then I bump into a wall. \u2018I feel . . . My mouth is suddenly producing far too much saliva, my stomach turning violently.</p><p>\u2018Oh shit, Livy!\u2019 He scoops me up and charges for his office again, but he\u2019s not quick enough. I throw up all over the corridor . . . and Miller. \u2018Bollocks!\u2019 he curses.</p><p>I retch some more as he gets me into his office. \u2018I feel sick,\u2019 I mumble.</p><p>\u2018What the hell have you had?\u2019 he asks, negotiating my floppy body onto the toilet in his bathroom.</p><p>\u2018Tequila,\u2019 I giggle. \u2018But not properly. I forgot the salt and lemon so we had to do it again. Oh!\u2019 I slip from the toilet seat and land on my backside. \u2018Ouch!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, for crying out loud,\u2019 he grumbles, picking me up and holding me in place, my head lolling while he tries to remove his sick-splattered waistcoat and shirt. \u2018Livy, how many shots did you have?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Two,\u2019 I answer, my bottom dropping to meet the toilet seat again. \u2018And I helped myself to more champagne,\u2019 I slur, \u2018but I didn\u2019t use the glass with cherry-red lipstick on. She wants an association in more than business, you stupid man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s got into you?\u2019</p><p>I pull my heavy head up and try to focus, finding a bare, smooth, masterpiece of a chest at eye level. \u2018You, Miller Hart.\u2019 I rest my hands on his pecs and take my time caressing him. I might be stinking drunk, but I can still appreciate what I\u2019m feeling, and it feels good. \u2018You\u2019ve got into me.\u2019 I lift my eyes with some effort, finding his are dropped, watching me feeling him. \u2018You\u2019ve worked your way into me and I can\u2019t shake you out.\u2019</p><p>He slowly crouches in front of me and strokes my cheek before sliding his hand around the back of my neck and pulling my face close to his. \u2018I wish you weren\u2019t so pissed right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So do I,\u2019 I admit. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll handle him in a drunken stupor. And I wouldn\u2019t want to. I want to remember every intimate moment, even this one. \u2018If I forget the look on your face right now, or the words you said to me on your desk, promise me you\u2019ll remind me.\u2019</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>\u2018And that!\u2019 I blurt. \u2018Promise me you\u2019ll smile at me like that the next time I see you.\u2019 His smiles are rare and beautiful, and I hate him for giving me one now, when I\u2019m not likely to remember.</p><p>He groans, and I think he closes his eyes. Or did I close mine? I\u2019m not even sure. \u2018Olivia Taylor, when you wake up in the morning, I\u2019m going to be catching up on what you\u2019ve deprived me of this evening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve deprived yourself,\u2019 I retort. \u2018But remind me first,\u2019 I mumble as he pulls me in for his thing. \u2018Smile at me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia Taylor, if I have you, then I\u2019ll be smiling for the rest of my life.\u2019</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>My brain feels warped, and in my darkness I wonder what year it is. It may have been a long time, but I know exactly how I\u2019m going to feel when I open my eyes. My mouth is dry, my body clammy, and the dull thump in my head is likely to transform into a full-on carnival of relentless bongo drums when I lift my head from the pillow.</p><p>Deciding my best option is more sleep, I roll over to find a cool spot and burrow back down into my pillow, sighing happily at my new, comfortable position. The sweet sound of a low, peaceful hum is soothing and distinguishable.</p><p>Miller.</p><p>I don\u2019t bolt upright because my body won\u2019t allow it, but I do open my lids, discovering shockingly blue smiling eyes. I frown and drop my eyes to his mouth. Yes, he\u2019s smiling, and it\u2019s like sunlight bashing its way through grey clouds and making everything just perfect. Bright. Real. But what\u2019s he so delighted about, and how did I end up here?</p><p>\u2018Have I done something funny?\u2019 I croak. My throat is rough and parched.</p><p>\u2018No, not funny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why are you smiling so hard?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you made me promise that I would,\u2019 he says, planting a light kiss on my nose. \u2018If I ever make you a promise, Livy, I\u2019ll keep it.\u2019 He pulls me over to his side of the bed and goes about giving me his thing, positioning me beneath him and squeezing me tightly, sinking his face into my neck. \u2018I\u2019ll never do anything less than worship you,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018I\u2019m never going to be a drunken fumble, Livy. Every time I take you, you\u2019ll remember it. Each and every moment will be etched on that beautiful mind of yours for ever.\u2019 He kisses my neck sweetly and squeezes a little tighter. \u2018Every kiss. Every touch. Every word. Because that\u2019s how it is for me.\u2019</p><p>My breath catches in the back of my throat, his words sending a deep warmth to my very centre, pure happiness shining through my fuzziness. But my eyebrows meet in the middle. I feel like he\u2019s privy to a one-way, secret conversation.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a good job I keep my promises.\u2019 He emerges and studies my face closely. \u2018You disappointed me last night.\u2019</p><p>His light accusation stimulates a blurry memory of me . . . and another man . . . and lots of alcohol. \u2018It was your fault,\u2019 I retort quietly.</p><p>His brow wrinkles in surprise. \u2018I don\u2019t remember demanding that you let another man taste you.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I didn\u2019t let him, and I don\u2019t remember agreeing to you bringing me here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t expect you to remember a lot.\u2019 He leans down and bites my nose. \u2018You threw up all over me and my new club; you fell over, more than once; and I had to stop the car twice for you to be sick. And you still managed to vomit in my Mercedes.\u2019 He kisses my nose while I concentrate on cringing, mortified. \u2018You then decorated the floor in the lobby of my apartment block and the floor of my kitchen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry,\u2019 I whisper. I must have sent him into a tailspin with his cleaning habits.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re forgiven.\u2019 He sits up and pulls me onto his lap. \u2018My pure, sweet girl turned into the devil last night.\u2019</p> <p>Another memory is jolted. My Livy. \u2018Your fault,\u2019 I repeat, because there\u2019s nothing else I can claim, apart from it being my fault, which it is, partly.</p><p>\u2018So you keep saying.\u2019 He stands and places me on my unstable feet. \u2018Do you want the good news or the bad news?\u2019</p><p>I try to focus on him, annoyed my clouded, post-drunken vision isn\u2019t allowing me to absorb him all. \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll give you the bad news.\u2019 He gathers my hair and rests it neatly down my back. \u2018You had one dress and you\u2019ve vomited all over it, so you have no clothes.\u2019</p><p>I look down, finding I\u2019m completely nude, not even knickers, and I doubt the vomit reached those.</p> <p>\u2018They were lovely, but I prefer you naked.\u2019</p><p>I glance up and find a knowing look. \u2018You\u2019ve washed my clothes, haven\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your lovely new knickers, yes. They\u2019re in the drawer. Your dress, on the other hand, was rather soiled and needed soaking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the good news?\u2019 I ask, slightly embarrassed by his acknowledgment of my new underwear and reminder of my vomiting episode.</p><p>\u2018The good news is that you don\u2019t need them because we\u2019re broccoli today.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re broccoli?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, like veg.\u2019</p><p>I smile my amusement. \u2018We\u2019re going to veg like broccoli?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you\u2019ve got it all wrong.\u2019 He shakes his head a little. \u2018We lie like broccoli.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So we\u2019re vegetables?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he sighs, exasperated. \u2018We\u2019re going to veg all day, making us broccoli.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d like to be a carrot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t lie like a carrot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or a turnip. How about a turnip?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 he warns.</p><p>\u2018No, scrap that. I would definitely like to be a courgette.\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head on an eye roll. \u2018We\u2019re going to slob out all day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to veg.\u2019 I grin, but he doesn\u2019t give me anything. \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll lie like broccoli with you,\u2019 I relent. \u2018I\u2019ll be whatever you\u2019d like me to be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How about less irritating?\u2019 he asks seriously.</p><p>I have a raging hangover, and I\u2019m a little confused by how I came to be here, but he\u2019s smiled at me, said some meaningful words, and he\u2019s planning a whole day with me. I don\u2019t care whether he laughs or smiles any more, or if he doesn\u2019t engage with me when I\u2019m trying to be playful. He\u2019s too serious and there\u2019s no sign of a sense of humour, but despite his clipped manner, I still find him impossibly captivating. I can\u2019t stay away from him. He\u2019s alluring and addictive, and as he glances down at his watch, I remember something else . . .</p><p>I think you know that I want more than four hours.</p><p>The memory thrills me. How long is more? And will he backtrack on that . . . again? Another image worms its way into my fuzzy mind \u2013 an image of pursed cherry-red lips and a stunned face. She\u2019s beautiful, well-maintained, classy. She\u2019s everything I would expect a man like Miller to go for.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Miller\u2019s concerned tone pulls me from my thoughts.</p><p>I nod. \u2018I\u2019m sorry for vomiting everywhere,\u2019 I say sincerely, thinking a woman like Miller\u2019s business associate wouldn\u2019t do something so lowly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve already forgiven you.\u2019 He takes my neck and guides me to the bathroom. \u2018I tried to brush your teeth last night, but you refused to hold still.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m squirming, thinking it best that I can\u2019t remember half of the evening. The things that I can are not making me feel any better about the stuff that I can\u2019t \u2013 Gregory and Ben, for a start. \u2018I need to call Gregory.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No you don\u2019t.\u2019 He hands me a toothbrush. \u2018He knows where you are and that you\u2019re okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He took your word for it?\u2019 I ask, surprised, their heated words coming back to me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not compelled to explain myself to the man who encouraged your reckless behaviour.\u2019 He puts some paste on the brush before putting it back in the cupboard behind the giant mirror that\u2019s hanging over the sink. \u2018But I did explain myself to your grandmother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You called her?\u2019 I ask warily, wondering what he means by explaining himself. Explain that he\u2019s moody, that he\u2019s playing with my heart and sanity?</p><p>\u2018I did.\u2019 He takes my hand and leads it to my mouth, encouraging me to brush. \u2018We had a nice conversation.\u2019</p><p>I put the brush in my mouth and start circling, just to stop myself from probing him on how that conversation went. But my face must be revealing pure curiosity, even though I have no desire to know what they spoke about.</p><p>\u2018She asked me if I\u2019m married,\u2019 he muses, making my eyes widen. \u2018And once we\u2019d cleared that up, she told me a few things.\u2019</p><p>My brush slows in my mouth. What has she told him, damn her? \u2018What did she tell you?\u2019 The question I really don\u2019t want to know the answer to just slips past my paste and brush.</p><p>\u2018She mentioned your mother, and I told her you\u2019d already shared that with me.\u2019 He stares thoughtfully at me, and I tense, feeling exposed. \u2018Then she mentioned that you disappeared for a time.\u2019</p><p>My heart starts a relentless, nervous beat in my chest. I feel mad. It\u2019s not Nan\u2019s place to share my history with anyone, least of all with a man that she\u2019s met a handful of times. It\u2019s my story to tell, if I want to tell it. And I don\u2019t. That part I never want to share. I spit my toothpaste out and rinse, dying to escape the intensity of his inquisitive stare.</p><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 he asks as I leave the bathroom. \u2018Livy, wait a minute.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where are my clothes?\u2019 I don\u2019t bother waiting for his answer, instead heading for the drawers, kneeling and pulling open the bottom one, then finding my bag, knickers and shoes.</p><p>He reaches me and pushes the drawer shut with his foot, then pulls me to my feet. I keep my head lowered, my hair tumbling all over my chest and face, giving me the perfect hiding place, until he removes it and lifts my chin, exposing me to curious eyes. \u2018Why are you hiding from me?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t speak because I have no answer. He\u2019s looking at me all sorrowful, which I hate. The mention of my mother and my disappearance has brought every second of last night flooding back, every single detail, every drink, every action . . . everything.</p><p>When he realises that he\u2019s going to get nothing, he picks me up and takes me back to his bed, gently easing me down to my back and kneeling to push his shorts down his thighs. \u2018I will never force you to do anything I know you don\u2019t want to.\u2019 He dips and kisses my hipbone, the feel of his slow moving mouth on my sensitive skin immediately chasing away my woes. \u2018Please understand. I\u2019m going nowhere, and neither are you.\u2019 He\u2019s trying to reassure me, but I\u2019ve already shared enough.</p><p>My eyes close and I let him take me to that wonderful place where anguish, self-torture, and histories do not exist. Miller\u2019s realm.</p><p>I can feel his lips climbing up my body, leaving a scorching trail in their wake. \u2018Please let me take a shower,\u2019 I plead, not wanting to stop this, but also not relishing the thought of him worshipping my post-drunken body.</p><p>\u2018I showered you last night, Livy.\u2019 He reaches my mouth and pays some attention to my lips before pulling back to look down at me. \u2018I washed you, stripped your face back to the beauty I love, and I savoured every moment of it.\u2019</p><p>My breath hitches at the word \u2018love\u2019. He said the word love, and I\u2019m so disappointed that I missed him doing all of those things. He looked after me, even after my appalling performance last night.</p><p>Taking my hair, he lifts it, and I register the absence of straight, glossy locks, my usual wild waves back where they belong. He holds it to his nose and inhales deeply. Then he takes my hand and shows me my bare nails, no red nail polish in sight. \u2018Pure, unspoilt beauty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You dried my hair and removed my polish? You keep nail polish remover?\u2019</p><p>His lips tip. \u2018I may have detoured to a twenty-four-hour store.\u2019 He lifts to his knees, reaching over to the bedside cabinet to pick up a condom. \u2018We needed to stock up on these, anyway.\u2019</p><p>The mental image of Miller scanning the aisles of a shop for nail polish remover makes me smile. \u2018Nail polish remover and condoms?\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t entertain my amusement. \u2018Shall we?\u2019 he asks, ripping it open with his teeth and sliding it out.</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 I breathe, not caring if I sound like I\u2019m begging. We don\u2019t have a time constraint, there\u2019s really no rush, but I desperately want him.</p><p>He takes hold of his arousal on a small hiss and rolls on the condom before pushing me onto my front and spreading his body all over me. \u2018From behind,\u2019 he whispers, guiding one of my legs out and bending it upwards, opening me up to him. \u2018Comfortable?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Happy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do I make you feel, Livy?\u2019 He shifts down my back and bites at my bottom, moulding my cheeks as he sucks and licks. \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Alive.\u2019 I exhale the word on a fast rush of breath, turning my face outwards, as he climbs back up my body and sinks straight into me, making no noise whatsoever, whereas I cry out. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shhhh, let me taste you.\u2019 He hovers his mouth over mine, keeping his body still. My cheek on the pillow pushes forward to capture his lips, meeting him harder than I intended to. \u2018Savoured, Livy. Never rushed.\u2019 He takes over the speed, calming my frantic mouth with his gentle pace. \u2018See? Slowly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want you.\u2019 I raise my bum, impatient. \u2018Miller, I want you, please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then you\u2019ll have me.\u2019 He retreats and drives forward slowly on a suppressed moan into my mouth. \u2018Tell me what you want, Livy. Anything you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Faster.\u2019 I bite down on his lip, knowing there\u2019s some ferocity in there somewhere. He always insists on taking it so slow, but I want to experience everything that he has to give. I want his moodiness and arrogance when he takes me. He pushes me to it, makes me crazy with desire, yet always keeps his head and control.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve told you before, I like to take my time with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you deserve to be worshipped.\u2019 He pushes himself up and slips out, sitting back on his heels before grasping at my h*ps and pulling me up. \u2018You want deeper penetration?\u2019 I\u2019m on my knees, my back still to him. \u2018Let\u2019s see if we can satisfy you this way.\u2019</p><p>I look over my shoulder to see him holding himself upright, looking down, the sight of his rippling stomach beyond the solid column of muscle he\u2019s holding making me pant.</p><p>\u2018Rise and move back.\u2019 He pulls on my hip, guiding me to him, until my kneeling body is straddling his lap. \u2018Lower gently.\u2019</p><p>My eyes close as I sink down onto him. \u2018Ohhhhh,\u2019 I groan, feeling him impale me, each fraction I lower pushing him deeper and deeper until I have to hold myself on my knees and take some steadying breaths. \u2018Too deep,\u2019 I pant. \u2018It\u2019s too deep.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Does it hurt?\u2019 His hands slide around my front and cup my br**sts.</p><p>\u2018A little.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Take your time, Livy.

My legs start to tremble, my muscles objecting to my held position, so I lower a little more, holding my breath and letting the back of my head fall onto his shoulder. One hand leaves my breast, dragging up my chest and onto my throat, his whole palm covering it.</p><p>\u2018How are you keeping so still?\u2019 I push the words through controlled breaths, wanting to release my leg muscles and take him to the hilt, but I\u2019m wary of the pain it\u2019ll cause.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u2019 He turns his face into my cheek and bites down before kissing it gently. \u2018Trust me, it\u2019s taking everything out of me. Down a bit more?\u2019</p><p>I nod and drop a fraction further. \u2018Oh God.\u2019 I grit my teeth, the persistent stabbing pain making my head heavy, my face turning into his neck and hiding.</p><p>\u2018Get past this and we\u2019re in a whole new world of pleasure.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Why does it hurt so much?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to sound self-assured, but . . .\u2019 He gasps and starts to shake. \u2018Fucking hell, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I hold my breath and release the muscles in my legs, falling straight onto his lap on a shocked yelp. \u2018Shit!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 he shouts. \u2018Jesus, Livy, tell me you\u2019re okay.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve broken out in a sweat, and I\u2019m still shaking, despite my relaxed body. It\u2019s beyond my control. \u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019 I nuzzle into his neck some more.</p><p>\u2018Am I hurting you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes . . . no!\u2019 I pull away from him and delve my hands into my hair in despair. \u2018Just give me a moment!\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long is a moment?\u2019 he spits.</p><p>I grit my teeth and push up from my knees, only a very small way, before dropping down, less controlled than I planned. He barks. I yelp. \u2018Miller, I can\u2019t!\u2019 I feel utterly defeated by the mixture of pleasure and pain. I want to grab hold of the heaviness in my groin and take it to the next level, but my legs haven\u2019t got the strength required to take me there. \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I fall back against his chest, my arms falling limply to my sides, my breathing laboured from doing hardly anything.</p><p>\u2018Shhhh,\u2019 he soothes me. \u2018Do you want me to take care of it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please.\u2019 I feel useless, feeble.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve worked hard enough to break you in, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He executes a slow, firm rotation of his groin into my bum, keeping deep but not instigating the sharpness that\u2019s causing me discomfort.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Better?\u2019 he asks, resting his palms on my hips. I nod my acceptance on a sigh, letting him keep us completely close and connected while he grinds continuously, around and around, over and over. \u2018How does that feel?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Perfect,\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018Can you lift a little bit?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, lifting myself a fraction, feeling him slip slightly from my passage. \u2018You\u2019re so patient with me,\u2019 I murmur, wondering whether he\u2019s this attentive with every woman he\u2019s slept with.</p><p>\u2018You make me appreciate sex, Livy.\u2019 I feel him rise slightly, too, his hands drifting from my h*ps to my br**sts, then onto my shoulders and down my arms where he holds my hands. Lacing his fingers through mine, he lifts my useless limbs and takes them behind his head and holds them there. He thrusts forward gently, pulls back and inches forward once more. \u2018Let me taste you.\u2019</p><p>I turn my head and find his eyes. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve seen them. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve said that, but I feel the profound need to voice my gratitude.</p><p>\u2018Why are you thanking me?\u2019 His eyes twinkle curiously as he maintains the steady flow of his body into mine. It\u2019s divine, all tenderness long forgotten, being replaced with pure, beautiful pleasure.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I admit quietly.</p><p>\u2018I do.\u2019 He sounds confident, following up his assured words with a confident kiss, hard but slow, demanding but oh so giving. \u2018You\u2019ve never felt like this.\u2019 His h*ps dip and roll up at an excruciatingly accurate angle, pulling a low, pleasure-filled moan from deep within me. \u2018And neither have I.\u2019 He pecks my lips. \u2018So I need to thank you, too.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m starting to shake. \u2018Oh God!\u2019 I sound panicked, desperate.</p><p>\u2018Keep your hands in my hair,\u2019 he orders tenderly, letting his own hands fall to my br**sts. He massages them gently and circles his thumbs over the very tips of my ni**les, hurling me beyond pleasure.</p><p>I\u2019m losing control of my muscles, my entire body giving in to wild shakes, and I\u2019m purring, pulling his head closer to locate his lips. \u2018Let me taste you.\u2019 I mimic his words, plunging my tongue into his mouth, rolling, retreating and pushing back in, while he tortures my body with his delicate rhythm, so careful and attentive.</p><p>\u2018Do I taste as good as you?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018Better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I very much doubt that,\u2019 he claims. \u2018I need you to focus, Livy.\u2019 He groans and separates our mouths, his hair damp from sweat and dripping down his face. \u2018I\u2019m going to lower you so we can both finish, okay?\u2019 I nod my acceptance, and he kisses me as he takes my hands from his head and pushes me down so I\u2019m on all fours. \u2018Comfortable?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I shift my arms, feeling no reluctance or vulnerability at being so exposed. I\u2019m at complete ease, and when he repositions himself, widening his stance and taking a gentle hold of my hips, my blissed-out mind just blisses out more. I take a deep breath as he lazily withdraws, then let it all rush back out when he plunges forward. \u2018Ohhhhhhhhhhh . . .</p><p>One hand leaves my hip and his fingers walk up my spine, each connection of his fingertips on my skin singeing my flesh. When he reaches my neck, he flattens his palm and strokes his way down until he\u2019s at my bottom, rubbing soft, wide circles. \u2018Jesus, Livy, I\u2019m in awe of such perfection.\u2019</p><p>My legs may have been relieved from holding my weight, but my arms are now shaking in their place. \u2018Miller.\u2019 I resist collapsing to my front and try to rein in the uncontrollable spasms.</p><p>He jerks forward on a curse, and then reaches under my stomach, feeling down until his fingers are slipping across my throbbing flesh. I cry out, my head dropping, my hair pooling on the bed beneath me. \u2018You need a little help.\u2019 His throat sounds sore, his voice like gravel. \u2018Let it take hold.\u2019 He slips his fingers back and forth over my cl*t as his h*ps advance and retreat, and his spare hand finds my breast, his grip compressing gently. I\u2019m in sensory overload, helpless to what my body\u2019s striving to find.</p><p>Explosion.</p><p>Release.</p><p>And it comes fast, my bottom flying back on a choked cry, my arms finally giving out.</p><p>\u2018Oh Jesus!\u2019 he cries, tugging me onto him and grinding deeply. He sighs and holds us connected while he thrusts the remnants of our pleasure away, mumbling confused words quietly.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite with it. My mind is a pleasure-induced fuzz, not allowing me to think straight, and my body is totally replete. It\u2019s morning. I\u2019ll never survive his endurance all day. I let him grind into me lazily, him groaning, me trying to stabilise my pleasure-fuelled gasps.</p><p>\u2018Come here, sweet girl,\u2019 he murmurs, pulling at my body impatiently.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t move,\u2019 I breathe, going limp.</p><p>\u2018Yes, for me, you can move.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t leave me be, instead becoming more impatient, so I heave my exhausted body up and turn to him, letting him lift me and position my thighs on either side of his lap. His head cocks to the side a little as he runs his eyes down my torso, his hands skating slowly up and down my sides. \u2018I\u2019ve been desperate to touch you all night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You could\u2019ve felt me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He shakes his head. \u2018You misunderstand.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019 I don\u2019t pass up this opportunity to touch his hair, twisting a lock between my fingers.</p><p>\u2018Touch you, not feel you.\u2019 He looks up at me and I frown, not quite fathoming the difference. \u2018Feeling you gives me untold pleasure, Livy.\u2019 Dipping, he kisses the centre of my chest. \u2018But touching you, touching your soul. That\u2019s beyond the realms of pleasure.\u2019 His eyes make a slow blink as he returns them to mine, and it\u2019s in this moment that I realise he doesn\u2019t do it on purpose. His slow movements are part of this man disguised as a gentleman. This is him. \u2018It\u2019s like something powerful happens,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018And the pleasure of making love to you is just a little bonus.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m still frightened,\u2019 I admit. Even more so with every hopeful word he says to me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a little terrified of you, too.\u2019 He brings his hand between our chests and rubs feathery circles around my nipple.</p><p>Dropping my eyes, I watch his movements. \u2018I\u2019m not scared of you. I\u2019m scared of what you can do to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can make you feel like no other, like you have me,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018Take you to pleasure-filled places beyond your imagination, places that you have taken me.\u2019 Dipping his head, he takes my breast between his teeth and grazes the tip of my nipple, encouraging my head to fall back and my lungs to drain of air. \u2018That\u2019s what I can do to you, Olivia Taylor. And it\u2019s what you do for me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You already have.\u2019 My voice is unrecognisable, fuelled with lust, bursting with desire.</p><p>He\u2019s suddenly moving, carrying me forward and placing me on my back, his body covering me completely and my arms settling over his shoulders. I\u2019m looking up at him, my eyes spoilt for places to settle \u2013 his wet hair falling onto his face, his stubble darkening his jaw, but it\u2019s the pull of his glistening eyes that captures mine. Whenever he catches my attention with that gaze, I\u2019m hypnotised . . . helpless. I\u2019m his.</p><p>\u2018You look good in my bed,\u2019 he declares quietly. \u2018Messy, but good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I look a mess?\u2019 I ask, injured, thinking he should\u2019ve let me take the shower I wanted.</p><p>\u2018No, you misunderstand.\u2019 He frowns, clearly frustrated by my misinterpretation of his words, but I heard all too well what he just said. \u2018My bed looks messy. You look gorgeous.\u2019</p><p>My lips start twitching as I realise his issue. I bet he sleeps deathly still, the covers folded neatly at his waist, whereas I\u2019m a fidget in my sleep, and I know this because of the state of my own bed in the mornings \u2013 a bit like Miller\u2019s bed is right now. \u2018Would you like me to make your bed?\u2019 I ask seriously, hoping the answer is no because, quite frankly, the thought scares me. I\u2019ve seen the precision of the fancy cushions and the silk runner across the centre. I expect he keeps a ruler in the drawer of his bedside cabinet to measure the exact distance from the headboard to the sheets and from the pillows to the runner.</p><p>He knows I\u2019m teasing, despite my success in keeping a straight face and even voice. His thoughtful look confirms it. \u2018As you wish.\u2019 He kisses my startled face and pushes his na**d body from the bed, standing to the side and removing the condom before taking his perfection to the bathroom to dispose of it.</p><p>I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. My bedmaking efforts will never come up to scratch. Shifting to the edge of his bed, I stand and stare blankly at the mess of sheets, wondering where to start. The pillows. I should start with the pillows. Grabbing one of the four plump rectangles, I arrange it neatly, then set another by its side before placing the remaining two on top of each, running my palms over the surfaces to smooth the cotton. Happy with the result, I take two corners of the quilt and fling my arms skyward, flapping the sheet into a perfect square that floats gently down to the bed. I\u2019m pleased with myself, it looks tidy, but I know it\u2019s not tidy enough, so I set on a journey around the bed, pulling at corners and ironing out the crinkles with my palms. Then I open the lid of the giant chest and begin placing the cushions, trying my hardest to remember the exact positioning from when I was last here. When I\u2019m satisfied with my display, I slide the silk throw across the centre and tweak the edges into place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile triumphantly and stand back, admiring my handiwork. He can\u2019t possibly turn his nose up at that. It looks spectacular.</p><p>\u2018Happy with yourself?\u2019</p><p>I swing my na**d body around and find Miller, arms folded, leaning up against the door frame of the bathroom. \u2018I think I\u2019ve done a good job.\u2019</p><p>He casts his eyes over the bed and pushes himself away from the frame, walking over slowly and thinking hard. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good job at all. He wants to start all over again, and the juvenile side of me is willing him to do just that, just so I have ammo to poke fun at him.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re dying to pull it all off and start again, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I ask, mirroring his folded arms and close studying of his bed.</p><p>He shrugs nonchalantly, blatantly feigning acceptance. \u2018It\u2019ll do.\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>He sighs and walks off, leaving me to admire his bed. \u2018Livy, that is far from perfect.\u2019 He disappears into his wardrobe and I follow behind, discovering Miller pulling some black boxers up his thighs.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to form words when confronted with such a sight. \u2018Why the need to have everything just so?\u2019 I ask, watching as his fluid movements falter at my question.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t look at me, only continues arranging the waistband of his boxers around his hips. \u2018I appreciate my possessions.\u2019 His answer is reluctant and curt and clearly not going to be elaborated on. \u2018Breakfast?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have no clothes,\u2019 I remind him.</p><p>He takes a leisurely jaunt down my nakedness with sparkling eyes. \u2018You\u2019re fine as you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m naked.\u2019</p><p>His face is completely impassive. \u2018Yes; as I said, fine.\u2019 He proceeds to pull on some black shorts and a grey T-shirt, and something in this moment makes me wonder if Miller Hart has ever stepped out in anything less than a three-piece suit.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d feel more comfortable if I had some cover,\u2019 I argue quietly, annoyed with myself for sounding so unsure and timid.</p> <p>He straightens his T-shirt and regards me closely, making me shift and feel even more uncomfortable, now that he\u2019s clothed. \u2018As you wish,\u2019 he grumbles, and I waste no time seeking out something to throw on.</p><p>Flicking through the rails of shirts, I lose a bit of patience at the constant stream of dress shirts and pull down a blue one by the sleeve in exasperation.</p><p>\u2018Livy, what are you doing?\u2019 He chokes the words out as I feed my arms through the sleeves.</p><p>\u2018Covering myself,\u2019 I reply, my actions slowing as I register the look of pure horror on his face.</p><p>He seems to release a calming breath, and then he\u2019s on his way over to me and quickly removing the shirt from my body. \u2018Not in a five-hundred-pound shirt.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m na**d again and watching as he rehangs the shirt and starts brushing down the front, huffing his annoyance when the minuscule crease that I\u2019ve created doesn\u2019t disappear. I can\u2019t laugh. He\u2019s too aggravated, and it\u2019s quite alarming.</p><p>After a good few moments of Miller faffing with the shirt and me watching on in shock, he yanks it down, screws it up and tosses it in a wash basket. \u2018Needs washing,\u2019 he mutters, stomping over to a drawer and pulling it open. He lifts out a pile of black T-shirts and sets the stack on the cabinet in the centre of the room before taking each shirt individually and starting another pile to the side. When he reaches the last, he shakes it out and hands it to me, then goes about lowering the newly rotated pile of T-shirts back into the drawer.</p><p>As I watch him, completely fascinated, I steel myself to acknowledge something that\u2019s been pretty obvious for quite some time. He\u2019s not just tidy. Miller Hart suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.</p> <p>\u2018Are you going to put it on?\u2019 he asks, still clearly annoyed.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything; I\u2019m not sure what to, so I pull it over my head and down my body, thinking he lives his life to military precision, and I might have thrown him a curveball with my presence, although he keeps putting me here, so I shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about it.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 I enquire nervously, wishing he\u2019d put me back in his bed and resume worshipping me.</p><p>\u2018Fine and dandy,\u2019 he mutters, very un-fine and un-dandy -like. \u2018I\u2019ll make us breakfast.\u2019</p><p>My hand is clasped abruptly and I\u2019m pulled through the bedroom with purpose. It doesn\u2019t pass my notice that Miller makes a terrible job of pretending to ignore the bed, his jaw ticking a little as he glances out of the corner of his eye to the neat covers and pillows \u2013 neat by my standards, anyway.</p><p>\u2018Please, sit,\u2019 he instructs when we reach his kitchen, leaving me to lower my na**d bum to the cool surface of the chair. \u2018What would you like?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll have what you\u2019re having,\u2019 I say, thinking I should make this as easy as possible for him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m having fruit and natural yogurt. Would you like that?\u2019 He opens the fridge and lifts out a stack of plastic containers, all containing various chopped fruits.</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 I answer on a sigh, praying we\u2019re not heading down that familiar road of shortness and detachment. It feels like it.</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 His tone is clipped as he sets about taking bowls down from the cupboard, spoons from the drawer, and yogurt from the fridge.</p><p>I\u2019m silent as I watch him. Each object he puts in front of me is nudged to get it just so. Orange juice is squeezed, coffee brewed, and he\u2019s sitting opposite me in no time. I\u2019m not touching a thing. I dare not. It\u2019s all been placed with utter precision, and I won\u2019t risk lowering his mood further by moving anything.</p><p>\u2018Help yourself.\u2019 He nods at my bowl. I gauge the position of the fruit bowl, so I can reposition it exactly right, and start spooning some fruit into my bowl. Then I replace it carefully. I\u2019ve not even picked up my spoon before he\u2019s leaning over the table and nudging the fruit dish to the left. My fascination with Miller Hart just keeps growing, and while these little traits are quite irritating, they\u2019re really quite endearing, too. It\u2019s becoming quite clear that it is me who\u2019s sending this gentleman into a tailspin \u2013 me and my inability to satisfy his compulsion to keep things just the way he likes them. But I\u2019m not going to take it personally. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone on the planet who could get this right.</p><p>The silence is awfully uncomfortable, and I know exactly why. He\u2019s eating, but I can tell that he\u2019s fighting the urge to leave the table and restore his bedcovers to their normal perfect glory. I want to tell him to just go and do it, especially if it means he\u2019ll relax, which means I\u2019ll relax. I don\u2019t get a chance to, though. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and rests his spoon across his bowl.</p><p>\u2018Excuse me while I use the bathroom.\u2019 He stands and leaves the room, and my eyes follow his path, wanting to follow and see him in action, but I take the opportunity to study all the items on the table, trying to figure out exactly what it is about their positions that keep him calm. I can\u2019t see it.</p><p>It\u2019s a good five minutes before he returns to the kitchen, visibly more relaxed. I relax, too, and I\u2019m relieved that I\u2019ve finished my breakfast and drunk my juice, so there is absolutely no need for me to move anything . . . except me, and I\u2019m beginning to register an issue with my positioning and movements, too \u2013 like in his bed.</p><p>He tucks himself under the table and takes his spoon, loading it with a strawberry and popping it in his mouth. The inevitability of my eyes focusing on his slow chews is something that I can\u2019t help. His mouth hypnotises me as much as his eyes do when they\u2019re glistening at me. And I know they are now, which leaves me in a predicament. Eyes or mouth?</p><p>He decides for me when he speaks. I almost don\u2019t hear him as I\u2019m too rapt by those lips. \u2018I have a request,\u2019 he declares. The words, when they finally filter into my distracted mind, pull my eyes up to his. I was right. They\u2019re glistening.</p><p>\u2018What kind of request?\u2019 I ask warily.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want you to see other men.\u2019 He watches me thoughtfully, clearly trying to gauge my reaction, but I can\u2019t be giving him much to go on as my face is blank, not having quite worked out what reaction to give. \u2018I think it\u2019s a reasonable request in light of your performance last night.\u2019</p><p>Now I have a facial expression, and I know it\u2019s a little stunned. \u2018You are the reason for my performance last night,\u2019 I retort.</p><p>\u2018That may be so, but I\u2019m uncomfortable with the idea of you exposing yourself like that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exposed in general, or exposed to other men?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Both. You didn\u2019t feel the need to expose yourself before you met me, so I can\u2019t see that it would be a difficult request for you to fulfil.\u2019 He takes another mouthful of his fruit, but I\u2019m not compelled to watch him chew this time. No, I\u2019m still stunned and looking into completely unaffected eyes.</p><p>He clearly seems to think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to make these demands. I don\u2019t even know what to make of it. He\u2019s just worshipped me in his bed, said some pretty touching words, and now he\u2019s all businesslike.</p><p>\u2018And the dating nonsense,\u2019 he continues. \u2018That won\u2019t be happening again, either.\u2019</p><p>I have to stop myself from laughing. \u2018Why are you asking this of me?\u2019 I probe. Is this his way of saying he wants us to be exclusive?</p><p>His shoulders jump up on a shrug. \u2018No man will make you feel like I can, so it\u2019s really in your best interest.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m staggered by his arrogance. He\u2019s right, but I\u2019m not about to fuel his ego. \u2018Miller.\u2019 My elbows hit the table and my forehead falls into my palms. \u2018Will you please just say exactly what you mean?\u2019 I look up at him, finding slight concern etched on his perfect face.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want anyone else tasting you,\u2019 he says unapologetically. \u2018It may seem unreasonable, but that\u2019s what I want and I\u2019d like you to agree.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what about you?\u2019 I ask on a whisper. \u2018I know about that woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s dealt with.\u2019</p><p>Dealt with? So he had to deal with her? \u2018And she accepted that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why would it matter if she\u2019s just a business associate?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I said last night, it doesn\u2019t, but it does to you so I told her about you and let that be the end of it.\u2019</p><p>I scowl across the table at him. \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know about my club.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only because I landed there by accident. I doubt I would\u2019ve found out if I had waited to be told, and I\u2019m certain you wouldn\u2019t have had me there by choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wrong.\u2019</p><p>I frown at his one word, assertive counter.</p><p>\u2018You were on the guest list, Livy. If I had wanted to keep you away, I would\u2019ve had you removed from it.\u2019</p><p>I snap my mouth shut and cast my mind back to what I can remember before the champagne and tequila took hold. \u2018You were watching me all evening, weren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was with Gregory.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You were.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you think that he was my date?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you didn\u2019t like it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>Just like he didn\u2019t like seeing me with Luke. \u2018You were jealous,\u2019 I tell him, wondering at what point he figured out that Gregory\u2019s g*y. Maybe the dance floor. Or maybe the toilet. He\u2019s been working at Ice, but my friend isn\u2019t obviously camp. He\u2019s a strapping bloke who turns as many women\u2019s heads as he does g*y men\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Frighteningly,\u2019 he confirms.</p><p>I was right and I\u2019m glad, but is he going to give me more than one word? \u2018What\u2019s in it for me?\u2019 I ask, knowing damn well what he\u2019s going to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Pleasure.\u2019</p><p>I sag at the table. Pleasure delivered by Miller is the ultimate prize . . . nearly. But what I want is his constant loving, like how he is when he has me in his thing or in his bed. \u2018You\u2019re asking me to make myself exclusive to you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m absolutely fine with that, but given the circumstances of this conversation and how it\u2019s come about, I\u2019m not sure this will mean that Miller is exclusively mine. \u2018And what about you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will you stop speaking in monosyllables?\u2019 I snap.</p><p>He leans across the table. \u2018I beg your pardon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can beg all you like,\u2019 I hiss back, fury burning in my gut. \u2018You won\u2019t be getting any pardon from me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018There you go again!\u2019 I push my bowl away from my place setting and it collides with the glass fruit bowl, knocking it out of position. \u2018Begging!\u2019 I watch as his eyes focus on the disturbed items on his perfect table, and he starts twitching, a flash of anger flying across his face. It makes me sit up and take notice.</p><p>More calmly than I know he\u2019s feeling, he spends a few silent moments putting everything back into position, then he stands and my eyes follow him around the table until I can no longer see him. He\u2019s behind me, and I tense when his palms rest on my shoulders, delivering a shot of fire through the material of his T-shirt and into my skin.</p><p>\u2018It is you who will be begging, sweet girl.\u2019 His mouth is at my ear, biting at my lobe. \u2018You will accept my request because we both know that you\u2019re constantly wondering how you will survive without my attention.\u2019 His thumbs start massaging delicious, firm circles into my shoulders.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t pretend that this is all about my needs,\u2019 I breathe, wanting to relax into his touch but refusing to grant my body the further pleasure that it\u2019s craving. He said he couldn\u2019t have me in the very beginning and in actual fact, he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>His hands are gone in a moment and I\u2019m being lifted from the chair. \u2018I don\u2019t pretend, Livy.\u2019 He starts a slow walk forward, forcing me to step back until I\u2019m being gently pushed into the wall. \u2018This is just as much for my needs, which is why I\u2019m making this proposition, and it\u2019s also why you will accept.\u2019</p><p>My mind is doing an amazing job of preventing the desire from steaming forward. It\u2019s there, but so is the desire for answers. \u2018You\u2019re making this sound like a business transaction.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I work hard. I\u2019m emotionally and physically drained by it. I want to have you to worship and indulge in when I\u2019m done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think you might be referring to a relationship,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>\u2018Call it what you like. I want you to be at my disposal.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m horrified, delighted . . . unsure. For a man who\u2019s so articulate, he has a pretty strange way with words. \u2018I think I\u2019d like to call it a relationship,\u2019 I say, just so he knows exactly what page I\u2019m on.</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He dips and finds my mouth, wrapping his forearm around the small of my back and lifting me, crushing me to his chest. I fall straight into the tender rhythm of his tongue, cocking my head to the side and sighing into his mouth, but my mind is still mulling over the weird words that have just been exchanged. Is Miller Hart now my boyfriend? Am I his girlfriend? \u2018Stop overthinking,\u2019 he mumbles into my mouth, turning and carrying me from the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You confuse me.\u2019 My legs curl around his waist, my arms around his body.</p> <p>\u2018Take me as I am, Livy.\u2019 He releases my lips and squeezes me to him. It\u2019s a silent, pleading follow-up to his words.</p><p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 I whisper my question into his neck and return his squeeze.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a man who\u2019s found a beautiful, sweet girl who gives me more pleasure than I ever thought possible.\u2019 He lowers me to the couch and lies beside me, his face close to mine, his palm stroking up the inside of my thigh. \u2018And I don\u2019t just mean with sex,\u2019 he whispers, and I gasp. \u2018I\u2019ve made my intentions clear.\u2019 His hand brushes over the hair at the apex of my thighs and his finger slips down my centre. My back bows. \u2018She\u2019s always ready for me,\u2019 he murmurs, working the heated moisture over every inch of my flesh. \u2018She\u2019s always aroused by me.\u2019 I push my forehead to his and close my eyes. \u2018And she accepts that she can\u2019t stop it. We were made to fit together. We fit perfectly together.\u2019</p><p>My breath diminishes and my legs stiffen.</p><p>\u2018She responds to me without even knowing it.\u2019 He uses his forehead to push me back from him. \u2018And she knows how I feel when she deprives me of her face.\u2019</p><p>Forcing my eyes to open and my head to remain still, I start involuntarily thrusting my h*ps gently back and forth to match his caressing of my damp, throbbing centre. He\u2019s building me up lazily, watching me come apart. My hands are fisted on the front of his T-shirt, pulling and grappling at the cotton, making a mess of the previously creaseless garment.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s going to come,\u2019 he muses, his eyes drifting down my body to watch his hand work me. My legs start shifting, trying to control the onslaught of pressure surging forward. And then he pushes a finger into me on a hitch of his breath, quickly swapping it for two when I cry out and start to shake. \u2018That\u2019s it, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I lose the battle to hold my eyes open and throw my head back, mumbling senseless words as my cl**ax takes hold.</p><p>\u2018Show me your face.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 I moan.</p><p>\u2018You can for me, Livy. Let me see you.\u2019</p><p>I yell my despair and toss my head forward. \u2018You can\u2019t do this to me.\u2019</p><p>He kisses me, too gently for my current frenzied state. \u2018I can, I am, and I always will. Scream my name.\u2019 He pushes his thumb onto my clitoris and circles firmly, watching me as I fight to deal with the pleasure that he\u2019s inflicting on me.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s the only man\u2019s name you\u2019ll ever scream, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He tackles my mouth, kissing me to orgasm as he moans and pushes his chest into mine, his body absorbing my shocked trembles. \u2018I promise that I\u2019ll always make you feel this special.\u2019 He brings his fingers to my mouth and runs the moisture across my lips. \u2018No one will ever taste that, except me and you.\u2019 His face is expressionless, but I\u2019m beginning to recognise his emotional frame of mind through his mesmerising eyes. Right now, he\u2019s sanctimonious, satisfied . . . victorious. I\u2019ve confirmed all of his claims with my low moans and bodily responses to his touch.</p><p>Miller Hart rules my body.</p><p>And it\u2019s fast becoming obvious that he rules my heart, too.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>My legs are cold and my body stiff. Miller isn\u2019t on the sofa with me, but I can hear him close by, the sounds of cupboards opening and crockery gently clanking, quickly telling me where he is and what he\u2019s doing. Stretching out on a happy groan, I smile as I look up at the ceiling, then sit up to remind myself of the beautiful art that graces the walls of his apartment. After switching my eyes from one to another, and then another a few times, I give up on trying to pick my favourite. I love them all, even though they are distorted and bordering ugly.</p><p>My head is only fuzzy with sleep, as opposed to alcohol, and despite my slightly achy muscles, I feel perfect. Getting to my feet, I go in search of Miller, finding him wiping down the countertop with anti-bacterial spray. \u2018Hi.\u2019</p><p>He looks up, pushing his hair from his forehead with the back of his hand. \u2018Livy.\u2019 He folds the cloth and lays it next to the sink. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine, Miller.\u2019</p><p>He nods. \u2018Excellent. I\u2019ve drawn a bath. Would you like to join me?\u2019</p><p>We\u2019re back to gentleman mode. It makes me smile. \u2018I\u2019d love to join you.\u2019</p><p>He cocks his head curiously as he walks towards me. \u2018Have I said something amusing?\u2019 he asks as he takes hold of my nape and turns me.</p><p>\u2018I find your manner amusing.\u2019 I let him lead me to his bedroom and into the bathroom where the huge, claw-foot bath is full of bubbly water.</p><p>\u2018Should I be offended by that?\u2019 He grasps the hem of my T-shirt and lifts it over my head, then neatly folds it and places it in the laundry basket.</p><p>I shrug. \u2018No, your habits are charming.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My habits?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, your habits.\u2019 I don\u2019t elaborate. He knows what I\u2019m referring to, and it\u2019s not just his gentlemanly ways \u2013 when he chooses to use them.</p><p>\u2018My habits,\u2019 he muses, pulling off his T-shirt and going about the same folding routine. \u2018I think I am offended.\u2019 He slides his shorts down his thighs, folding and placing them neatly in the laundry basket, too. \u2018After you,\u2019 he says, gesturing to the bath, his na**d perfection sending me dizzy. \u2018Need some support?\u2019</p><p>I glance up, finding smugness in his eyes and his hand held out. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I tentatively take his offered hand and climb the steps before lowering myself into the tub.</p><p>\u2018Is the temperature okay?\u2019 he asks, following me in and taking the opposite end so we\u2019re facing one another, his legs bent, his knees breaking the surface of the deep water.</p><p>\u2018Sure.\u2019 I lie back, and the soles of my feet slip along the bottom of the tub until they\u2019re wedged under his arse. He raises his eyebrows, making me blush. \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s slippery.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No need to apologise.\u2019 He collects my feet from beneath him and lifts to settle them on his chest. \u2018You have cute feet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cute?\u2019 I have to stop myself from laughing. I never know what words or tones are going to fall from Miller Hart\u2019s lips, but they affect me in one way or another every time, whether it be amusement, irritation, lust, or confusion.</p><p>\u2018Yes, cute.\u2019 He dips and kisses my little toe. \u2018I have a request.\u2019</p><p>His declaration makes it very easy to stop the threatening laughter from surfacing. Another request? \u2018What is it?\u2019 I ask nervously.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t look so apprehensive, Livy.\u2019</p><p>Easy for him to say. \u2018I\u2019m not apprehensive. I\u2019m curious.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So am I.\u2019</p><p>I frown across the bath at him. \u2018What are you curious about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How it will feel to be inside you without anything between us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh . . .\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>He reaches into the water and locates my hand, pulling me to my knees and leading it to the solid rod resting on his abdomen. \u2018You must be curious, too.\u2019</p><p>I am now. \u2018You\u2019re speaking like this is long term,\u2019 I say hesitantly, bracing myself for his reply.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve already told you that I want more than our remaining four hours, which I believe have expired now.\u2019 He positions my grasp around him and lays his hand over mine, then starts guiding me up and down slowly under the water. My whole being relaxes, peace settling over me in response to his words. The movement of his chest visibly changes, the rise and fall increasing dramatically. He feels like velvet, but my view of our combined movements is hampered by the gallons of water surrounding us. I can only see the swollen head of his penis, so I lift my eyes and let them indulge in the subtle parting of his incredible lips.</p><p>\u2018I am curious,\u2019 I confess, shifting forward on my knees. \u2018But I\u2019m not on the pill.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you prepared to rectify that so we can both feed our curiosity?\u2019</p><p>I nod my agreement as I allow him to control the strokes of my hand over his erection. He feels sublime \u2013 smooth, firm and large. He looks sublime, too, and breathing some confidence into myself, I flex my hand until he releases on a frown and watches me climb up his body.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing, Livy?\u2019 he asks warily, but he doesn\u2019t stop me from finding my way until I\u2019m sitting on his lap, his arousal resting perfectly beneath me. In fact, he helps me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I want to feel you.\u2019 I lower my face to his, the sensation of him pulsing under me injecting more confidence. I\u2019m losing my mind, my body acting without instruction.</p><p>He shakes his head lightly and homes in on my lips, kissing me adoringly. I might be teasing and tormenting him, but he\u2019s the one in control. \u2018That can\u2019t happen, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 I breathe, finding his hair. \u2018Let me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Jesus, you\u2019re ruining me.\u2019</p> <p>I take his weak, breathless words as defeatism and reach down between our bodies while keeping up our kiss. \u2018It is me who\u2019s ruined.\u2019 I bite his tongue gently. \u2018You\u2019ve ruined me.\u2019 My hand finds what it\u2019s looking for, and I lift to position him at my opening.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t ruined you, Livy.\u2019 I feel his hand wrap around my wrist, halting my reckless intention. \u2018I\u2019ve awakened a desire in you that only I can satisfy.\u2019 He pulls my hand away, his lips straight in warning. \u2018And it seems one of us needs to keep our head before we find ourselves in a situation.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m pent-up on lust, but his cautionary face soon drags me back to reality. \u2018Your fault,\u2019 I mumble, embarrassed and feeling unreasonably rejected.</p><p>\u2018So you keep telling me,\u2019 he says, rolling his blue eyes. It\u2019s a sign of exasperation, a rare show of emotion. In an attempt to restore my slighted state and distract Miller from scorning me further, I start to shift down, keen to taste him again. But I don\u2019t get very far.</p><p>He halts me, looking almost nervous, and pulls me up, completely crowding me with his body and falling back against the bath, settling me on his chest. \u2018Thing.\u2019</p> <p>Despite my confusion at his decline, I hum happily and embrace his iron hold, clinging onto him everywhere and relishing the sound of his breathing as the water around our bodies laps gently. \u2018I have a request, too,\u2019 I whisper, feeling brave and comfortable asking.</p><p>\u2018Hold your thought.\u2019 He turns his head and kisses my wet cheek. \u2018Let me have my thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can ask while you\u2019re having your thing,\u2019 I counter on a smile.</p><p>\u2018Probably, but I like to see you when we\u2019re conversing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think cuddling might be my thing now, too.\u2019 I squeeze some more, causing our bodies to slip. The comfort and peace that engulfs me during these moments makes me want to superglue myself to him.</p><p>\u2018I hope you mean with me.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Exclusively,\u2019 I sigh. \u2018Can I voice my request yet?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m reluctantly released from his chest and pushed up on his lap. \u2018Tell me what you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Information.\u2019 My bravery diminishes at the sight of his straight lips and tight jaw, but I find the courage to continue. \u2018Your habits.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My habits?\u2019 He raises his eyebrows, almost in warning.</p><p>I push on carefully. \u2018You\u2019re very . . .\u2019 I stop myself to choose my words wisely. \u2018Exact.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean tidy?\u2019</p><p>This is more than tidy. This is obsessive, but I\u2019m getting the feeling that he\u2019s sensitive about this subject. \u2018Yes, tidy,\u2019 I relent. \u2018You\u2019re very tidy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I make sure I take care of what\u2019s mine.\u2019 He reaches forward and pinches my nipple, making me jerk on top of him. \u2018And you are now mine, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I am?\u2019 I sound shocked, but I\u2019m secretly delighted. I want to be possessed by him every moment of every day.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he says simply, taking my waist and pulling me down until our foreheads meet. \u2018You are also my habit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a habit?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re an addictive habit.\u2019 He kisses my nose. \u2018A habit that I never plan on giving up.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t hesitate to let him know my thoughts on him and his new habit. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who said you have a choice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You said you\u2019d never make me do anything I don\u2019t want to,\u2019 I remind him.</p><p>\u2018I said I\u2019d never make you do anything that I know you don\u2019t want to do, and I know that you really want to be my habit. So this is a pointless discussion, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>I scowl at him, stumped for any comeback. \u2018You\u2019re cocky.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in trouble.\u2019</p><p>I retreat on his lap. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 I ask. Is he warning me?</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s talk about yesterday evening,\u2019 he suggests, like we might be discussing where to have dinner. I\u2019m instantly on my guard, and my chest falling onto his and my face hiding in his neck is evidence of this.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve already talked about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not at length. I\u2019m none the wiser as to why you behaved so recklessly, Livy, and it makes me uncomfortable.\u2019 He wrestles me out of his chest and holds me in place. \u2018When I\u2019m talking to you, you look at me.\u2019</p><p>I keep my head down. \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hard luck.\u2019 He\u2019s moving, making himself more comfortable. \u2018Explain yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I got drunk, that\u2019s all.\u2019 I don\u2019t mean to, but I\u2019m gritting my teeth and looking up at him through pissed off eyes. \u2018And stop talking to me like I\u2019m a delinquent child.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then stop behaving like one.\u2019 He\u2019s deadly serious. I\u2019m stunned.</p><p>\u2018You know what?\u2019 I push up and get out of the bath, and he does nothing to stop me. He just lies back, all relaxed and completely unaffected by my little tantrum. \u2018You might make me feel incredible, say some beautiful things when you make love to me, but when you behave like this, all . . . all . . . all . . .</p><p>\u2018All what, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a self-righteous prick!\u2019 I spit desperately.</p><p>He\u2019s not at all fazed. \u2018Tell me why you disappeared. Where did you go?\u2019</p><p>His demanding questions only heighten my fury . . . and my desperation. \u2018You said you\u2019d never make me do anything I didn\u2019t want to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That I know you don\u2019t want to. I can see a burden weighing down my sweet girl.\u2019 He reaches for me with his hand. \u2018Let me ease it.\u2019</p><p>I look at his hand for a few moments, my mind racing with only one worry. He\u2019d leave me again if I ever told him. \u2018You can\u2019t.\u2019 I turn on my bare feet and stalk away. I can\u2019t stand this. Miller Hart is a roller-coaster ride, tossing me from untold pleasure to indescribable anger, from confident to timid and nervous, from pure joy to painful hurt. I\u2019m being constantly pulled in two directions and while I know full well how I felt when he abandoned me before, at least the despair was consistent. At least I knew where I was. I\u2019ll make the decision this time.</p><p>Cold and wet, I pull open the bottom drawer of the chest and take my knickers, bag and shoes, then hurry into his wardrobe and grab the first shirt that I lay my hands on, tossing it over my shoulders and dropping my shoes to the floor. Once I\u2019ve slipped my knickers on and my feet into my heels, I make my escape, running across his bedroom, down the corridor and into the lounge, desperate to hide from his pressing questions and disapproving tones. I know that I was reckless last night. My mistakes are plentiful, but none as big as the man who I\u2019ve just left in the bath. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been thinking. He won\u2019t understand.</p><p>Dashing towards the front door of his apartment, I begin to relax when my hand makes contact with the handle. But I can\u2019t turn it. It\u2019s not locked, I can leave if I want to, but my muscles are ignoring my brain\u2019s faint order to open the door. And that is because there\u2019s a more powerful command drowning it out, telling me to go back and make him understand.</p><p>I look down at my hand, mentally willing it to turn the knob. But it doesn\u2019t. It won\u2019t. My forehead meets the shiny black door, my eyes clamping shut as I battle the conflicting commands and stamp my heel on the floor in pure frustration. I can\u2019t leave. My body and mind are not prepared to pass this door and leave behind the only man who I\u2019ve ever connected with. I didn\u2019t allow this to happen. It was unstoppable.</p><p>I roll my body around until my back is stuck to the door and I\u2019m staring at Miller. He\u2019s standing quietly watching me, completely na**d and dripping wet. \u2018You can\u2019t leave, can you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I sob, my knees becoming as weak as my falling heart and refusing to hold my body up any longer, leaving me sliding down the door until my bottom hits the floor. My anger turns to tears, and I cry silently to myself, the last of my defences melting away. I let my hopelessness pour into my hands and my barricades completely diminish under the scrutiny of the confounding Miller Hart. It feels like a lifetime, but I know it\u2019s only mere seconds before he\u2019s gathering me up and carrying me back to his bed. He doesn\u2019t say a word. He sits me on the edge and slips my shoes and knickers off, and then pushes his shirt from my shoulders and down my arms, leaning into me and resting his lips on my cheek as he does. \u2018Don\u2019t cry, sweet girl,\u2019 he whispers, uncharacteristically throwing his shirt to the floor before taking me gently down to the bed. \u2018Please don\u2019t cry.\u2019</p><p>His plea has the opposite effect and more tears flow, his bare chest becoming as sodden as my face as he presses me into him, tenderly kissing the top of my head every now and then, while he hums that peaceful harmony above me. It starts to soothe me and my sobs begin to abate under the hard warmth of his body holding me and the calming hum of his voice seeping into my ears.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not a sweet girl,\u2019 I whisper into his chest. \u2018You keep calling me sweet girl, but you shouldn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>His humming fades out and the tender kissing of my head stops. He\u2019s thinking about my declaration. \u2018You are very much a sweet . . . woman, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not the reference to \u201cgirl\u201d so much,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018It\u2019s the sweet part that bothers me most.\u2019 I feel him stiffen a little before he encourages me from his chest. We\u2019re conversing, he wants eye contact, and when he finds it, he wipes my damp cheeks with his thumbs and gazes at me, his eyes full of pity. I don\u2019t want pity, and I don\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re my sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re mistaken.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you\u2019re mine, Livy,\u2019 he asserts, almost showing annoyance.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t mean that,\u2019 I sigh, dropping my eyes, but soon bringing them back up when he shifts his hands from my cheeks to my neck and tilts my head back.</p><p>\u2018Elaborate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to be yours,\u2019 I murmur, and he smiles. He gives me that rare, beautiful smile, and my heart skips with happiness for a split second, but then I remember the conversation direction. \u2018I really want to be yours,\u2019 I affirm.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u2019 He drops his lips to mine and kisses me delicately. \u2018But you really don\u2019t have a choice in the matter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I agree, aware that it\u2019s not just because Miller says that I don\u2019t have a choice. I tried to leave, and I couldn\u2019t. I really tried.</p><p>\u2018Listen to me,\u2019 he says, sitting up and dragging me onto his lap. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have pressed you. I said that I\u2019d never make you do anything I know you don\u2019t want to. That will always stand, but please know that whatever you fear will change my opinion of my sweet girl is wasted anxiety.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What if it isn\u2019t?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m never going to know unless you choose to tell me, and if you don\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine, too. Yes, I would prefer it if you confide in me, but not if it\u2019s going to make you sad, Livy. I can\u2019t see you sad. I want you to trust me that it won\u2019t make any difference to how I feel about you. Let me help you.\u2019</p><p>My chin starts to tremble.</p><p>\u2018Your mother,\u2019 he says quietly.</p><p>I nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Livy, you\u2019re not like that. Don\u2019t let someone else\u2019s bad choices affect your life.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I could have been like that,\u2019 I whisper, shame beginning to flood me, my head dropping.</p><p>My face is grasped and pulled to him, but I keep my eyes low, not wanting to face the contempt he\u2019ll be showing. \u2018We\u2019re talking, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve said enough.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, you haven\u2019t. Look at me.\u2019</p><p>Forcing my eyes up, I meet his, but there\u2019s no contempt. There\u2019s no anything. Even now, Miller Hart gives nothing away. \u2018I wanted to know where she\u2019d gone.\u2019</p><p>He frowns. \u2018You\u2019ve lost me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I read her journal. I read about the places she went and who with. I read about a man. A man named William. Her pimp.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s just staring at me. He knows where I\u2019m heading.</p> <p>\u2018I put myself in her world, Miller. I lived her life.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He shakes his head. \u2018No, you didn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I did. What was so amazing about that life that it kept her from being a mother? That it made her abandon me?\u2019 I fight to control the tears threatening to break free again. I refuse to shed another tear for that woman. \u2018I found Nan\u2019s gin and then I found William. I tricked him into taking me on and he set me up with clients. Her clients. I went through most of the men listed in my mother\u2019s journal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018Please stop.\u2019</p><p>I harshly brush at my wet cheeks. \u2018All I found was the humiliation of letting a man slam into me.\u2019</p><p>He winces. \u2018Don\u2019t say that, Livy.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018There was nothing glamorous or appealing about mindless sex.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, please!\u2019 he yells, pushing me from his body and standing, leaving me feeling exposed and lonely on his bed. He starts pacing around his room, clearly agitated, his head falling back on a curse. \u2018I don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re so pure and beautiful to the core. I love that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Alcohol got me through it. I was just there in body. But I couldn\u2019t stop. I kept thinking there had to be more, something I was missing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop!\u2019 He flies around and hammers me with an enraged glare, making me jump back on the bed in shock. \u2018Any man who\u2019s done anything less than worship you should be f**king shot!\u2019 He crouches on the floor, his hands in his hair. \u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><p>My entire being goes lax \u2013 my body, my mind and my heart. It\u2019s all given up, my past very much in my present and forcing me to explain myself. He looks up at me. His blues are boring into me. Then they close and he pulls in a long, calming breath of air, but I don\u2019t give him time to start firing his thoughts at me. I have a good idea what they are, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019ve ruined his opinion of his pure, beautiful girl. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I say evenly as I drag myself off the bed. \u2018I\u2019m sorry for destroying your ideal.\u2019 I collect his shirt from the floor and calmly start to put it on. I can feel the pain turning in my gut, stirring years of anguish and misery.</p><p>I draw my discarded knickers up my thighs, pick up my shoes and bag from the floor and walk out of his bedroom, knowing that this time I\u2019ll be able to leave. And I do. The evident contempt that he feels makes me turn the handle of the door with ease, and I\u2019m on my way down the corridor to the stairwell, my bare feet dragging the floor along with my fallen heart.</p><p>\u2018Please don\u2019t go. I\u2019m sorry for shouting at you.\u2019</p> <p>His soft voice halts me mid-step and rips my breaking heart from my chest. \u2018Don\u2019t feel obligated, Miller.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Obligated?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, obligated,\u2019 I say, starting down the steps again. Miller feeling guilty over his violent reaction isn\u2019t what I need, nor is sympathy. I\u2019m not sure what the happy medium is of those two, but acceptance and understanding might help. It\u2019ll be more than I allow myself.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 I can hear his bare feet coming after me, and when he lands in front of me, I mildly register that he\u2019s wearing only a pair of black boxer shorts. \u2018I\u2019m not sure how many times I have to tell you,\u2019 he grinds. \u2018When I\u2019m talking to you, you look at me.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s saying that because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say. \u2018And what will you say if I do look at you?\u2019 I ask, because I don\u2019t need to see disgust or guilt or sympathy.</p><p>\u2018If you look at me, you\u2019ll find out.\u2019 He hunkers down to get in the field of my dropped vision, prompting me to glance up. I find his beautiful face completely expressionless, and while I usually find this frustrating, right now I\u2019m relieved because with no expression, there is no contempt or any of the other emotions that I don\u2019t want to see. \u2018You\u2019re still my habit, Livy. Don\u2019t ask me to give you up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re disgusted with me,\u2019 I whisper, forcing my voice to remain steady. I don\u2019t want to cry on him again.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m disgusted with myself.\u2019 He tentatively lifts his hand and seeks out my nape, watching me closely for any signs of denial. I won\u2019t deny him. I\u2019ll never deny him. I know my face must be as hard to read as his right now, and that is because I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m feeling. Part of me is relieved; a huge part is still ashamed and another part, the biggest part of all, is acknowledging what Miller Hart means to me.</p><p>Comfort.</p><p>Refuge.</p><p>Love.</p><p>I\u2019ve fallen. This beautiful man fills me with far more comfort and offers far more refuge than my life strategies ever have. When he\u2019s not scorning me or reminding me of my manners, he\u2019s overdosing me with adoration, but even the irritating parts of him are stupidly comforting. I\u2019m as much in love with the fake gentleman as I am with the attentive lover. I love him \u2013 all of him.</p><p>His lips twitch at the corners, but it\u2019s nerves. I can tell that much. \u2018I hate the thought of you like that. You should never have been put in that situation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I put myself in that situation. I drank to get through it, even if it made me stupid. William sent me away when he realised who I was, but I was determined. I was stupid.\u2019</p><p>He blinks lazily, trying to absorb being bombarded with my reality. My mother\u2019s history. And my history, too. \u2018Please, come back inside.\u2019</p><p>I nod faintly, and he exhales in relief, putting his arm around my shoulder and tucking me into his chest. We walk slowly and silently back to his apartment.</p><p>After sitting me on the couch and placing my bag and shoes under the table, he goes straight to his drinks cabinet and pours some dark liquid into a tumbler, quickly downing it before refilling. His hands are braced on the edge, his head dropped. It\u2019s too quiet. Uncomfortable. I need to know what\u2019s ticking in that complex mind of his.</p><p>After the long, difficult silence, he picks his drink up and makes his way over to my shrinking form, taking a seat on the glass table and placing his drink down, shifting it a tiny bit. He eventually sighs. \u2018Livy, I\u2019m doing a terrible job of pretending that this hasn\u2019t knocked me sideways.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are,\u2019 I agree.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re so . . . well, lovely \u2013 pure in a healthy way. I love that.\u2019</p><p>I frown. \u2018Because you get to walk all over me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it\u2019s just . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018What, Miller? It\u2019s just what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re different. Your beauty starts here.\u2019 He leans in and runs his palm across my cheek, hypnotising me with his intense blue gaze. Then he slowly drags it down my throat and onto my chest. \u2018And goes all the way to here. Deep into here. It shines through those sapphire eyes, Olivia Taylor. I saw it the moment I looked at you.\u2019 My emotions are choking me, the mention of sapphire eyes bringing back fond memories of my granddad. \u2018I want to surrender myself to you completely, Livy. I want to be yours. You are my perfect.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m shocked. But I don\u2019t voice it. For Miller to say I\u2019m his perfect, given his crazily perfect world, is . . . crazy.</p><p>He grabs my hands and kisses my knuckles. \u2018I don\u2019t care what happened years ago.\u2019 His forehead wrinkles and he begins to shake his head. \u2018No, I apologise. I do care, I f**king hate that you did that. I don\u2019t understand why.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I felt lost,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018Granddad kept things together after my mum vanished. He battled with Nan\u2019s grief for years and disguised his own. Then he died. He\u2019d hidden my mother\u2019s journal all that time.\u2019 I draw breath and continue before I lose my flow or Miller loses his mind. He looks more and more shocked by the second. \u2018She wrote about all of these men showering her with gifts and attention. Maybe I could find that, and find her too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your nan loved you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan wasn\u2019t capable of anything when Granddad died. She spent every hour of every day crying and praying for answers. She couldn\u2019t see me through her grief.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s eyes clench shut but I go on, despite him clearly struggling.</p><p>\u2018I left and found William. He was taken by me.\u2019 Miller\u2019s teeth are gritting now. \u2018It didn\u2019t take him long to make the connection and he sent me away. But I went back. Now I had an idea of how it worked. I was even more determined to see if I could find out anything about my mum, but I never did. All I felt was shame when I let one of them have me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, please.\u2019 Miller\u2019s cheeks puff and release a slow stream of air, an obvious attempt to calm himself.</p><p>\u2018William took me home, and I found Nan in a worse state than when I\u2019d left. She was in such a dark place. I felt so guilty and I realised it was my job to take care of her now. We only had each other. I never returned to William and I\u2019ve never given myself to anyone since. Nan\u2019s never known where I went and what I did. She never can.\u2019</p><p>My clouded vision sees wide blue eyes and a stoic face. It\u2019s out there now. No going back.</p><p>He seems to shake himself back to life, squeezing my hands in his. \u2018Promise me you won\u2019t ever degrade yourself like that again. I beg you.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t hesitate. \u2018I promise.\u2019 It\u2019s the easiest promise that I\u2019ve ever made. That\u2019s all he has to say? There\u2019s no look of contempt or disgust. \u2018I promise,\u2019 I affirm. \u2018I promise, I promise, I pro\u2014\u2019 I don\u2019t get any further. He moves in fast, taking me down to my back, and completely drowns me in his mouth\u2019s attention, kissing me until I\u2019m literally seeing stars. He\u2019s moaning into my neck, kissing his way over my cheek, thrusting his tongue into my mouth. He\u2019s everywhere. \u2018I promise,\u2019 I moan. \u2018I promise.\u2019</p><p>He grapples with the shirt I\u2019m wearing, pulling it open to access my body. \u2018You\u2019d better not,\u2019 he warns seriously, trailing his lips down my neck and onto my chest. His mouth locks around my tingling nipple and sucks hard, and I\u2019m arching my back and throwing my hands into action. They home in on his strong shoulders, my nails scraping at him, and then I feel his fingers between my thighs, separating me, and his head starts moving down. He sends me delirious with a firm, hot lick up my centre before he\u2019s on his way up my body again and plunging into my mouth. \u2018So ready,\u2019 he mumbles.</p><p>\u2018Inside. I want you inside me.\u2019 I\u2019m demanding, desperate for him to scrub away the last hour of agonising confessions and judgments. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>He growls, firming up his kiss. \u2018Condom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit!\u2019 he barks, jumping up and pulling me to my feet. He stoops and throws me onto his shoulder, urgently pacing to the bedroom where he lowers me to the bed and immediately removes his boxers before finding a condom and making quick work of rolling it on.</p><p>I\u2019m impatient as I watch him, willing him to hurry up before I lose my screwed-up mind. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I pant, reaching up to stroke down the centre of his stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushes me to my back and falls to his fists, one on each side of my head. He\u2019s breathless, his hair falling forward, his eyes hungry. \u2018This is what it\u2019s all about.\u2019 He rolls his h*ps and drives into me on a suppressed gasp, holding himself deep while he tries to stabilise his uneven breathing. I cry out. \u2018This is pleasure.\u2019 He retreats and pushes forward on another burst of air, coaxing another shout of gratification from me. \u2018This is feeling.\u2019 Back he draws before thrusting forward again. \u2018This is how it\u2019ll always be.\u2019 His pace is meticulous, smooth and perfectly precise. \u2018This is us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want it to be,\u2019 I breathe, meeting his advances with constant swivels of my hips. His eyes are smiling, and then like a sun breaking through the grey clouds on an overcast, smoggy day in London, his mouth smiles, too \u2013 his perfectly straight, white teeth on full display, his eyes sparkling wildly. He accepts me. All of me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up, not that you had a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want a choice.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You know it makes perfect sense.\u2019 He drops to his forearms and gets our faces nose to nose, delivering delicious deep grinds over and over. My hands are all over his back, my knees bent and spread, and his shirt a creased-up mess, pooling my body. \u2018I have a fascinating habit,\u2019 he says, scanning my face.</p><p>\u2018Me too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s the most beautiful thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My habit is mystifying.\u2019 I groan and lift my head to capture his lips. \u2018He\u2019s in disguise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Disguise?\u2019 he asks around my mouth, meeting my demanding tongue with his own.</p> <p>\u2018He\u2019s disguised as a gentleman.\u2019</p><p>A cough of surprise falls past his lips. \u2018If I wasn\u2019t enjoying myself so much right now, I\u2019d challenge you for your cheek. I am a gentleman.\u2019 He jerks forward and bites my lip. \u2018Bollocks!\u2019</p><p>\u2018A gentleman doesn\u2019t swear!\u2019 I shout, linking my legs around his waist and tightening them, pushing into his rock-hard arse.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh God! Faster!\u2019 My hands push into his neck, forcing his lips harder to mine.</p><p>\u2018Savoured,\u2019 he argues weakly. \u2018I\u2019ll enjoy you slowly.\u2019</p> <p>He might be enjoying me slowly, but I\u2019m losing my mind fast. His control is beyond comprehension. How does he do it? \u2018You want to go faster,\u2019 I goad him, yanking at his dishevelled mop.</p><p>\u2018Wrong.\u2019 He pulls his head away, making me lose my grip. \u2018I didn\u2019t before, and I especially don\u2019t now.\u2019</p><p>His harsh reminder of what came before the rightness of this moment halts my tempting tactic in their tracks. \u2018Thank you for keeping me,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t thank me. This is happening.\u2019 He abruptly pulls out and gently turns me over, pulling my h*ps upward before slowly sliding back into me. My face buries in the pillow, biting at the cotton as he continuously thrusts back and forth, painstakingly slowly. He\u2019s wreaking havoc on my senses, and I find my body falling into his momentum, gliding back onto each of his drives. He\u2019s moving again, flipping me back over and guiding my legs until they\u2019re draped over his shoulders and he\u2019s inside me once more, pushing deep.</p><p>He\u2019s sweating, his waves a delightful mess of wet and his stubble glistening. \u2018I love seeing your body move.\u2019</p><p>I allow my eyes a glimpse of his chest, finding ripples of muscle riding up his torso with every push forward. I\u2019m on the brink of detonation, but trying to rein it in so I can indulge in him some more. Finding his eyes again, I warm further when he blesses me with another one of his beautiful smiles.</p><p>\u2018I guarantee you, Livy. What you\u2019re looking at isn\u2019t a whisper of the beauty in my view.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wrong,\u2019 I breathe seriously, reaching up to touch him. He exceeds perfection to the point of inflicting pain on my eyes.</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019ll agree to disagree, sweet girl.\u2019 He grinds with purpose, making it impossible for me to argue with him. \u2018Good?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I concur.\u2019 He drops a shoulder, letting my leg slide down his arm so he can lower his torso. \u2018Put your hands above your head.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to touch you,\u2019 I complain, my wandering hands going off on a feeling frenzy.</p><p>\u2018Put your hands over your head, Livy.\u2019 He reinforces his command with a sharp thrust, sending my head flying back, along with my hands. Lowering to his forearms, he rests his palms on the undersides of my arms and strokes to match the tempo of his hips. His blue eyes are wild with passion.</p><p>\u2018Are you ready, Livy?\u2019</p><p>I nod, then shake my head, then nod again. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>He groans, taking his rhythm up a level. \u2018Livy, I\u2019m going to send you crazy with pleasure daily, so you\u2019re going to have to learn to control your body.\u2019</p><p>Now my head is shaking, my body being attacked by persistent shots of pleasure. It\u2019s becoming too much. \u2018Please,\u2019 I beg, looking up into eyes full of triumph. He loves making me crazy. He thrives on it. \u2018You\u2019re doing this on purpose.\u2019</p><p>My other leg is released and he completely cages me in with his body, preventing me from wriggling, moving, or shaking. I can\u2019t hold out any longer. I\u2019ll pass out.</p><p>\u2018Of course I am,\u2019 he agrees. \u2018If you could see what I\u2019m seeing, you\u2019d drag it out, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t torture me,\u2019 I groan, flicking my h*ps up.</p><p>He dips and kisses me. \u2018I\u2019m not torturing you, Livy. I\u2019m showing you how it should be.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re making me crazy,\u2019 I breathe. He doesn\u2019t need to show me. He\u2019s done that every time he\u2019s worshipped me.</p><p>\u2018And it\u2019s the most satisfying sight.\u2019 He bites at my lip. \u2018Would you like to come?\u2019</p><p>I nod and lift my arms from my head, and he doesn\u2019t stop me. I find his shoulders, my hands slipping everywhere, and kiss the hell out of him. I\u2019m relentless with my tongue as he pushes me higher and higher, and then it happens. He bucks on a yell, I scream on a violent arch of my body, and we both begin to shake and pulse. I\u2019m utterly replete, and once my shakes have subsided, I\u2019m totally limp. Useless. I can\u2019t talk, I can\u2019t move, and I can\u2019t see straight. He\u2019s twitching within me, still circling firmly.</p><p>\u2018Do you want the good news or the bad news?\u2019 he puffs into my neck, but I can\u2019t answer him. I\u2019m breathless, my mind scrambled, and I attempt a shrug that is executed as more of a spasm. \u2018I\u2019ll give you the bad news,\u2019 he says when it becomes obvious that an answer is not forthcoming. \u2018The bad news is I\u2019m paralysed. I can\u2019t bloody move, Livy.\u2019</p><p>If I had the energy, I\u2019d smile, but I\u2019m a despondent pile of twitching nerve endings. So I hum my response and attempt a little squeeze of him. It\u2019s feeble.</p><p>\u2018The good news is,\u2019 he pants, \u2018we haven\u2019t got to go anywhere, so we can stay like this for ever. Am I heavy?\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s very heavy but I haven\u2019t got the strength or inclination to tell him so. He\u2019s all over me, covering every square inch, our sweaty skin rubbing everywhere. I hum my non-committal reply again, my eyes closing with exhaustion.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 he whispers softly.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No matter what happened, you really are my sweet girl. Nothing will change that.\u2019</p><p>My eyes open and I find the energy to respond. \u2018I\u2019m a woman, Miller,\u2019 I say, needing him to realise I\u2019m no girl. I\u2019m a woman and I have needs, and one of those needs \u2013 the biggest one \u2013 is now Miller Hart.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>It was inevitable that he would abandon me. All his actions, reassuring words and comfort were far too good to be true. I should have known that from the guilt plaguing his face when he stopped me from leaving. I wish he\u2019d never come after me. I wish he\u2019d never let his compassion take over and force him into comforting me. It\u2019s made it so much harder to bear. The darkness is constant and the agony relentless. Everything hurts \u2013 my brain for thinking too much, my body for missing his touch and my eyes for not seeing him. I\u2019m not sure how long it has been since he left me. Days. Weeks. Months. It could be longer.</p><p>I dare not venture from my silent darkness. I dare not present my injured soul to the world, which puts me further into seclusion than I ever was before I met Miller Hart.</p><p>Tears start to pour from my eyes. Visions of my mother\u2019s face morph into mine, and my head jerks from the lash of my nan\u2019s palm slapping my face.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Leave me alone,\u2019 I sob, pulling my numb body onto my stomach and hiding my tear-drenched face in the pillow.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 Hands start to pull at my body and I fight them away, not wanting to face anyone or anything. \u2018Livy, please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get off me!\u2019 I scream, thrashing my body aimlessly everywhere.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly pinned to the mattress, my flailing hands held firmly by my sides.</p><p>\u2018Livy, open your eyes.\u2019</p><p>My head starts shaking and my eyes clench tighter. I\u2019m not ready to face the world yet \u2013 probably never will be. My arms are released and my head held still, then the familiar softness of slow-moving lips are on my mouth, and I can hear the low hum that I love so much.</p><p>My eyes fly open and I scramble to sit up \u2013 shocked, disorientated and sweating. I\u2019m having heart palpitations and I can\u2019t see anything with my wild hair messy and falling all over my face. \u2018Miller?\u2019 My hair is pushed from my eyes and he slowly comes into my line of sight, concern etched all over his impossibly beautiful face.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m here, Livy.\u2019</p><p>Awareness finally hits me and I launch myself onto his kneeling body, knocking him to his back. I\u2019m deranged but relieved, terrified but calm.</p><p>It was just a dream.</p><p>A dream that made me feel all too vividly how it might be if he\u2019s gone. \u2018Promise me you won\u2019t abandon me,\u2019 I mumble. \u2018Promise me you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey, whatever\u2019s brought this on?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just say it.\u2019 I sink my face into his neck, unwilling to let him go. I\u2019ve had dreams before, I\u2019ve woken up and wondered if they\u2019ve really happened, but this was different. This was frighteningly real. I can still feel the ache in my chest and the panic engulfing me, even now when he\u2019s got me firmly in his arms.</p><p>It takes some effort on his part, but he eventually prises my clawed fingers from his back and detaches me from his body. Sitting up and placing me between his thighs, he circles my neck completely with his palms and tilts my head until our gazes lock, mine brimming with tears, his with tenderness. \u2018I\u2019m not your mother,\u2019 he says firmly.</p><p>\u2018It hurt so much.\u2019 I\u2019m sobbing, trying to reassure myself that it was just a dream \u2013 a stupid, stupid dream.</p><p>His face falls. \u2018Your mother walked out on you, Livy. Of course it hurt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I shake my head in his hold. \u2018That doesn\u2019t hurt any more.\u2019 This new fear has drowned any sense of abandonment that I felt before. \u2018I\u2019m better off without her.\u2019 He winces, his eyes closing painfully at my harshness. I don\u2019t care. \u2018I\u2019m talking about you,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018You left me.\u2019 I\u2019m aware that I sound needy and weak, but my desperation is crippling me. Compared to how I\u2019m feeling now, coping with my mother\u2019s abandonment seems like a breeze. Miller\u2019s shown me comfort. He\u2019s accepted me. \u2018I\u2019ve never felt pain like it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I cut him off. He needs to know. I move from his personal space, shifting myself across the bed so I\u2019m out of touching distance.</p><p>\u2018Livy, what are you doing?\u2019 he asks, reaching for me. \u2018Come here.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You need to know something,\u2019 I murmur nervously, refusing to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s more?\u2019 he blurts, pulling his reaching hand back, like I might bite him. He\u2019s cautious, wary. It doesn\u2019t boost my confidence. I\u2019ve shocked Miller Hart with my dirty little secrets, more than he\u2019s ever shocked me with his moods \u2013 transforming from domineering to passive and from cold-hearted to loving faster than I can keep up with.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s one more thing,\u2019 I admit, hearing him draw breath, preparing himself for what I might hit him with next. For him, this might be the biggest shock of all.</p><p>\u2018I believe we might be conversing, Livy.\u2019 His tone is clipped and intimidating, the one that makes me take notice, whether I scoff at it or cower. Right now, I\u2019m cowering.</p> <p>\u2018You still fascinate me,\u2019 I say, looking up at him. \u2018All of your set ways, your faffing with things when they\u2019re already perfect, and the way you have to have things just so.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s frowning at me, and for a split second I think he might deny it. But he doesn\u2019t. \u2018Take me as I am, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elaborate,\u2019 he demands harshly, making me cower further.</p><p>\u2018You take command over me,\u2019 I start nervously, \u2018and it should probably frighten me or perhaps have me telling you to piss off, but . . .</p> <p>\u2018I believe you might have told me to go to hell last night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your fault.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Probably,\u2019 he relents on a grunt and a roll of those blistering blue eyes. \u2018Continue.\u2019</p><p>I smile inwardly. He\u2019s doing it right now \u2013 being brusque and starched, but it\u2019s terribly alluring, even when it\u2019s bloody infuriating. I feel so safe with him. \u2018I don\u2019t know whether my heart can survive you,\u2019 I say quietly, watching closely for his reaction, \u2018but I want to take you as you are.\u2019 I shouldn\u2019t be surprised when his expression remains completely blank, and I\u2019m not, but those eyes tell me a little something. They\u2019re telling me he knows how I feel already. He\u2019d be pretty stupid not to. \u2018I\u2019ve fallen.\u2019</p><p>His blue gaze touches my soul. It\u2019s now full of knowing and understanding. \u2018Why are you on the other side of the bed, Livy?\u2019 he asks, his voice low and sure.</p><p>My eyes travel the distance between our bodies, noting a good metre of mattress between us. Perhaps I did go over the top with my decision to distance myself, but I didn\u2019t want to feel his body stiffen when I uttered those words. I\u2019ve not said it, but Miller is an intelligent man. My cards have been slowly laid, and now they are face up for all to see.</p> <p>\u2018I . . . I . . . I didn\u2019t . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why are you on the other side of the bed, Livy?\u2019</p><p>Our eyes connect. He\u2019s looking at me sternly, like he really is mad about my distance, but I can still see understanding in them, too. \u2018I . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve already repeated myself.\u2019 He cuts me off completely. \u2018Don\u2019t make me do it again.\u2019</p><p>I hesitate too long, going to shift towards him but quickly drawing back, wondering what\u2019s running though that multi-layered mind of his.</p><p>\u2018Overthinking, Livy,\u2019 he warns. \u2018Give me my thing.\u2019</p><p>I inch forward slowly, but he doesn\u2019t welcome me with open arms or encourage me. He just watches me blackly, following my eyes as they get closer and closer until I\u2019m gently crawling onto his lap and circling his shoulders tentatively with my arms. I feel his palms gently rest on my h*ps and begin a languid caress of my back while he slowly lowers his face into my hair until we\u2019re locked together, completely encasing each other . . . just holding each other. Miller Hart\u2019s thing has fast become my thing, too. Nothing will ever beat the sense of refuge and solace that I get from a simple cuddle delivered by Miller. His touch soaks up all of the anguish and despair.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure if I can function without you,\u2019 I say softly. \u2018I feel like you\u2019ve become a vital part of what keeps me breathing.\u2019 I\u2019m not exaggerating. That dream was chillingly real, and that feeling alone is enough to make me spill. But he\u2019s too quiet. I can feel his heart beating under my chest, and it\u2019s steady, not shocked and erratic, but that\u2019s all I can feel. I\u2019m very rapidly considering what he must be thinking \u2013 probably that I\u2019m stupid and naive. I\u2019ve never experienced this before, but these feelings are intense, uncontrollable. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m equipped for them, and I\u2019m even less confident that Miller is. \u2018Please speak,\u2019 I plead quietly, following up my request with a little squeeze. \u2018Say something.\u2019</p> <p>He accepts my squeeze, reciprocating with his own, and then he withdraws from the sanctuary of my neck and takes a deep breath, letting it stream from his lips slowly and calmly. I take a deep breath too, except I hold mine.</p><p>Smoothing his palms up my spine, his hand finds my hair and starts combing through with his fingers as he watches. Then he slowly brings his eyes to mine. \u2018This beautiful, pure girl has fallen in love with the big bad wolf.\u2019</p><p>My eyebrows meet in the middle. \u2018You\u2019re not a big bad wolf,\u2019 I argue, not thinking to deny his other conclusion. He\u2019s absolutely right, and I\u2019m not ashamed of it. I am in love with him. \u2018And I thought we established that I\u2019m not so sweet.\u2019 I want to feel his hair and his lips, but he looks despondent, almost troubled by the knowledge that someone loves him.</p><p>\u2018We established nothing of the sort. You\u2019re my sweet girl, and we\u2019ll be leaving that line of conversation exactly there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 I succumb immediately and easily, hating his curt delivery but secretly loving the words he\u2019s used. I\u2019m his.</p><p>He sighs and kisses me chastely. \u2018You must be hungry. Let me make you supper.\u2019 He starts to untangle our bodies and places me on my feet, running his eyes down my body. I\u2019m still wearing his shirt, buttons undone, hanging open, and it\u2019s creased beyond creased. \u2018Look at the state of that,\u2019 he muses on a subtle shake of his head. And just like that, he\u2019s switched back to perfect, precise Miller Hart, like I haven\u2019t just confessed my love for him.</p><p>\u2018Maybe you should invest in non-iron shirts,\u2019 I say thoughtfully, pulling the two sides together.</p><p>\u2018Cheap material.\u2019 He pushes my hands away and starts buttoning me up, and even straightens the collar before nodding his half-hearted approval and taking my nape.</p><p>He\u2019s already wearing a pair of shorts, which means only one thing. While I was having terrible nightmares, my finicky, fine Miller was tidying up.</p><p>\u2018Please, sit,\u2019 he says when we arrive in the kitchen, releasing me from his grasp. \u2018What would you like?\u2019</p><p>I park my bum on the chair, the coolness on my bottom reminding me that I have no knickers on. \u2018I\u2019ll have what you\u2019re having.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m having bruschetta. Will you join me?\u2019 He takes numerous containers from the fridge and turns the grill on.</p><p>He means tomatoes, I think. \u2018Sure,\u2019 I reply, placing my hands in my lap in preparation for him to set the eating area. I should offer to help but I know my consideration won\u2019t be appreciated. Nevertheless, I do anyway. I might surprise myself \u2013 and Miller \u2013 and get it all right. \u2018I\u2019ll lay the table.\u2019 I get up, not missing the tensing of his shoulders as he slowly turns towards me.</p><p>\u2018No, please, let me tend to you.\u2019 He\u2019s using his whole worshipping business as an excuse to prevent me from screwing up his perfection.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d like to.\u2019 I dismiss his worry and make my way over to the cupboard where I know the dishes to be, while Miller reluctantly starts coating some bread with olive oil. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you just tell me about your club?\u2019 I ask, keen to distract him from the potential of his sweet girl screwing up his perfect table. I slide two plates from the cupboard and make my way back to the table, setting them down neatly.</p><p>He\u2019s wary, his eyes flicking from the plates to me as he finishes up with the oil. \u2018I told you. I don\u2019t like mixing business with pleasure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019ll never talk about work with me?\u2019 I ask, heading for the stack of drawers.</p><p>\u2018No. It\u2019s draining.\u2019 He slides the tray full of bread under the grill and sets about tidying up the mess that isn\u2019t there. \u2018When I\u2019m with you, I want to concentrate on only you.\u2019</p><p>I falter as I collect two pairs of knives and forks. \u2018I can live with that,\u2019 I say on a small smile.</p><p>\u2018Who said you have a choice?\u2019</p><p>My smile widens as I face him. \u2018I don\u2019t want a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then this is a pointless conversation, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Agreed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u2019 he says seriously, pulling the lightly toasted bread from under the grill. \u2018Would you like wine with your supper?\u2019</p><p>Again, I\u2019m faltering, certain I\u2019ve not heard him right. After everything I\u2019ve told him? \u2018I\u2019ll have water.\u2019 I pad back to the island.</p><p>\u2018With bruschetta?\u2019 He sounds disgusted. \u2018No, you have chianti with bruschetta. There\u2019s a bottle on the drinks cabinet and the glasses are in the left-hand cupboard.\u2019 He nods towards the lounge while neatly spooning the prepared tomato mixture onto the toast and setting it on a white platter.</p><p>After placing the knives and forks as accurately as possible, I make my way to the drinks cabinet, finding dozens of wine bottles, all displayed in tidy rows, labels facing outward. Not daring to touch them, I bend slightly to start reading the labels, getting through every single bottle and finding nothing named chianti. I straighten and frown, running my eyes over all of the bottles gracing the surface of the cabinet, noting them grouped according to the alcoholic drink contained in each one. It\u2019s then I see a basket containing a dumpy bottle and as I close in, I see the label says \u2018Chianti\u2019. It\u2019s also open.</p><p>\u2018Bingo.\u2019 I smile, taking the bottle from the wicker container and opening the left cupboard to pick two glasses. They all sparkle when the artificial light from the room hits the cut glass, and I admire the shards of light ricocheting between them for a few moments, before collecting two and making my way back. \u2018Chianti and two glasses,\u2019 I declare, holding up my finds, but quickly halting when I see my effort to lay a perfect table has been a complete waste of time. He\u2019s just tweaking the freshly laundered napkins into accurate triangles to the left side of each place setting as he looks up.</p><p>I\u2019m frowning at him, but he\u2019s frowning at me, too. I have no idea why. He studies the bottle, then the glasses, and in total exasperation, strides over and takes it all from my hands. I\u2019m completely dismayed as I watch him take it all back to the cabinet, putting the bottle back in the basket and the glasses back in the cupboard. I saw the label. It said \u2018Chianti\u2019, and I may not be a connoisseur of wine, but they were definitely wine glasses.</p><p>My frown only deepens when he takes two other glasses from the very same cupboard, and then takes the basket containing the wine and starts back across the room. \u2018Are you going to sit?\u2019 he asks, ushering me to the table when he reaches me.</p><p>I answer him by lowering my bum to the chair and watching as he sets the glasses down to the right side above the knives. Then he puts the basket containing the wine between us. Not happy with the items\u2019 final resting places, he shifts them all before taking the wine and pouring a few inches into my glass.</p><p>\u2018What did I do?\u2019 I ask, still frowning.</p><p>\u2018Chianti is traditionally kept in a fiasco.\u2019 He pours himself a few inches, too. \u2018And the glasses you picked are for white wine.\u2019</p><p>Looking at the glasses, now a fraction full of red wine, I frown even more. \u2018Does it matter?\u2019</p><p>He looks at me all shocked, and on a little gape of his luscious mouth. \u2018Yes, of course it matters. Red wine glasses are wider because the increased exposure to air helps the deeper and more multifaceted flavours of red wine to develop fully.\u2019 He takes a sip and rolls it around his mouth for a few seconds. I half expect him to spit it out, but he doesn\u2019t. He swallows and continues. \u2018The greater surface area allows higher air exposure and the wider bowl of a red wine glass allows more wine to be exposed at any one time.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m speechless and feeling rather uncultured and intimidated. \u2018I knew that,\u2019 I grumble, picking up my own glass. \u2018You\u2019re such a smart arse.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s fighting a smile, I know it. I wish he\u2019d just loosen up with the sophistication and uptight manners that being at a dinner table especially brings, and flash me that heart-stopping smile. \u2018I\u2019m a smart arse because I appreciate beautiful things?\u2019 He raises his perfect eyebrows as he raises his perfect glass containing the perfect wine, taking a perfectly slow and suggestive sip with those perfect lips.</p><p>\u2018Appreciate or obsess about?\u2019 I put the word out there because if there\u2019s one thing about Miller Hart that I\u2019m absolutely certain of, it\u2019s that he\u2019s obsessive, and he\u2019s obsessive about most things in his life. And I hope that one of those things is me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m more inclined to appreciate.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m more inclined to obsess.\u2019</p><p>He cocks his head, amused. \u2018Are you talking in code, sweet girl?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you good at cracking codes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The master,\u2019 he utters low, licking his lips, making me squirm on my chair. \u2018I\u2019ve cracked you.\u2019 He tips his glass toward me. \u2018I\u2019ve also conquered you.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t argue with him; he has, so I reach over and take some bruschetta. \u2018This looks delicious.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I concur,\u2019 he says, taking a piece for himself. I sink my teeth in on a satisfied hum, quickly noting that I\u2019m being looked at in disapproval again. My chewing slows, wondering what I\u2019ve done now. I soon find out. He picks up his knife and fork and makes a stupidly slow display of slicing his way through the bread before slowly taking the piece from the fork and setting his cutlery down neatly. He starts to chew as he watches me heating with embarrassment. I need to take some lessons in refinement.</p><p>\u2018Do I annoy you?\u2019 I ask, setting down my bruschetta and following his lead.</p><p>\u2018Annoy me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Far from it, Livy. Except when you\u2019re being a little reckless.\u2019 He hits me with a disapproving look, which I choose to sidestep. \u2018You fascinate me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With my common ways?\u2019 I ask quietly.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re not common.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re a snob . . .\u2019 I pause briefly as he coughs his surprise. \u2018Sometimes,\u2019 I add. My beautiful man in disguise is generally a gentleman, except when he\u2019s being an arrogant twat.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think well-mannered classifies as snobbery.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re more than well-mannered, Miller.\u2019 I sigh, resisting the urge to put my elbows on the table. \u2018I quite like it, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like I\u2019ve said before, Livy. Take me as I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As I have you.\u2019</p><p>I recoil on the inside, a little injured by his remark. He means that he\u2019s accepted my shameful history and lack of manners, that\u2019s what he means \u2013 I\u2019ve accepted him for being a part-time gentleman with a fascinating compulsion to have everything in his life perfect, while he\u2019s accepted me for being a careless tart who doesn\u2019t know her white wine glass from her red. He\u2019s right, though, and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s accepted me, but he doesn\u2019t need to remind me of my shortcomings.</p> <p>\u2018Overthinking, Livy,\u2019 he says quietly, snapping me from my mental deliberation.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t understand . . .</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re being silly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it!\u2019 he shouts, shifting his recently placed wine glass at the same time. \u2018Just accept that it\u2019s happening, like I said it would.\u2019 I retreat in my chair cautiously, keeping quiet. \u2018I\u2019ve already told you that I don\u2019t necessarily understand, but it\u2019s happening and there is nothing neither I nor you can, or should, do about it.\u2019 He swipes his glass up, making his action of a second ago completely pointless, and takes a violent swig \u2013 not a sip, he doesn\u2019t savour the taste; he swigs it.</p><p>He\u2019s really mad.</p><p>\u2018Shit,\u2019 he spits, slamming his glass down and grabbing his head. \u2018Livy, I . . .\u2019 He sighs and pushes himself out of his chair, holding his hands out to me. \u2018Please, come here.\u2019</p><p>I sigh too, getting up from the table on a frustrated shake of my head and making my way around to him, quickly climbing onto his lap and letting him apologise with his thing.</p><p>\u2018I apologise,\u2019 he whispers, kissing my hair. \u2018It upsets me when you talk like that, like you\u2019re not worthy. I\u2019m the unworthy one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not true,\u2019 I say, pulling back so I can get his lovely face in my sight. And it really is lovely, his signature shadow holding fort and his light-blue eyes glistening. Reaching up, I take a wave of his hair and twist it gently between my fingers.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll agree to disagree.\u2019 He drops his mouth to mine and reinforces his apology with a lazy dance of his tongue with mine. The world is right again, but the flashes of that temper he\u2019s warned me of are becoming a concern. He always looks momentarily feral, and I can see with clarity his battle to rein it in.</p><p>After apologising thoroughly, he turns me around on his lap and feeds me some bruschetta, and then takes some for himself. We eat in a comfortable silence, but I\u2019m a bit bemused that Miller\u2019s table manners accept me on his lap, but it won\u2019t accept the bottle of wine slightly off position.</p><p>It\u2019s all calm and lovely until the sound of his iPhone breaks our peaceful supper, ringing persistently from somewhere behind me. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he says, lifting me from his lap and pacing over to a set of shelves by the fridge. I definitely see a look of irritation when he glances at the screen before answering. \u2018Miller Hart.\u2019 He walks from the kitchen, leaving me to settle back on my chair. \u2018It\u2019s no problem,\u2019 he assures whoever\u2019s on the other end of the line, his bare back disappearing from view.</p><p>I take the opportunity while he\u2019s away from the table to study the set-up, again trying to work out if there\u2019s a theory to his madness. I reach over and pick up the platter in a silly test to see if there is an outline which marks its place. Of course there isn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from picking up my plate to check under there too. Nothing. Smiling, I reach the swift conclusion that there are outlines for everything, but only Miller can see them. Then I take my red wine glass and stick my nose in the top before sipping cautiously.</p><p>My attention is pulled to Miller when he re-enters the kitchen and pops his phone back where it belongs in the docking station. \u2018That was the manager of Ice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The manager?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, Tony. He takes care of things in my absence.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have an interview tomorrow. He was just confirming times.\u2019</p><p>\u2018An interview for a newspaper?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, about the opening of London\u2019s new elite club.\u2019 He starts loading the dishwasher. \u2018Six tomorrow evening. Would you like to come with me?\u2019</p><p>My spirits lift to stupid heights. \u2018I thought you didn\u2019t mix business with pleasure.\u2019 I arch an eyebrow at him, and he arches one right back, making me grin.</p><p>\u2018Would you like to come?\u2019 he repeats.</p><p>I\u2019m smiling properly now. \u2018Where is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018At Ice. I\u2019ll take you for dinner after.\u2019 He casts me a sideways glance. \u2018It\u2019s rude not to accept a gentleman\u2019s offer to wine and dine you,\u2019 he says seriously. \u2018Ask your grandmother.\u2019</p><p>I laugh and start to collect the dishes from the table. \u2018Offer accepted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jolly good, Miss Taylor.\u2019 There\u2019s humour in his tone, and it widens my smile. \u2018May I suggest you call your grandmother?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You may.\u2019 I slide the last of the dishes on the counter, leaving Miller to reshuffle and load. \u2018Which drawer will I find my things in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Second from bottom. And be quick. I have a habit that I want to lose myself with under the sheets.\u2019 He\u2019s serious and stern . . . and I couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>I drifted off to the calming tone of Miller humming sweetly in my ear, kissing my hair repeatedly and surrounding me in his thing. I know he got out of bed to pick up his boxers and shirt that I left strewn on the floor, but he was soon back, cuddling up behind me.</p><p>When I woke, he was already up, showered and suited with his side of the bed made. I lay there for a few moments, thinking how me entering his life has played havoc with his perfectly assembled and organised world before I was ordered to get up and get dressed. With a lack of other clothes, I was delivered home in my freshly laundered dress, much to Nan\u2019s delight.</p><p>After showering, texting Gregory to advise him that I\u2019m alive, and readying myself for work, I dart down the stairs with only twenty minutes to get my happy arse to the bistro. Nan\u2019s waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs, her cheerful face a pleasure to see, but the diary in her hand, not so much.</p><p>\u2018Ask Miller about dinner,\u2019 she orders as I slip my denim jacket on. She flicks the pages of her diary and runs her wrinkled finger down the dates. \u2018I can do tonight, but I can\u2019t do tomorrow or Wednesday. Tonight\u2019s cutting it a little fine, but I have time to pop to Harrods. Or we could do Saturday . . . oh, no we can\u2019t. I have a tea and cakes meeting.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller has an interview this evening.\u2019</p><p>Her old navy blues fly up in surprise. \u2018An interview?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, for the new bar he\u2019s opened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller owns a bar? Goodness me!\u2019 She snaps her diary shut. \u2018You mean to say he\u2019ll be in the paper?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I swing my satchel across my body. \u2018He\u2019s picking me up from work so I won\u2019t be here for tea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How exciting! How about Saturday for dinner? I can rearrange my diary.\u2019</p><p>It staggers me how my grandmother\u2019s social life is more active than mine . . . or it was until recently. \u2018I\u2019ll ask him,\u2019 I pacify her, opening the front door.</p><p>\u2018Call him now.\u2019</p><p>I turn on a frown. \u2018I\u2019ll be seeing him later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no.\u2019 She points to my satchel. \u2018I need to know now. I\u2019ll have to go shopping and call the community centre to rearrange the tea and cakes meeting. I can\u2019t just fall into line with you and Miller.\u2019</p><p>I inwardly laugh. \u2018Let\u2019s have dinner next week, then,\u2019 I suggest, solving the problem immediately.</p><p>Her old, thin lips purse. \u2018Make the call!\u2019 she insists, prompting me to immediately dive into my bag for my phone. I can\u2019t deny her the excitement, not now Miller and I seem to be on the same page.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I soothe, dialling Miller under her watchful eyes.</p><p>He answers in an instant. \u2018Miller Hart,\u2019 he says, all formal and businesslike.</p><p>I frown down the line. \u2018Do you have my number stored?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why are you answering like you don\u2019t know who it is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Habit.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head and glance up to see Nan frowning, too. \u2018Are you available Saturday evening?\u2019 I ask, feeling incredibly awkward under my grandmother\u2019s observation. It\u2019s times like now, when he\u2019s reserved and clipped, that he defies the tender man who I\u2019m faced with when he\u2019s out of those suits and has me to himself.</p><p>\u2018Are you asking me on a date?\u2019 I can hear a hint of amusement in his tone.</p><p>\u2018No, my nan is. She\u2019d like you to come for dinner again.\u2019 I feel like such a juvenile.</p><p>\u2018It would be my pleasure,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ll bring my buns.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help the burst of laughter that slips out, making Nan look offended. \u2018Nan will be pleased.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Who wouldn\u2019t?\u2019 he asks cockily. \u2018See you after work, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>I disconnect the call and leave Nan in the hallway as I practically skip down the path from the house.</p><p>\u2018Well?\u2019 she calls, as she follows me out.</p><p>\u2018You have a date!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What was so funny?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller\u2019s bringing his buns!\u2019 I shout back.</p><p>\u2018But I was going to make my pineapple upside-down cake!\u2019</p><p>I laugh to myself, all the way to work.</p><p>\u2018I might need you on Sunday night, Livy,\u2019 Del says towards the end of my shift. \u2018Do you think you could help me out? Big event. I need as many hands as I can get.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Sure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sylvie?\u2019 he asks, nodding at her as she works her way out of the bistro with the mop.</p><p>She pivots on her biker books and smiles sickeningly sweetly. \u2018No,\u2019 she says simply.</p><p>Our boss leaves grumbling something about \u2018help these days,\u2019 while Paul laughs and I try not to.</p><p>\u2018So,\u2019 Sylvie begins, after Paul has also said his goodbyes. \u2018I\u2019m hoping your good mood is because Friday night with Mr Wide Eyes went exceptionally well.\u2019</p><p>I cringe. \u2018He was nice.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Is that it?\u2019 she asks incredulously.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fucking hell, Livy. If you\u2019re going to nab a decent bloke, then you need to be a little more enthusiastic.\u2019 She\u2019s glaring at me, and I\u2019m doing everything to avoid it. \u2018So what\u2019s made you so chirpy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think you already know.\u2019 I\u2019m not looking at her but I know she has just tried to disguise an eye roll and an exhale of worried breath. \u2018Miller\u2019s picking me up,\u2019 I tell her, glancing down the road. \u2018He\u2019ll be here in a minute.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 she says, short and clipped. \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sylvie.\u2019 I stop and turn, placing a hand gently on her arm. \u2018Your concern is appreciated, but please don\u2019t try to stop me from seeing him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s just . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018A nice girl like me?\u2019</p> <p>She smiles mildly. \u2018You\u2019re too nice. That\u2019s my worry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is right, Sylvie. I can\u2019t walk away. If you had led the life I have, you might see this for what it is.\u2019</p><p>I can see her face drift into thought, trying to surmise what I mean. \u2018What is \u201cthis\u201d?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A chance for me to feel alive,\u2019 I admit. \u2018He\u2019s a chance for me to live and feel.\u2019</p><p>She nods slowly and leans in to kiss my cheek, then wraps me in her arms. \u2018I\u2019m here,\u2019 she says simply. \u2018I hope he\u2019s everything you want and need.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know he is.\u2019 I take a deep breath and break free from Sylvie\u2019s hold. \u2018Here he is.\u2019 I leave Sylvie and make my way over to the black Mercedes, sliding in and giving her a quick wave. She returns it as she slowly backs away.</p><p>\u2018Good evening, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good evening, Miller Hart,\u2019 I counter, pulling my belt on, smiling when I hear Crystal Waters \u2018Gypsy Woman\u2019. \u2018Have you had a nice day?\u2019</p><p>He pulls into the traffic swiftly. \u2018I\u2019ve had a very busy day. And you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Busy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you hungry?\u2019 He looks over to me, face straight, no expression.</p><p>\u2018A little,\u2019 I reply, feeling a little chilly in the air-conditioned car. Looking at the digital display on the dashboard, I note masses of switches and dials. There are two temperature displays and a dial next to each, both reading sixteen degrees. \u2018Why are there two temperature gauges?\u2019</p><p>\u2018One for the passenger side, one for the driver\u2019s side.\u2019 He keeps his eyes on the road.</p><p>\u2018So you can set two different temperatures?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So my side can be twenty degrees, and your side can be sixteen degrees?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>I reach forward, thinking it\u2019s such a ridiculously stupid piece of gadgetry, and turn my dial up, making my side of the car twenty degrees.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he asks, starting to twitch in his seat.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m chilly.\u2019</p><p>He reaches for the dial and turns it back until the display reads sixteen degrees again. \u2018It\u2019s not chilly.\u2019</p><p>Looking across the car to him, I begin to work out the issue. \u2018But isn\u2019t that the point of having dual temperatures? So both passenger and driver can set their own comfort level?\u2019</p><p>\u2018In this car, they stay the same.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How about if I turn them both up to twenty degrees?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019d be too warm,\u2019 he answers quickly, replacing his hand on the wheel. \u2018The temperature is suitable as it is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or the matching digits are suitable,\u2019 I say to myself, sitting back in the seat. I can\u2019t imagine how stressful it would be to live in a world where the desire to have everything a particular way is so compulsory, it pretty much takes over your life. I smile to myself. Actually, I can, because not only has my life been turned upside down by this confounding, fraudulent gentleman sitting next to me, his particular ways are having a funny effect on me, too. I\u2019m becoming very aware of how things should be, even if I\u2019m not quite sure how to get them there. But I\u2019ll learn, and then I can help make Miller\u2019s life as stress-free as possible.</p><p>The club looks entirely different, all lit by natural daylight, the blues that illuminated it by night absent, leaving frosted glass everywhere I look. Now the space is empty; only the staff scattered here and there stocking the bars or buffing a section of the large expanse of glass. And it\u2019s so much quieter, with only Lana Del Rey humming softly in the background about video games. It\u2019s a million miles away from the hard beats of the club on Saturday night.</p><p>A well-built, stocky guy, all suited and booted, is waiting just beyond the dance floor, sitting on a Perspex stool sipping from a bottle of beer. As we approach, he lifts his bald head from the paperwork he\u2019s perusing and signals the barman, who immediately prepares a drink for Miller, placing it on the glass surface of the bar in time for our arrival.</p><p>\u2018Miller.\u2019 The guy stands, holding his hand out.</p><p>My neck is released and Miller gives him a firm, manly shake before indicating for me to sit, which I do without delay. \u2018Tony, this is Olivia. Livy, Tony.\u2019 He waves his hand between us before wasting no time taking his drink and knocking it back, immediately signalling for another.</p><p>\u2018Nice to meet you, Olivia.\u2019 Tony says my name as a question, clearly wondering which version to use.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 I take his hand and let him do all the shaking while he regards me thoughtfully.</p><p>\u2018Would you like a drink?\u2019 Miller asks, accepting his second from the barman.</p><p>\u2018No, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He gives Tony his full attention.</p><p>\u2018Cassie will be here shortly,\u2019 Tony says, flicking a cautionary look in my direction. It makes me sit up and pay attention.</p><p>\u2018She needn\u2019t have bothered,\u2019 Miller replies, ensuring he keeps his eyes on me. \u2018I told her not to.\u2019</p><p>Tony laughs. \u2018Since when has she listened to anything you say, son?\u2019</p><p>Miller returns his steel stare to Tony but ignores his question, leaving me wondering who the hell Cassie is and why she never listens to Miller. Now is quite obviously not the time to ask, but by Tony\u2019s look and Miller\u2019s response, I think I already know who Cassie is. Why is she coming here? She never listens to him? What about? Everything? What\u2019s everything? I mentally yell at myself and in an attempt to rein in my wandering thoughts until it\u2019s an appropriate time to press on it, I take in the cutting-edge decor of the club. It feels cold now, with the absence of crowds and darkness, the light and glass at every turn making me feel like I\u2019m stuck in a gigantic piece of . . . well, ice.</p><p>As I watch Miller looking over the papers being held by Tony, I wonder if he would be at all different right now if he was wearing a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. The grey three-piece suit and blue shirt make his eyes look shockingly blue, but hold the usual mask in place whenever he\u2019s suited \u2013 which is ninety-nine per cent of the time.</p><p>\u2018My office.\u2019 Miller\u2019s voice pulls my eyes from the blue shirt at his neck to the blue of his intense stare.</p><p>\u2018Sorry?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Make your way down to my office.\u2019 He tugs me gently down from the stool and turns me in the direction that I should be headed. \u2018Do you remember where?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think so.\u2019 I remember being taken towards the front of the club and down some stairs, but I was well on my way to a total drunken stupor.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll catch up with you.\u2019</p><p>I glance back as I leave Miller at the bar with Tony, both men blatantly waiting for me to be out of earshot before they speak. Miller is impassive and Tony is thoughtful. I take all of the awkward vibes from Tony and conclude that they\u2019re either talking business and it\u2019s not for my ears, or they\u2019re talking about me. A funny feeling, plus Tony\u2019s discomfort, makes me conclude it\u2019s the latter, and when I reach the other side of the club and turn to round the corner, I see Tony waving his hands at Miller, which only confirms my thoughts. I stop and watch through the glass of the stairwell, seeing Tony drop to his arse and put his round face in his palms. It\u2019s a sign of despair. Then Miller shows a rare display of aggravation, flashing that temper I\u2019ve been warned about, throwing his hands up and cursing as he storms off in my direction. I hurry down the stairs quickly, weaving my way through the corridors aimlessly, until I spot the metal keypad that I vaguely remember Miller punching some numbers into.</p><p>It\u2019s mere seconds before he rounds the corner, clearly pissed off and running his hand through his waves, pulling back the loose curl that\u2019s fallen onto his forehead. Striding towards me with purpose, the aggravation is still so very obvious, even more so when he punches the code in aggressively and pushes the door open a little too hard, making it hit the plaster behind it.</p><p>I jump at the loud crash, and Miller drops his head. \u2018Shit,\u2019 he curses quietly, making no attempt to enter his office.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 I ask, keeping my distance. I\u2019m constantly willing emotion from him, but not if it\u2019s going to be like this.</p><p>\u2018I apologise,\u2019 he murmurs, keeping his eyes to the ground, defying his own rule of looking at someone when you\u2019re speaking to them. I don\u2019t remind him, though. The words that have just been exchanged between Miller and his bar manager were about me, I have no doubt. And now he\u2019s mad. \u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>I feel my spine stretch out, making me stand up straight. \u2018Yes?\u2019</p><p>His shoulders rise and fall on a heavy sigh. \u2018Give me my thing,\u2019 he says, turning pleading blue eyes onto me. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>My shoulders drop, seeing a side of Miller Hart that I never have. He wants comfort. I reach up over his broad shoulders, lifting on my tiptoes to get my face in his neck.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he mumbles, wrapping his arms around my waist and lifting me from my feet. The force of his hold compresses my ribcage, making it a little tricky to breathe, but I\u2019m not about to stop him. I wrap my legs around his waist as he shuts the door and walks us to his empty desk. He rests his arse on the edge which allows us to maintain our hold, and he shows no sign of letting up. I\u2019m surprised. His suit will be a crumpled mess and he has an interview.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m creasing you,\u2019 I say quietly.</p><p>\u2018I have an iron.\u2019 He squeezes harder.</p><p>\u2018Of course you do.\u2019 I pull away from him so we\u2019re staring into each other\u2019s eyes. He doesn\u2019t give me anything. His annoyance seems to have faded, his face as expressionless as ever. \u2018What has upset you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Life.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u2018People overthinking things and interfering.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Interfering with what?\u2019 I ask, but I suspect I already know.</p><p>\u2018Everything,\u2019 he breathes.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s Cassie?\u2019 I also know the answer to this question.</p><p>He stands, lowers me to my feet, and grabs my cheeks. \u2018The woman you thought was my girlfriend.\u2019 He hits me with a long, moist kiss, sending me dizzy.</p> <p>\u2018Why is she coming here?\u2019 I ask around his lips.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t break our kiss. \u2018Because she\u2019s a pain in the arse.\u2019 He pecks up my cheek to my ear. \u2018And because she thinks that holding shares in my club gives her a right to dictate what happens here.\u2019</p><p>I gasp and pull away. \u2018So she really is a business associate?\u2019</p><p>He almost scowls before yanking me back to his chest. \u2018Yes. How many times do I need to tell you? I said trust me.\u2019</p><p>This knowledge doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. I\u2019m not completely stupid and I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at him. And me, for that matter.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve had a terrible day.\u2019 Miller kisses my cheek softly, distracting me with those soft lips. \u2018But you\u2019re going to de-stress me when I get you home.\u2019</p><p>I let him take my hand and lead me around his desk. \u2018What are we doing?\u2019</p><p>He sits me in his chair and turns me to face his desk, and then takes a remote control from the top drawer and crouches beside me, resting his elbow on the arm of the chair. \u2018I want to show you something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, noting Miller\u2019s desk is as empty as the last time I saw it, the phone its only adornment.</p><p>\u2018This.\u2019 He presses a button and I jump back in my chair on a gasp when his desk starts to shift in front of me.</p><p>\u2018What the . . .\u2019 I\u2019m open-mouthed and gawking like an idiot as five flat screens start to rise from the back section. \u2018Bloody hell!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Impressed?\u2019</p><p>I might be a little stunned, but there is no denying the proud edge to his tone. \u2018So you just watch TV in here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, Livy,\u2019 he sighs, pressing another button which prompts the screens to jump to life, revealing image after image of his club.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s CCTV?\u2019 I ask, letting my eyes travel over the screens, each one sectioned into six images, except the middle screen. That screen is just one large image.</p><p>And I\u2019m on it.</p><p>I lean forward, seeing myself on Ice\u2019s launch night drinking with Gregory, then the image changes to us walking up the stairs, me looking around in awe. Then I\u2019m on the dance floor. And Miller is on the prowl behind me. I see Gregory whisper in my ear, and me going to turn, and then I watch as he homes in, giving me a thorough inspection before he has his hands on me. The footage is clear, but when Miller reaches forward and touches the centre of the screen, it gets bigger, clearer, and the look on his face makes me instantly wet. I\u2019m tingling, too, and it\u2019s right now I wonder why the hell I\u2019m staring at a screen when the real thing is crouched next to me.</p><p>I slowly turn to face him. \u2018You sat here and watched me.\u2019 I don\u2019t ask it as a question because it\u2019s obvious. I knew it, but I didn\u2019t consider a club littered with cameras.</p><p>He regards me thoughtfully and cocks his head a little. \u2018My gorgeous, sweet girl, are you turned on?\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to, but I squirm in his big office chair, my cheeks flushing terribly. \u2018You\u2019re here. Of course I am.\u2019 I need to try and meet his poise \u2013 try being the operative word. I could never match Miller in the intensity stakes or the brooding stakes or the hot stakes or the sexy stakes. I might in the sass stakes, though.</p><p>My chair is slowly turned to face him, the remote control placed neatly on the table, and his palms slide under my thighs, pulling me to him until there are only a few inches between our faces. \u2018When I watched you on Saturday night,\u2019 he whispers in my face, \u2018I was turned on, too.\u2019</p><p>An image of Miller reclined in this chair, short in hand, watching quietly as I drank, chatted and wandered around his club, invades my lust-filled mind. The mental visual makes the heat drop from my face, straight into my groin. I\u2019m saturated, and he knows it. \u2018Are you turned on now?\u2019 I breathe, moving my face a little closer so our noses meet.</p><p>\u2018Find out for yourself.\u2019 He pushes his lips to mine and rises, forcing my head to drop back to accommodate our kiss. His hands are braced on the arms of his office chair, caging me in, and the satisfied moan that seeps from his mouth into mine is the most pleasurable sound I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>I waste no time getting my hands on him. I blindly yank his belt undone while our mouths work each other frantically, the softly-softly approach a distant memory in this moment in time. He seems harassed and if I can fix it, then I will.</p><p>\u2018Just your hand,\u2019 he mumbles desperately.</p><p>I unzip his fly, unbutton him and slide my hand into his trousers, finding hard heat immediately.</p><p>I grasp it loosely, and he gasps, prompting me to flick my eyes up. I\u2019m looking into blinding blues as I pull a slow, smooth stroke, his parted lips letting his shallow pants warm my face. \u2018Did you do this to yourself when you watched me?\u2019 I ask quietly, his desperation powering me on, boosting my confidence.</p><p>\u2018I never do this to myself.\u2019</p><p>His response shocks me, making my rhythm falter. \u2018Never?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never.\u2019 His h*ps gently push forward.</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019 I\u2019m shocked to the core, and even though it sounds unbelievable, I believe him.</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 He swoops down and takes my lips, halting any further questioning. I\u2019m focusing on working him gently, but with his mouth action getting unusually firm, it seems to influence my hands too, the thrusts of my fist speeding up, coaxing continuous groans from him. \u2018Keep it steady,\u2019 he almost begs.</p><p>Following his guidance, I slow my pace until I\u2019m evenly gliding up and down his length.</p><p>\u2018Hmmmm, oh God.\u2019 He tenses from top to toe, like he\u2019s cautious, but he\u2019s enjoying it. I can feel him pulsing under my palm, the heat building, his breath hitching further. Maintaining our deep kiss is easy. Holding back from pumping harder with my fist isn\u2019t. My awareness of his building cl**ax is driving my confidence, making my clenched hand ache from tensing to prevent the instinct to fly up and down his shaft.</p><p>He bites my lip and pulls away, giving me a perfect view of his perfect face as I continue to work him. His h*ps are starting to thrust with my hand, and I can see the tensing of his arms braced on the chair. But his face is poker straight.</p><p>\u2018Good?\u2019 I ask, wanting something more than his bodily reactions. I want the words he\u2019s so good at during these moments.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll never know.\u2019 His head drops a little and small wheezing breaths start to puff from his lips. I take my spare hand and find the hem of his shirt, sliding my hand onto his stomach and feeling the contractions of his muscled abs. \u2018Shit!\u2019 he curses.</p><p>I take his cue and squeeze harder, but then a loud knock at the door makes me jump, and I\u2019m suddenly dropping him and flying back in my chair.</p><p>He gasps. \u2018Fucking hell, Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 I blurt, not knowing whether to resume my attention of Miller or hide under the desk.</p><p>I can see the pain on his face as he pushes himself up from the chair and tries to get his laboured breathing under control. \u2018Well, that\u2019s just f**king perfect, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>I press my lips together as I watch him quickly tuck himself away and refasten his trousers and belt. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I repeat, not knowing what else to say. He\u2019s still rock solid and it\u2019s obvious through his trousers.</p><p>\u2018So you should be,\u2019 he grumbles, and I lose my attempts to hold back my smile. \u2018Look.\u2019 He points to his groin and cocks his eyebrow when he catches my amusement. \u2018I have a bit of a problem.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do,\u2019 I agree, looking to one of his screens and seeing two people standing outside his office door, just as a knock sounds again. \u2018Should I let them in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is going to be agony.\u2019 He adjusts himself on a groan. \u2018Yes, please.\u2019</p><p>I jump up and leave Miller settling in his chair, finding my own hyped-up state easy to control with the distraction of Miller\u2019s clear discomfort. Swinging the door open, I come face to face with a lovely looking woman, who immediately gives me the once-over on a frown.</p><p>\u2018You are?\u2019 she says, waving to a man behind her with a camera.</p><p>I step back to give her access before I\u2019m barged from her path. \u2018Livy,\u2019 I say to myself because she has already passed me and is on her way to Miller\u2019s desk, all smiley and gushy. I\u2019m delighted when I see his mask slip right into place, his cool, business persona replacing his despairing pre-climax state.</p><p>\u2018Hi!\u2019 she sings in his face, practically throwing herself over his desk to get to him. \u2018Diana Low.\u2019 She puts her hand out, but I can tell she\u2019s dying to kiss him. \u2018Wow, this place is just amazing!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Miller is as formal as ever, shaking her hand before indicating a chair opposite his desk and discreetly adjusting his groin area. \u2018Can I get you a drink?\u2019</p><p>She parks her tight arse on the chair and lays her notepad on the table. I\u2019m immediately picking up on the unease emanating from Miller as he looks at the pad. \u2018Oooh, I\u2019m not supposed to drink on the job, but you\u2019re my last call of the day. I\u2019ll have a martini on the rocks.\u2019</p><p>The photographer passes me, clearly exhausted.</p><p>It\u2019s only now I wonder if Miller actually wants me here for this, so I look over to him and gesture to the door, but he starts shaking his head, then nods towards the sofa as he takes Miss Low\u2019s pad and hands it to her. He wants me to stay.</p><p>I shut the door and watch the photographer take a seat beside the gregarious woman, dumping his camera on his lap.</p><p>\u2018Drink?\u2019 Miller looks to the man, but I see his head shake from behind.</p><p>\u2018Nah, I\u2019m cool.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get the drinks,\u2019 I pipe up, opening the door. \u2018Martini and a Scotch?\u2019</p><p>\u2018On the rocks!\u2019 The woman swings around, giving me another once-over. \u2018Make sure it\u2019s on the rocks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rocks,\u2019 I confirm, looking to Miller, who nods his thanks. \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 I slip out, grateful to be free from Diana Low\u2019s irritating voice.</p><p>I find the lights have been dimmed and the blue illuminations activated, restoring the bar to the glow I remember. With more than one bar to choose from, I finally plump for the one where Miller met Tony, making my way over and finding a young guy crouched behind, restocking the glass front fridges.</p><p>\u2018Hello,\u2019 I say to get his attention. \u2018Can I get a martini on the rocks and a Scotch straight?\u2019</p><p>\u2018For Mr Hart?\u2019</p><p>I nod and he flies into action, pulling down a tumbler and giving it an extra polish before pouring a few inches and sliding it across the bar. \u2018And a martini?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>While the barman prepares the drink, I stand feeling a little self-conscious, knowing I\u2019m being regarded with interest by Tony. I look over and receive a small smile, but it\u2019s a poor attempt to make me feel comfortable. His round face is thoughtful.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s it going down there?\u2019 he asks, breaking the difficult silence.</p><p>\u2018I just left them to it,\u2019 I answer politely and accept the martini.</p><p>\u2018Miller doesn\u2019t appreciate fuss and attention.\u2019</p><p>I try to detect a double meaning to Tony\u2019s abrupt declaration. \u2018I know,\u2019 I answer, because I suspect he\u2019s implying that I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s happy in his own little organised world.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I repeat, turning to leave the discomfort of the conversation. He\u2019s not being particularly unfriendly, but I don\u2019t like where this chat is heading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018He\u2019s emotionally unavailable.\u2019</p><p>I stop and turn, watching the thoughtful look on his face for a few moments before I speak. \u2018Is there a purpose to this?\u2019 I ask outright, finding my annoyance advancing my poise. Miller has told me the very same thing, but I\u2019m finding emotions in him. Maybe not the regular way, but they\u2019re there.</p><p>He smiles, and it\u2019s a sincere smile, but it\u2019s also a smile that suggests I\u2019m blind, naive and way out of my depth. \u2018A sweet thing like you shouldn\u2019t be getting caught up in this world.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What gives you the impression that I\u2019m sweet?\u2019 I ask, my annoyance growing. And what does he mean by \u2018this world\u2019? Clubs? Drinking? He shakes his head and returns to his paperwork, not giving me an answer to my question. \u2018Tony, what do you mean?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I mean . . .\u2019 He pauses and sighs, looking up. \u2018You\u2019re a distraction that he could do without.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A distraction?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. He needs to focus.\u2019</p><p>\u2018On what?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>Tony lifts his stocky body from the barstool and gathers his papers, slipping his pen behind his ear and taking his bottle of beer. \u2018This world,\u2019 he says simply, turning and wandering across the club.</p> <p>I stand motionless as I watch the distance between us grow, feeling completely perplexed. Maybe distraction is exactly what Miller needs. He works hard, he\u2019s stressed and he needs me to de-stress at the end of the day. I want to do that. I want to help him.</p><p>Looking down into the two glasses I\u2019m holding, I notice the heat of my palm around the martini glass has melted the ice somewhat, but I don\u2019t replace it. Diana Low can have a martini on melted rocks. I head back to Miller\u2019s office.</p><p>His eyes are on the door as I enter, and Diana is pacing his office, doing an amazing job of swaying her arse, while the photographer just looks plain bored, slumped in his chair.</p><p>I take Miller his Scotch, placing it in his hand, rather than on the desk, because I have no clue where on his desk I should put it. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he almost sighs, patting his lap for me to take a seat. I\u2019m a little stunned by his casual demand in a business meeting, but I don\u2019t protest.</p><p>I follow his cue and lower my bum to his knee and watch in silent amusement as Diana Low takes in the situation. I can\u2019t help a little power play of my own, holding her martini out so she has to come to me to get it.</p><p>As soon as the glass leaves my hand, Miller has his arm around my waist and tugs me back against his chest.</p> <p>Diana Low makes a terrible job of smiling warmly at me as she composes herself. \u2018I guess I\u2019ll need to change the title of my article.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What was the title of your article, Miss Low?\u2019 Miller asks coolly.</p><p>\u2018Well, it was \u201cLondon\u2019s most eligible bachelor opens London\u2019s most prestigious club\u201d.\u2019</p><p>Miller stiffens beneath me. \u2018Yes.\u2019 He downs the rest of his drink and positions the glass on his desk with utter accuracy. \u2018Change it.\u2019</p><p>She gets all flustered and sits back down in the chair opposite Miller\u2019s desk. London\u2019s most eligible bachelor? Miller has confirmed, but it\u2019s still nice to hear someone else acknowledge that he\u2019s single. Or was.</p><p>She frowns as she places her glass on Miller\u2019s desk, making him stiffen and me stiffen as a result of Miller\u2019s stiffness.</p><p>\u2018Would you mind?\u2019 I move forward and reclaim the glass, pushing it back in her hand. \u2018No coaster and the desk is very expensive.\u2019</p><p>She flicks her confusion to Miller\u2019s empty tumbler that is on the desk without a coaster . . . but it\u2019s in the right place. \u2018Sorry,\u2019 she replies, taking the glass.</p> <p>\u2018No problem.\u2019 I smile, making it as insincere as hers, feeling Miller squeeze his thanks.</p><p>\u2018So let\u2019s finish up,\u2019 she says, struggling to hold her glass while attempting to make notes on her pad. \u2018On what basis do you approve membership to your club?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Payment,\u2019 Miller answers, short and tiredly, making me smile.</p><p>\u2018And how do potential members apply?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>She looks up again, confused. \u2018So how do you obtain membership?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have to be nominated by an existing member.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Doesn\u2019t that limit your clientele?\u2019 she asks.</p><p>\u2018Not at all. I already have over two thousand members and we opened less than a week ago. Now we have a waiting list.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 She looks disappointed, but then smiles suggestively and crosses her legs slowly. \u2018And what would one need to do to skip the waiting list?\u2019</p><p>I screw my face up in disgust at her brashness, the shameless hussy. \u2018Yes, what would one need to do, Miller?\u2019 I ask, turning to look at him and pouting my lips.</p><p>His eyes sparkle, the corners of his mouth lifting ever so slightly as he directs his gaze back to Diana Low. \u2018Do you know any members, Miss Low?\u2019</p><p>She smiles brighter. \u2018I know you.\u2019</p><p>I have to force the cough of shock back down my throat. Can she see me?</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t know me, Miss Low,\u2019 Miller states, low and harsh. \u2018Not many people do.\u2019</p><p>The photographer shifts uncomfortably in his seat and Diana Low reddens with embarrassment. I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t get knocked back very often, and I\u2019m wondering whether Miller should be so hostile when she\u2019s going to be writing a piece on him and his new club. His words don\u2019t have the same effect on me, though, because I do know him.</p><p>\u2018Photo!\u2019 Diana shrieks, jumping up from her chair and placing her drink down again, obviously forgetting my previous request in her fluster.</p><p>I quickly scoop it up before Miller starts twitching and stand to the side so the photographer can get what he needs. I watch as Miller stands and starts brushing down the creases in his suit, huffing and puffing to himself as he does. That\u2019s my fault, distracting him from dragging out the ironing board so he can perfect his appearance, even though he really doesn\u2019t need to. He always looks perfect.</p><p>He casts an accusing gaze in my direction and mouths, \u2018Your fault.\u2019</p><p>I break out in a big smile, shrugging and mouthing \u2018sorry\u2019 back.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be,\u2019 he says aloud, \u2018I\u2019m not.\u2019 He winks, nearly knocking me from my feet, before repositioning himself in his big chair, unfastening the button of his jacket and nodding to the photographer. \u2018Ready when you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great.\u2019 He prepares his camera and takes a few steps back. \u2018We\u2019ll leave the TV screens in place. I was thinking a few more things on your desk, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019 Miller asks, horror beginning to surface at the potential of someone messing with his clear surface.</p><p>\u2018Some paperwork,\u2019 he replies, taking Diana\u2019s pad and positioning it to the left of Miller. \u2018Perfect.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s not perfect at all. Even I can see it\u2019s wonky, the edge of the paper not parallel to the edge of the desk, and Miller\u2019s swift rearrangement of the pad confirms it. \u2018Get on with it, then,\u2019 he grunts, trying to relax back in his chair and failing. He\u2019s fidgety.</p><p>It seems like the photographer spends forever aiming and clicking at my poor Miller, who looks ready to explode with stress. He\u2019s directed from one position to another, the guy rounds his desk and gets a shot of the TV monitors with Miller casually observing the screens, and then he asks him to sit on the edge of the desk, all casual with his ankles and arms crossed. It\u2019s killing him, and the final straw comes when he\u2019s asked to smile.</p><p>He looks over at me in disbelief, like how dare they ask such a thing. \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019 he snaps irritably, buttoning up his jacket and collecting the pad that\u2019s been poisoning the perfection of his desk for too long. \u2018Thank you for your time.\u2019 He shoves the pad at Diana Low and strides over to the door, swinging it open and gesturing for them to leave.</p><p>Neither the journalist nor the photographer hangs around, both moving quickly across Miller\u2019s office to the door. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 Diana stops short of the door and gazes up at Miller. \u2018Hope to see you around.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stunned and wondering if this is normal behaviour. She\u2019s incorrigible. \u2018Goodbye,\u2019 Miller retorts with utter finality, sending the brash journalist on her way, just as another woman strides into his office.</p><p>Miller\u2019s business associate.</p><p>Cassie.</p><p>She appears to be in a fluster and out of breath, but it diminishes the second she claps eyes on Diana Low within touching distance of Miller. Cassie\u2019s eyes narrow on the brash journalist. \u2018I said he wasn\u2019t available for interviews.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I know.\u2019 Diana isn\u2019t perturbed by the hostility pouring from Cassie\u2019s designer-adorned figure. \u2018But you were clearly mistaken because a few further calls revealed that he was.\u2019 She turns back to Miller and smiles seductively. \u2018Bye for now.\u2019 Her hand raises and waves before she turns a snide look on Cassie as she sashays out of Miller\u2019s office, and once she has disappeared, I know Cassie\u2019s cattish mood is about to be turned on me.</p><p>She swings around and for the first time seems to register my presence. \u2018What\u2019s she doing here?\u2019 she spits, looking to Miller for an answer. I recoil in shock, as does Miller.</p><p>\u2018Keep your nose out,\u2019 Miller says calmly, taking her arm and leading her to the door.</p><p>\u2018I care about you,\u2019 she argues, not putting up much of a fight, her words confirming my suspicions.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t waste your energy, Cassie.\u2019 He pushes her out gently and the door to his office slams shut, sending me a few centimetres back on a frightened jump. He said to trust him and I should have. He really has sent her on her way. He swings to face me, looking grumpy and harassed. \u2018I\u2019m stressed out,\u2019 he proclaims on a bark, stating the obvious and sending me on another little jump across the carpet.</p><p>\u2018Would you like me to get you another drink?\u2019 I ask, for the first time thinking that perhaps Miller drinks too much. Or has that just been since he met me?</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need a drink, Livy.\u2019 His tone has taken on a throaty edge, and his eyes have landed on me with a bang. \u2018I think you know what I need.\u2019</p><p>My blood reheats under his primal stare, my whole sexual being becoming aware and responsive. God help me when he touches me. \u2018De-stressing,\u2019 I whisper, looking up through my lashes as he stalks slowly towards me.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re like therapy to me.\u2019 He reaches me and swoops down, kissing me with purpose and meaning, moaning and mumbling into my mouth as his tongue works mine fluidly. My mind immediately scrambles. \u2018I love kissing you.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019re in his office. I don\u2019t want to be in his office. I want to be in his bed. \u2018Take me home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019ll take too long. I need de-stressing now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please.\u2019 I rest my hands on his shoulders and pull away. \u2018You make me feel stressed when you\u2019re all uptight.\u2019</p><p>He sighs deeply and drops his head, letting loose the wayward curl. It calls for me to push it back from his forehead, so I do, taking the chance while I\u2019m in the vicinity of his hair to feel all of it. I feel privileged that this complex man has designated me the role of de-stressing him, and I\u2019ll relish doing it whenever need be, but I can see there are ways in which he can do this for himself.</p><p>\u2018I apologise,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018Your request has been noted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you. Take me to your bed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He looks down at his suit, scowling at the few creases as he tries to smooth them out. He gives up on an exasperated sigh and cocks his head when he catches me smiling.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s so amusing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 I shrug nonchalantly and set about smoothing myself down. It\u2019s a terribly sarcastic act, but when I glance up and see that Miller has pulled an ironing board from a concealed cupboard in the wall and is busy setting it up, my amusement soon abates. \u2018You\u2019re not?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pauses and casts his eyes over to my bulging ones. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re going to iron your suit?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s all creased.\u2019 He\u2019s horrified that I\u2019m clearly stunned by this. \u2018Someone distracted me before, so I\u2019m going to look like a sack of potatoes in my picture.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about bed?\u2019 I sigh, seeing a long stretch ahead while I wait for Miller to perfect on perfect.</p> <p>\u2018As soon as I\u2019m done.\u2019 He turns and takes an iron out.</p><p>\u2018Miller . . .\u2019 I halt when I detect the very subtle jumping of his shoulders, and totally intrigued, I pace quickly over and round him, finding the biggest boyish grin I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. My mouth drops open. I\u2019m stunned and can\u2019t even remember what I was going to say.</p><p>\u2018Your face!\u2019 he laughs, folding the board and putting it back. Miller Hart, Mr Serious, my confounding, complex creature, is winding me up? Playing a joke? I think I might pass out.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not even that funny,\u2019 I mutter, pushing the cupboard door shut in a childish act of stroppiness.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 he laughs, straightening and knocking me sideways with that cheeky grin again. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it.</p> <p>\u2018Beg all you like,\u2019 I retort, then yelp when he picks me up and spins me around. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not going to iron my suit because getting you into my bed is of paramount importance.\u2019</p><p>\u2018More important than ironing your suit back to perfection?\u2019 I ask, threading my fingers through his waves. \u2018And more important than fixing your hair?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Considerably.\u2019 He drops me to my feet. \u2018Ready?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was looking forward to you taking me for dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dinner or bed?\u2019 He scoffs. \u2018Now you\u2019re just being silly.\u2019</p> <p>I smile. \u2018What would one have to do to skip the club\u2019s waiting list?\u2019</p><p>His eyes lose a little sparkle when they narrow, his lips straightening. He\u2019s trying not to laugh. \u2018One would need to know a member.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know the owner,\u2019 I declare confidently, but very quickly remember his comment to Miss Low. Will he say the same to me? I know Miller, but does he agree?</p><p>He nods thoughtfully and paces over to his desk, opening the drawer and pulling something out. Whatever it is gets swiped, bleeped, and scanned on a section of the flat-screen monitors before they disappear into the depths of white desk.</p><p>\u2018Here.\u2019 He hands me a transparent credit card with one word engraved in small block capital letters through the centre.</p><p>ICE</p><p>Turning it over, I see a silver strip, but that\u2019s all \u2013 nothing else. No details of the club or the member. I look up suspiciously. \u2018This is a fake, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p><p>He laughs lightly and leads me out of the room and back up to the main club, but he doesn\u2019t take his usual hold of my neck, instead draping his strong arm over my petite shoulders and hugging me into him. \u2018It\u2019s very real, Olivia.\u2019</p> <p>Chapter 22</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s carried me up the stairs to his apartment and let us in, he runs a bath and strips us both down before cradling me in his arms, carrying me up the steps, and lowering us into the hot, bubbly water. It\u2019s not his bed, but I don\u2019t argue. I\u2019m wrapped in his arms where I\u2019m happiest. It\u2019s more than good enough.</p><p>I sigh, completely content, while he devotes our bath time to smothering me in his body, feeling me everywhere and squeezing me tightly. He\u2019s humming that soft tune. It\u2019s becoming very familiar to me now. I know when he\u2019s going to draw breath and when the tone changes, and I know when a small pause is approaching, when he\u2019s sure to take the brief silence as an opportunity to press his lips to the top of my head.</p><p>My cheek is resting on his wet chest as I slowly circle his nipple with my fingertip and stare across the vast expanse of his skin. Relaxed and tranquil go nowhere near to describing how I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s these moments when I feel like I\u2019m experiencing the real Miller Hart, not the man who\u2019s hiding behind fine three-piece suits and an impassive face. The serious Miller Hart, the man disguised as a gentleman, hides his inside beauty from the world, leaving it facing a man who seems hell-bent on repelling any friendliness he encounters or confusing people with his impeccable manners, which are always delivered with such aloofness, they snuff the fact that he is, in fact, well mannered.</p><p>\u2018Tell me about your family.\u2019 I break the silence with my quiet question, almost certain he\u2019ll brush my enquiry aside.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have any,\u2019 he whispers simply and softly, kissing the top of my head again as my brow wrinkles into his chest.</p><p>\u2018None at all?\u2019 I try not to sound disbelieving, but I fail. I haven\u2019t a family, so to speak, just my nan, but the value of at least one family member is . . . well, invaluable.</p><p>\u2018Just me,\u2019 he confirms, leaving me silently sympathetic and pondering the loneliness his admission signifies.</p><p>\u2018Just you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what way you say it, Livy. It\u2019ll still just be me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got no one?\u2019</p><p>My body lifts and falls with his chest when he sighs. \u2018That\u2019s three. Shall we go for four?\u2019 he asks gently. He\u2019s not displaying exasperation or impatience, although I can tell if I try for that fourth he might do.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t find it so hard to believe, given my own sparse family. I have Gregory, too, and George, but only one blood relative. One is more than none, and one is a piece of history. \u2018Not a living soul?\u2019 I wince as soon as the fourth slips from my lips and immediately apologise for it. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve no need to apologise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But no one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018And we have number five.\u2019 There\u2019s humour in his voice, and hoping I might catch a glimpse of that rare smile, I lift from his chest, but all I find is his wet, impassive beauty.</p><p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 I smile.</p><p>\u2018Accepted.\u2019 He manoeuvres me, taking me to the other end of the bath, and lays me on my back. My thighs are spread and he kneels between them, taking one of my legs and lifting my foot until my sole is resting on the middle of his chest. My tiny size five looks lost in the vast expanse of muscle, even smaller when his manly hand starts stroking over the top as he watches me thoughtfully.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 My voice has been reduced to nothing more than a breath of air under the piercing passion of his blue gaze. Miller Hart has passion seeping from every pore of his striking body and even more through that purposeful blue stare. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s special and kept only for me, but I know I\u2019m hoping in vain. Perhaps Miller Hart only ever expresses himself and removes that mask when he has a woman to indulge in.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just thinking how lovely you look in my bath,\u2019 he muses, lifting my foot to his mouth and slowly, painfully slowly, licking from my toes, over the top of my foot until he\u2019s at my shin, my knee . . . my thigh.</p><p>The water ripples around me from my mild shift, and my hands splatter against the sides of the tub, slipping on the shiny porcelain. My skin is warm from the heat of the water and the steam in the bathroom, but with the heat of his tongue burning through my already heated flesh, I\u2019m on fire. I\u2019m quietly gasping. I\u2019m closing my eyes and preparing myself to be worshipped, and when he reaches a point where my thigh meets the water, he slips his forearm under my lower back and lifts effortlessly, bringing me to his mouth, making the need to shift my hands essential if I\u2019m going to stop myself from slipping under the water. I find the rim of the bath and grip as best I can, being gently guided into his realm of utter rapture \u2013 a place where the throes of passion are intense and where I fall deeper and deeper into the curious world of Miller Hart.</p><p>His light nips over my clitoris are difficult to deal with. The light dashes of his tongue that follow each one of those nips are torturous. But when he slowly slips two fingers inside me and thrusts lazily in time to his nips and tongue dashes, I lose any hope that there was of maintaining the silent serenity surrounding us.</p><p>I whimper and bow my back, the muscles of my arms that are holding me up instantly aching and my stomach muscles tensing in an attempt to control the sharp twinges sparking in my groin. My mounting desperation only encourages him, his thrusting fingers upholding his desired pace, but the strokes becoming firmer, more determined.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know how you do this to me,\u2019 I mumble to my darkness, my head slowly shaking from side to side.</p><p>\u2018Do what?\u2019 he whispers, blowing a cool stream of air across my pulsing core, the chill of his breath mixed with my flaming skin making me shudder.</p><p>\u2018This,\u2019 I gasp, mindlessly grappling at the side of the bath and crying out when he punishes me with a precise set of soft nips with his teeth, slow rotations with his tongue and firm drives of his fingers. \u2018And that!\u2019 The power of the spasms bolting through me is sending my body into muscle meltdown as I try my hardest to remain relatively still in the water.</p><p>My eyes open and I take a few moments to allow my vision to clear until my sight is distorted again, simply because of what I\u2019m faced with: indescribable flawlessness \u2013 a pureness in his eyes that I only ever see when he\u2019s worshipping me and his dark hair that\u2019s on the verge of being too long, the soft flicks curling out from behind his ears.</p><p>Despite my restrained fever, he\u2019s cool, calm and collected as he gazes back at me, never ceasing the motions that bring me so much pleasure. \u2018You mean like if this was for ever,\u2019 he murmurs, \u2018then you\u2019d be happy with that.\u2019</p><p>I nod, hoping he\u2019s agreeing with me and not just trying to vocalise my thoughts.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t confirm my silent wondering with words, instead returning his attention to the screaming nerves between my thighs. His face buried there and his eyes looking up at me is the most sensual vision I\u2019m ever likely to see. Yet I can\u2019t help closing my eyes as I prepare for the onslaught of pressure that\u2019s set to blow my mind.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t stop,\u2019 I breathe, begging for more insane, torturous pleasure. He\u2019s moving all of a sudden, the water splashing crazily around us as he crawls up my body and seals our mouths, his tongue caressing me in time to the wicked thrusts of his fingers, his thumb working firm circles on my throbbing clitoris.</p><p>My hands grip his wet shoulders, holding on for dear life, his strength the only thing preventing me from slipping under the water. I\u2019m a little fevered, but Miller keeps things steady and controlled, despite my moans of desperation.</p><p>And then it happens.</p><p>The explosion.</p><p>The release of a million lightning bolts that force me to break our kiss and hide my face in his neck as my body tries to deal with the blitz of pleasure. He\u2019s quiet as he helps my trembling body settle. His only movements are of his fingers circling deeply and his thumb resting lightly on my twitching mass of nerves, easing the persistent, sharp throbs.</p><p>\u2018I thought that I was supposed to de-stress you,\u2019 I wheeze, not willing to release my hold \u2013 not ever.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you have.\u2019</p><p>\u2018By you worshipping me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, a little, but mostly by just letting me be with you.\u2019 He sits up, taking me with him, and pulls me onto his lap. My heavy, wet hair is arranged just so, and his palms wrap around the tops of my arms, holding me firmly. \u2018You\u2019re so beautiful.\u2019</p><p>I feel my skin heat, and I drop my eyes, a little embarrassed.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m paying you a compliment, Livy,\u2019 he whispers, pulling my eyes back up.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>He smiles a little and shifts his hands to my waist, his eyes journeying over every visible part of my body. I watch him closely as he slowly drops his lips to my breast and kisses it tenderly, and then he starts trailing his finger over every part of me, so lightly I sometimes can\u2019t feel it. He inhales a deep, thoughtful breath and lets it out, his head tilting a little to the side, adding to his thoughtfulness. \u2018Every time I touch you,\u2019 he whispers, \u2018I feel I need to do it with the utmost care.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I ask quietly, a little perplexed.</p><p>He takes another long pull of air and turns his eyes to me, blinking slowly. \u2018Because I\u2019m frightened you might turn to dust.\u2019</p><p>His admission chokes me. \u2018I won\u2019t turn to dust.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You might,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018What would I do?\u2019 His eyes scan my face, and I\u2019m shocked to see nothing but complete seriousness, maybe even a little fear.</p> <p>Guilt tells me I shouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t help feeling quietly happy by his question. He\u2019s falling, too, just as hard as I am. I embrace his uncertainty and cuddle him tightly, locking my arms around his neck and my legs around his hips, like I\u2019m trying to squeeze some reassurance into him. \u2018I\u2019m only going away if you send me,\u2019 I say, because I think that\u2019s what he means. I couldn\u2019t possibly turn to dust.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to share with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, remaining where I am with my face stuck to his neck.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s get washed and I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 He reaches behind his neck and pulls my arms away, forcing me to vacate my comfort zone. \u2018You\u2019ll be the first.\u2019</p><p>\u2018First?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018The first person to see.\u2019 He\u2019s turning me in his arms, therefore turning my inquisitive face away, too.</p><p>\u2018See?\u2019</p><p>His chin rests on my shoulder. \u2018I love your curiosity.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You make me curious,\u2019 I accuse, pushing my cheek onto his lips. \u2018What are you going to show me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll see,\u2019 he teases, releasing me.</p><p>I turn around and face him again, seeing him sliding down, dunking his head and rubbing some shampoo through it, before rinsing and following it up with some conditioner.</p> <p>I make myself comfortable at the other end of the bath and watch as he works the conditioner through his waves. \u2018You use conditioner?\u2019</p><p>He pauses with his massaging hands and studies me carefully for a few moments before he speaks. \u2018I have very untamed hair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then you must feel my pain.\u2019 He slides back down the bath and rinses his untamed waves, while I grin like an idiot. He\u2019s embarrassed.</p><p>When he surfaces, I\u2019m still grinning, and he rolls his eyes at me as he pushes himself up, my gaze lifting with him forever until he\u2019s towering over me and I\u2019m staring at his soaking, na**d perfection.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll leave you to wash your untamed mane.\u2019 He\u2019s not smiling, but I can tell he wants to.</p><p>\u2018Thank you, kind sir.\u2019 I continue to admire his wet nakedness as he takes the steps from the bath, his butt cheeks tensing and swelling delightfully. \u2018Nice buns,\u2019 I say quietly to myself, slipping further into the bubbles.</p><p>He turns slowly and cocks his head to the side. \u2018I beg you don\u2019t adopt your grandmother\u2019s terminology.\u2019</p> <p>I burn bright red, and with nowhere else to escape my embarrassment, I disappear under the water.</p><p>When I\u2019m finished taming my own wild locks with conditioner, I reluctantly leave the warm serenity of Miller\u2019s colossal bath and dry off. Ensuring I\u2019ve emptied the tub, rinsed the bubbles away and tidied up the bathroom after me, I pad into his bedroom and find a pair of black boxer shorts and a grey T-shirt spread neatly on the bed. I smile to myself as I dress, his boxer shorts barely staying up on my waist, his T-shirt completely swamping me, but they smell of Miller so I tolerate the annoying need to hold the shorts up as I go in search of him.</p><p>I find him in the kitchen, looking breathtaking in his own pair of black boxers and a T-shirt to match the one he has picked for me. Seeing Miller without a perfect suit adorning his perfect body is a rarity, but the casual edge that his casual attire puts on him whenever I do is always welcome. I\u2019m beginning to resent his suits, seeing them as a mask that he hides behind.</p><p>\u2018We match,\u2019 I say, pulling up my boxers.</p><p>\u2018So we do.\u2019 He approaches me and runs his fingers through my wet tendrils before bringing them to his nose and inhaling deeply.</p><p>\u2018I should call my grandmother,\u2019 I say, closing my eyes and absorbing his closeness \u2013 his scent, his heat . . . his everything. \u2018I don\u2019t want her to worry.\u2019</p><p>He releases me and arranges my hair, staring at me thoughtfully.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Yes, I apologise.\u2019 He shakes himself from his daydream. \u2018I was just thinking how lovely you look in my clothes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re a bit big,\u2019 I point out, glancing down at the material swamping me.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re perfect on you. Call your grandmother.\u2019</p><p>Once I\u2019m done checking in with Nan, my nape is taken lightly and I\u2019m led over to the docking station where his iPhone is kept. He presses a few buttons before leading me from the kitchen without a word. The xx\u2019s \u2018Angels\u2019 joins us, soft and hypnotising in the background, seeping quietly through the integrated speakers. We pass Miller\u2019s bedroom and turn left, then he unlocks a door and pushes me gently into a large room.</p><p>\u2018Wow!\u2019 I gasp, stumbling to a stop on the threshold. \u2018Oh wow!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come in.\u2019 He encourages me in and flicks a switch that floods the room with powerful artificial light. I shield my eyes, annoyed my view has been spoiled for a few seconds while my eyes readjust.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve stopped squinting, I drop one hand, keeping his boxers up with the other, and stare in complete wonder at my surroundings. I\u2019m in awe. I\u2019m in heaven . . . I\u2019m shocked.</p><p>I turn towards him and give him a confused look. \u2018This is yours?\u2019</p><p>He looks almost embarrassed when his shoulders jump up a little on a mild shrug. \u2018This is my home, so I guess so.\u2019</p><p>I slowly turn back to the source of my shock and start to take it all in. The walls are covered, they\u2019re propped up on the floor, and they\u2019re stacked on wire racking systems. There are dozens, possibly hundreds, and they are all of my beloved London, whether of architecture or landscapes.</p><p>\u2018You paint?\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s up against my back and resting his arms over my shoulders. \u2018Do you think you could say something without it sounding like a question?\u2019 He nips at my ear, which would usually make my breath falter, but I still haven\u2019t caught it yet. This can\u2019t be right.</p><p>\u2018You did all of these?\u2019 I wave my arm in the general direction of the whole studio, casting my eyes around again.</p><p>\u2018Another question.\u2019 He bites my cheek this time. \u2018This was my habit before I found you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t a habit, this is a hobby.\u2019 I look at the paintings on the wall again, thinking that such excellence couldn\u2019t really be classed as a hobby. These belong in a gallery.</p><p>\u2018Well, now you\u2019re my hobby.\u2019</p><p>I have a moment of comprehension, and I\u2019m suddenly on the move, breaking free from Miller\u2019s hold and making my way out of his painting studio, heading for the lounge area until I\u2019m standing before one of the oil canvases gracing his wall. This one is of the London Eye, blurred but clear. \u2018You did this?\u2019 I\u2019m speaking in sodding questions again. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>He approaches from my left and stands next to me, observing his own creation. \u2018I did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And that one?\u2019 I point to the opposite wall, where London Bridge is holding court, still keeping the damn boxers up.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he confirms, and I\u2019m on the move again, back to his studio. I walk further into the room this time, surrounding myself with Miller\u2019s art.</p><p>There are five easels, all holding white canvases with partially finished works. The giant wooden table running the length of the side wall is cluttered with pots of brushes, paints in every colour on God\u2019s earth, and photographs scattered everywhere, some pinned on cork boards among the art. An old squidgy sofa is sitting in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, facing the glass so you can sit and admire the view across the city, which nearly matches the magnificence of the paintings around me. It\u2019s a typical artist\u2019s studio . . . and it completely defies everything that Miller Hart stands for.</p><p>It\u2019s expressive, but even more shocking, it\u2019s an awful mess. I feel like I\u2019m in a bit of a trance, an Alice in Wonderland kind of moment, and in a really silly fit of curiosity, I begin assessing everything more closely to try and establish whether there is some sort of method to his arrangement of things in here. It doesn\u2019t look like it; it all looks very random and haphazard, but to be sure, I walk over to the table and pick up a pot of brushes, turning it casually in my hand. Then I put it down aimlessly before turning to see his reaction.</p><p>He isn\u2019t twitching, he isn\u2019t looking at the pot of brushes like it could bite, and he hasn\u2019t come over to move it. He\u2019s just considering me with interest, and after absorbing his gaze for a few moments, I break out in a smile. My shock has transformed into happiness because what I\u2019m seeing in this room is a different man. This almost humanises him. Before me, he expressed himself and de-stressed by painting, and it doesn\u2019t matter that he has to be super-duper precise in every other element of his life, because in here, he\u2019s chaotic.</p><p>\u2018I love it,\u2019 I say, taking another slow gaze around the room, not even the beauty of Miller keeping me from it. \u2018I just love it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I knew you would.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s suddenly dark again, except for the glow of London by night pouring in from the window, and he walks slowly over and takes my hand, leading me to the old worn couch in front of the window. He sits and encourages me down beside him.</p><p>\u2018I fall asleep here most nights,\u2019 he says wistfully, pulling me a little closer. \u2018It\u2019s hypnotic, don\u2019t you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Incredible,\u2019 I agree, but I\u2019m more in awe of what\u2019s behind me. \u2018Have you always painted?\u2019</p><p>\u2018On and off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just landscapes and architecture?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mainly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re very gifted,\u2019 I say quietly, tucking my feet under my bum. \u2018You should exhibit them.\u2019</p><p>He laughs a little, and I\u2019m soon looking up at him, annoyed that he always chooses to do this when I can\u2019t see him. He\u2019s not laughing any more, but he\u2019s smiling at me. It\u2019s good enough. \u2018Livy, it\u2019s just a hobby. I have the club and plenty of stress. Turning a hobby into something more makes it stressful.\u2019</p><p>I frown, not seeing his logic at all, at the same time hoping his theory doesn\u2019t apply to me. I\u2019m a hobby. \u2018I was paying you a compliment.\u2019 I raise my eyebrows cheekily, making him smile more, eyes sparkling and all.</p><p>\u2018So you were. I apologise.\u2019 He kisses me tenderly and tucks me back under his arm. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u2019 I reply, letting my body mould into the sharp edges of his frame and my hand slip up the hem of his T-shirt. This Miller Hart I really adore \u2013 laid-back, carefree, and expressive. I\u2019m tucked snugly under his arm, relishing in his tender kisses on my head and soft strokes of my arm. But then he starts to move me, positioning me on my back so I\u2019m spread down the couch with my head on his lap. My hair is stroked away from my face and he gazes down at me for a few moments before he sighs and lets his head drop back. He continues feeling me as he stares up at the ceiling silently while the wistful tones of the track float in the peaceful air around us. Everything is just lovely \u2013 the calmness spacing out my serene mind and Miller\u2019s touch lazily skimming my cheek. But then the sound of his phone ringing from the kitchen interrupts our peace.</p><p>\u2018Excuse me.\u2019 He shifts me and exits the room, leaving me feeling bitter and now resentful of the view, so I get up and follow him.</p><p>When I enter the kitchen, he\u2019s removing his iPhone from the docking station on the shelf, bringing the lovely song to an abrupt halt. \u2018Miller Hart,\u2019 he greets, making his way back out of the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t want to follow him when he\u2019s on the phone, he\u2019d definitely think that rude, so I sit at the empty table and twiddle my ring, wishing us back into his studio.</p><p>When Miller re-enters the room, he\u2019s still on his phone. He walks with purpose to a stack of drawers and pulls the top one open, removing a leather-bound organiser before flicking through the pages. \u2018Short notice, yes, but like I said, it\u2019s not a problem.\u2019 He takes a pen from the drawer and starts writing across the page. \u2018Look forward to it.\u2019 He hangs up and quickly flips his organiser shut, placing it back in the drawer. He doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s looking forward to it at all.</p><p>It\u2019s a few moments before he faces me, but when he does, I see immediately that he\u2019s not happy, even if his face is completely straight. \u2018I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019</p><p>My back lengthens as I sit up. \u2018Now?\u2019 I ask, slighted and annoyed.</p> <p>\u2018Yes, I apologise.\u2019 He strides out of the kitchen. \u2018Last-minute meeting at the club,\u2019 he mutters, and then he\u2019s gone.</p><p>Upset, irritated and wounded, I return to face the perfectly empty table, but then curiosity makes me stand and before I can stop myself, I\u2019m by the drawers, pulling the top one open. The leather-bound organiser is tucked in the bottom right-hand corner, screaming for me to peek, so I study its exact positioning before lifting it out and glancing over my shoulder. I shouldn\u2019t be doing this. I\u2019m snooping when I have no right to . . . but I can\u2019t help it. Damn curiosity. And damn Miller Hart for spiking it.</p><p>I flick the pages, seeing various notes, but conscious that Miller could rumble me prying at any moment I hastily skip them all until I reach today\u2019s date. And there, in that perfect handwriting, is a note.</p><p>Quaglino\u2019s 9:00.</p><p>C.</p> <p>Black suit. Black tie.</p><p>I frown and jump all at once, hearing the shutting of a door. Panicked and with a thundering heart, I make a terrible attempt of putting Miller\u2019s organiser back just right. I don\u2019t have time. I dart to the table and sit back down, using every modicum of strength to stop shaking and look normal. C? Cassie?</p><p>\u2018Your clothes are on the bed.\u2019</p><p>I turn and find Miller standing in just his boxer shorts, but my mind is too busy racing to appreciate the view. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u2019 he says as he leaves me again. \u2018Chop-chop.\u2019</p><p>Something isn\u2019t right. He\u2019s turned back into the masked gentleman, being all formal and clipped, which is an insult after our time together, especially the past few days. He\u2019s shared something very private and special, and now he\u2019s treating me like a business deal again. Or a hooker. I wince at my own thoughts, knocking the flat of my balled fist on my forehead. What\u2019s Quaglino\u2019s, and why has he lied about it? Uncertainty and mistrust plague me as I fail to prevent my mind from wandering.</p> <p>I find my phone and pray it hasn\u2019t died. I have two bars, and I also have two missed calls . . . from Luke. He\u2019s called me? Whatever for? He didn\u2019t reply to my text, and that was days ago. I don\u2019t have time to think about it. I clear them and load Google, typing in \u2018Quaglino\u2019s\u2019 as I make my way back to the kitchen. When my Internet connection finally decides to give me the information I want, I don\u2019t like what I see: a fancy restaurant in Mayfair, with a cocktail bar to boot. I\u2019m even more wary when Miller strides into the room wearing a black suit and a black tie.</p><p>\u2018Livy, I need to go,\u2019 he says shortly, standing in the mirror and messing with his pesky tie. It was perfect already.</p><p>I leave him behind, perfecting on perfect, and hurry to his room, throwing on my jeans and Converse. I\u2019m suspicious, and I\u2019ve never been suspicious because I\u2019ve never had anything to be suspicious about. I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u2018Ready?\u2019</p><p>I look up and bitterly register how spectacular he looks. He always does, but a three-piece black suit for a meeting at the club? \u2018Great,\u2019 I mutter.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 He takes his customary hold of my nape and directs me from the room.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll come with you,\u2019 I say, confidence oozing in my tone.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, you\u2019ll be bored to tears.\u2019 He\u2019s not in the least bit fazed by my demand.</p> <p>\u2018I won\u2019t be bored.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Trust me, you will.\u2019 He leans down and kisses my forehead. \u2018I\u2019ll be drained by the time I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll need you to cuddle, so I\u2019ll come and get you and you can stay with me tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I may as well wait here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you can pack some clothes and I\u2019ll take you straight to work in the morning.\u2019</p><p>I scowl to myself. \u2018What time will you be done?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll call you.\u2019</p><p>I give up and let him push me onward, down the masses of stairs until we arrive at his car in the underground car park. The silence is deathly the whole way home, and when he pulls up outside Nan\u2019s, he undoes his belt and shifts in his seat so he\u2019s facing me.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re upset,\u2019 he says, reaching over and giving my cheek a gentle brush with his thumb. \u2018I have to work, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not upset,\u2019 I argue, but it\u2019s plainly obvious that I am, although for different reasons than Miller thinks.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll speak to you later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You will.\u2019 He leans over and spends a few moments refreshing my memory on what I\u2019ll be missing for the next few hours. It doesn\u2019t improve my mood.</p><p>I get out and walk up the path to my house, mind racing, quickly letting myself in and shutting the door behind me. As I knew she would be, Nan\u2019s standing at the bottom of the stairs with the biggest smile on her face.</p><p>\u2018Have you had a nice time?\u2019 she asks. \u2018With Miller, I mean.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great.\u2019 I try to match her smile, but suspicion and uneasiness are crippling me. If it\u2019s work, then why is he meeting her at a fancy restaurant?</p><p>\u2018I thought you were staying the night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going back out.\u2019 The words fall from my mouth, my subconscious seeming to make the decision for me</p><p>\u2018With Miller?\u2019 she calls hopefully.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I reply. Her happiness at the potential news tugs painfully at my fallen heart.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>I slide from the taxi as elegantly as I can, exactly how Gregory showed me. I was torn by how to dress, but having checked Google, it would seem you don\u2019t wear Converse at Quaglino\u2019s, nor do you turn up without making a reservation, but I\u2019m not planning on eating. The cocktail bar, that\u2019s where I\u2019m heading.</p><p>The doorman nods and pulls open the glass door by the giant Q-shaped door handle. \u2018Good evening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 I straighten my back and pass him, and then go about brushing down the short pale-blue silk dress that Gregory made me buy. Miller may have disdained my hair and make-up, but I specifically remember him saying he liked the dress. And now my hair is back to golden waves and my make-up is natural again, he should be fairly pleased. If he\u2019s with that woman, then I hope he takes one look at me and chokes.</p><p>I wince as I take the stairs down to the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, my new nude stilettos pinching my toes. She smiles brightly. \u2018Good evening, madam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 I pull a confident tone from nowhere, appearing to be a regular in these types of swanky places.</p><p>\u2018Reservation for?\u2019 She looks down at her list.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to settle at the bar for a cocktail and wait for my date.\u2019 The words roll off my tongue with ease, surprising me.</p><p>\u2018Of course, madam. Please, this way.\u2019 She gestures towards the bar and leads on, taking me around a corner where I have to refrain from letting out an audible gasp.</p><p>A marble staircase comes into view, with polished gold handrails and black Qs linking together to form a balustrade on either side, leading down to the huge restaurant, all light and airy, with a stunning glass vaulted ceiling running down the centre. It\u2019s bustling, busy for a Monday night, with groups of people making happy chatter at every table. I\u2019m relieved when I see the cocktail bar is on this level, the glass panels making it easy for me to see below into the restaurant. My eyes are darting around, scanning every corner, but I can\u2019t see him. Have I made a colossal error?</p><p>\u2018May I recommend the cherry and orange Bellini?\u2019 the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 says, indicating a stool at the bar.</p><p>I decline her offer of a stool near the back of the bar and take one closer to the end so I can see down below. \u2018Thank you. Maybe I\u2019ll try.\u2019 I smile, wondering if I could get away with drinking a glass of water when I\u2019m in such a fancy place wearing a fancy dress.</p><p>She nods and leaves me with the barman, who hands me a cocktail menu on a smile. \u2018The lavender and lychee martini is so much better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I return his smile, feeling more comfortable and at ease now that my body is being supported by the stool.</p><p>I cross my legs, keeping my back straight as I peruse the menu, noting the barman\u2019s suggestion has London Dry Gin in the mix, putting it right out of the contest. I smile as I remember my granddad constantly battling with my nan over her gin-drinking habits. He always said that if you wanted a woman to break down on you, feed her gin. Then my smile fades as I recall the last time I drank gin myself.</p><p>The cherry and orange Bellini has champagne in it, a clear winner by a mile. I point and glance up at the waiting barman. \u2018Thank you, but I\u2019ll have the Bellini.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A man can try.\u2019 He winks and sets about making my drink, while I swivel on my stool and start searching the space below again. A quick scan produces no results, so I begin working my way over each and every table, studying the faces and the backs of heads. It\u2019s silly. I\u2019d spot Miller\u2019s head in a flash mob of a thousand people in Trafalgar Square. He\u2019s not here.</p><p>\u2018Madam?\u2019 The barman pulls my attention back to the bar and hands me a flute, garnished with mint and a maraschino cherry.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I take the glass delicately and take an equally delicate sip under the watchful eye of the barman. \u2018Lovely.\u2019 I smile my approval, and he winks again before going to tend to a couple at the other end of the bar.</p><p>Turning my back on the bar, I sip the delicious cocktail while considering what on earth I\u2019m going to do. It\u2019s nine-thirty. His meeting was at nine. He\u2019d still be here, surely? And like my phone\u2019s heard my thoughts, it starts ringing from my bag. I panic, quickly setting my drink down and rummaging through my little bag, cringing when I see his name flashing up on my screen. My shoulders meet my ears and every possible muscle in my body tenses as I answer. \u2018Hello.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m wrapping up shortly. I\u2019ll be with you in an hour.\u2019</p><p>I puddle at the bar in relief. I can get my overactive imagination and my overdressed body home within an hour. I\u2019m safe and feeling rather silly. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I breathe, taking my drink and having a much-needed slurp. Was I looking at the wrong day in his organiser? In my frantic, rushed state, it\u2019s possible.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s noisy. Where are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Television,\u2019 I blurt. \u2018Nan\u2019s going deaf.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Evidently,\u2019 he says drily. \u2018Are you ready to de-stress me, my sweet girl?\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018So ready.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up. Be ready in an hour.\u2019 He hangs up, and I sigh all dreamy and loved up at the bar, quickly necking the rest of my Bellini.</p><p>I wave the barman over. \u2018Can I settle the bill, please?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only the one?\u2019 he says, nodding at my empty.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m meeting someone.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shame,\u2019 he muses, passing over a tiny black plate with my bill. I hand over a twenty on a smile. \u2018Have a lovely evening, madam.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I drop elegantly to my feet and pivot, making my way to the exit, hoping I can flag a cab quickly.</p><p>But I barely make it two paces before I\u2019m skidding to a halt. My stomach twists and my skin turns stone cold, sending every fine hair on my body standing upright. He is here. And he\u2019s with her. She\u2019s just settling back in her seat at the table, her back to me, but I can see Miller\u2019s face just fine, and it\u2019s straight, as usual, yet I can see the boredom plain and clear. Cassie is animated, chucking hand gestures everywhere, throwing her head back on continuous laughs and also throwing champagne down her throat. Her hair\u2019s coiled into a tight bun on her nape and she\u2019s wearing black satin, not your average business meeting attire. There are oysters on the table. And she keeps reaching over and touching him.</p><p>\u2018Decided to stay for another?\u2019 the barman asks, but I don\u2019t answer. I keep my eyes on Miller and back up until my bum meets the stool. Then I lift myself slowly.</p><p>\u2018Yes, please,\u2019 I murmur, placing my bag back on the bar. I\u2019m not sure how I missed him. His table is directly below, in perfect sight. Maybe I was looking too hard. I think carefully, trying to figure out my next move. Good God, I\u2019m beginning to feel the rage burning in my gut.</p> <p>I accept the Bellini that\u2019s handed to me, then I find my phone, calling him and holding it calmly to my ear. It starts to ring. I watch as he shifts in his seat and holds his finger up to Cassie in a gesture to be excused, but when he glances down at his screen, he shows no emotion or shock at seeing my name. He slips it back in his pocket and shakes his head. It\u2019s a motion to suggest that the caller is of no importance. His actions inflame the hurt, but worst of all, it inflames the anger.</p><p>I drop my phone back in my bag and turn to the barman. \u2018I\u2019m just going to use the bathroom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Down the stairs. I\u2019ll watch your drink.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I take in a long, confidence-boosting lungful of air and start towards the stairs, taking a firm hold of the gold handrail when I reach it while praying to the stair gods that I don\u2019t make a complete fool of myself and stumble to my arse. I\u2019m shaking like a leaf, but I need to remain composed and poised. How the heck did I find myself amidst this hideousness?</p><p>Because I put myself here, that\u2019s how.</p> <p>My steps are precise and accurate, my body swaying seductively. I find it too easy. I\u2019m being watched by numerous men. Coming down these stairs is like the parting of the waves. I\u2019m alone, and I\u2019m purposely drawing attention to myself. I\u2019m not looking anywhere, though, except right at my heart\u2019s nemesis, willing him to glance up and see me. He\u2019s listening to Cassie, nodding and saying the odd word, but he\u2019s taking slow sips of his Scotch more often than anything else. The resentment cripples me \u2013 resentment that another woman is getting a close-up of his perfect lips latching onto the glass.</p><p>I quickly divert my stare downward when he casts his eyes to the stairs. He\u2019s seen me, I\u2019m certain of it. I can feel glacial blues freezing my skin, but I refuse to stop, and as I reach the toilets, I glance over my shoulder. He\u2019s coming after me. I said I\u2019d make him choke, and I think I have. His face is cut with too many emotions \u2013 anger, shock . . . worry.</p><p>I escape into the ladies\u2019 and study myself in the mirror. There\u2019s no getting away from it; I look ruffled and a little distressed, and the light brushing of my cheeks with my palms turns into light smacks as I try to slap some feeling back into me. I\u2019m in unknown territory. I don\u2019t know how to handle this situation, but instinct seems to be guiding me pretty well. He knows I\u2019m here. He knows that I know he\u2019s lied to me. What is he going to say?</p><p>Deciding that I really want to know, I quickly wash my clammy hands, straighten my dress and brace myself to face him. I\u2019m a nervous wreck when I open the door to exit, but seeing him standing with his back leaning against the wall, looking all pissed off, soon sucks up all of those nerves. Now I\u2019m just mad.</p><p>I meet his clear eyes with equal contempt. \u2018How were the oysters?\u2019 I ask evenly.</p><p>\u2018Salty,\u2019 he replies, the hollows of his cheeks pulsing from his ticking jaw.</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s a shame, but I wouldn\u2019t be concerned. Your date\u2019s probably too drunk to notice.\u2019</p><p>His eyes narrow as he steps forward. \u2018She\u2019s not my date.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What is she, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Business.\u2019</p><p>I laugh. It\u2019s condescending and rude, but I couldn\u2019t give a toss. Business meetings don\u2019t happen on Monday night in Quaglino\u2019s. And you don\u2019t wear satin dresses. \u2018You lied to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve been snooping.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t deny, so I don\u2019t. I\u2019m feeling emotion take hold. It\u2019s racing through me now, making up for Miller\u2019s lack of it.</p><p>\u2018Just business.\u2019 He takes another step towards me, closing the distance. I want to move back, distance myself, but my heels are cemented in place, my muscles refusing to work.</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t believe you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You should.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve given me no reason to, Miller.\u2019 I fight against my useless limbs and pass him. \u2018Enjoy your evening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will once I can de-stress,\u2019 he counters softly, taking hold of my neck to stop me escaping. The heat of his touch immediately rids my body of the goose pimples and heats me . . . everywhere. \u2018Go home, Livy. I\u2019ll pick you up soon. We\u2019ll have a chat before we start with the de-stressing.\u2019</p><p>Disgusted and fighting my way from his hold, I swing around and stab at his impassive face with furious eyes. \u2018You\u2019ll get nothing more from me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019</p><p>I flinch at his arrogance and confidence. I\u2019ve never slapped a man in my life. I\u2019ve never slapped anyone.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>The power of my small palm across his face creates the most piercing sound, the smack echoing in the noisy air around us. My hand is on fire and judging by the instant red mark on Miller\u2019s tanned skin, so is his cheek. I\u2019m shocked by my actions, and my frozen body and stunned face are proof of it.</p><p>He clasps his chin, seeming to click his jaw back into place. Miller Hart doesn\u2019t give much away, but there\u2019s no denying his surprise. \u2018You have a vicious swipe, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not your sweet girl,\u2019 I retort nastily, leaving Miller rubbing some life back into his cheek. Taking the stairs fast I don\u2019t veer left for the exit, the enticement of my Bellini too much to resist. I land at the bar and knock it back quickly, gasping and slamming the empty down, drawing the attention of the barman.</p><p>\u2018Another?\u2019 he asks, swinging straight into action when I nod.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 Miller\u2019s whisper in my ear makes me jump. \u2018Please go home and wait for me there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, I\u2019m asking you nicely.\u2019 There\u2019s an edge of desperation in his tone which makes me swivel on my stool to face him. His face is straight, but his eyes are pleading. \u2018Let me fix this.\u2019</p><p>He is begging, but he\u2019s just confirmed that there is, indeed, something to be fixed. \u2018What needs fixing?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Us.\u2019 His one-word answer is spoken quietly. \u2018Because there\u2019s no me or you any more, Livy. It\u2019s us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why lie? If you\u2019ve nothing to hide, why lie to me?\u2019</p><p>He closes his eyes, obviously trying to keep his cool, and then reopens them slowly. \u2018Believe me. It\u2019s simply business.\u2019 His eyes and tone are full of sincerity as he leans down and kisses me gently on the lips. \u2018Don\u2019t make me go without you tonight. I need you in my arms.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll wait here for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Business and pleasure, Olivia. You know my rules.\u2019 He pulls me gently down from the stool.</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019ve never mixed business and pleasure with Cassie?\u2019</p><p>He frowns. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m frowning now, too. \u2018Why the meal in a posh restaurant, then? And the oysters and touching across the table?\u2019</p><p>Our furrowed brows are matching, but before Miller has a chance to clear up the obvious confusion, we\u2019re confronted with Cassie.</p><p>At least who I thought was Cassie. This woman, while stunning and in possession of an amazing figure from behind, is older \u2013 by fifteen years, at least. She\u2019s obviously wealthy and very exuberant. \u2018Miller, darling!\u2019 she sings at him. She\u2019s drunk, waving a champagne flute in my face.</p><p>\u2018Crystal.\u2019 He starts twitching, pushing into my back. \u2018Please excuse me for a moment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 She dumps her backside on my recently vacated stool. \u2018Shall I order more drinks?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Miller replies, pushing me onward. C? Crystal? I\u2019m confused, but my poor, overloaded mind won\u2019t allow me to voice it or ask questions.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need for your friend to leave,\u2019 she purrs, and I look back, seeing her smiling at me. No, she\u2019s not smiling; she\u2019s smirking. \u2018The more the merrier.\u2019</p><p>I frown and look up at Miller, who looks like he\u2019s gone into shock. He speaks up, but his jaw is tight, making his words seem threatening. \u2018I told you this was just dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, yes.\u2019 She rolls her eyes dramatically and pours the rest of the champagne down her throat. \u2018And would this sweet little thing be the reason for our change in etiquette?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s none of your business.\u2019 He tries to remove me from the bar, but I\u2019m as stiff as him now, hindering his attempts.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s she talking about, Miller?\u2019 I ask more calmly than I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u2018Nothing. Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I twist out of his hold and face the woman.</p><p>She seems oblivious of the tension bouncing between Miller and myself as she demands more champagne from the barman before handing me a card. \u2018Here. Doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ll need this any more. Keep it safe.\u2019</p><p>I take it without thought and glance down at the ivory embossed words, seeing only Miller\u2019s name, telephone number, and e-mail. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019</p><p>Miller goes to snatch it, but my nimble hands move faster, pulling it from his reach. \u2018It\u2019s nothing, Livy. Please, give it to me.\u2019</p><p>The woman laughs. \u2018Put it on speed dial, sweetheart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Crystal!\u2019 Miller shouts, shutting her up in an instant. \u2018It\u2019s time for you to leave.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes widen and turn slowly to me. \u2018Oh my,\u2019 she breathes, dragging her smug stare down my frozen body. \u2018Has London\u2019s most notorious male escort gone and fallen in love?\u2019</p><p>Her words knock all of the air from my lungs and my knees give out a little, causing me to reach out and grab Miller\u2019s jacket. Escort? I slowly turn the card over, seeing \u2018Hart Services\u2019 in an elegant scrolled font.</p><p>\u2018Shut up, Crystal,\u2019 he snarls, clenching my hand.</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t know?\u2019 She laughs some more, looking at me in pity. \u2018And there\u2019s me thinking she was paying like the rest of us.\u2019 She downs her fresh champagne, while I\u2019m fighting down the bile that\u2019s rising in my throat. \u2018Think yourself lucky, sweetheart. A night with Miller Hart will set you back thousands.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop,\u2019 I whisper, shaking my head. \u2018Please stop.\u2019 I want to run away, but my thumping heart won\u2019t allow the instructions from my brain to pass through to my legs. It\u2019s bouncing them straight back up to my head, making me dizzy and confused.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 He appears in my downcast view, his face not the usual expressionless beauty that I\u2019ve fast become used to. \u2018She\u2019s drunk. Please don\u2019t listen to her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You accept money for sex.\u2019 The words stab at me repeatedly. \u2018You listened to me spill everything \u2013 about my mother, about me. You acted all shocked, when you\u2019re just like she was.

I\u2019m in shock, I feel sick, and my head is ringing. I can\u2019t even think clearly to comprehend what\u2019s happening. I feel my legs moving beneath me, but I don\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. I can feel my heart beating wildly, but I don\u2019t seem to be able to breathe. My eyes are open, but all I can see is my mother.</p> <p>\u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>I look up at him blankly, finding sorrow, anguish and torment. \u2018Tell me I\u2019m dreaming this,\u2019 I murmur quietly. It\u2019ll be the worst dream ever, but as long as it\u2019s not real, I don\u2019t care. Please let me wake up.</p><p>His face screws up in defeat as he stops walking, bringing me to a halt by the giant glass doors. He looks totally beaten. \u2018Olivia, I wish I could say yes.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m pulled into his arms and compressed against his chest violently, but I don\u2019t return his thing. I\u2019m numb.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re going home.\u2019 He tucks me into his side and leads me onto the street. We walk some distance, neither one of us saying anything, me because I physically can\u2019t and Miller because I know he doesn\u2019t know what to say. I might\u2019ve been rendered useless by shock, but my brain is working better than ever before, and it\u2019s making me relive memories that I\u2019ve already spent too much time on recently. My mother. Me. And now Miller.</p><p>I\u2019m bundled into his car carefully, like he\u2019s worried I might break. I might \u2013 if I\u2019m not broken already. I want to rewind the evening, change so many things, but where would I be then, apart from unaware and completely in the dark?</p> <p>\u2018Would you like me to take you home?\u2019 he asks quietly, settling cautiously in his seat.</p><p>I turn my blank face to his. The roles are reversed. It\u2019s him showing all of the emotion now, not me. \u2018Where else would I want to go?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>His eyes drop, he starts the engine, and I\u2019m driven home with Snow Patrol reminding me to open my eyes.</p><p>The journey is slow, like he\u2019s dragging it out, making it last for the longest time, and when he slowly pulls up outside Nan\u2019s house, I open the door to get out without delay.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 He sounds desperate as he seizes my arm and stops me from getting any further, but he says no more. I\u2019m not sure what he can say, and he clearly doesn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, hoping I\u2019m going to wake at any moment and find myself wrapped in his thing, safe in his bed away from the cold harshness of the reality that I\u2019ve found myself in \u2013 a reality that is all too familiar.</p><p>The silence is disturbed by Miller\u2019s phone, and he stabs at the reject button on a curse, but it soon rings again. \u2018Fuck!\u2019 he yells, tossing it onto the dashboard. It stops and chimes again.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d better get that.\u2019 I pull my arm from his grip. \u2018I expect they are all prepared to hand over their thousands for a night with London\u2019s most notorious male escort. You may as well make some extra cash while you f**k a woman. I must owe you thousands.\u2019</p> <p>I ignore his wince and leave him in the car with a face full of hurt, set on throwing all my energy into getting over the second prostitute I\u2019ve been landed with in my short life. Except this one accepted and comforted me. This one will be harder to get over. No, this one will be impossible to get over. I can feel a darker solitude awaiting me.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>When dawn breaks, I\u2019m still staring blankly up at the ceiling of my bedroom. It was a catch-22 situation \u2013 fall asleep and have nightmares, or stay awake and live them. My decision was made for me. I couldn\u2019t sleep. My poor mind isn\u2019t being given any respite and my eyes are being bombarded with flashbacks of his face. I\u2019m in no fit state to face the world. Just as I feared, I\u2019m further in solitary than I ever was before I met Miller Hart.</p><p>My mobile chimes from my bedside table and I reach over, knowing it could be only one of two people, but going by the defeated look on Miller\u2019s face last night, I\u2019m opting for Gregory. He\u2019ll want the lowdown from the rest of my weekend with the coffee-hater. I\u2019m right. I feel no guilt as I reject his call and let the voicemail pick it up. I can\u2019t speak to anyone. I fire him a quick text.</p><p>Late 4 work. Call u later. Hope u r ok xx</p><p>I might be late, I\u2019m not sure, but it doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m not going anywhere, except further under my covers where it\u2019s dark and silent. I hear the creaking of floorboards, and then the chirpy singing of Nan. It makes my eyes swell with tears again, but I brush them determinedly away when she barrels into my room and hits me with delighted navy eyes.</p><p>\u2018Morning!\u2019 she chirps, making her way to my curtains and flinging them open. The morning light attacks my eyes.</p><p>\u2018Nan! Shut the curtains!\u2019 I burrow under my covers, escaping the brightness but mostly escaping the look of her cheerful face. It\u2019s eating me up inside.</p><p>\u2018But you\u2019ll be late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have to work today.\u2019 I\u2019m on autopilot as I blurt an excuse to keep me in bed and hopefully Nan away. \u2018I\u2019m working Friday night so Del gave me today off. I\u2019m going to catch up on some sleep.\u2019 I keep my face hidden under the covers and even though I can\u2019t see her, I know she\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t get much sleep at Miller\u2019s over the weekend, then?\u2019 The delight in her tone cripples me.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 This is a ridiculously inappropriate conversation to be having with my grandmother, but I know it\u2019ll pacify her and give me some peace . . . for now. I have no room to accept any guilt for lying to her.</p><p>\u2018Wonderful!\u2019 she cries. \u2018I\u2019m going shopping with George.\u2019 I feel her hand rub my back over the bedcovers briefly before her footsteps get quieter and the door to my room closes.</p><p>Finding the strength to break my split with Miller to Nan will have to wait until I can think of a plausible reason. She won\u2019t settle for anything less than a full explanation. She doesn\u2019t love Miller Hart; she loves the idea of me being happy and in a stable relationship. But if I\u2019m mistaken and she does love Miller, then I can soon remedy that . . . but I won\u2019t. My recent revelation will only stir ghosts for Nan, too. She might be spunky, but she\u2019s still an old lady. I\u2019ll suffer this darkness alone.</p><p>I relax into my mattress and attempt to find sleep, hoping my dreams don\u2019t bring more nightmares.</p><p>I was hoping in vain. My sleep was restless, seeing me waking regularly, sweating, breathless, and mad. I give up come evening. After forcing myself to shower, I lie wrapped in a towel on the bed, trying to rid my mind of Miller and desperately trying to seek something else to focus on. Anything other than him.</p><p>I should join a gym. I bolt upright in bed. I have joined a gym. \u2018Bollocks!\u2019 I grab my phone and note that I have forty minutes to get myself to my induction. I can do it, and it\u2019s the perfect distraction. They say working out alleviates stress and gets the feel-good pheromones pumping. It\u2019s just what I need. I swing into a rushed frenzy, stuffing some leggings, an oversized T-shirt and my white Converse into a bag. I\u2019ll look like a complete amateur, with no sporty-looking get-up in sight, but it\u2019ll do for now. I\u2019ll go shopping. I bundle my heavy hair up with a hair tie as I scurry down the landing, coming to a stop when my phone declares the arrival of a text message. Walking slowly down the stairs, my heart drops with each step I take when I see it\u2019s him.</p><p>I\u2019ll be at Langan\u2019s Brasserie on Stratton St at 8.</p><p>I want my four hours.</p><p>My arse hits the step halfway down the stairs, and I stare at the message, reading it over and over. He\u2019s had far more than his four hours already. What point is he trying to make here? He\u2019s holding me to a deal which was made weeks ago, and has since been quashed by feelings and too many encounters to list. He even said himself that it was a stupid deal. It really was a stupid deal. It still is a stupid deal.</p><p>His unreasonable demand stirs years of anger until it\u2019s fizzing uncontrollably in my gut. I\u2019ve battled years of self-torture. I\u2019ve beat myself up trying to understand what my mother found that was more important than me and my grandparents. I\u2019ve watched the agony she caused affect my dear nan and gramps, and I\u2019ve tinkered too close to causing more agony myself. I still could, if Nan ever discovered where I really was during my disappearing spell. He\u2019s listened to me spill my heart to him, he drowned me in compassion, and all the while he was the king of debasement? I glance back down at his message. He thinks by reverting back to the clipped, arrogant arsehole he\u2019ll have me falling at his feet again? A red mist falls, blocking the questions I want to ask and the answers I need to find. I can see nothing except resentment, hurt and burning anger. I\u2019m not going to the gym to lash out my hurt on a treadmill or punchbag. Miller can take it all.</p><p>I jump up and dash to my bedroom, snatching down the third and final dress from my shopping trip with Gregory. Giving it a good inspection, I conclude very quickly that he\u2019ll disintegrate before my eyes. Holy shit, it\u2019s lethal. I have no idea what possessed me to allow Gregory to talk me into buying it, but I\u2019m so glad I did. It\u2019s red, it\u2019s backless, it\u2019s short, it\u2019s . . . reckless.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve taken my time to shower again, shaving everywhere and creaming from top to toe, I wriggle into the dress. The design won\u2019t allow for a bra, which, annoyingly, isn\u2019t a problem for me and my sparse chest. I flip my head upside down and blast my masses of blond into perfect waves that tumble freely, then I apply some make-up, concentrating on keeping it natural, just how he likes it. My new black stilettos and bag finish me off and, deciding a jacket will spoil the effect, I\u2019m soon darting down the stairs faster than is safe.</p><p>The door swings open before I make it there, Nan and George halting all conversation when they clock me flying towards them.</p><p>\u2018Wowzers!\u2019 George blurts, then apologises profusely when Nan scowls at him. \u2018Sorry. Bit of a shock, that\u2019s all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you going out with Miller?\u2019 Nan looks like she\u2019s just hit the jackpot at bingo.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I rush past them.</p><p>\u2018Jolly good!\u2019 she sings. \u2018See how she rocks the red, George?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t hear George\u2019s reply, although I gather from his reaction to my red-clad body that it was a resounding yes.</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve run halfway down the street to the main road, I\u2019m verging on breaking out in a sweat, so I slow my pace, also thinking that I should be fashionably late \u2013 make him sweat. I hover on the corner for a few minutes, ironically feeling like a hooker, before I flag down a cab and tell him my destination.</p><p>I check my make-up in the reflection of the window, make a fuss of my hair and brush my dress down, making certain that it won\u2019t be creased. I\u2019m being as precise as Miller, but I bet he hasn\u2019t got butterflies in his stomach, and I\u2019m damning myself to hell for having a whole farm of them fluttering around in my tummy.</p><p>When the cabbie turns onto Piccadilly towards Stratton Street, I glance at the dashboard clock. It\u2019s five past eight. I\u2019m not late enough, and I need a cash machine, too. \u2018This will do,\u2019 I say, rummaging through my purse and passing over my only twenty. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I slide out as elegantly as possible and stride down a busy Piccadilly, where on a weeknight evening I look ridiculously overdressed. This only heightens my self-consciousness, but remembering what Gregory told me, I try my very hardest to appear confident \u2013 like I always make this much effort. Once I\u2019ve found a cashpoint, I withdraw some money and round the corner onto Stratton Street. It\u2019s eight-fifteen, making me a perfect quarter of an hour late. The door is opened for me and I take a deep breath of confidence, entering looking cool and self-assured, when on the inside I\u2019m wondering what the frigging hell I\u2019m doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Are you meeting someone, madam?\u2019 the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 asks, giving me the once-over, looking both impressed and a little disapproving. It makes me pull my hem down, which I immediately mentally chastise myself for.</p><p>\u2018Miller Hart,\u2019 I inform him with the utmost confidence, making up for the little slip-up of adjusting my hem.</p><p>\u2018Ah, Mr Hart.\u2019 He clearly knows him. It makes me feel like crap. Does he know what Miller does? Does he think I\u2019m a client? My anger burns the nerves away.</p><p>He smiles brightly at me and indicates for me to follow, which I do while struggling not to look around the restaurant for Miller.</p> <p>As we pass through the randomly placed tables, I begin to feel the deep burn on my skin that my heart\u2019s nemesis spikes, just from looking at me. Wherever he is, he\u2019s seen me, and as I slowly cast my eyes around, I see him, too. There would be nothing that I could ever do to stop the increase of my heart rate, nor the hitching of my breath. He may be the male equivalent of a high-class prostitute, but he\u2019s still Miller and he\u2019s still stunning and he\u2019s still . . . perfect. He rises from his chair and fastens the button of his jacket, his dark stubble gracing his inconceivably gifted face, his blue eyes blistering me as I approach. I don\u2019t falter. I meet his gaze with equal resolve, noting immediately what I\u2019m about to encounter. He has an air of determination surrounding him. He\u2019s going to try and seduce me again, which is fine, but he won\u2019t be getting his sweet girl.</p><p>He nods at the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, a signal that he\u2019ll take it from here, then rounds the table and pulls my chair out for me. \u2018Please.\u2019 He swoops his hand towards the seat.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I sit and place my bag on the table, almost relaxed until Miller lays his hand on my shoulder and pushes his mouth to my ear.</p><p>\u2018You look unimaginably beautiful.\u2019 He pulls my hair to the side and skims his lips across the tender hollow below my ear. He can\u2019t see me, so it doesn\u2019t matter that I close my eyes, but my neck tilting to give him space is a dead giveaway of what he does to me. \u2018Exquisite,\u2019 he murmurs, sending a wave of tingles down my spine.</p><p>Relieving me of his touch, he appears in front of me again, unbuttoning his jacket and taking his seat. He glances down at his expensive watch and raises his eyebrows, silently observing my lateness.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ve taken the liberty of ordering for us.\u2019</p><p>I match his raised brow. \u2018You were obviously confident that I would be here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 He collects a bottle of white wine from the floor-standing wine bucket that\u2019s positioned next to the table and starts to pour. The glasses are smaller than the red ones that we used yesterday, and I\u2019m wondering how Miller will cope with the placing of things on the restaurant table. Nothing is positioned as it would be at home, but he doesn\u2019t seem too bothered by it. He\u2019s not twitchy, and weirdly that is making me very twitchy. I almost want to put the wine on the table where it belongs.</p><p>Pulling my wandering mind back to the man sitting opposite me, I observe his cool persona for a few moments, then I speak. \u2018Why did you ask me to come?\u2019</p><p>He lifts his glass and swirls the wine slowly before taking it to those devastating lips and drinking slowly, all the time ensuring his eyes never stray from mine. He knows what he\u2019s doing. \u2018I don\u2019t recall asking you to come.\u2019</p><p>For a split second, I nearly lose my composure. \u2018You don\u2019t want me here?\u2019 I ask cockily.</p> <p>\u2018As I recall, I sent you a message telling you that I would be here at eight. I also expressed my desire for something. I didn\u2019t demand it.\u2019 He takes another slow sip. \u2018But by you being here, I\u2019m assuming you would like to give me what I desire.\u2019</p><p>His arrogance has returned full force. It spikes my own sass, and I know Miller is now wary of my sass. He likes his sweet girl. I reach into my purse and gather the cash I\u2019ve loaded myself with. Then I toss it on the plate in front of him and relax back in my chair, all brash and calm. \u2018I\u2019d like to be entertained for four hours.\u2019</p><p>His wine glass is floating between his mouth and the table as he stares down at the pile of money, which I\u2019ve diabolically used my savings account to obtain; the savings account which contains every penny that my mother left me, the savings account which I have never dipped into out of principle. How ironic that I\u2019m now using some of the money to have myself . . . entertained. I\u2019ve drawn a reaction, just like I planned, and the words he once said are dancing at the front of my mind, egging me on. Promise me you won\u2019t ever degrade yourself like that again. Me? What about him?</p><p>He\u2019s speechless. His eyes are fixed on the money, and I can definitely see his suspended hand begin to shake, the wine rippling as evidence. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 he asks tightly, settling his glass down. I\u2019m not shocked when I see him reposition the glass before he raises incensed blues to me.</p><p>\u2018A thousand,\u2019 I reply, completely unruffled by his obvious anger. \u2018I know the notorious Miller Hart demands more, but as we\u2019re brokering a deal on just four hours and you know what you\u2019re getting, I figured a thousand was fair.\u2019 I take my glass and sip lazily, making an exaggerated display of swallowing and licking my lips. His blue eyes are wider than usual. His shock probably wouldn\u2019t be noticeable to anyone else, but I know those eyes, and I know that most of his emotion comes from them.</p><p>He breathes in deeply and slowly scrapes the money from his plate, tidying it into a neat pile before reaching for my bag and stuffing it back inside. \u2018Don\u2019t insult me, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re insulted?\u2019 I actually laugh. \u2018How much money have you made from giving yourself to those women?\u2019</p><p>He leans forward, his jaw ticking. Oh, I\u2019m drawing emotion all right. \u2018Enough to buy an exclusive club,\u2019 he says coldly, \u2018and I don\u2019t give myself to those women, Olivia. I give them my body, nothing else.\u2019</p> <p>I wince, and I know he catches it, but listening to him speaking like that is turning my stomach. \u2018You hardly give me anything else, either,\u2019 I state unfairly. He absolutely has given me something other than his body, and his barely noticeable recoil tells me he knows it, too. He\u2019s hurt by my claim. \u2018Buy yourself a new tie.\u2019 I take the money out and throw it on his side of the table, shocked by my own harshness, but his reactions are egging me on, feeding my unreasonable need to prove something, even though I\u2019m not entirely sure what the purpose of my coldness is achieving. I can\u2019t stop, though. I\u2019m on autopilot.</p><p>The hollows of his cheeks begin to pulse. \u2018And how was it different when you did it?\u2019 He grinds the question out.</p><p>I try to conceal my choked breath. \u2018I put myself in that world for a reason,\u2019 I seethe. \u2018I didn\u2019t relish in the extravagance. I didn\u2019t make a living from selling myself.\u2019</p><p>His mouth snaps shut and he lets his eyes fall to the table briefly before he stands and buttons his jacket. \u2018What\u2019s happened to you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve told you before, Miller Hart. You\u2019ve happened to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t like this person. I like the girl who I\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then. You. Should. Have. Left. Me. Alone.\u2019 I speak slowly and clearly, yanking yet more feeling from this apparently emotionless man. He\u2019s barely containing himself. I\u2019m not sure whether he wants to shout or cry.</p><p>We\u2019re briefly interrupted when the waiter places a platter of ice and oysters on the table. He doesn\u2019t speak or ask if we require anything else. He skulks off quickly and quietly, aware of the obvious tension, leaving me staring at the platter in disbelief.</p><p>\u2018Oysters,\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018Yes, enjoy. I\u2019m leaving,\u2019 he says, clearly forcing his body to turn away from me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a paying client,\u2019 I remind him, reaching for one of the shells and dislodging the meat with my fork.</p><p>He turns slowly back toward me. \u2018You make me feel cheap.\u2019</p><p>Good, I think to myself. Expensive suits and luxury living doesn\u2019t make this acceptable. \u2018And the other women don\u2019t?\u2019 I ask. \u2018Should I have bought you a Rolex?\u2019 I slowly raise the oyster to my lips and tip it down my throat, wiping the back of my hand across my mouth and holding his gaze while I lick my lips seductively.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t push me, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck me,\u2019 I mouth, leaning forward in my chair, getting a strange thrill from seeing him struggle to know what to do with me. He didn\u2019t bargain on this when he set this up. I\u2019m turning this around on him.</p><p>He takes a few moments to gather himself before leaning across the table. \u2018You want me to f**k you?\u2019 he asks, not bothered about his gentlemanly manners in the presence of nearby diners.</p><p>I manage to contain my recoil at his returned confidence, even if I don\u2019t utter any words.</p><p>He leans in further, his face deadly serious, all hurt, anger and shock seeming to have disappeared. \u2018I asked you a question. You know how I feel about repeating myself.\u2019</p><p>For reasons I\u2019ll probably never know, I don\u2019t hesitate. \u2018Yes.\u2019 My voice is a breathy murmur and, despite fighting it, my body is flying into full-on responsive mode.</p><p>His eyes are burning through me. \u2018Get up.\u2019</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>I stand immediately and wait for him to round the table and collect me, taking a firm grip of my neck and pushing me out of the restaurant urgently. When we hit the fresh evening air, I\u2019m directed across the road towards a regal, grand hotel where I expect his car is parked, except we don\u2019t head to the car park. The doorman opens the glass door and I\u2019m pushed through, suddenly surrounded by exceptionally traditional decor, with a stone fountain in the centre of the foyer and old worn leather couches scattered everywhere. Character is bursting from every corner. It\u2019s classically stately, like the Queen herself might appear at any moment.</p><p>Miller drops his hold of my neck. \u2018Wait,\u2019 he instructs shortly, approaching the reception area. He speaks quietly to the woman behind the large, curved counter for a few moments, before taking a key that\u2019s quickly handed to him. He turns and cocks his head towards the stairs, but with his lack of hold on my neck, I\u2019m feeling a little unstable. \u2018Livy,\u2019 he grinds, his impatience kicking me into action.</p><p>He leaves me free from his grip as we take the stairs, the tension bouncing between us almost unbearable, but I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s sexual tension or nervous tension.</p><p>It\u2019s both.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous now, while Miller is overflowing with sexual craving. He stares blankly forward, displaying nothing, which isn\u2019t unusual, except now it\u2019s making me uneasy. He\u2019s shut down completely, and even though I\u2019m sizzling with desire, I\u2019m also a little apprehensive.</p><p>I\u2019m reclaimed by his hold on my neck when we reach the fourth floor and I\u2019m being guided down the extravagant corridor until he\u2019s inserting a card into a door and pushing me into a room. I should be overwhelmed by the gigantic four-poster bed and the gushing luxury, but I\u2019m too busy trying to balance my senses. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the room, feeling exposed and vulnerable, while Miller looks poised and powerful.</p><p>He reaches up and starts unravelling his tie slowly. \u2018Let\u2019s see what a grand gets you with the notorious Miller Hart, shall we?\u2019 His tone indicates complete detachment. \u2018Strip, sweet girl.\u2019 His endearment for me is rife with sarcasm.</p><p>I search everywhere for my earlier brashness, but I\u2019m struggling to find it.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re hesitating, Livy. The women I f**k don\u2019t waste time when they have me.\u2019</p><p>His words tear at my heart a little, but also inject some courage and reignite my anger. I can\u2019t let him see me wavering. I instigated this, but why I have is now forgotten. I firm up my movements and pull my dress from my body, letting it fall to the ground, the red material pooling at my feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018No bra,\u2019 he muses, shrugging his jacket off and unbuttoning his waistcoat. His eyes are dragging slowly down my body, drinking me in. \u2018Take your knickers off.\u2019 His commanding tone has been used plenty before, but the soft edge has long gone. I don\u2019t want to be turned on by it. I don\u2019t want the throb between my thighs to intensify. I don\u2019t want to find the conceited arsehole before me attractive. Yet I can\u2019t prevent my body from responding to him. I\u2019m shaking with anticipation. I\u2019m a foregone conclusion. Even now.</p><p>I slowly push my underwear down my thighs and step out, then kick my shoes off. I\u2019m naked, and when I return my eyes to Miller and see he\u2019s now bare-chested, I forget any reluctance, being blinded by the pure extravagance of his torso. There really are no words, but when his trouser and boxers are slowly removed, I find one.</p><p>\u2018Ohhh . . .\u2019 I breathe, my lips parting in an attempt to get some air into my lungs. His clothes are cast aside carelessly and he\u2019s staring at me through his dark lashes as he slides a condom on.</p><p>\u2018Impressed?\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s asked. It\u2019s nothing that I haven\u2019t seen before, but it improves every time I\u2019m confronted with it. Miller\u2019s perfect cock, his perfect body, and his perfect face. It all screams hazard. It did before. I knew it then and I most definitely know it now.</p><p>\u2018Are you going to make me ask you again?\u2019</p><p>I return my eyes to his and form some words. \u2018Not a thousand pounds impressed.\u2019 My cockiness shocks me.</p><p>His jaw tightens and he starts to approach, taking slow, even strides until he\u2019s pushed up against my front, breathing down on me. \u2018Let\u2019s see what we can do about that.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to respond. I\u2019m pushed back to the bed until the edge meets the back of my thighs and I can go no further. I\u2019m desperate to feel him, so I lift my hands and push my fingers into his hair, messing up his dark waves with a few circling caresses.</p> <p>\u2018Get your hands off me,\u2019 he growls. I can\u2019t hide my shock at his severe order, my hands instantly falling away from his head to my sides. \u2018You don\u2019t get to touch me, Livy.\u2019 He reaches forward and takes my nipple between his thumb and forefinger, squeezing hard.</p><p>I hiss in pain and cry out, but the shot of pain surprises me and falls into my groin, mixing with the pleasure. It\u2019s a heady cocktail of feelings, and I have not the first idea of how to deal with them.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to drive you insane,\u2019 he declares, producing a belt from behind his back. The sight of the brown leather makes my eyes widen and fly to his, finding an element of uncertainty. He\u2019s unsure; I can see it.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re going to hurt me?\u2019 I ask, the potential of the belt sending a shockwave of fear coursing through me.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t hurt women, Olivia. Lift your hands to the bar.\u2019</p><p>I look up, seeing the brown wooden bar stretching from one post to another and, relieved his intentions seem to be different from my thoughts, I lift willingly. But I can\u2019t reach. \u2018I can\u2019t . . .\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Get on the bed.\u2019 He\u2019s brusque, impatient.</p><p>Negotiating the soft mattress is a task, but I eventually steady myself, without any offer of assistance, and hold my wrists to the bar. He\u2019s going to bind me, restrain me, and while it\u2019s a more appealing option than the thought of being whipped, I\u2019m not entirely happy about it. I thought he\u2019d f**k me. I didn\u2019t expect the introduction of restraints, and I certainly thought I would be able to touch him.</p><p>His tallness allows him to reach the bar with ease, and he sets about weaving the leather between my wrists and around the bar effortlessly and confidently. He\u2019s done this before. \u2018Don\u2019t fidget,\u2019 he snaps when I start to wriggle, the leather cutting into the bone of my wrists.</p><p>\u2018Miller, it\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bailing on me?\u2019 He raises a challenging eyebrow, victory gushing from his blues. He thinks I will. He thinks that I\u2019m going to call a halt to this.</p><p>He\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I raise my chin in confidence, my sureness strengthening when he loses the smugness.</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He pulls my legs down from the bed so I\u2019m suspended, the leather instantly becoming taut and sharp around my wrists. \u2018Hold onto the bar to ease the pressure.\u2019</p> <p>I manage to follow through on his command, linking my fingers over the bar. It alleviates the cutting of the leather into my flesh, making me more comfortable, but Miller\u2019s severe words and harsh face do not. He\u2019s only ever made love to me. He\u2019s only ever worshipped me. I can see clearly that I\u2019m going to get neither now.</p><p>He starts running his eyes over my naked, suspended body, clearly trying to decide where to start, then after staring at the apex of my thighs for a few moments, he places his hand on my thigh and starts stroking his way up until he\u2019s brushing lightly over my clitoris. I draw in a long breath and hold it. This action is quite tender, but I\u2019m under no illusion that I\u2019m about to be worshipped.</p><p>\u2018I have rules,\u2019 he says slowly, thrusting his fingers into me, pushing all of the air from my lungs. \u2018You don\u2019t get to touch me.\u2019 He withdraws and wipes his fingers across my bottom lip, spreading my wetness everywhere before leaning in, getting as close as possible. \u2018And I don\u2019t kiss.\u2019</p><p>I absorb his hard stare and his hard words. My restrained hands are preventing me from touching him, but his lips are close, so I lean forward to try and capture them. He pulls back, shaking his head, and then curls his hands around the tops of my thighs and grabs harshly, lifting me to his body. Like a man possessed, he yanks me onto him on a guttural bark, impaling me fully, no easing in and no soft words to accompany his taking of me. I scream in shock at his ruthless move, my legs hanging limply around his hips, but he doesn\u2019t give me time to adjust. He lifts my body up and yanks me back down again. He\u2019s completely merciless. He falls into an unforgivingly fast and brutal pace, hitting me repeatedly, over and over, shouting and barking on each and every strike. My head is limp, my screams loud, and my body in shock. It\u2019s painful, but as he pounds on, the discomfort starts to break and pleasure begins to push its way forward, sending my delirious mind into despair.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I cry, yanking and pulling at my wrists in a vain attempt to free myself. I need to feel him, but I\u2019m ignored, his grip increasing further, his h*ps hitting me harder. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut the f**k up, Livy!\u2019 he shouts, following through his cold order with a powerful smash of his body into mine.</p><p>I force every useless muscle in my neck to solidify my droopy head, pulling it up and finding clear blue eyes full of purpose. He looks crazed and completely detached, like he\u2019s not present in mind and his body is acting on instinct. There\u2019s nothing in those eyes. I don\u2019t like it. \u2018Kiss me!\u2019 I yell, wanting to draw the feelings that I know are there. This is unbearable, and not because of the ruthlessness of him smashing into me, but because of the absence of our usual connection. It\u2019s completely gone, and I need it, especially when he\u2019s taking me so aggressively. \u2018Kiss me!\u2019 I\u2019m screaming in his face now, but he just squeezes my thighs further and pounds harder, the sweat dripping from his face. My pleasure has gone. I\u2019m getting nothing from this, except the earlier pain returning, but it\u2019s hurting physically and emotionally now. I\u2019ve lost my grip of the bar above me, leaving the leather of the belt cutting into my skin, and his hold on the backs of my thighs is pinching my flesh. But my heart is hurting the most. I\u2019m not feeling my usual comforted bliss or safety, and his denial to let me kiss him is killing me. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. And I asked him to do it.</p><p>My eyes close and I drop my head back, not wanting to look at his face any more. I don\u2019t recognise it. This isn\u2019t the man I\u2019ve fallen in love with, but I don\u2019t stop this because in a screwed-up kind of way, this will help me get over Miller Hart, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t chastise me for depriving him of my face only enflames the hurt further. The reasons for my stupid decision to do this are suddenly all I can think of as I blank out and accept his brutality. I think of all of the loving words he\u2019s said to me, all of the tender touches he\u2019s given me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll never do anything less than worship you. I\u2019ll never be a drunken fumble. Every time I take you, Livy, you\u2019ll remember it. Each and every moment will be etched on that beautiful mind of yours for ever. Every kiss. Every touch. Every word.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s loud roar pulls me straight back into a room that\u2019s cold and unwelcoming, despite the warmth and luxury of the surroundings. And something strange happens \u2013 something out of my control. I\u2019m shocked, my body taking on a mind of its own and responding to his vicious strikes. I orgasm. But it passes with no element of pleasure attached. I\u2019m attacked by one last round of thundering strikes before he raises me slightly to gain more leverage, then finishes on an ear-piercing bellow that resounds around the room. He holds himself inside me and drops his head back, his chest expanding at a crazy rate and sweat pouring down his neck. I\u2019m numb. I can\u2019t feel the pain of the leather or the agony in my heart.</p><p>\u2018Any man who\u2019s done anything less than worship you should be f**king shot!\u2019</p><p>My legs are pushed down from his waist, and he pulls out of me quickly, but he doesn\u2019t start to release me. He leaves me on a quiet curse and goes into the bathroom, slamming the door viciously behind him.</p><p>All of the missing emotion from that encounter is made up for when I begin to weep. My head goes limp, my chin hitting my chest, and I can\u2019t even find the strength to relieve the pain in my wrists by getting myself back on the bed. I\u2019m just hanging lifelessly, my body jerking from my sobs.</p><p>Destroyed.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>I hear the door open, but I keep my head down. I can\u2019t look at him and I can\u2019t let him see that I\u2019ve fallen apart. I goaded him, pushed his boundaries. He\u2019s hidden this man from me. He\u2019s fought his control the whole time.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 he roars, and I drag my heavy head up to see his face pointed towards the ceiling. His features are distorted . . . disturbed. He lets out another ear-piercing bellow and swings around, sending his fist crashing into the bathroom door and splintered wood crashing to the floor.</p><p>A suppressed sob escapes my mouth and my chin falls back to my chest.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 His voice is softer but doesn\u2019t ease my wretched state as I feel his hands working around my wrists. He wraps an arm around my stomach to hold me up while he unravels the belt, and I hiss in pain when my arms drop lifelessly to my side. \u2018Livy, you let go of the f**king bar!\u2019 He sits me on the end of the bed and kneels on the floor before me, pushing my hair away so he can see me. I pull my eyes up to meet his. My face is soaked with tears and Miller is just a blur through my glazed eyes, but the horror on his face is clear, even through my distorted vision. \u2018Oh Jesus.\u2019 He grabs my wrists, lifting my hands to his mouth, and kisses my knuckles repeatedly, but I flinch, pain searing my flesh from his hold, making his face fall further. Shifting his grip to my forearms, he studies the angry welts silently until I pull my arms away from him and stand on shaky legs. \u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>I ignore the anxiety in his voice and pick up my knickers, pulling them on as fast as my wobbly limbs will allow.</p><p>\u2018Livy, what are you doing?\u2019 he asks, moving in front of me to get in the field of my vision.</p><p>I glance up, seeing panic and uncertainty. \u2018I\u2019m going.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He shakes his head and rests his hands on my waist.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t touch me!\u2019 I shout, jumping back to escape him. I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u2018Oh God, no!\u2019 He swipes my dress up from the floor and holds it behind his back. \u2018You can\u2019t go.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s wrong. For once I will find it very easy to walk away from him. \u2018Can I have my dress?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018No!\u2019 He chucks it across the room and takes my waist again. \u2018Livy, that man isn\u2019t who I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get off!\u2019 I pull out of his hold and start towards the spot where my dress has landed, but he beats me to it. \u2018Please, give me my dress.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, Livy. I\u2019m not letting you leave.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never want to see you again!\u2019 I shout in his face, making him wince.</p> <p>\u2018Please don\u2019t say that,\u2019 he begs as I try to win my dress back. \u2018Livy, I\u2019m not letting that be your last memory of me.\u2019</p><p>I snatch my dress, collect my bag and heels, and run half na**d from the room, leaving Miller fighting his way into his boxer shorts. My head is spinning and my body trembling as I dive into the lift and smash my fist on every button in sight, not prepared to take the time to find the one I need.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 His thumping footsteps come charging down the hotel corridor as I continue to hit the buttons.</p><p>\u2018Come on!\u2019 I shout. \u2018Shut!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, please!\u2019</p> <p>I sag against the back wall when the doors begin to shut, but they don\u2019t close fully. Miller\u2019s arm appears, forcing them open again. \u2018No!\u2019 I shout, backing into a corner of the lift.</p><p>He\u2019s heaving, sweating, panic clear on that perfect, usually expressionless face. \u2018Olivia, please, get out of the lift.\u2019</p><p>I wait for him to step in and seize me, but he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s just hovering on the threshold, persistently cursing and forcing the doors open each time they try to close.</p><p>\u2018Livy, get out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I shake my head, clutching my belongings to my chest.</p><p>He reaches in, but there\u2019s at least two feet between his outstretched hand and me. \u2018Give me your hand.\u2019</p> <p>Why isn\u2019t he getting in to pull me out? He\u2019s looks afraid, and I\u2019m beginning to realise that it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m running away from him. He\u2019s scared of something else. The horrible realisation slams into my frantic mind, accompanied by countless flashbacks of him carrying me up endless stairs. He\u2019s scared of the lift.</p><p>He takes a slow look around the inside of the lift until his eyes slowly fall back to mine. \u2018Livy, I beg you. Please, give me your hand.\u2019 He thrusts his hand forward again, but I\u2019m too stunned to take it. He\u2019s truly petrified. \u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I say quietly, pressing the buttons again. \u2018I\u2019m not getting out.\u2019 My clouded eyes release the pools of tears that have been building and they begin to trickle down my cheeks.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 His hold of the door releases and his hands delve into his dark waves.</p><p>Then the doors start to close again.</p><p>And this time he doesn\u2019t stop them.</p><p>We stare at each other for the short time it takes for them to meet in the middle, and the very last image I see of Miller Hart is what I have come to expect. A straight face. Nothing to tell me what he\u2019s thinking. But I don\u2019t need expressions from him to tell me how he\u2019s feeling any more.</p><p>I stare at the door in silence, my mind awash with so many thoughts to process, but a chime from the lift makes me jump and the doors begin to open. It\u2019s only now I realise that I\u2019m standing in my underwear with my dress, shoes and bag still clutched to my chest.</p> <p>I hurry to dress myself as a corridor comes into view, relieved that there\u2019s no one awaiting the lift\u2019s arrival. Then I stop at every floor on the way down until the doors open onto the lobby. My strained heart is working overtime, smashing against my breastbone as I dart out of the lift, desperate to escape this hotel. Images of Miller escorting many women through this foyer engulf my mind and the woman on reception catches my eye as I hurry across. She knows Miller, she knew the drill, handing him a room key without question or payment, and now she\u2019s looking at me with a knowing look. I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I yelp, dropping my bag as I lose my footing, tumbling to my knees and sending an expensive leather briefcase skidding across the marble floor. Pain shoots up my arm when my palm smacks the marble in an attempt to stop my head from hitting the hard surface, my tears beyond my control now. Shocked gasps ring out through the air as I stare at the flecked marble floor. Then it falls silent. Everyone is looking at me.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay, darling?\u2019 A big hand appears in my downcast vision, the deep, grainy voice pulling my eyes up to the crouching form in front of me. I find a mature man in an expensive suit.</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>He recoils.</p><p>I scramble from my knees and fall back, landing on my backside. My heart rate has lost control. We both stare at each other.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>I scoop up my bag and struggle to my feet, not knowing how much more shock I can take. It\u2019s only been seven years, but his salt and pepper-flecked temples have greyed completely, as has the rest of his hair. He\u2019s shocked to see me too, but his face still holds that softness and his grey eyes are still sparkling.</p><p>\u2018William.\u2019 His name falls from my lips on a shocked rush of breath.</p><p>His tall body rises, his eyes roaming all over my face. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019</p><p>I swing around and see Miller come flying down the stairs, fighting his way into his suit jacket. He looks dishevelled and untidy, a complete about-face from my usual finicky, fine Miller. The lobby is silent, everyone looking at the girl who\u2019s just taken a tumble and now at the man who\u2019s pelting down the stairs while dressing himself. He hits the bottom and halts dead in his tracks, his stare cast over my shoulder, his eyes wide. It prompts me to slowly turn until I find William staring as intently at Miller. The men are in a staring stand-off, me in the middle.</p><p>They know each other.</p><p>My simple little world has been turned upside-down and has now just exploded on me. I need to escape. My legs kick into action, leaving behind the only two men I have ever loved.</p><p>William is a ghost to me and should stay that way.</p><p>But Miller is the heart beating in my chest.</p><p>Every pound of my feet on the steps jolts an image of him. Every inhale of breath spurs a memory of his words. Every thump of my heart spikes the absent feel of his touch. But nothing is worse than the imprint of his beautiful face on my mind\u2019s eye as I run away.</p><p>Escape from him.</p><p>Hide from him.</p><p>Protect myself from him.</p><p>This is unquestionably the right thing to do. Everything indicates that I\u2019m being wise \u2013 my head, my body . . . everything.</p><p>Except my fallen heart. </p> </body></html>"]
