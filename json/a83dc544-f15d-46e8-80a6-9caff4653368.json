Once upon a time, she\u2019d needed me to give her a boost. Now, she didn\u2019t need me for anything. I\u2019d let her down in so many ways. I\u2019d heard the term heartbreak before and never really understood it. Until now. Sitting here looking at her, my chest literally hurt. Taking a deep breath had become difficult since the day I\u2019d walked outside the church and saw her with Beau. I\u2019d known. I\u2019d wanted her to tell me anything to prove me wrong. Still, deep down, I\u2019d known. Ashton was no longer mine.</p><p>\u201cImpressive. You made it look easy,\u201d I said loud enough so she could hear me. She\u2019d texted me to tell me she was out here. I\u2019d come down here to think hours ago. This was where it all started. It was fitting that it ended here too.</p><p>Ashton\u2019s expression was slightly confused. I loved that look. It was adorable. \u201cI was already here when you sent the text,\u201d I explained and a small smile touched her lips.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this visit?\u201d I already had a good idea as to why she was here. I just wanted her to say it out loud. It was time we cleared the air for good. Standing up, I made my way over to where she sat on the limb but not before noticing the audience hidden in the darkness. It figures Beau would have come looking for me too. Or maybe he\u2019d followed her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to check on you. Beau said you had a concussion.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. I had a concussion alright. I skipped the rock I held in my hand across the water. \u201cHe tell you how I got the concussion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the guilt in her voice was thick. He must have admitted to bashing my head in. It wasn\u2019t her fault though.</p> <p>\u201cI deserved it. I was shitty to you all week.\u201d My chest ached harder. Seeing everyone treating her so cruelly, while I sat back and did nothing, would haunt me for a long time.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she seemed unsure of what to say next. I\u2019d let her down this week. I\u2019d let myself down. The guy I\u2019d been, the way I\u2019d reacted, that wasn\u2019t me.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let them do those things to you. Honestly, Beau beating the crap out of me was a relief. I\u2019d been beating myself up. Having someone physically beat me was a nice release.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She was surprised that I felt bad about what I\u2019d let them do to her. Damn, if that didn\u2019t make this even harder. Breathing was becoming more difficult.</p><p>\u201cAsh, you were my girl for years. Even before that, we were friends. The best of friends. I should\u2019ve never let one bump in the road cause me to turn on you like I did. It was wrong. You took all the blame for something that wasn\u2019t entirely your fault. It was Beau\u2019s and it was mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYours? How\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew Beau loved you. I\u2019d seen the way he looked at you. I also knew you loved him, more than you did me. You two had a secret bond I didn\u2019t get to share. I was jealous. Beau was my cousin and you were the prettiest girl I\u2019d ever seen. I wanted you for myself. So, I asked you out. Without going to Beau first, never once asking him how he felt about it. You accepted and just like magic, I broke up the bond you two had. Y\u2019all never talked anymore. There were no more late night roof talks and no more bailing y\u2019all out of trouble. Beau was my friend and you were my girlfriend. It was as if your friendship had never been. I was selfish and ignored the guilt until it went away. Only the times I saw him watching you, with that pained needy expression, did the guilt stir in my gut. It was mixed with fear. Fear you\u2019d see what I\u2019d done and go to him. Fear I\u2019d lose you.\u201d</p><p>That was the first time I\u2019d verbalized the truth. For years, I\u2019d held it inside. Even pushed it away when my conscience nagged at me. Watching Ashton transform her personality and never saying one word to stop her. All of it. This was all my fault.</p><p>Ashton\u2019s hand played lightly with my hair and I wanted to close my eyes and sigh from the small innocent touch. Would I always love her like this? Would I spend my life paying for my sin by living with the constant pain in my chest?</p><p>\u201cI loved you too. I wanted to be good enough for you. I wanted to be the good girl you deserved.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her say she\u2019d wanted to be good enough for me, reminded me once again why we\u2019d not worked out. She\u2019d been perfect since the first day I\u2019d met her but I\u2019d let her believe I expected more.</p><p>\u201cAsh, you were perfect just the way you were. I was the one who let you change. I liked the change. It\u2019s one of the many reasons I feared I\u2019d lose you. Deep down, I knew one day that free spirit you\u2019d quenched would fight for release. It happened. And the fact it happened with Beau doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sawyer. I never meant to hurt you. I made a mess of things. You aren\u2019t going to have to watch Beau and me together. I\u2019m stepping out of both your lives. You can get back what was lost.\u201d</p> <p>When Beau didn\u2019t come charging out of the woods cursing like a sailor, I knew he was too far back to hear us. I reached up and grabbed Ashton\u2019s hand. I was the only one who could convince her that she didn\u2019t need to do that. It was time I let her go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that Ash. He needs you.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she gave me a sad smile, \u201cNo, it\u2019s what he wants too. Today, he hardly acknowledged me. He only spoke to me when he was making a point to everyone else; I was to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>She really didn\u2019t have a clue. \u201cHe won\u2019t last long. He\u2019s never been able to ignore you. Not even when he knew I was watching him. Right now, he\u2019s dealing with a lot. And he\u2019s dealing with it alone. Don\u2019t push him away.\u201d</p><p>Jumping down from the limb, Ashton stood on her tiptoes and wrapped her arms around my neck for what I knew would be the last time. \u201cThank you. Your acceptance means the world to me. But right now, he needs you. You\u2019re his brother. I\u2019ll just be a hindrance to you two dealing with everything.\u201d</p><p>The pain was almost unbearable now. Reaching out, I played with a lock of her hair. I\u2019d been fascinated with the perfect golden color of it since we were five years old. She\u2019d always reminded me of a fairy princess, even when she was baiting hooks with chicken liver. I\u2019d lost my princess but the memory of her was worth every sharp pain in my heart.</p><p>\u201cEven if I was wrong to take you without a thought to Beau\u2019s feelings, I can\u2019t make myself regret it. I\u2019ve had three amazing years with you Ash.\u201d</p><p>That was my goodbye. Beau was out there waiting on me to walk away. It was his time now. I\u2019d royally screwed mine up. Dropping her hair, I stepped back, then turned and walked into the woods, toward my brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter One</p><p>Six months later...</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>I\u2019d known better than to come here but I couldn\u2019t keep avoiding the field parties. It was time I started acting as if Beau and Ash being together didn\u2019t bother me.</p> <p>\u201cHere, man,\u201d Ethan shoved a red plastic cup full of beer into my hand. Frowning, I started to hand it back to him. \u201cDrink it. You need it. Hell, I need it just watching the three of you.\u201d</p><p>I was thankful he\u2019d spoken low enough that no one else could hear him. I could feel everyone sneaking glances at me. They were all waiting to see how I would react. It\u2019d been six months since I\u2019d lost Ash to my brother. It was easier to see them together now but, normally, I kept my distance. This was the first time I\u2019d had to witness Ashton snuggled up between Beau\u2019s legs while my horny ass brother kissed her neck, hand, head and anything else he could get near his lips while he carried on a conversation with everyone else.</p><p>Ethan was right; I needed a drink. Touching the cup to my lips, I tilted my head back and took a very long gulp. Anything to distract me from the make-out session in front of me would be nice.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you two aren\u2019t going to the same college. I always expected y\u2019all to get signed on as a package deal.\u201d Toby Horn almost sounded let down that I\u2019d chosen to sign with the University of Florida instead of Alabama, like everyone expected me to. Beau and I had been planning to play for the Crimson Tide since we were five years old. But when Florida had offered me a full ride, I\u2019d taken it. I needed the distance. Ashton was headed to Alabama with Beau and I just couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cFlorida offered him a sweet deal. Can\u2019t blame him for taking it,\u201d Beau explained. He got it. He never mentioned it but he knew why I\u2019d gone with Florida. Beau had been careful for a long time not to shove my face in his relationship with Ashton but since graduation he\u2019d put that behind him. Every time I saw them lately she was wrapped up in his arms and he was staring at her with that ridiculous worshipful expression he\u2019d always reserved just for her.</p> <p>\u201cAlabama can\u2019t handle two Vincent boys. I needed to share the love,\u201d I replied, focusing my gaze on Toby before taking another swig of my beer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be weird not having you around though.\u201d Damn. Why\u2019d she have to say anything? Couldn\u2019t she sit over there quietly and let Beau paw all over her? Hearing Ashton\u2019s voice made it impossible not to lift my eyes to meet her gaze.</p><p>The sad tilt to her full lips made that old familiar ache start up in my chest. Only Ashton could get to me this way. \u201cYou\u2019ll survive. Besides, you two hardly come up for air to notice much of anything else.\u201d I\u2019d just sounded like an ass. Ashton\u2019s flinch from my snide comment was just another strike against me.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Sawyer.\u201d The threat in Beau\u2019s voice was unmistakable. Silence fell over the group. Everyone\u2019s focus was on the two of us. The anger flashing in Beau\u2019s glare just pissed me off. What did he have to be angry about? He had the girl.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you calm down? I was responding to her comment. Am I not allowed to speak to her now?\u201d</p><p>Beau gripped Ashton\u2019s waist and moved her away from him as he stood up. \u201cYou got a problem, Sawyer?\u201d</p> <p>Ashton scrambled to her feet, threw her arms around Beau\u2019s neck and began begging him to ignore me. Telling him I didn\u2019t mean anything by it, which we both knew I had. Beau\u2019s eyes never left mine as he reached behind his neck to unlatch Ashton\u2019s hold on him.</p><p>Setting my cup down on the bed of my truck, I took a step toward him. This was a fight I needed. Holding my aggression in was so damn hard at times. Ashton, however, wasn\u2019t having it. She grabbed Beau\u2019s shoulders and jumped up, wrapping her legs firmly around his waist. If seeing her wrapped around him didn\u2019t piss me off so bad, I\u2019d laugh at her determination to keep us from fighting. She\u2019d been dealing with us since we were kids and she knew exactly how to keep us from coming to blows. Throwing herself in the line-of-fire was the only way.</p><p>Amusement lit Beau\u2019s eyes as his angry snarl turned into a pleased grin and his eyes shifted from me to Ashton. \u201cWhat ya doin\u2019 baby?\u201d he asked in a slow drawl I hated. He\u2019d been using it on girls since we hit puberty.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way to distract him, Ash,\u201d Kayla Jenkins hooted from Toby\u2019s lap.</p><p>More catcalls and whistles started. Beau was smiling at her now like she was the most fascinating person in the world. That was it for me. I had to get out of here.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get something to eat, I\u2019m starved,\u201d Ethan suggested and Jake North agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou drive,\u201d Ethan called out and climbed into the passenger seat of my truck. Without looking back at Ash and Beau, I walked around my truck and climbed in. If he hauled her off to his truck, I\u2019d lose it. Leaving was the best idea.</p><p>Lana</p> <p>Jewel flirted outrageously with the bartender. I knew her game and was willing to bet he did too. The brilliant scheme to flash cleavage and bat eyelashes while giggling wasn\u2019t the most original idea ever concocted. Why she couldn\u2019t just be happy with her soda while we waited on a table was beyond me. The ten-hour road trip I\u2019d been on with her from Alpharetta, Georgia to south Alabama was my quota on quality time spent with my childhood friend and next-door neighbor. Jewel and I had grown up and become two completely different people but that bond from our childhood had somehow kept us from growing apart. However, Jewel could only be endured in small doses.</p><p>\u201cCome on Lana, flash him a view of those fabulous boobs you\u2019ve finally decided to share with the world,\u201d Jewel whispered as her gaze stayed on the young guy fixing drinks for another customer. Shaking my head at her ridiculous request, I picked up my soda and took a sip. I was happy with my soda. If she wanted to make a fool out of herself in hopes of getting a mixed drink, then fine, but I wasn\u2019t about to join in. The last thing I needed was to get caught with an alcoholic drink only thirty minutes away from my aunt and uncle\u2019s house. My uncle was a Baptist preacher and if he found out I\u2019d been drinking alcohol, there was no way he\u2019d let me stay with him and his family for the summer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a party pooper, Lana,\u201d Jewel whined and glared at my drink like it was offensive.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really care if she was upset at this point. I just wanted to get some dinner and then get to my aunt and uncle\u2019s. The sight of Jewel\u2019s taillights driving away was going to be a welcome event.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you, Lana. You go and get all gorgeous and finally decide to flaunt what your Momma... Okay maybe not your Momma because God knows she ain\u2019t real attractive... How about flaunt what luck must have given you and for what? Nothing! That\u2019s what! You buy yourself a new, sexy, cute wardrobe and finally get a hairstyle to show off that head of hair of yours but you never flirt. It\u2019s as if you did this for yourself and that\u2019s just dumb. Guys notice you now Lana. They turn their heads but you just ignore them.\u201d</p><p>This was a familiar tirade of hers. It drove her nuts that I didn\u2019t throw myself at any boy that looked my way. I wasn\u2019t about to tell her the reason why. That kind of information would make Jewel dangerous. She\u2019d find a way to ruin everything. She wouldn\u2019t mean to, of course, but she would. Her loud mouth always seemed to bring a world of trouble with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you that I\u2019m just not interested in dating right now. We just graduated. I want a summer to prepare for college in the fall, enjoy being away from my insane mother and just\u2014relax.\u201d</p><p>Jewel sighed and bent her head down to nibble on her straw while her eyes zeroed in on the poor bartender who had to be ready for us to be seated at a table.</p><p>\u201cYou can still come with me, you know. Skip this living with the preacher stuff and come party all summer at the beach. Corey would love you to join us. Her step-father\u2019s condo has three bedrooms and a killer view of the ocean.\u201d</p><p>A summer hanging out with drunk Jewel and friends was not appealing, at all. I had my plans and so far everything I\u2019d put into motion was running smoothly. However, I couldn\u2019t help but be nervous about the next step. It was the most crucial.</p><p>Having my naturally red hair darkened to a deep copper and styled attractively instead of pulled back in a braid or ponytail had been step-one. The darker red color had made my pale skin seem almost delicate. Then the cleaning out of my closet had been the next move. I\u2019d bagged up every single piece of clothing I owned and dropped them off at the local Goodwill. My mother had been horrified but after she\u2019d seen the clothing style I intended to replace it with, she\u2019d been very supportive. Unlike most mothers, my mother wanted to see me in shorts that showed off almost all of my legs and tight tops that emphasized my C cup boobs.</p><p>Jewel had wanted to teach me how to apply makeup but I\u2019d kindly refused and went to the Clinique counter at Macy\u2019s and had them teach me, and then I\u2019d bought everything they\u2019d used. Although I\u2019d never been one for makeup I had to agree that it did startling things to my eyes. I\u2019d closed my bedroom door and stared at myself in fascination for hours after they\u2019d put makeup on me.</p><p>Convincing my mother to let me stay the summer with my aunt and uncle had been a little more difficult. My cousin, Ashton, had helped tremendously with this part. She\u2019d talked to her mother who in return talked to mine. Our mothers are sisters and once my aunt convinced my mother that Ashton truly wanted me to come spend our last summer before college together, I\u2019d been so excited I\u2019d momentarily forgotten about the last step in the plan. The reason why I\u2019d made myself moderately attractive and begged to come stay the summer with my cousin. The goal sounded so simple but when I allowed myself to dwell on it then it became so incredibly complicated. Getting a boy to fall head-over-heels in love with you isn\u2019t easy. Especially when he\u2019s been in love with your cousin for as long as you can remember. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to curb the temper, man. If anyone could take on Beau\u2014it would be you but you\u2019d still walk away beat up,\u201d Ethan announced as I pulled out onto the country road from the dirt road that led back to the field parties.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been six months, bro. How long you gonna be pissed over this?\u201d Jake asked from the backseat.</p> <p>Why was this any of their business? Neither one of them knew what a committed relationship was like. They\u2019d both been through so many girls during our four years of high school I couldn\u2019t even name them all. Explaining to them that I\u2019d planned my life with Ashton as the center from the time I was twelve years old wasn\u2019t exactly easy. So instead, I leaned forward and turned on the radio to drown out any more of their interrogation.</p><p>\u201cYou can turn on music all you want but the fact is you got to let this go. He\u2019s your cousin and your best friend. A chick can\u2019t come between that. Not for long.\u201d Ethan was watching me from the passenger seat. I knew he was waiting on a response from me but I didn\u2019t give him one. His comment about Beau being my cousin was reminder enough that no one really knew me, except Beau and Ash. He wasn\u2019t my cousin. He was my brother but once Beau found out the truth from his mother, he\u2019d decided to keep that information locked away where it\u2019d been his whole life. He didn\u2019t want to claim my dad as his own and I couldn\u2019t really blame him. It wasn\u2019t like my dad had ever done anything to help Beau\u2019s home situation growing up. Beau held nothing but disdain for my father, our father. He chose to remember our father\u2019s brother as his dad. He\u2019d been the only dad Beau had ever known. Even though he\u2019d died when Beau was in first grade, he\u2019d been a fond memory for Beau\u2014unlike his real father.</p><p>\u201cHey! You passed Hank\u2019s,\u201d Ethan announced, pointing his finger toward the burger place we normally went to eat.</p><p>\u201cNot going to Hank\u2019s,\u201d was my only response. They were the ones who jumped in my truck. If they didn\u2019t like my need to get out of Grove then they could walk back to town when we got to where I was headed.</p><p>\u201cYou leaving Grove?\u201d Jake asked.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed and leaned back in the seat, \u201cWe may end up in Florida before he stops this damn truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlorida? I\u2019m starving and a cheeseburger from Hank\u2019s would\u2019ve fixed that,\u201d Jake grumbled.</p><p>Slowing down the truck, I pulled over and glanced back at Jake, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to get out and walk back.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and he slowly shook his head. \u201cNo man, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back onto the road and ignored the exchange between the guys. They both thought I was nursing a broken-heart. Well, they were right.</p> <p>No one said another word until I pulled the truck into the parking lot of Wings. I\u2019d driven about twenty miles south to the next town big enough for decent restaurants.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me you were headed to Wings. I\u2019d have shut up,\u201d Jake made an excited whoop as he jerked open the backdoor of the truck and jumped out.</p><p>This was somewhere I\u2019d never eaten with Ash. There weren\u2019t many places that I didn\u2019t have a memory of her so my choices had been limited. Tonight, I needed to get my mind off her and focus on my future\u2014or at least my summer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna eat my weight in some wings,\u201d Ethan said in reply to Jake\u2019s excitement over my choice of restaurant. At least I\u2019d made them happy. Not that it mattered.</p><p>Opening the door, I went inside and stopped at the hostess stand. A tall girl with long blond hair pulled back in a ponytail smiled up at me with an appreciative gleam in her eye that I was used to. It had been habit for me to ignore that look in other girls\u2019 eyes for so long that I automatically brushed it off. Tonight, I wasn\u2019t going to do that. It was time I started flirting back.</p><p>I flashed a grin that I knew was pretty damn impressive because it was one Ashton always commented on. \u201cThree please,\u201d I told her and watched as her brown eyes got bigger and she blinked several times. She wasn\u2019t exceptionally pretty but seeing her get all flustered was a nice balm to my ego.</p><p>\u201cOh...um... okay... yes... uh,\u201d she stammered, reaching for the menus and instead knocking them to the floor.</p><p>I bent down beside her to help pick them up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not normally so clumsy,\u201d she explained with two bright red splotches of color staining her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s just me then?\u201d I teased.</p><p>A nervous giggle erupted from her and I realized she\u2019d never do. I didn\u2019t like giggles. Ash wasn\u2019t a giggler.</p><p>Handing her the menus, I stood back up and pointedly shifted my attention elsewhere. I didn\u2019t need to flirt with her anymore. She\u2019d get the wrong idea.</p><p>\u201cOkay, um, this way,\u201d I heard her say. Both Ethan and Jake quickly fell in behind her. I started to follow when my gaze stopped its uninterested appraisal of the bar to focus in on a female I would happily let giggle all she wanted.</p><p>Auburn hair hung down her back and curled on the ends. Two very long legs were bare and crossed as she sat on the barstool and a silver backless high-heeled sandal dangled off the toe of a very dainty foot. I hadn\u2019t seen the face of this one yet but from the back, she was a head turner. Major potential.</p><p>\u201cYou coming or what?\u201d Jake yelled but I didn\u2019t turn my head to see how far they\u2019d gone or where they were being seated. Instead, I stood frozen watching her. Jake\u2019s loud voice caught her attention and she turned in her seat and glanced over her shoulder toward him. The creamy smooth complexion was dotted with freckles. Normally, I wasn\u2019t a fan of a lot of freckles but the bedroom look to her green eyes and full, almost unreal, looking lips made it all work. She started to turn back around after seeing what the yelling had been about when she froze and her eyes locked with mine.</p><p>Surprise, pleasure, and anxiety all flittered across her face as she studied me. I was fascinated. The bartender came up behind her and said something and she glanced back at him.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, man, come on,\u201d Ethan called out this time. Tearing my gaze off the redhead, I made my way toward the table where the hostess was standing with our menus.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, wait,\u201d a familiar voice stopped me in my tracks. Disbelief settled over me as I turned back around to see the pretty redhead making her way toward me. A short denim skirt stopped several inches above her knees as I made my way up her body appreciating the view. The white top she was wearing tied at her waist in some sort of loose knot and small glimpses of flat smooth stomach peeked out as she moved. Finally, I managed to get my focus off the impressive cleavage the shirt displayed to see her face. A small smile tugged on those ridiculously plump lips and recognition dawned on me.</p><p>No fucking way.</p><p>\u201cLana?\u201d The incredulity in my voice was unmistakable. The last person I\u2019d expected to see was Ashton\u2019s cousin. The fact she was the girl I\u2019d been checking out was even more shocking.</p><p>\u201cSawyer,\u201d she replied with a full grin on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d I asked, thinking more along the lines of what the hell happened to you? She looked nothing like the girl I\u2019d seen about seven or so months ago. That girl had been sweet, prim, and proper. This one in front of me was a walking sexual fantasy.</p><p>\u201cEating,\u201d she quipped and I realized I was smiling. A real smile, not a forced one, for the first time in months.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, I kind of gathered that. I meant what are you doing here, in south Alabama?\u201d She pressed her lips together and then her tongue peeked out and nervously licked them. Hmmm... I wouldn\u2019t mind tasting those lips either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with Ashton this summer. My friend is headed to the beach so she\u2019s dropping me off at Ash\u2019s after we eat.\u201d</p><p>Ash. Damn. Did she have to bring up Ashton? My good mood evaporated and I was once again forcing a smile. She glanced over my shoulder toward the table I had been headed to and frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are already seated at a table?\u201d She shot her frustrated gaze over toward the hostess stand. \u201cFigures,\u201d she muttered. I followed her gaze and saw the blonde hostess watching us with an irritated frown on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, turning my attention back to Lana.</p><p>She sighed and looked back at me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting on a table for at least fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ah. The waitress had given us their table. I could fix this problem.</p><p>\u201cGo get your friend and y\u2019all come sit with us.\u201d</p><p>Lana flashed a bright smile, \u201cOkay, thanks. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she spun around and walked back to the bar. Her backside was impossible not to watch as her hips swayed gently from side to side. Damn, Lana looked good.</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cOhmygod, did you just flirt with that hottie? Dang girl, when you decide to flaunt it you shoot high.\u201d The awe in Jewel\u2019s voice made me want to laugh. However, the fact I felt like I was about to throw-up kept the humor at bay. Sawyer had checked me out. His eyes had slowly scanned up my body. He\u2019d paused at my boobs. I felt the need to fan myself with the stupid coaster under my drink.</p><p>\u201cI know him. And we\u2019re sitting with him and his friends,\u201d I announced reaching for my purse and soda.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jewel squealed happily, snatching her purse out of the seat beside her and standing up. The scarf thing she called a shirt showed off all of her flat tanned stomach. The bar in her belly-button flashed two small rhinestones on each end causing eyes to immediately focus on her exposed skin. Then the Daisy Duke\u2019s she was wearing made my mini skirt look classy. The girl turned heads when she walked if for no other reason than most of her body was on display.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I snapped and headed toward Sawyer who was standing right where I left him, waiting on us. His eyes drifted over to Jewel and I watched him appraise her the same way he had me. A sick knot formed in my stomach and I fought the urge to push her behind me. I didn\u2019t want him doing that slow sexy trek up her body with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so freaking hot,\u201d Jewel hissed beside me. She\u2019d stuck out her chest further and the flip thing she did with her long blonde hair over her shoulders had just happened. She was getting ready to unleash her skills on Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cNot him, Jewel. Pick one of the others. Just not him,\u201d I tried not to sound like I was begging but but there was no masking the desperation in my voice.</p><p>I heard a small gasp beside me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the reason you...\u201d she trailed off as her mind wrapped around what she was just now figuring out. \u201cOh, wow. I get it. I won\u2019t poach,\u201d she replied.</p><p>No, but she was still tanned, freckle free, blond, and well-practiced in the world of men. Those were all things Sawyer liked.</p><p>When we reached him, I knew I had to make the introductions as much as I hated it. Why hadn\u2019t I just left her at the bar to flirt with the bartender and pretended like she didn\u2019t exist? Sawyer\u2019s appreciative gaze was locked on Jewel and although she\u2019d promised me she wouldn\u2019t flirt, it was ingrained in her. The girl couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Jewel,\u201d she drawled out in a sexy voice that had me wanting to slap her stupid.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Jewel,\u201d he replied, taking her hand in his large one and... did he just squeeze it?! \u201cI\u2019m Sawyer. An old friend of Lana\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The fact I was leaving them to make their own introductions wasn\u2019t lost on me. I just couldn\u2019t open my mouth, afraid I\u2019d let out the angry snarl vibrating in my chest. At the moment, I really hated Jewel. She was going to spend her summer with a guy that was supposed to be her boyfriend but she was unleashing all her charms to get what out of Sawyer? A one-nighter? I shivered at the thought. I just might kill her if she dared.</p><p>\u201cLana?\u201d Sawyer\u2019s voice startled me from my vicious thoughts and I blinked several times to clear my head.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exhausted from the trip,\u201d Jewel explained, covering for me. No doubt she knew what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI asked if you wanted me to drive you back to Ashton\u2019s, after we eat, so that Jewel doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was offering me a ride. Jewel would be gone. Yes, please.</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. Thanks,\u201d I managed to keep the excitement out of my voice.</p><p>A pleased smile touched his lips and I wanted to reach over and feel them. See if they were as smooth as they looked. How weird was that?</p><p>Sawyer led the way over to the booth and two other guys were smiling up at us. You could see the surprised curiosity in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cGuys, this is Lana, Ash\u2019s cousin, and her friend Jewel. They were waiting on a table and I offered to share ours.\u201d Sawyer turned back to us, \u201cThe guy to the left is Ethan and the guy to the right is Jake.\u201d</p><p>Ethan had a nice smile and short dark hair. It was just barely long enough to flip up some in the front. His dark brown eyes appeared warm and amused. I liked him instantly. I needed to pick a side of the half circle booth to slide into and he seemed less threatening of the two. Taking a quick peek at Jake I saw he was drinking in Jewel\u2019s bare stomach with his gaze. The blond curls peeking out of his baseball cap were cute but the sexual gleam in his gray eyes was a little unnerving.</p><p>\u201cJewel,\u201d Sawyer said, motioning for her to slide in on Jake\u2019s side. I moved to slide in on Ethan\u2019s side. I felt extremely grateful; I wouldn\u2019t have to sit beside Jake.</p><p>Then I watched as Sawyer slid in behind Jewel and my stomach dropped. He\u2019d had to pick a side and without a second thought he\u2019d chosen Jewel\u2019s. His offer to drive me to Ashton\u2019s now seemed unimportant. He\u2019d done it to be considerate because that\u2019s was what he was. Not because he had been attracted to me or even remotely interested. I was an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Ash had a cousin,\u201d Ethan said beside me. I tore my eyes off Sawyer as he sidled up to Jewel and focused on the guy beside me. At least he didn\u2019t look upset about getting stuck with me, instead of Jewel.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, I\u2019m the only one. I live in Georgia and only get down to visit her about once a year, at the most.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s easy smile showcased straight white teeth. I liked good teeth on a guy. And Ethan wasn\u2019t bad to look at either. His dark eyes were outlined with really long lashes.</p><p>\u201cSo, you staying long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll summer,\u201d I replied. Ethan\u2019s smile looked approving and he nodded his head.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he replied, then lifted his gaze to the waitress who\u2019d just walked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get y\u2019all to drink?\u201d she asked, tucking a strand of brown hair behind her ear and forcing a smile that didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCoke,\u201d Ethan announced, then glanced down at my almost empty one. \u201cMake that two cokes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d ordered for me. I liked that. No guy had ever ordered for me. It made me feel oddly special.</p><p>\u201cA screwdriver for me,\u201d Jewel said as if she was going to get away with this. I glared at her and she gave me a small smirk.</p><p>\u201cID,\u201d the waitress replied and this time I smirked as Jewel immediately went from looking cocky to irritated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have it with me,\u201d she replied in an annoyed tone.</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t,\u201d the waitress muttered.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I don\u2019t look twenty-one?\u201d Jewel asked as if she were shocked someone would even question it. Because, of course, an eighteen year old girl could pass for twenty-one easily. Whatever.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying,\u201d the waitress deadpanned.</p><p>Jewel opened her mouth to argue, no doubt, and I knew I needed to step in and stop her, before we all got thrown out.</p><p>\u201cJust bring her a Diet Coke, please,\u201d I told the waitress with an apologetic smile and then sent a warning glare over toward Jewel.</p><p>She harrumphed and crossed her arms over her chest in a pout. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have much in the way of cleavage so Sawyer wasn\u2019t leering down her shirt as she pushed her small boobs up with her ridiculous posture.</p><p>Everyone else ordered their drinks. Sawyer leaned down to whisper something to Jewel that made her giggle and I decided I needed to focus on the menu and just get through this. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d hoped for anything different.</p><p>\u201cYou handled that well,\u201d Ethan whispered, opening his menu beside me. I peeked over at him and smiled, \u201cThanks. It happens a lot.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and studied his menu. I did the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>If the girl giggled one more time, I was going to rip off pieces of my napkin and shove it in my ears. Damn, she was annoying. When I\u2019d first seen her I\u2019d thought she could potentially distract me from Ashton tonight but I\u2019d been so very wrong. All she was managing to do was get on my nerves. If her hand slid up my thigh one more time, I was going to end up shoving her toward Jake.</p><p>Soft laughter caught my attention and I turned my attention to Lana. She was smiling brightly at whatever Ethan was saying to her. He\u2019d been talking to her in whispered tones throughout the entire meal. That was grating on my nerves as well. Ever since she sat down beside him, he\u2019d taken up all her attention. It was as if the rest of us weren\u2019t even at the damn table.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like she\u2019s interested in your friend,\u201d Jewel said, obviously noting where my attention was focused.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d was my only response.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known Lana?\u201d she asked. I thought back to the days of her bright orange ponytails and skinny legs with knobby knees and realized she\u2019d come a very long way. Those freckles that had once made her unattractive now somehow enhanced her looks.</p><p>\u201cSince we were kids. I always used to have to take up for her with Ash and Beau. They tormented her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau?\u201d Jewel asked. Apparently, Lana didn\u2019t talk much about Ashton to her friend. If she did, she\u2019d know exactly who Beau was.</p> <p>\u201cMy br\u2014uh, cousin,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Lana threw her head back and let out a real laugh this time. Not one she was trying to silence but one where she was thoroughly delighted about something and didn\u2019t care who heard her. The long silky auburn locks brushed the edge of the table and I wondered how she\u2019d react if I wrapped one of those locks around my finger.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny, huh?\u201d Ethan replied grinning like an idiot because he\u2019d made her laugh so hard.</p><p>Lana nodded her head, reached out, and squeezed his arm. \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she replied, trying to keep the huge grin off her face.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s body language said he didn\u2019t mind at all as he leaned into her touch and began that damn whispering again. Those two were lost in their own little world.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t normally good with guys. They make her nervous,\u201d Jewel pointed out.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t look nervous to me. Although, I had to agree, the Lana I remembered was quiet and reserved. What had changed other than the fact she had gone from forgettable to gorgeous in a few short months?</p><p>Jake said something to Jewel and she turned her attention to him. Finally, I had some relief. Maybe she would grope his thigh now and leave mine alone.</p><p>Lana reached for her drink and her eyes met mine. She paused briefly then smiled at me. She really had a nice smile. And those freckles... damn they were cute.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your dinner?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She snuck a peek over at Ethan who was still staring at her like a lovesick puppy. She\u2019d managed to wrap him around her little finger rather quickly. \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d she replied, then took a sip of her drink. Those lush lips wrapped around the straw and I had to swallow hard to keep from groaning. How had little Lana McDaniel become so skilled in the ways of seducing a man?</p><p>\u201cLana mentioned we were giving her a ride to Ashton\u2019s,\u201d Ethan said and I tore my gaze off Lana and her straw to glare at him. Why I was glaring, I wasn\u2019t sure. He\u2019d done nothing wrong. He\u2019d entertained Lana and made sure she felt comfortable at the table. Forcing my face to relax, I nodded. \u201cYeah, I figured since we were going that way I could take her and Jewel could continue on toward the beach.\u201d</p><p>Ethan appeared a little too pleased. \u201cGood idea,\u201d he replied with a smile and leaned over to say something to Lana that caused her to grin.</p><p>Paying for the meal and getting out of there had been my number one priority. I was ready to send Jewel on her way. Girls who didn\u2019t take a hint annoyed me. I signed the receipt and stuck my debit card back in my wallet.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jewel said in an unhappy tone as she handed the waitress her receipt and a twenty dollar bill.</p><p>\u201cEthan, no,\u201d Lana\u2019s voice broke into my thoughts and I watched as she frowned up at Ethan who was grinning in return.</p><p>\u201cI need out. I\u2019ve got to go to the restroom before I hit the road again,\u201d Jewel said. I stood up and let her by but didn\u2019t take my eyes off Lana and Ethan who appeared to be arguing or at least Lana looked like she was arguing and Ethan was enjoying himself.</p><p>\u201cThose two are about to make me gag,\u201d Jake muttered, getting out of the booth. \u201cBesides, why the hell would he go and pay for the chick\u2019s meal if he just met her? It ain\u2019t like this is a date.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d paid for her meal? Why hadn\u2019t I thought of that? It was the polite thing to do. She was Ash\u2019s cousin. I should have paid for it. Except, I\u2019d been so focused on getting away from Jewel I hadn\u2019t thought of anything else.</p><p>\u201cCome on E, let\u2019s roll,\u201d Jake didn\u2019t try to mask his annoyance. He must have struck out with Jewel.</p><p>Lana quickly scooted out of the booth and stood up. Ethan was right behind her with her small red purse in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot this,\u201d he said as he stepped up behind her.</p><p>Lana flashed him a grateful smile and thanked him.</p><p>Stalking toward the door, I didn\u2019t glance back to see if anyone was following me. I needed to get outside and get some fresh air before I went off on someone for absolutely no reason.</p><p>Lana</p><p>Sawyer was quiet. I tried not to stare at him as he and Ethan took my things from Jewel\u2019s car and loaded them in the back of his truck. He seemed in a hurry to leave. Maybe Jewel had laid it on a little too thick with him and he was ready to get away from her. The thought made me smile.</p><p>Peeking over at him through the veil of my hair, I could see he\u2019d relaxed since we\u2019d gotten in the truck. Ethan had offered Jake the front seat and said he\u2019d sit with me in the back but Sawyer had said that he wasn\u2019t making me crawl into the back of the truck. I didn\u2019t really consider the extended cab with the comfortable backseat \u201ccrawling\u201d into anything but I hadn\u2019t argued. His angry scowl had made me scramble into the front seat. Thankfully, he\u2019d seemed to calm down once the other two got into the back.</p><p>\u201cYou can change the station if you want,\u201d Sawyer said, glancing over in my direction.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been paying any attention to what was on the radio. I\u2019d been more worried about figuring out why he was being so surly all of a sudden. I wasn\u2019t used to seeing Sawyer like this. Normally he was all smiles and politeness. This must be Sawyer after Ashton. The thought made me sad.</p><p>\u201cAh, man, don\u2019t let her choose. She\u2019s a chick. She\u2019ll pick some awful boy band shit,\u201d Jake complained from the backseat. \u201cUmph, ow, what the hell,\u201d he snapped. I turned to see Ethan glaring at him.</p><p>If only Sawyer liked me as much as Ethan obviously did. Then again, Ethan was more in my league.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a good mind to let her crawl back there and slap you,\u201d Sawyer said with an amused tone to his voice.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay, I think E bruised my ribs. I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful. There wasn\u2019t much talking except for Sawyer asking me if I was comfortable. He\u2019d turned the air vent toward me and told me to close it if I got cold. He\u2019d changed the channels several times and always asked if I liked that song. This was the Sawyer I was used to. The attentive, polite one. Not the moody guy I\u2019d witnessed all night.</p><p>When Sawyer pulled onto a dirt road, that I knew led out to the field parties, I searched the parked cars for Ashton\u2019s car or Beau\u2019s truck. I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to witness Ashton with both of the Vincent boys just yet. If Sawyer was still hung up on her it would almost kill me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see y\u2019all later. I\u2019m going to go ahead and take Lana to Ash\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Ethan cleared his throat drawing my attention from the parked vehicles to him.</p><p>\u201cUh, I can take her,\u201d he said in a cautious tone as he stared at Sawyer. Sawyer, on the other hand, hadn\u2019t even turned around to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI got this, Ethan,\u201d he replied in a cool hard voice.</p><p>Ethan shifted his gaze from me to Sawyer, then let out a defeated sigh and opened the door and got out.</p><p>Once he\u2019d closed the door, Sawyer backed up and turned around. I was silently thrilled he\u2019d wanted to take me to Ashton\u2019s but then the nagging reminder that he was probably doing it in hopes of seeing Ashton squelched my joy.</p><p>Instead of torturing myself with different scenarios in my head, I decided to ask him about Ashton.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are things with the three of you?\u201d I didn\u2019t have to elaborate. I knew he would know exactly who I was talking about.</p><p>He tensed up then let out a breath and cocked his head to the side and cut his eyes toward me, \u201cWould you believe me if I said we were doing great?\u201d The sad smile on his face broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied.</p><p>He let out a small chuckle and ran his hand through his dark hair. \u201cYou knew about them last time you were here, didn\u2019t you? I remember that time at the field party. Something had been off about that whole scenario. For starters, you weren\u2019t Beau\u2019s type and Ash wouldn\u2019t have gotten all worked up if he had flirted with you because they\u2019d mended their fences,\u201d he shook his head, \u201cguess you were the only reason I believed that story. I didn\u2019t figure you for a liar.\u201d</p><p>I always knew that lie was going to come back to haunt me. When Sawyer had found Ashton and Beau having a lover\u2019s spat because Beau had followed Ashton into the woods so he could sneak a kiss, I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of Sawyer finding out the truth that way. So, I\u2019d lied and told Sawyer that Beau had hit on me and Aston didn\u2019t think he was good enough for me. I\u2019d told Ashton later that she had to choose or let them go because what she was doing to Sawyer was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I replied. Because I was.</p><p>Sawyer nodded, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the drive over to Ashton\u2019s was fairly quiet. He didn\u2019t ask me if I was comfortable and he didn\u2019t turn on the radio. Why had I opened my big mouth? Reminding him about my part in his cousin and girlfriend\u2019s deception had been stupid.</p><p>\u201cAsh\u2019s car is here but I doubt she\u2019s home. She was with Beau at the field earlier.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and reached for the door handle. I\u2019d said enough tonight. I needed to get out of his truck before I said anything else stupid.</p><p>\u201cWait, Lana,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s hand reached out and his fingers wrapped around my upper arm. Chill bumps from his rough warm skin popped out all over my skin.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d I managed to choke out.</p><p>\u201cLook, I was a jerk. I\u2019m sorry. It isn\u2019t your fault. That crap with Ash and Beau, none of it was your fault. I just needed an outlet to vent and you were the only person around. I was wrong,\u201d he paused and I glanced back at him. \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>The sincere look in his eyes made me melt. He was like a sweet wounded puppy. Ashton had been crazy to hurt him. I mean, who does that? He was so perfect. How can you hurt someone so incredibly perfect?</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>A smile lit up his face and he squeezed my arm then let go. \u201cPhew, thank you.\u201d</p><p>We both got out of the truck and I met him on the other side to get the luggage he was lifting out of the back and setting on the driveway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you. Don\u2019t get the heavy stuff,\u201d Sawyer said as he reached for the last bag. I didn\u2019t normally pack so much but now that I wore makeup and styled my hair and had an actual wardrobe I had quite a few pieces of luggage.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t peg you as a girl who packs a lot,\u201d he observed.</p><p>I shrugged, \u201cThings change.\u201d I reached down to pick up my cosmetics and toiletries bags. They were the smaller two.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they do, don\u2019t they.\u201d His gaze shifted back to the house and I knew he was staring up at Ashton\u2019s window. He was so not over her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an idiot... for what it\u2019s worth,\u201d I would have slapped my hand over my mouth if I hadn\u2019t already had them full. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d just said that.</p><p>Sawyer swung his attention back to me. His dark eyebrows arched in surprise at my statement and I was sure my cheeks were bright red.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>Well, I couldn\u2019t exactly deny it now. So I nodded.</p><p>Sawyer took a step closer to me and my heart beat so hard against my chest I felt the need to gasp for air. His green eyes studied me carefully. It was as if he was looking at me for the first time. His eyes dropped to my mouth and I fought the urge to lick my lips nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a better choice than Beau? He\u2019s the bad one, you know. The dangerous one. Girls like bad boys.\u201d His voice had dropped to a low rumble. I shivered as he took another step closer, his eyes never leaving their study of my lips. It had been awhile since I\u2019d reapplied lip-gloss. I wondered if they were dry.</p><p>Forcing myself to remain calm, I responded, \u201cNot all girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm...\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand and gently ran the pad of his thumb over my bottom lip. I mentally imagined biting his thumb and pulling it into my mouth to suck but I didn\u2019t. Instead, I just stopped breathing.</p><p>\u201cThey are as soft as they look... maybe softer,\u201d he whispered, then he lowered his head and before I could take a calming breath his mouth was on mine.</p><p>Forcing oxygen into my lungs via my nose, I dropped both the bags in my hands and grabbed onto his arms to keep from passing out due to the overwhelming fact I was actually being kissed by Sawyer Vincent.</p><p>His hands settled on my waist and squeezed the bare skin they touched gently. I think I may have moaned when he pulled my bottom lip into his mouth to suck on it. Before I could completely throw myself at him, he was gone. Dizzy and completely shaken , I lost my balance and reached out to grab the side of the truck.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s hand shot out to steady me.</p><p>Now, that was embarrassing. I took a steadying breath and lifted my eyes, once I got them focused again, to look at Sawyer. Instead of having an awestruck expression like I was sure I had plastered on my face, he was frowning. No, make that scowling.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that Lana. I\u2019m sorry. I was upset and I just didn\u2019t think,\u201d he reached down and grabbed my two heavy suitcases and headed for the front door without waiting on me to respond.</p><p>That hadn\u2019t been the way I\u2019d pictured our first kiss ending. And trust me, I\u2019d been fantasizing about that kiss for years. Most of my life. Although the kiss itself was spot on perfect, the ending was way off course.</p><p>Anger suddenly took the place of disappointment and I snatched up the remaining bags and followed him. How dare he kiss me like that, then apologize and walk off.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>The front door swung open ending my sentence, which was probably a good thing since I was about to let him have it.</p><p>\u201cLana, sweetheart, you\u2019re here,\u201d Aunt Sarah beamed at me as she pushed open the screen door.</p><p>Shooting Sawyer an angry glare, I pushed past him and into the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be good. I mentally cursed myself for making such a jackass move. Jerking my truck door open, I started to climb inside when Beau\u2019s truck pulled in behind me. Perfect. Not what I needed right now. I needed to wrap my head around that stupid kiss with Lana. Not face Beau and Ash.</p><p>Beau\u2019s truck door swung open and he got out with an angry snarl on his face. What was his deal?</p> <p>\u201cBetter be a damn good reason you\u2019re parked in Ash\u2019s drive.\u201d</p><p>Adjusting to Beau being a caveman over a girl had been almost as hard as seeing him with Ash. Beau didn\u2019t do jealous, until Ashton had become his. Now, he was a freaking lunatic.</p><p>\u201cI just dropped Lana off,\u201d I replied, meeting his angry glare. I wasn\u2019t scared of his stupid tough guy shit. I\u2019d been in more fights with him than I could count.</p><p>My answer obviously confused him because he raised one eyebrow then turned to look at Ash as she scooted out behind him on the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here?\u201d Ash squealed, jumping down before Beau could catch her. \u201cRemember, I told you Lana was coming tonight,\u201d she beamed up at Beau then frowned and looked over at me. \u201cWhy... how did you get her?\u201d</p> <p>Ash was adorable when she was confused. \u201cShe was eating dinner at Wings when we stopped in to eat. I offered to give her a ride to save her friend the trip.\u201d</p><p>Ashton\u2019s frown turned up into a smile again. I liked making her smile\u2014always had. \u201cThank you! I\u2019m so glad you met up with her.\u201d Ash turned and wrapped her arms around Beau and laid a loud quick kiss on his lips before releasing him and stepping back, \u201cI gotta go see her. I haven\u2019t seen her in months. Call me later.\u201d</p><p>Beau grabbed her hand and turned it palm up before kissing it and then licking it. Gross, I did not want to see this. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll call you when I crawl in bed,\u201d his voice dropped until it was much deeper than normal and I swear I heard Ashton sigh. I\u2019d seen more than I wanted. I started to climb up in my truck.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, wait,\u201d Beau\u2019s command stopped me. I really just wanted to leave but he was blocking me in so I couldn\u2019t exactly escape.</p><p>Ashton ran inside and once she closed the door, Beau turned his gaze toward me.</p><p>\u201cAbout tonight. Don\u2019t do that again. It\u2019s been six months and Ashton goes out of her way to be kind to you. You talk to her that way again and I\u2019m gonna kick your ass.\u201d</p> <p>Figures it wasn\u2019t an apology but a threat. But he was right, I had been a jerk to Ashton. I didn\u2019t want to push either of them away. They both knew me better than anyone. They\u2019d been my best friends all my life. We shared a secret and we shared memories. It formed a bond so important that I\u2019d given up Ash without much of a fight in order to preserve.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I was a jackass. I\u2019ll apologize to her next time I see her.\u201d</p><p>Beau seemed appeased. His eyes shifted back to her now lit bedroom window. She and Lana would be inside talking and I wondered if I\u2019d have something else to apologize for the next time I saw her. Because if Lana told her about that kiss then Ash would be pissed. Not because I kissed Lana but because I\u2019d been a complete dick afterwards.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Beau started to get into his truck and stopped. \u201cHey you, wanna go play some pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Honey working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>That meant free beer. I nodded, \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Lana</p> <p>I\u2019d barely made it inside the door when Ashton had come racing inside squealing. She\u2019d made quick work of getting us past her parents and their questions concerning my parents and up to her room. She closed the door and spun around smiling brightly at me.</p><p>\u201cI am so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Her long blond hair was hanging loose down her back and her golden tan was already perfect. How did she do that? It had been summer for what now\u2014a week? We shared the same green eyes. That was it. When I was younger, I\u2019d hated her. Not because she was mean but because she looked like a Barbie doll. To retaliate, I\u2019d been the one who was mean.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I replied when she plunked down on the bed beside me. Getting away from my mother and her endless griping about my dad was a major relief. They\u2019d been officially divorced now for three months but she still ranted about him daily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much fun. Kayla Jenkins\u2019 birthday is tomorrow night and she\u2019s having a huge party at her house. She throws one every year. You\u2019ll love it and get to meet everyone. Then Beau and I have been talking about a camping trip. Maybe for a week up at Cheaha. We\u2019re going to invite Sawyer, since hiking is his thing, and some other people. You, of course, are coming too. Then Leann is at the beach all summer at her grandmother\u2019s beach house. So, I told her we\u2019d come visit her one week.\u201d Forcing a smile was hard but I somehow managed.</p><p>Pushing Sawyer\u2019s reaction to our kiss as far away from my mind as I could, I put all my focus into talking to Ashton.</p><p>\u201cThat all sounds like fun. I\u2019m game for whatever,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>Leaning forward she touched my hair and studied my face. Then her face broke into a huge grin, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing makeup and your hair is darker and...,\u201d she studied my skirt and top. \u201cYou have stylish clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided it was time for a change,\u201d I replied, unable to suppress my smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look hot.\u201d</p><p>Ashton stood up and started pulling off the cowboy boots she\u2019d been wearing with a black sundress that barely made it halfway to her knees. It was like God had decided to try his hand at making someone perfect and chose Ashton as his experiment.</p><p>\u201cSawyer said he brought you home. How was he? I mean, was he in a good mood?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about Ashton still worrying about Sawyer. I hadn\u2019t expected this when I\u2019d planned to spend the summer here. It had been six months since the breakup. Normal people moved on in six months, didn\u2019t they? I mean, she was with Beau now. Shouldn\u2019t everything be water under the bridge at this point?</p><p>\u201cHe, uh, was fine.\u201d Okay, so that was a lie but I wanted to protect him from her. He wouldn\u2019t want Ashton to know he was still affected by her and Beau.</p><p>She let out a sigh and plopped back down on the bed folding her legs up underneath her and facing me. \u201cGood. He and Beau kind of had some words at the field tonight. I had to jump in Beau\u2019s arms to keep them from tearing it up. That\u2019s why he left and ended up at Wings.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen them fight since we were kids. Surely, they weren\u2019t fighting over Ashton still. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, knowing I probably didn\u2019t want to hear this.</p><p>\u201cStupid stuff. Beau didn\u2019t like the way Sawyer spoke to me. It wasn\u2019t a big deal but Beau got real upset and went on the defensive. They still haven\u2019t found a way to handle me being in the middle.\u201d</p><p>The last time I\u2019d been sitting on her bed talking about the Vincent boys I had told her that she needed to let both of them go. Even then, I knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to. They were so much a part of her life. Beau, especially.</p><p>\u201cIs Sawyer dating?\u201d I asked, trying to sound as casual as possible.</p><p>Ashton let out a short laugh, \u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>That was odd. He was gorgeous, talented, athletic, polite, and funny\u2014how did someone like him go six months without some girl managing to snag a date?</p><p>\u201cNot even one date?\u201d</p><p>Ashton shrugged and pulled her knees up to her chin wrapping her arms around the front of her legs. \u201cI think maybe one or two dates. Not sure. I don\u2019t ask, really. Sawyer still acts weird around me and Beau gets very territorial if I bring up Sawyer. He doesn\u2019t like me talking about him much.\u201d</p><p>How sad for Sawyer. Ashton had been a big part of his life since they were twelve. Now, he couldn\u2019t really talk to her anymore without Beau standing over them. As much as I wanted Sawyer to be over Ashton, I didn\u2019t like the picture in my head. Sawyer, alone, bothered me. He didn\u2019t deserve that. He\u2019d been so good to both of them.</p><p>Welcome to the Jungle started blaring and Ashton reached for her cell phone on the table beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot already be in bed,\u201d Ashton purred into the phone. It had to be Beau.</p><p>\u201cReally? Oh, okay, well that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad the two of you are out together.\u201d My ears perked up and I studied my fingernails trying to appear as if I weren\u2019t completely curious about this conversation.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Be careful and remember he doesn\u2019t drink much so get him home safe.\u201d Was Sawyer drinking? With Beau?</p><p>Ashton smiled, \u201cNo, I love you more.\u201d</p><p>Oh, please.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it beside my pillow. Call me as soon as you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re catching up,\u201d she lifted her eyes to smile brightly at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, love you, bye.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her phone in her lap and let out a happy sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like how things went down and that Sawyer was hurt but I love Beau so much, Lana. I\u2019d do it all over again if I had to. I hated hurting Sawyer, I really did. I\u2019ve never been so happy. Beau is wonderful.\u201d Her voice went all dreamy and I fought the urge to roll my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>I still couldn\u2019t figure out why I was here. Sure, I\u2019d been to Kayla\u2019s birthday parties every year since seventh grade but that had been because Ash wanted to come. This year, what Ash wanted no longer mattered, so why the hell was I here?</p><p>Spill Canvas blared through the speakers outside. The pool had several different colored strobe lights pointed at it from an upstairs balcony making the blue water appear pink, purple, green and yellow. Teak loungers surrounded the pool along with tiki torches. Last year, Jake had bumped into one of those and caught an umbrella on fire. Before it could get too out of hand, Beau had picked it up and chunked it into the pool. We\u2019d laughed about it for weeks afterward.</p> <p>I made my way over to the self-serve makeshift bar right outside the pool house, which basically consisted of large metal tubs filled with ice and drinks. If I was going to endure tonight, I needed alcohol. Lots of it.</p><p>\u201cSawyer! The man has arrived,\u201d Ryan Mason slurred. He was already drunk. This was no surprise. The Mason boys were the owners of the land that we had our field parties on. Ryan\u2019s older brother had started the field parties years back.</p><p>I nodded his way and reached for a bottle of Corona that was hidden under ice cubes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it buddy, drink up. Ain\u2019t got to impress the preacher\u2019s daughter anymore, do ya?\u201d Ryan called out from the middle of the pool. He was laying on a float with some girl I was pretty sure had gone to our school snuggled up beside him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond to his asinine comment. Like Ash cared about that. Hell, she\u2019d left me for Beau. Twisting off the top and throwing it into the recycle bin beside the drinks, I took a long swig. The cold liquid didn\u2019t make me feel better but at least it tasted good.</p> <p>Turning to walk back to the house and maybe find a television so I could turn on ESPN Sports Center, I took only a few steps before the glass doors opened and out stepped Ashton, Beau, and Lana.</p><p>Ah hell, I should\u2019ve stayed home. Ashton waved at Kayla and pulled Lana over to where Kayla was lounging with some of the other girls we\u2019d graduated with. Beau\u2019s eyes met mine and he sauntered over to stand beside me. Both his hands were tucked into the front pockets of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d come to this,\u201d Beau said in way of greeting.</p><p>Shrugging, I held up the Corona in my hand, \u201cFree beer.\u201d</p><p>Beau grinned and nodded. Free beer was definitely something he understood. His eyes didn\u2019t leave Ash as she chatted happily with the other girls. The tiny cover-up she was wearing over her bikini left little to the imagination. She\u2019d never dressed like that when we\u2019d dated. Probably another one of her attempts at being perfect for me. What bullshit.</p><p>\u201cBetter be Lana you\u2019re checking out,\u201d Beau warned.</p> <p>I shifted my eyes to Lana and was surprised to see her in a pair of really tiny shorts. Her legs weren\u2019t tanned like Ash\u2019s but they were long and shaped exactly like Ashton\u2019s. The pale creamy color was delicate looking. I ran my gaze up her body and took in the way her hips flared just below a very small waist completely visible in the halter-top she wore over her bikini. It was odd that she had so many freckles on her face. The rest of her body looked so perfectly smooth she appeared almost airbrushed.</p><p>\u201cI think she likes you,\u201d Beau\u2019s words broke into my thoughts and I tore my gaze off Lana\u2019s head of dark copper curls and looked at my brother.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLana, she asked about you this evening. Wondered if you\u2019d be here,\u201d Beau smirked. \u201cI think she might have a crush on the quarterback.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my attention back to Lana at the same time she peered over her shoulder and our eyes met. She froze, as if in shock I\u2019d been looking her way. Ashton\u2019s cousin wasn\u2019t hard on the eyes and she was really sweet. I took another drink of my Corona while playing around with the idea of getting my mind off Ash with Lana.</p><p>\u201cTold ya,\u201d Beau said in an amused tone.</p><p>Maybe he was right. Lana\u2019s mouth lifted in a small smile and I remembered how soft her lips had felt under mine. It\u2019d been one helluva kiss.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get you something a little stronger than a beer. It\u2019s time you moved on from Ash before we end up beating the shit out of each other again.\u201d</p> <p>Beau headed for the pool house and I reluctantly broke the lingering gaze we\u2019d held longer than I expected, to follow my brother.</p><p>Lana</p><p>Beau pressed his hand on the lower part of Ashton\u2019s back in a territorial way as he led her toward the stairs. I watched as she fought between the desire to go with her boyfriend and her duty to stay with me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave Lana,\u201d Ashton whispered.</p><p>Beau grabbed her waist and tugged her up against his chest. His eyes never once left Ashton\u2019s face. \u201cLana is a big girl and won\u2019t mind if I steal you away for a few minutes... or more,\u201d he lifted his hazel eyes and grinned at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you Lana?\u201d</p><p>Like I was going to piss off Beau Vincent by admitting that I really didn\u2019t want to be left alone. Shaking my head, I forced a smile, \u201cUm, no that\u2019s fine. Y\u2019all, uh, go do whatever.\u201d</p><p>Beau turned his gaze back to Ashton, \u201cPlease come with me.\u201d His voice had dropped and his eyes went all dark and pleading. No way Ashton was going to turn him down now.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered without giving me a second glance. I watched as Beau led her up the stairs. Surely, she wasn\u2019t going to have sex with him in Kayla\u2019s house. Shaking my head, I turned to head back outside. Maybe Sawyer would be alone and I could work up the nerve to go talk to him.</p><p>Before I reached the door, Sawyer walked inside. His eyes seemed a little glassy and his normally perfectly styled hair was messy. I stopped and watched him as he scanned the room until his eyes found me and stopped. A slow grin spread across his lips and he sauntered toward me. Or was he staggering a little?</p><p>\u201cHey Lana, what you doin\u2019 all alone?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the nervous knot in my throat, as he stood so close my arm was touching his. \u201cUh, well, Ash and Beau went,\u201d I pointed toward the stairs unable to tell him what they\u2019d gone to do.</p><p>His amused smile became an angry snarl as he shifted his focus to the steps leading upstairs like they were repugnant. Great, I\u2019d got him all worked up over Beau and Ashton again.</p><p>A warm hand closed around mine and I squeaked in surprise. Sawyer chuckled and slipped his fingers between mine, \u201cCome on, sweet little Lana. You can come entertain me since you\u2019ve been left stranded. Besides, I\u2019ve been looking at those long sexy legs all night. You make them shorts look real good.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him as he pulled me over to an empty couch. Had Sawyer just said my legs were sexy? I didn\u2019t have time to think about his statement before he was pulling me down to sit in his lap.</p><p>He buried his face in my hair and inhaled loudly, \u201cDamn, you smell good,\u201d he murmured. One of his hands slipped around my waist and his hand spread out across the front of my bare stomach while his other hand wrapped a strand of my hair around his finger.</p><p>\u201cFeels like silk,\u201d he whispered and ran my hair across his lips. After my initial shock, my heart started racing. This was the closest I\u2019d ever gotten to a boy and the fact it was Sawyer\u2014 terrified and excited me all at once.</p><p>His nose trailed up my shoulder and then he began nuzzling my neck. I couldn\u2019t help the shiver that ran through me when his warm breath tickled my ear. The hand on my stomach inched up a tiny bit and he turned me so that I was facing him.</p><p>\u201cYou feel real good, Lana. Makes me forget everything else,\u201d he murmured as his hand cupped the back of my head and gently guided my mouth to his.</p><p>The same intense hunger I\u2019d felt the last time we\u2019d done this overtook me. His tongue darted out and licked at my bottom lip and he groaned. Sawyer Vincent groaned as he licked and tasted my mouth. I pressed closer to him and ran my hands into his dark locks hoping this kiss didn\u2019t end as abruptly as the last one had.</p><p>When his tongue swept into my mouth, I was the one to groan. He tasted like something dark and dangerous. Cautiously, I touched my tongue to his. Both his hands gripped my waist and picked me up to straddle him before he ran his hands up my back pulling me tighter against his chest. His mouth left mine and I started to protest until he began trailing kisses across my jawline and softly nipped my earlobe before kissing a trail down my neck. I wiggled anxiously as heat pooled in my belly and a strange tingling began between my legs.</p><p>\u201cYo Saw, get a room, man,\u201d a loud voice called out breaking through my foggy brain and I stiffened, jerking back out of the warmth of Sawyer\u2019s embrace. I\u2019d completely forgotten that we were in the living room! Other people were around us. My face was on fire. I chanced a peek at Sawyer who was watching me with an amused grin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go getting all shy on me now, Lana,\u201d he drawled, squeezing my sides with his hands.</p><p>\u201cSawyer! What are you doing?\u201d Ashton demanded from behind me and I scrambled out of his lap like I\u2019d been doing something wrong.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ash, I\u2019m doin\u2019 exactly what it looks like I\u2019m doin\u2019,\u201d Sawyer replied.</p><p>\u201cYou were all over Lana!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, I was. Your cousin is a sweet little thing. And she wasn\u2019t fighting me. I\u2019m pretty damn sure she was enjoying herself too.\u201d</p><p>Hoots and whistles came from somewhere around us. I couldn\u2019t seem to do anything but stare at Sawyer in shock.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s off limits. Do you hear me? Don\u2019t you dare use her--\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse her? Really, Ash? You think that\u2019s what this was about? Because baby, it ain\u2019t. I can be attracted to other girls. It is possible,\u201d the pleased tone in his voice was unmistakable. Why was he so pleased?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Ashton all but yelled.</p><p>Sawyer raised his eyebrows in disbelief, \u201cReally? Cause that\u2019s sure what it sounds and looks like from here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Sawyer,\u201d Beau\u2019s voice startled me and I turned to see him walking into the room. Oh, good Lord, he was mad.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t me this time bro. She started it,\u201d Sawyer didn\u2019t sound worried at all about the fact Beau looked ready to hurt someone.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t shut your drunk ass mouth I\u2019m going to end it,\u201d Beau\u2019s voice was cold and even.</p><p>Sawyer wasn\u2019t drunk, was he? I stared at him and he just looked relaxed. When my dad had come home drunk he\u2019d been loud and mean. Sawyer was sweet and gentle or he had been before we\u2019d been interrupted.</p><p>\u201cLana just come on, we need to go,\u201d Ashton demanded from her spot beside Beau.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s hand reached over and grabbed mine, \u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d he said in a pleading whisper. That was all I needed. I\u2019d come here for one reason, to get Sawyer Vincent to notice me. I wasn\u2019t about to leave now that I had his attention.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay here awhile longer, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d I replied, hoping Ashton didn\u2019t get angry. Not that she really had a reason to be.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your business,\u201d Sawyer said, interrupting Ashton.</p><p>Anger flared in Ashton\u2019s green eyes and Beau pulled her up tight against his side and whispered something to her. She seemed to relax a little then nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. Stay. But do not let Sawyer drive you home. Beau and I\u2019ll come back and get you when you\u2019re ready. Just call.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Sawyer hadn\u2019t promised to take me home anyway. That sounded like a good plan.</p><p>\u201cGlad you two are leaving. Lana and I needed a room,\u201d Sawyer announced, standing up rather unsteadily then tugging me up beside him. Laughter from the audience we\u2019d gathered was the wake-up call I needed.</p><p>Jerking my hand out of his grasp, I mentally cursed my fair skin and the blush I knew was covering my face and neck. Maybe Sawyer was drunk. I hoped he was because insinuating to everyone around us that we were going to go do something in a bedroom was not something the Sawyer I knew would do.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I will leave with Ash and Beau,\u201d I replied, hoping I\u2019d masked the humiliation in my voice.</p><p>\u201cWait. No. What\u2019d I do?\u201d Sawyer\u2019s hurt little boy voice almost stopped me. But his words insinuating we were going to go up to a bedroom and do -God knows what- while a room full of people listened kept me moving toward Ashton.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Ashton whispered, pulling me to her side and leading me out the door.</p><p>\u201cSomeone sober drive him home or call me to come get him,\u201d Beau said in parting before he turned and followed us outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk!\u201d Sawyer declared loudly.</p><p>Then the door closed and I had to fight back the tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>I was drunk. I\u2019d only been drunk one other time in my life and that had been the day I\u2019d found out about Beau and Ashton. I was almost positive that I was even more drunk now than I had been then. My stomach rolled and I bent over for the third time and hurled into the bushes in the front of Kayla\u2019s yard. Cold sweat trickled down my face and I rested my hands on my knees and closed my eyes praying I didn\u2019t pass out in my own vomit. What the hell had I drunk? All I could remember was pouring some rum into a few or more of my cokes. Maybe I\u2019d stopped adding the coke after awhile and just went with straight rum... No wait, I\u2019d switched to vodka. We\u2019d run out of rum. My stomach heaved again but there was nothing left to come out. Backing up, I leaned against the cool brick wall and let the fresh air cool me down.</p><p>\u201cDrink this, you stupid fucker.\u201d</p> <p>I peeled my eyes open to see Beau\u2019s annoyed expression before he pressed a cold plastic bottle into my hand. Dropping my gaze, I saw he\u2019d brought me water. The aftertaste of my regurgitated liquor wasn\u2019t appealing. I should thank him for coming to the rescue but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it.</p><p>Opening the bottle, I took a long swig and instantly felt better.</p><p>\u201cGet a few more drinks, then come on, I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>His bossy attitude was beginning to get on my nerves. He wasn\u2019t suddenly the good brother, or cousin as far as everyone else knew. Just because he had Ash didn\u2019t make him the smart one.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Beau,\u201d I snarled and took another drink of my water.</p> <p>\u201cI promised Ash I wouldn\u2019t knock some sense into you tonight. Don\u2019t make me break that promise.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I pushed off from the side of the house where I\u2019d been resting and walked past Beau toward my truck. I wasn\u2019t drunk anymore. I\u2019d just expelled every drop of alcohol from my body in the Jenkins\u2019 shrubbery.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Sawyer. You\u2019ve had too much to drink and you\u2019re ready to pass out. Let me take you home.\u201d</p><p>Stopping, I turned around and glared at him. \u201cWhy? All I do is piss off Ash. I can\u2019t stop looking at her. Wanting her. Why the fuck do you want to help me so bad?\u201d</p><p>Beau let out a sigh and returned my glare. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my brother.\u201d</p><p>That was the crux of it all. Sure hadn\u2019t mattered to him that I was his brother when he\u2019d taken my girl. Technically, he\u2019d thought I was his cousin but we\u2019d always been as close as brothers.</p> <p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d gotten our closure on this, Sawyer. You gave me your blessing. You gave Ash your blessing and you walked away. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>What was wrong? Everything was wrong. He got my girl. He got the college I wanted to attend. He got every fucking damn thing I wanted in life.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I muttered and turned around and headed for my truck again.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, I will literally force you into my truck if I have to,\u201d Beau didn\u2019t sound angry, just sincere.</p><p>Tonight, I wasn\u2019t up to handling a one-on-one with him. I was more than positive I\u2019d lose and possibly have a few bruises to show for it.</p><p>\u201cFine. Drive me home.\u201d</p><p>After Beau dropped me off, I\u2019d taken a long hot shower and then crawled into bed. Luckily, neither of my parents got up to check on me. Once I pulled the sheets up over my waist, I stared at the ceiling and replayed the fit Ashton had pitched tonight in my head. She\u2019d been angry. Why? Because I\u2019d been making out with Lana in public? All we\u2019d done was kiss. Granted, it was one really hot kiss and that girl\u2019s skin was incredible to touch. Her hair smelled like some sort of soft flower and before we\u2019d been interrupted by Jake\u2019s stupid demand that we get a room, I\u2019d been thinking about how I wanted to taste the skin in the curve of her neck. Her pulse had been racing under my lips and it had been intoxicating. Like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before.</p><p>Ashton had put a quick stop to things though. She\u2019d been spitting mad. Almost a little too mad. Was she... jealous? Could she be? I hadn\u2019t really dated anyone since our breakup. She\u2019d never seen me with any girls and certainly not making out like that. But... jealous... maybe. A small smile tugged at the corner of my mouth and I reached for my cell phone.</p> <p>Me: Please tell Lana I\u2019m sorry I got drunk and was a jerk.</p><p>I pressed send and waited to see what Ashton\u2019s reply was. Almost immediately, it dinged. Grinning, I sat up and read-</p><p>Ashton: Yes you were. I\u2019ll tell her. Just stay away from her Sawyer.</p><p>She was jealous. She didn\u2019t like me being interested in someone else. Ashton wanted both Vincent brothers enthralled with her. Well, this could turn out to be fun as hell.</p><p>Me: Can\u2019t do that Ash. I really like her.</p><p>I almost thought she wasn\u2019t going to reply when the phone lit up and I read her text,</p><p>Ashton: I don\u2019t want her hurt.</p><p>I laughed to myself; I knew better. She didn\u2019t want to share my affection. Stingy little brat.</p><p>Me: I wouldn\u2019t hurt her. I want to spend some time with her. Can I have her number?</p><p>Ashton: Not tonight</p><p>I lay back in bed grinning, thinking that Ash had just made this game too fun to walk away.</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cLana?\u201d Ashton\u2019s voice broke into my internal battle of staying here or just giving up and going back home.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied, wishing I could successfully fake sleep.</p><p>Ashton opened the door to the guest bedroom where my aunt had insisted I sleep instead of the extra mattress on the floor of Ashton\u2019s room where I normally slept. I sat up and watched as she walked over to me wringing her hands. That one small nervous mannerism of hers told me that this was about Sawyer. Not something I wanted to talk about. At least not tonight.</p><p>\u201cUm... do you, uh, do you like Sawyer?\u201d</p><p>How blind could one person be? Ashton had always been clueless to the world around her. She had her little small bubble and she worried about what affected her and nothing more. Now, I was invading her bubble and she was noticing things that she should have picked up years ago.</p><p>\u201cYes, a little.\u201d</p><p>Her bare perfectly tanned shoulders lifted with a sigh and she nodded. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>She sat down cautiously on the edge of the bed. I studied her face and wondered if the concern was for me or herself or possibly Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cSawyer wasn\u2019t himself tonight. You know that,\u201d she lifted her eyes to meet mine and I only saw sadness. No jealousy or anxiety. She was just sad.</p><p>\u201cI know. I didn\u2019t even realize he drank. I thought that was Beau\u2019s MO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe normally doesn\u2019t. Tonight was a side of Sawyer I\u2019d never seen before. He was very... Beau-like. Or at least the way Beau used to be.\u201d</p><p>Her words made everything click. The puzzle that Sawyer had created tonight all fell into place. He had acted like Beau back when Beau wanted Ashton and didn\u2019t have her. A small ache in my chest started and unfortunately, it was all too familiar. It was the same ache I felt when I\u2019d seen the tender, completely devoted look Sawyer would bestow on Ashton every time he glanced her way. Which had been often.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d I muttered, more to myself than to Ashton.</p><p>Instead of asking me what I meant, she only nodded and stared helplessly at the pale blue wall across from her. At least she got it and I wouldn\u2019t have to spell it out for her. Sawyer was coping with not having Ashton by drinking and acting out. It had been six months for crying out loud. How long did he need?</p><p>\u201cHe texted me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I assumed she was talking about Sawyer but with Ashton you never could be sure which Vincent boy she was talking about.</p><p>\u201cSawyer. He asked about you. Wanted me to tell you he was sorry.\u201d</p><p>My stupid heart sped up and I tried to keep my face composed. I reminded myself he\u2019d probably been more worried about Ashton\u2019s feelings than mine.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was the only response I could muster.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what his motives are Lana. I mean you are gorgeous and he is a guy. I can see that he could be interested in you--\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re also worried he\u2019s using me to get to you,\u201d I finished her thought for her.</p><p>Ashton pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and grimaced. Yep, it sounded bad when said out loud. But it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe Sawyer I know, the Sawyer I loved isn\u2019t calculating and cruel. But the Sawyer I knew also would have never gotten drunk at a party and made out with a girl in public. Heck, I\u2019m pretty sure you did more with Sawyer on that couch than I did with Sawyer during the three years we dated.\u201d Ashton let out a hard short laugh, \u201cI basically had to beg him to do more than a few chaste kisses. He was so controlled. Tonight, when I came downstairs and saw the two of you and well\u2014his hands...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>I knew exactly where his hands had been and remembering made my face heat up.</p><p>\u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, be careful. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to and I don\u2019t want to believe he is trying to get to me through you. I just don\u2019t think he would do that. Honestly, if you and Sawyer became an item I\u2019d be happy for both of you. He\u2019s a wonderful guy. He just wasn\u2019t \u2018my guy\u2019... ya know?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to her. I was surprised she was so okay with Sawyer moving on. Sure, Beau was a hottie but if Sawyer had been mine I\u2019d be devastated to see him move on.</p><p>\u201cHe wants your cell phone number. I didn\u2019t give it to him. I wasn\u2019t sure what you wanted me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to him,\u201d I replied quickly.</p><p>Ashton laughed and nodded before standing up. \u201cWell, okay then. Glad to know where you stand,\u201d the teasing in her voice was a relief. She really was okay with this.</p><p>\u201cThis summer... my coming here... it wasn\u2019t just about wanting to spend time with you before we go off to college.\u201d</p><p>Ashton grinned and raised her eyebrows. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re telling me a Vincent boy brought you to Grove, Alabama and not me.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I returned her smile, \u201cThey\u2019re hard to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d</p><p>I stood at the window and watched as Ashton jumped in Beau\u2019s arms and proceeded to kiss his face all over as if she hadn\u2019t just seen him last night. It was kind of gross. He was shirtless and covered in sweat. He reached up and turned his dirty University of Alabama baseball hat around backwards before grabbing Ashton\u2019s face and taking over her wandering lips. Shaking my head, I turned away from the major public display of affection those two were sharing with the entire street. She\u2019d been all-clean when she left and now she had Beau Vincent sweat all over her outfit. Not to mention the grass probably stuck to his body. She\u2019d better hope her daddy doesn\u2019t decide to come home for an early lunch. That would not go over well.</p><p>The short clip of Tell Him by Colbie Caillat alerted me that I had a text message. Running over to the dresser where I\u2019d left my phone, I grabbed it up and my heart fluttered even before I read it.</p><p>Sawyer: It\u2019s Sawyer. I\u2019m sorry about last night. Let me make it up to you. I\u2019m taking out the boat today. Come with me, please.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even give myself time to think it through. I quickly typed.</p><p>Me: Okay. When?</p><p>Playing hard to get might be the best way to handle this if Sawyer actually liked me. But I wasn\u2019t sure. If I was just a weapon to use against Ashton then I needed to change that. I needed to make him see me.</p><p>Sawyer: Can you be ready in an hour?</p><p>Me: Yes</p><p>Sawyer: Wear a Swimsuit. Preferably that bikini you had on last night.</p><p>I had to take a deep calming breath and I reread his request several times before typing\u2014</p><p>Me: K </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Lana opened the front door the moment I pulled into Ash\u2019s driveway. I needed to fix the mess I\u2019d made last night so instead of enjoying the view of her long creamy legs, showcased in those tiny little red shorts, I jumped out of the truck and walked around the front of the cab so I could open the door and help her get in.</p><p>A shy smile played on her full lips as I met her on the other side of my truck. Yep, I had hope. Even after the stunt I\u2019d pulled last night, she was affected by me. Guilt settled in my stomach when I stared into her trusting eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d her Georgia drawl wasn\u2019t bad either. I\u2019d never realized Lana had a sexy voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve forgiven me enough to come with me today.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged one of her dainty little shoulders. A few freckles graced the smooth skin she was exposing with the sleeveless top. I hadn\u2019t noticed those last night and the urge to kiss each one shocked me.</p><p>\u201cNot much to forgive. You acted like an ass but you were drunk. I should\u2019ve been paying closer attention.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t keep from laughing. Lana McDaniel had just called me an ass.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s awfully considerate of you,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cHmmm... maybe so.\u201d</p><p>I opened the truck door and reached out to take her hand as she stepped up into the cab. The shorts rode even further up her legs and, in my appreciative gaze, I noticed one lone freckle incredibly close to the curve of her heart-shaped bottom. My heart sped up and I forced myself to stop ogling her backside.</p><p>Unsure about whether or not my voice was going to betray me, I didn\u2019t say anything as I closed the door and went back around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>Once we headed toward the boat launch, I glanced over at Lana. \u201cYou still know how to wakeboard, don\u2019t you?\u201d I\u2019d spent hours teaching her how to board one summer when we were in middle school while Ash and Beau heckled her from the boat.</p><p>A small smile tugged on her lips and I wondered if she was remembering that day too. It had been us against Ash and Beau. For once, I\u2019d felt like I had a team. It was always me trying to rein in those two but that day, I\u2019d had a partner. Granted, I\u2019d wanted Ash as my partner. That was the summer before everything changed. The summer before I became quarterback and I got Ash.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think. Isn\u2019t it like a bicycle... ya know, once you learn you never forget?\u201d</p><p>The guys were going to enjoy this a little too much. If I hadn\u2019t needed a spotter and a back-up driver we would be doing this alone today. But skiing and boarding, with only two people, wasn\u2019t safe. Someone needed to be watching the rider and then if I wanted to wakeboard, and I did\u2014especially with Lana, then I needed another driver.</p><p>\u201cHmmm... maybe a little. It might take you a few tries if you\u2019re rusty,\u201d I finally replied.</p><p>Lana let out a small groan and I bit back a laugh. She\u2019d had the hardest time learning to get up on skis and then the wakeboard had almost done her in. I always admired her determination though. She hadn\u2019t given up.</p><p>\u201cIf we are skiing and wakeboarding, others will be there right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, noticing the small disappointment in her voice. She wanted me alone. I liked that\u2014a lot.</p><p>\u201cWill Ethan be there?\u201d</p><p>My small moment of pleasure evaporated.</p> <p>\u201cEthan? Uh, probably.\u201d Well shit. I had forgotten about their little bonding episode at Wings. Ethan hadn\u2019t been at the party last night. He didn\u2019t know about our little public display of affection. No, wait... he probably did. That was gossip worthy. Someone was bound to have told him by now.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. I\u2019ll at least have one other friend there.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no. I\u2019d have to pull Ethan aside without her noticing and make sure he understood Lana was hands off.</p><p>Again, the guilt started tugging at me and I pushed it away. Sure, Ethan might be more sincere about his interest in Lana but she was only here for the summer. Then we were all headed off to college. If anyone was going to have a summer fling with her, it was going to be me. End of story. No reason for guilt. This was a means to an end. Besides, I took a quick peek over at Lana, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t enjoy her company. She was gorgeous, smart and funny. Plus, my being with her was going to drive Ashton mad. Maybe even send her running right back to my arms.... there was that damn guilt again. I needed a beer. That always helped wash away my conscience.</p><p>Lana</p><p>My cell phone rang and I quickly pulled it out of my pocket. It was Ashton. I\u2019d texted her that I was going boating with Sawyer today. She must have thought that warranted a phone call instead of a text reply.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, trying hard not to look at Sawyer. He was driving but I could feel his eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cAre you two going alone? Because if you are, that isn\u2019t safe. Beau and I can come too.\u201d</p><p>No way did I want Ashton anywhere near Sawyer today. I needed to get his attention and when Ashton was around, he was single minded. \u201cNo, we\u2019re going skiing. Others are coming too. It\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s Ash tell her that she and Beau are welcome to join us,\u201d Sawyer piped up. Dangit.</p><p>\u201cTell him thanks but if y\u2019all have other people going it\u2019ll probably be more fun without Beau and Sawyer and me all together...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight Beau and I are going to go to the beach to eat some crab claws then go hear Little Big Town play at the Wharf. Ethan also has two tickets and was wondering if you\u2019d like to come, ya know... with him.\u201d</p><p>Ethan? I turned my head so I could peek at Sawyer. He was watching the road but I could tell his attention was completely focused on my conversation with Ashton. Annoyed with the reasons behind his interest, I decided two could play this game.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019d love to go tonight. I\u2019m about to see Ethan so I\u2019ll tell him myself.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s head whipped around to stare at me and I flashed him an innocent smile and said my goodbyes to Ashton before hanging up.</p><p>\u201cAshton and Beau have other plans for the day. She said to tell you thanks though.\u201d If he wanted to know about Ethan he was going to have to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want you to tell Ethan?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond almost automatically but snapped it shut quickly. That wasn\u2019t his business. Just because he asked me didn\u2019t mean I had to tell him. The old Lana would have blurted out whatever he wanted to know. This Lana didn\u2019t do that. This Lana wasn\u2019t a love struck puppy... okay, maybe I was but he didn\u2019t have to know that.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d have wanted you to know the details of my conversation, I\u2019d have put Ashton on speaker phone,\u201d I finally replied.</p><p>\u201cOuch. I was just asking.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019d gone a little overboard with my snarkiness. I did want Sawyer to like me and he had invited me to go out skiing with him.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It was nothing of your concern. I didn\u2019t mean to sound so snappy.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer didn\u2019t respond and silence engulfed the truck.</p><p>Once Sawyer pulled into the parking lot at the boat launch, I\u2019d had enough time to decide how to handle his silence. Spending the day on a boat with an annoyed Sawyer didn\u2019t sound like fun.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry I was so rude. It was nothing, really.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer turned the engine off and turned to meet my gaze. He studied me a moment then finally nodded. \u201cOkay. I shouldn\u2019t have stuck my nose in your business. I just thought we were friends. I didn\u2019t really think about it when I asked.\u201d</p><p>Great. Now, I felt as low as the dirt on the bottom of my shoes.</p><p>\u201cWe are friends. I don\u2019t know why I snapped at you like that. I guess I was embarrassed about the topic.\u201d Which was partially true.</p><p>A frown puckered his brow, which was ridiculously hot. \u201cWhy would Ash ask you to tell Ethan something embarrassing?\u201d</p><p>Perfect. I\u2019d backed myself into a wall. I couldn\u2019t exactly shut him out again. I didn\u2019t like having him go all surly and quiet on me. The best course of action would be to lie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been on a date before. Ethan asked me to go with him to a concert tonight. Or he asked Ashton to ask me if I\u2019d go with him.\u201d OR I could just blurt out the whole truth and look like an idiot. Dangit! I needed to work on my lying skills. I had none. I\u2019d opened my mouth to lie and out came the truth instead. I forced myself not to grimace and reached for the door handle. The complete surprise in Sawyer\u2019s eyes was humiliating. I was eighteen years old and I had never been on a date. It was sad. And now Sawyer knew just how pathetic I was.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed my arm to stop me before I jumped down out of the truck.</p><p>Sighing, I turned back around to look into his sympathetic eyes but found that they weren\u2019t exactly full of sympathy or astonishment. Instead, he looked... frustrated. Well, that\u2019s interesting.</p><p>\u201cDo you like Ethan?\u201d</p><p>Yes, I liked Ethan. He was nice, thoughtful, funny, sweet, and he was attracted to me. There was no ex-girlfriend he was hung up on standing in my way. But he wasn\u2019t Sawyer.</p><p>Nodding, I didn\u2019t say anymore. Instead, I waited.</p><p>Sawyer opened his mouth to say something then shut it and closed his eyes tightly before shaking his head and letting go of my arm. \u201cNever mind. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He opened his door and stepped out. I\u2019d give anything to get him to say what it was he stopped himself from saying just now. But the conversation was over. His curiosity had been cured and I had an entire day to dwell on the fact that I may have just killed any chance I had with him. Ethan was his friend and after the mess with Beau, I doubted Sawyer would ever make a move on a girl that had dated his friend first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>If Ethan whispered in her ear one more time, I was going to throw his ass off the damn boat. The only reason he\u2019d managed to stay on it this long was because Lana didn\u2019t look all that happy about his attempt at flirting. She wasn\u2019t laughing and smiling at him like she had been at the restaurant. Instead, she appeared a little uptight about something. Had she decided in the light of day that Ethan wasn\u2019t all that interesting? God, I hoped so. I didn\u2019t want her for the right reasons and that was making it very hard to be selfish and calculating. Lana was so freaking sweet and in no way did I want to hurt her. If Ethan made her happy, I wasn\u2019t sure I could stand in the way just to get Ash all worked up.</p><p>\u201cShould I warn E to step back?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice broke into my thoughts and I jerked my gaze off Lana and Ethan and focused on driving the boat.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d I asked in a bored voice.</p><p>Jake let out a snort, \u201cFrom the murderous glare you\u2019re shooting his way.\u201d</p><p>Since when did Jake decide to start paying attention to the world around him? Shaking my head, I turned back and checked on Kayla and Toby. They\u2019d been out there trying to out-do each other for over twenty minutes. If I didn\u2019t make a sharp unexpected turn they\u2019d both stay up for another twenty minutes. I needed a distraction.</p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019m about to sling them,\u201d I called out loudly. My eyes immediately found Lana and she had a tight grip on the side of the boat watching Kayla and Toby with a worried frown.</p><p>Jerking the wheel hard to the left sent Kayla and Toby flying through the air. I could hear her squeal and Toby yell out something very close to \u201cMotherfu\u2014\u201d before they hit the water with a loud slap.</p> <p>\u201cOHMYGOD! Are they okay?\u201d Lana asked, gaping back at me with a horrified expression. They were fine. I knew the correct way and place to sling someone off their wakeboard. We\u2019d all been doing this since we were kids. Those two knew how to safely land after a good slinging.</p><p>I pointed out at the water where Kayla and Toby had landed. Lana spun back around in her seat to see they had both resurfaced and were fine. Kayla was holding her board and Toby was kissing her as she giggled loudly.</p><p>I saw Lana\u2019s shoulders relax.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way Saw likes to tell someone their time is up,\u201d Ethan said, smiling at her with a ridiculous googly-eyed expression on his face. I would be doing the boy a favor taking her away from him. He was making an ass of himself.</p><p>Lana turned to look back at me with those big green eyes. I had to swallow hard because her eyes were so much like Ashton\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want a turn.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I nudged Jake, \u201cTake it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to drive you. I\u2019m going to go out there with you,\u201d I informed her.</p><p>Lana shifted her fearful gaze from me to Jake who was now at the wheel. She didn\u2019t trust him any more than she did me.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know. Maybe... maybe Ethan could drive,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>The frustrated frown he was wearing because I was the one about to go out with Lana was replaced with a pleased grin. She trusted him and he liked it\u2014of course, he did.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jake said, grabbing his drink and plopping back down on the bench where he\u2019d been sprawled out before I\u2019d given him the wheel.</p><p>Ethan went over, took the wheel, and cut the engine so that Toby and Kayla could climb back on.</p><p>I reached over and grabbed the wakeboard Toby was handing me. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just motioned for us to let go,\u201d Toby grumbled as he reached for Kayla and helped her crawl up on the dive board.</p><p>\u201cBut that was so much more fun to watch,\u201d I replied, taking Kayla\u2019s life vest and handing it to Lana. \u201cThis one is the only one that\u2019ll fit you. The rest are all too big.\u201d</p> <p>Lana took it and shivered as the cold water dripped off the jacket and onto her warm skin.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s not true. He has a much better one tucked away under the seats but it\u2019s Ash\u2019s. He gave it to her for her birthday one year along with the better wakeboard, at least for girls. But he won\u2019t let anyone else use it, even though\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, babe,\u201d Toby interrupted as he gently pushed Kayla toward the back of the boat.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bring myself to look back at Lana. I\u2019d really rather she didn\u2019t know about Ash\u2019s stuff. I did still have it tucked away under the bench seat. I wasn\u2019t ready to let someone else use it. Seeing someone else put it on would be another door closed. This had been something Ash and I did together. She\u2019d been so excited when I got her the new board. We\u2019d even laid out on the water and floated on it that night while she rained kisses over my face and told me how wonderful I was. Back when she\u2019d still been mine.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your vest,\u201d Jake called out as he threw my nice dry life vest at me. Catching it as it slammed into my chest, I quickly put it on and threw my board out into the water.</p><p>\u201cDo I just jump in?\u201d Lana asked from the dive board, staring down at me with a worried frown.</p><p>I swam over to her, \u201cSit down,\u201d I said. She did so quickly, not taking her eyes off me. I reached for her waist and eased her into the water.</p><p>\u201cEeeep, it\u2019s cold,\u201d she squealed and her hands squeezed my arms tightly. Her full bottom lip quivered a little and I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I\u2019d made her wear a cold wet life vest because I was too much of a baby to pull out Ashton\u2019s. The least I could do was warm her lips up.</p><p>She tensed the moment my mouth touched hers but only briefly. Both her hands slid slowly up my arms and into my hair as I held her waist pulling her closer to me. Pressing small innocent kisses on the corner of her mouth only wetted my appetite. I took a small taste of her bottom lip, her mouth opened in a small gasp, I plunged ahead. I needed to feel the soft pressure of her lips against mine. I tangled my tongue with hers as she pressed against me fisting her hands in my wet locks. Yeah, this was good. This was real good. Sliding my hand down her hip I pulled a leg up to wrap around my waist. A soft little moan escaped her as the vee between her legs was opened to me and pressed against the proof that I was enjoying this just a little too much. Ah, hell this was better than good.</p><p>\u201cCould you stop mauling her in public?\u201d Jake\u2019s annoyed tone reminded me that we had a boat full of people behind us getting an up-close view. I pulled back and the small, frustrated groan from Lana had me thinking I didn\u2019t really give a damn who saw us. But her eyes focused and she glanced over my shoulder to see our curious audience.</p><p>Her cheeks turned bright pink as she ducked her head. Curled tendrils of her hair had gotten loose from the sloppy bun she\u2019d put her hair in once we\u2019d gotten on the boat. She swallowed nervously, her throat muscles move behind the smooth pale skin of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI wanna kiss that spot... right there,\u201d I murmured as I ran the pad of my thumb over the place where her pulse beat heavily. It was as sexy as it was delicate.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she replied breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna board or not?\u201d Toby called from behind us. I scowled at the nosy bunch of people I\u2019d brought with us.</p><p>His question didn\u2019t warrant a reply. I reached for the board he\u2019d thrown overboard and moved it beside Lana, \u201cYou remember how this works?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath Lana nodded and unwrapped her legs from my waist eliciting a groan from me. I\u2019d been enjoying the forbidden warmth.</p><p>The flicker of surprise in her eyes made it very hard for me not to pull her back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d she replied.</p><p>I turned to grab my board and lifted my eyes to see Ethan glaring at me. I gave him an apologetic shrug and headed out to make sure Lana was strapped onto the board correctly before Ethan started up the boat.</p><p>\u201cHe looks angry,\u201d Lana said, studying Ethan as I swam over to check her position.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll sling us?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Ethan was pissed but he wasn\u2019t stupid. Lana had trusted him. He wouldn\u2019t screw that up. Also, beat the shit out of him if he scared her. I was pretty sure he knew that too.</p><p>\u201cIs the fit tight? You feel locked in?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and gave me a nervous smile.</p><p>Lana</p><p>What the heck had just happened? My body was still tingling and I couldn\u2019t even think about the strange sensations going on in my um... private area. Dear God, I\u2019d been about to hump Sawyer right there in the water in front of everyone.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Sawyer asked from beside me. I nodded and hoped I was. It had been awhile but I knew how it felt when I was pulling back on the rope just the right amount.</p><p>The motor on the boat roared to life and Ethan gunned it, which I\u2019d also been expecting. When Kayla and Toby had gone first I had been sure to pay attention to everything they did. Kayla jumping the wake and flying up in the air wasn\u2019t something I was going to give a go but I still watched carefully.</p><p>Once I was safely up and not about to pitch forward into the water I chanced a peek at Sawyer. He was grinning at me with approval and my chest tightened. He was so beautiful. He closed the space between us and I focused on not losing my balance reminding myself he knew what he was doing. I just needed to focus on not moving to the left or right.</p><p>\u201cYou got this,\u201d Sawyer smiled at me and then he was gone. I watched as he swung out, jumping the wake and flying even higher in the air than Kayla had done before coming back down and grinning like a little boy as the group on the boat whooped and hollered. I didn\u2019t even swing out to the right. I had no doubt I\u2019d wipe out if I gave it a go. I took quick peeks over at Sawyer as he continued to do tricks on his side of the boat.</p><p>My arms were burning and holding on was becoming increasingly harder. Biting down on my bottom lip, I tried to deal with the pain.</p><p>\u201cYour arms burning?\u201d Sawyer called out to me as he pulled in beside me.</p><p>I nodded, hating to end his fun.</p><p>\u201cLet go of the rope on three,\u201d he replied and began counting.</p><p>We both let go of our ropes when he said three and sank down slowly into the water.</p><p>\u201cTake your board off,\u201d Sawyer called out as he stayed in position. He was going to go again without me. I didn\u2019t feel as bad now for needing to stop.</p><p>The boat got back to us about the time I had the board unstrapped from my feet.</p><p>\u201cGive Toby the board, then come here,\u201d Sawyer instructed and I did as I was told. Maybe he needed help with something.</p><p>\u201cYou going again?\u201d Jake yelled from his spot on the boat.</p><p>Sawyer nodded \u201cYep, her arms were burning.\u201d</p><p>Toby got the board from my hands and once he had it safely on the boat, I swam over to Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cSit in my lap and straddle me. Wrap your legs around my waist and hold on real tight,\u201d Sawyer said with a wicked grin in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d I stuttered confused.</p><p>He let go of the rope with one hand and motioned me to come closer, \u201cCome on, Lana. Wrap those long legs around my waist. I won\u2019t let you get hurt. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>A squeal and clapping distracted me and I turned to look back at the boat. Kayla was extremely pleased.</p><p>\u201cDo it Lana! I\u2019ve seen Sawyer do this with Ash many times.\u201d Kayla called out.</p><p>I turned back to Sawyer, \u201cBut Ash can do tricks. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is hold on tight to me. Wrap your legs and arms around me and I got the rest of this.\u201d</p><p>Excitement and fear battled each other as I gave in and slipped my legs around his waist and wrapped my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cHmmm... that\u2019s nice,\u201d Sawyer whispered into the curve of my neck. My heart began racing for a completely different reason when the boat fired up. I tightened my hold on him and buried my face in his shoulder. A warm sexy chuckle vibrated within his chest.</p><p>We were up and going before I could think about anything else. My legs clamped down on his waist so tightly the hard arousal I\u2019d felt earlier was now firmly pressed against me.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d he whispered in my ear and I shifted wondering if I weighed too much or was holding on too tight.</p><p>\u201cPlease Lana, don\u2019t move. I can\u2019t concentrate when you do that.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath and pulled back to peer up at him.</p><p>The smoldering gleam in his eyes sent my body into a warm frenzy.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d I managed to croak out.</p><p>Sawyer shook his head and pressed a kiss to my forehead, \u201cNot the way you think. Hang on, I\u2019m going to give you a little bit of a ride.\u201d</p><p>I pressed back up against him and forced myself to keep my eyes open as he swung out to the left. The moment we went air-born I gasped in delight. It was so freeing. Then we were back on the water with such ease it wasn\u2019t frightening at all.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asked with his mouth close to my ear so he didn\u2019t have to yell.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cGood, cause we\u2019re going higher this time,\u201d he replied and we were flying out to the right and in the air so quickly my stomach fluttered wildly.</p><p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d I breathed as he landed the board.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Then we were slowing down and sinking into the water.</p><p>\u201cThank you for trusting me,\u201d he said, as we settled down in the water to wait on the boat to come back and get us.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the ride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>As soon as Lana closed the door to Ashton\u2019s house, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed Beau.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered on the third ring.</p> <p>\u201cI need a ticket to that concert tonight. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Beau didn\u2019t respond right away then he let out a sigh, \u201cLittle Miss Lana is gettin\u2019 to ya, huh?\u201d</p><p>The memory of how she felt wrapped around my waist flooded me and I swallowed hard, \u201cYeah, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh hooked her up with E tonight. You know this, right?\u201d</p><p>My blood boiled. Yes, I knew it but I was going to stop it. Ethan only wanted Lana for the summer. He was headed to UT in the fall and Lana was headed... well I didn\u2019t know where Lana was headed but she was going off to college too. Yes, I wanted to make Ash jealous but the idea of spending time with Lana was growing more and more appealing for no other reason than she made me forget. When I was with her, I wasn\u2019t thinking about Ashton.</p> <p>\u201cShe was with me today. You owe me Beau. A helluva lot. I need to be there tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh is gonna be pissed. She doesn\u2019t trust your motives and I\u2019m not real sure I do either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Lana. What\u2019s there not to like? Why would I want her for any other reason than she\u2019s hot-as-hell and available this summer? I need the distraction. I think it\u2019ll be good for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Beau was silent for a moment, \u201cThe concert is sold out but Ash got Leann two tickets and she\u2019s driving over from the beach to go with us. Her date just bailed on her and she\u2019s looking for someone to take with her. She might not want to give you the ticket as her date but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d sell it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still got her number. I\u2019ll call her. Thanks,\u201d I didn\u2019t wait for him to reply before I hung up and scrolled through my contacts for Leann\u2019s name.</p><p>Ashton had initially had us all driving separate vehicles since Beau and I drove trucks and Ethan drove a Jeep. I didn\u2019t like that plan because it put me alone with Leann and Lana alone with Ethan. Not the combination I was going for. So, I borrowed Mom\u2019s Mercedes Crossover. No one could argue that this wasn\u2019t a better idea. Except maybe Ethan who hadn\u2019t been in on the details. I\u2019d handled it with Beau who in return got Ashton to agree.</p> <p>I\u2019d started to ask Beau to take the backseat so Lana and Ethan would be closer to me but the idea of Beau tucked in the back away from everyone with Ashton made my chest ache. I didn\u2019t think I could handle it. So, I remained quiet as Ethan quickly took the back row holding Lana\u2019s hand as she stepped into the car. The ache from thinking about Ash and Beau was instantly extinguished by red-hot jealousy. Ethan\u2019s eyes were taking in Lana\u2019s cute little bottom, she\u2019d barely covered up in that sundress.</p><p>\u201cI think you just growled,\u201d Leann whispered as she stepped past me and opened the passenger door. Jerking my gaze off Ethan as he moved in beside Lana, I went to get in. This was going to be one long ass thirty-minute drive.</p><p>\u201cStill scowling,\u201d Leann teased from beside me. I shot her a glare that only caused her to giggle.</p><p>\u201cI really thought you\u2019d never get over Ash. I\u2019m surprised,\u201d she said under her breath then pulled down the mirror in front of her to peek back at Lana and Ethan.</p><p>\u201cIf it helps, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that into him,\u201d she said, and then flipped the visor back up.</p><p>\u201cFind whatever you want to listen to,\u201d was my only response to her nosy comments.</p><p>Leann clicked her tongue grinning before leaning forward and scanning the channels.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Ethan is a good guy. He doesn\u2019t have any ulterior motives.\u201d</p> <p>Grinding my teeth, I shook my head and shot her a warning glance.</p><p>\u201cYou used to be such a polite, nice guy Sawyer Vincent. You\u2019ve changed\u2014a lot.\u201d</p><p>I adjusted the rearview mirror so that Lana was directly in my sight. She was watching me. The angry frustration melted away when she gave me a shy smile. Winking, I glanced back at the road and decided the car would be the only place Ethan got her away from me. He sure as hell better enjoy himself.</p><p>\u201cIs that Ash or Lana you\u2019re checking up on?\u201d Leann asked from beside me.</p><p>I realized I\u2019d forgot about Ashton. My stomach knotted up. What was happening? Ash was right behind me sitting beside Beau. I reached up and adjusted the mirror just in time to see Ash laugh and lay her head over on Beau\u2019s shoulder. The familiar ache returned. Her eyes lifted and met mine. The laughter that had been sparkling in them vanished and a concerned sadness came over her face. I missed those eyes laughing up at me. Gripping the steering wheel harder I focused my attention on the road instead of the girl I\u2019d always love behind me or her cousin who sent me into a lust fog every time she got close.</p><p>\u201cYou might wanna adjust that mirror,\u201d Beau\u2019s low warning came from behind me. If I could only hate him. Because, I wanted to. So badly.</p><p>Reaching up, I fixed the mirror so that I couldn\u2019t see either girl and turned up the song Leann had chosen, Break Your Little Heart by All Time Low. It was fitting.</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came with me tonight,\u201d Ethan said, leaning into me a little.</p><p>I tore my eyes off the back of Sawyer\u2019s head. \u201cThank you for asking me,\u201d I replied, hoping the disappointment in my voice wasn\u2019t obvious. When Ashton told me that Sawyer had bought Leann\u2019s extra ticket and arranged for us all to ride together, I\u2019d hoped it had been because of me, not her. Then he\u2019d gotten in the car and fixed his rearview mirror so he could see me and my heart had done a silly little flip. But within seconds he\u2019d adjusted it so he could see Ashton instead. He hadn\u2019t been looking at me when he winked... he\u2019d been looking at Ashton. Beau had noticed too.</p><p>Ethan glanced back up at Sawyer and sighed, \u201cNot sure why he\u2019s doing this. Sorry but it looks like we\u2019re going to have to witness more of the Vincent boys\u2019 drama tonight. Sawyer isn\u2019t ever going to be able to let Ashton go, even though she\u2019s obviously let him go.\u201d</p><p>The nausea that followed his words wasn\u2019t surprising. I\u2019d been thinking the same thing but hearing it from someone else was hard. I was so sure Sawyer had seen me today. I could feel his attraction to me. But then what did I know about guys and sex? I knew nothing. If any guy had his crotch pressed between a girl\u2019s legs he\u2019d probably get hard. From what I\u2019d heard about guys, they couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Sighing, I slunk back in my seat and crossed my legs. My hopes that tonight was about me were now gone. Ethan deserved more than me being hung up on getting Sawyer\u2019s attention. After all, Ethan, not Sawyer, was the one paying for my meal and my ticket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to a concert before,\u201d I told him wanting to change the subject.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cReally? So, I\u2019m your first,\u201d he said wagging his eyebrows teasingly. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cI guess you are,\u201d I replied in a flirty tone I\u2019d practiced at home alone in my room but never on an actual guy.</p><p>His eyes widened for a second then he closed the small distance between us and slid his hand over my thigh to take my hand in his. And I let him. Because really, why shouldn\u2019t I?</p><p>Once we arrived at the beachside restaurant, I\u2019d had time to get over my disappointment enough to enjoy myself, somewhat. If I had to watch Sawyer moon over Ashton all night I might end up in the bathroom with the need to hurl again. Right now, however, I was good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love this place. They have the best fried oyster po\u2019boys,\u201d Ethan informed me as we made our way toward the steps that led up to the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cOr you could eat them raw,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s voice was so close to my ear it startled me. Jerking my attention off our destination, I turned to look at Sawyer who had fallen into step beside me. He shot me a sexy little grin, \u201cI\u2019ll share my dozen with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDozen?\u201d I asked, still dazzled by the tantalizing smell of his cologne and brush of his fingers as he lightly grazed mine.</p><p>\u201cRaw oysters,\u201d he replied in a lazy drawl.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve never eaten one before. Not sure I want to,\u201d my voice sounded all breathless and affected by him. I was just weak where Sawyer was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you exactly how to do it so it goes down nice and smooth,\u201d his voice had dropped and gone husky. I wanted to fan myself because suddenly it was very, very hot out here. The sea breeze did nothing to cool me off.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all I could manage as a reply.</p><p>\u201cIf she wants oysters, I\u2019ll get them for her,\u201d Ethan replied in an annoyed tone, reminding me that he was on the other side of me.</p><p>\u201cI was just offering to share, E. No need to get testy,\u201d Sawyer replied, not taking his eyes off me. His fingers softly tangled with mine then traced a caress up the inside of my arm. I had to clench my teeth to keep from making an embarrassing sound caused by the delicious feel of his touch.</p><p>Ethan opened the door and pulled me over closer to him then placed his hand on my lower back to direct me inside the restaurant before him. He was putting himself between me and Sawyer. Which only made me feel guilty. I\u2019d all but melted into a puddle at Sawyer\u2019s feet while on a date with Ethan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go to the little girl\u2019s room. Come with me Lana,\u201d Leann said as she grabbed my arm and led me back to the restroom and away from the rest of the group.</p><p>The moment the door closed behind me, Leann spun around, \u201cWhoa, girl. Do you need me to splash some cold water on your face? After witnessing that I think I may need to cool off.\u201d</p><p>Letting out a moan, I covered my face with my hands. Great, everyone had noticed. Why did Sawyer do this to me? I was at his beck and call. It was ridiculous. He wanted to make Ashton jealous with me and I was falling right into his arms. UGH!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I finally said through my hands.</p><p>Leann chuckled, \u201cSorry for what? You haven\u2019t done anything. Sawyer Vincent is hot, Lana. He has never, and I mean never, unleashed what I just witnessed on anyone ever. Not even Ashton. I can\u2019t believe I just saw him like that. I mean the boy was always so polite and respectful. He was never sexy. I mean like sex\u2014y. I didn\u2019t know he had it in him. But damn, I swear I need to throw some ice down my shirt. I\u2019ve always thought he was beautiful but he couldn\u2019t compete with Beau in sex appeal because he was so... good. But wow-oh-wow, was he dripping with it just now. I\u2019d have jumped in his arms if he\u2019d done that to me and I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my hands and let Leann\u2019s words sink in.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. Did you ever see him touch or look at Ashton in a way that insinuated he wanted to get her alone? Nope, you didn\u2019t. Because it never happened. He acted like she was a nun and he was the priest. But with you just now,\u201d Leann waved her hand toward me and grinned wickedly, \u201che was HOT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes, really! Question is... what\u2019re you doing with Ethan? Because he\u2019s a good guy. I don\u2019t want to see him hurt and he seems to really like you.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I walked over to the sink. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean I don\u2019t like him that way or anything. He\u2019s just a nice guy and he seems interested in me and I thought\u2014\u201d I trailed off. Ethan was her friend and I wasn\u2019t sure being honest about why I\u2019d said okay to a date with Ethan was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cYou thought Sawyer would get jealous. I already figured that out. We\u2019re females, Lana. It happens when a god, like Sawyer Vincent, unleashes his power on us. Just let Ethan down easy. Don\u2019t hurt him, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and lifted my gaze to stare at my reflection in the mirror. Who was that girl looking back at me? Did I even know her anymore? Not only did she look different, she was acting completely different.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt him. I\u2019ll make sure he understands and I won\u2019t ignore him for Sawyer tonight either.\u201d</p><p>Leann nodded, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind me and Ashton walked in, worrying her bottom lip between her teeth as she looked between Leann and me.</p><p>\u201cI had to run some interference but I think everything is smoothed out now,\u201d Leann informed her as she walked tentatively into the restroom.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay,\u201d she studied me a moment, \u201care you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer is different with her Ash,\u201d Leann said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more than he even realizes.\u201d</p><p>Ashton looked at Leann and a small smile touched her lips, \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>Leann nodded, \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Ashton reached for my hand and squeezed it. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back out there before one of them says the wrong thing and all hell breaks loose.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Ethan demanded as soon as Ashton was out of hearing distance.</p><p>\u201cAsh going to the restroom,\u201d I drawled in a bored tone.</p> <p>Ethan started to stand up and snarled at me.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Beau barked and Ethan lowered himself back into his chair. \u201cYou know what he means, Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I like Lana. Hell, he was with us all day on the boat. She was with me. Me. She wants to be with me. You can see it all over her face. Not my fault he asked her out and she was too nice to turn him down.\u201d</p><p>Ethan let out a frustrated sigh. He knew I was right. \u201cYou\u2019re still hung up on A\u2014\u201d he trailed off when Beau turned his angry glare his way.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hung up on Ash. She\u2019s moved on and I\u2019m trying to do the same thing. But you\u2019re stepping in my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have to flirt with her on my date? Could you at least let me enjoy tonight with her?\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I picked up the Coke the waitress had placed in front of me. \u201cAnd let her think I don\u2019t care she\u2019s with you? No can do. She needs to know what I want.\u201d</p><p>Beau cleared his throat and stood up. \u201cHey baby,\u201d he pulled the chair out beside him for Ashton to sit in.</p><p>I turned my head to watch as Lana walked up to the table shifting her eyes from me to Ethan. I\u2019d strategically taken the spot at the end of the table when Ethan had sat down leaving the spot next to the end open for Lana.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that seat isn\u2019t for me,\u201d Leann said in an amused tone under her voice as she passed me to go sit on the other side of Ashton.</p><p>Lana pulled her chair out and sat down, putting herself equidistant from Ethan and me. Sliding my chair over, I closed the distance between us until my thigh was resting against hers.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said quietly as she peeked at me through the curtain of her hair separating us. I reached up and tucked the silky locks, blocking my view, behind her ear. \u201cThere, that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Her posture tensed.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna eat those oysters with me?\u201d I asked, leaning down to look at her menu, instead of opening mine.</p><p>\u201cOh, I uh,\u201d she stammered and Leann let out a loud sigh.</p><p>\u201cTone that down a little bit would ya? The girl is so rattled she can\u2019t even talk.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t take my eyes off Lana, \u201cAm I making you nervous?\u201d</p><p>Lana lifted her eyes to meet my gaze. A small apologetic smile touched her lips. The pale pink lip-gloss she was wearing made them appear even plumper than normal. I leaned in and caught a small whiff of the raspberry scent.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she replied softly.</p> <p>She was on a date with Ethan and I was making it very hard for her to be comfortable. The guilt that came with that knowledge stopped me from leaning in and taking a small nibble of those raspberry flavored lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll stop,\u201d I said softly enough that only she could hear me. Ashton\u2019s voice was in the background as she talked to the others in her attempt to draw the attention away from Lana and me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she replied and then turned her gaze back to the menu in front of her. Sliding my chair back to a proper distance, I refused to look back at her as I ordered my food and carried on a conversation with everyone. I did my best not to let my gaze linger on her or lower my voice, when I spoke directly to her. I even managed to eat a meal while I watched Beau kiss Ashton\u2019s hand, bare shoulder and temple whenever he had the chance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Sawyer I remember. I wondered where you\u2019d run off to,\u201d Leann whispered as she walked beside me to the stadium seating at the Wharf. Ash and Beau led the way and Ethan and Lana were behind us. I didn\u2019t turn around and check on them. I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle it if I caught them touching in any way.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked only because I needed a distraction.</p><p>\u201cHot and bothered Sawyer is a new one. I\u2019ve never seen you treat a girl like you could eat her up if given the chance. It was... interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Lana has me hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>Leann let out a cackle, \u201cI know Lana has you hot and bothered. If the girl was to crook her finger your way you\u2019d have her pressed up against the first hard surface you could find.\u201d</p><p>I slowed my pace and glanced down at Leann, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. You want that girl. Sweet, prim, and proper Lana went and got all sexy and she\u2019s getting under your skin. You never did that with Ash. Not once did I see you look at her like you wanted her. She was your trophy or possession and you were real proud of her but she didn\u2019t make your body simmer.\u201d</p><p>Clenching my jaw, I glared down at Leann, \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I loved Ashton like crazy. She was my world. I planned my future around her. She was never a trophy or possession. Just because I didn\u2019t treat her like a piece of hot ass didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t my reason for living. I respected her. I\u2019d never treat her with anything less than respect. I\u2019m not in danger of falling in love with someone like Lana. She\u2019s a distraction. Sure, I treat her differently; she is different but she\u2019s just for fun.\u201d</p><p>The wide-eyed expression on Leann\u2019s face as she glanced to her right and left alerted me to the fact that I\u2019d stopped walking and raised my voice. I turned my head to the right and saw Ashton and Beau both looking at me. Beau\u2019s expression was anything but pleased and Ash looked like she was about to cry. Well, hell.</p><p>Lana.</p><p>Turning my head to the left I saw Lana\u2019s big green eyes glistening with unshed tears as she stared at me. Ethan was glaring at me with a murderous expression.</p><p>\u201cLana,\u201d I started toward her and she shook her head at me and turned to run off. I took a step to chase after her when Ethan stepped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t let you do this to her. I thought maybe you were sincere and I was willing to step down and let you have her. But you\u2019re not. If you were you\u2019d never have been able to yell what you just did without a thought to her hearing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way, Ethan.\u201d I started to shove past him when a large hand clamped down on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou need to let him go to her. You\u2019ve done enough.\u201d Beau wouldn\u2019t let me go. I\u2019d have to fight him first and that would just get us both thrown in jail.</p><p>Sagging in defeat, I turned and stalked toward the car. Once the concert got going and Beau was distracted, I\u2019d find her. I\u2019d fix this. I had to. The hurt look in her eyes was more painful than I would have ever imagined.</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cLana, wait,\u201d Ethan\u2019s voice called out from behind me. As much as I didn\u2019t want him to see me crying over Sawyer, I couldn\u2019t exactly keep running away from him. He was my date. Slowing, I stopped and leaned back against the brick wall outside the restrooms.</p><p>Ethan stopped in front of me and the worried expression on his face made me feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cLana, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? You didn\u2019t do anything but make the mistake of asking me out on a date.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, touched the side of my face, and wiped away tears with his finger. \u201cNothing about asking you out was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>I let out a sad laugh, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he sighed and dropped his hand to grab one of mine. \u201cI realized today on the boat that you liked Sawyer. The rest of the female population in Grove has a thing for Sawyer, except for Ash, so that wasn\u2019t a big deal. I still wanted my chance. I didn\u2019t expect Sawyer to find a way to come too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been stupid enough to believe he had come because of me. It was sad, how deluded I\u2019d been. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d I whispered through the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re smart, beautiful, and funny.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him and wiped the rest of the tears from my face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I just need a little alone time. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll meet you back at our seats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>I washed my face with the cold water in the sink and dried it off with a paper towel. My makeup was gone and the freckles I worked so hard to cover up were standing out like a neon sign against my red face. I had makeup in my purse but I\u2019d left it in the car. Sawyer had more than likely locked it but then again these south Alabama people rarely locked their vehicles. I needed to walk and get my mind off things. I could at least check the car and give my red face time to return to its natural pale color.</p><p>I searched for row D and headed down until I saw the back-end of Sawyer\u2019s mother\u2019s Mercedes. Turning in between the cars, I didn\u2019t notice the car door open until Sawyer was right in front of me.</p><p>Lana,\u201d he said in a surprised tone.</p><p>Backing up, I started to turn so I could run back to the bathroom and cry a little more because he was just so perfect it hurt to look at him</p><p>\u201cLana, please, don\u2019t go. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLana,\u201d Sawyer grabbed my arm and firmly but gently turned me around and backed me up against the car door. \u201cI need you to listen to me,\u201d he pleaded and cupped my face in his hands, gently rubbing my cheeks with the pads of his thumbs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an asshole,\u201d he started and I fought the urge to nod my head in agreement. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of that the way it sounded. It wasn\u2019t even about you or how you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because it sure sounded like it,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>\u201cLeann was accusing me of never loving Ashton. She was saying that I thought of her as a possession or trophy. It set me off.\u201d He closed his eyes and let out a frustrated sigh.</p><p>\u201cWith you, things are different. I\u2019m not sure what it is but when I\u2019m with you, I feel something I\u2019ve never felt before. I do want you. Bad. It surprises me and scares the shit out of me. Maybe I\u2019m not good for you. Maybe what I feel is wrong. Because, I did love Ashton. She was all I needed... but never did I feel the uncontrollable desire to get her underneath me.\u201d His voice dropped, \u201cNever did I make up reasons to get her to wrap her legs around me so I could feel her pressed up against me. Never,\u201d he swallowed hard. \u201cNever, did I think about being inside her.\u201d</p><p>I forgot to breathe as I stared up at him. He looked torn between fear and longing. The sweet guy I\u2019d fallen in love with years ago was there but it was underneath the other guy he was slowly changing into.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good for you. I don\u2019t know why you make me want you so bad. I was angry with myself when I said all that earlier. I was mad because I wanted you in a way I\u2019d never experienced before. Before you, I just wanted to excel in football and school. I wanted my parents to be proud of me. But now, I want other things too. You get to me in a way I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>I stood up on my tiptoes and stopped his words with my lips but before he could pull me against him, I stepped back and broke the kiss. \u201cThank you for explaining it to me,\u201d I replied as his eyes searched my face for an answer to why I\u2019d kissed him and backed away so quickly.</p><p>\u201cI know you loved or love Ashton. I watched you grow up adoring her. It\u2019s just that... I\u2019m not sure I can handle you flirting with me one moment and the next sulking or having angry outbursts over Ashton and Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Sawyer said as he reached down and threaded his fingers through mine. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for any kind of relationship but I\u2019d like to enjoy this summer. Before you came into town, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was even going to hang around until August. Now you\u2019re here and I don\u2019t want to leave anymore. I\u2019d like to enjoy this last carefree summer with you.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d hoped for when I\u2019d decided to come here this summer but it was a lot more than I expected. Maybe Sawyer would find a way to move on soon. Besides, we needed time to get to know each other without Ashton between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that too.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Ashton\u2019s eyes went wide with surprise when she spotted Lana and me walking toward them together. She was standing in front of Beau with his arms wrapped protectively around her. I tore my attention from her and quit trying to read her facial expressions. That was something I needed to stop doing. Beau\u2019s head turned to see what Ashton was staring at and he raised his eyebrows then shook his head once before turning back to watch the stage where Little Big Town was singing Boondocks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with Ethan,\u201d Lana said beside me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But that didn\u2019t mean I liked it.</p><p>Her small hand grabbed mine and squeezed it before letting go quickly and walking toward Ethan who finally noticed she was back. His worried frown went from her to me and the angry glare directed my way wasn\u2019t lost on me. He didn\u2019t like she\u2019d come back with me. I couldn\u2019t blame him. I hated seeing Lana\u2019s face all red and splotchy from crying. I\u2019d walked with her to the bathroom after she retrieved her purse from the car. She\u2019d gone inside and covered up a good bit of those adorable freckles.</p><p>I didn\u2019t follow her. This was Ethan\u2019s date. His only one. Because he was my friend and I really needed a little distance from Lana after the conversation we\u2019d had by the car, I was going to spend the rest of the night talking to Leann and enjoying the music.</p><p>Leann studied me as I made my way over to stand beside her. Before she could open her mouth and ask twenty questions that were none of her business, I informed her, \u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth and gave me a dirty look before focusing her attention on whatever Ethan was saying to Lana. I didn\u2019t allow myself even to glance over at them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Lana</p><p>Music played somewhere in the distance as I spun in circles searching for it. Just before I twirled off a huge cliff and plunged to my death, my eyes snapped open. I stared at the ceiling. The music was much louder now. Colbi Caillat was letting me know I had a phone call. Groaning, I reached for my phone on the pillow beside me. I\u2019d gone to sleep hoping to get a text from Sawyer but it never came.</p><p>Why was my mother calling at seven-thirty in the morning?</p> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey honey, I\u2019m sorry to wake you but I wanted to call you before your stupid father did. You need to hear this from me and not him. He has absolutely not one drop of compassion for others. He just goes around hurting people and doing whatever his sorry ass wants to do. Selfish man. He hasn\u2019t called you, has he? Because if he has already called, I\u2019m going to jump on a plane and fly to New York City and kick his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, could you tell me what\u2019s going on please?\u201d I\u2019d pulled myself up to a sitting position while my mother had rambled on about my father. That was her favorite past-time. Coming up with names for my dad.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I got carried away,\u201d she sighed into the phone. \u201cYour dad is getting married Lana, to that new whore of his.\u201d</p><p>I was prepared for this, maybe not so soon, but I knew he had moved away to be near some woman he\u2019d met on a business trip. I was hoping to visit him one week this summer if he found time in his schedule. Sounded pathetic that I was hoping he could pencil in time for me but he was my dad. Up until last year, he\u2019d lived in my house. I\u2019d hated him at first but eventually I\u2019d wanted a relationship with my dad again.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I began, trying carefully to filter my words while talking to my mother. She went crazy if I ever defended him. I didn\u2019t like her reminding me that he\u2019d left me too, whenever I tried to take up for him. Because she was right. He had left me too, but he loved me. I knew he did. He\u2019d told me the day he signed the divorce papers that he\u2019d stayed with her until I was grown. He had been planning to leave her the moment I went off to college but things had happened and he\u2019d had to leave a little early. He\u2019d said that none of it was because of me. He loved me and was proud of me. I needed to believe that. I held onto that at night when I lay in bed and heard my mother crying and screaming as she threw things across her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWe knew he was serious when he moved out there to be with her. When is he planning on getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not expect your forty-seven year old father to marry his twenty- three year old slut! What will people think? He\u2019s ruining our reputation. People in this town will find out and they will talk. You won\u2019t be able to walk around town without people whispering behind your back. This is going to RUIN us, Lana. Just ruin us!\u201d</p><p>Twenty-three? I cringed. What was my dad doing engaged to a girl only five years older than me? That was just... gross. My mother continued to rant and call my dad names as I sat there staring at the wall in front of me. The message \u2018Home is where the heart is\u2019 was stenciled on a framed painting and hung on the pale blue wall mocking me. Home? What was home now? My mother\u2019s house where there was never any peace? My dad\u2019s apartment in Manhattan? It was about 500 square feet and he was about to move in his college age wife. Tears stung my eyes as the smell of coffee wafted down the hall. I could hear my aunt and uncle chatting happily in the kitchen and bacon frying on the stove. This was a home. One like I\u2019d never really known.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me Lana?\u201d</p><p>Shaking myself out of the pity party I was having, I cleared my throat. \u201cSorry Mom, what was that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wants to fly you to New York City to be in the wedding. Can you believe that? My baby in New York. I told him no way. You wouldn\u2019t want to be in his ridiculous wedding. But he insisted that he\u2019d talk to you first. Be ready for that call today. The little floozy wants you to be the maid-of-honor. You haven\u2019t even met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, mom. Thank you for letting me know. I need to go. I\u2019ll call you later. Ashton is waiting on me to go for a morning run.\u201d Mom bought my lie and I fell back against the pillow as I ended the call.</p><p>Could this get anymore screwed up? The house phone rang and I heard my aunt answer it. I didn\u2019t have to pick-up to know it was my mother telling my aunt everything she\u2019d just told me. If mom mentioned the lie I\u2019d told her about running with Ashton, I knew my aunt would cover for me. She understood. She always had. I snuggled down into the covers and closed my eyes. For now, I could pretend this was my home. That I had a safe happy place.</p><p>Walking into the kitchen several hours later the faint smell of bacon still filled the air. Ashton stood by the counter in her pajamas and mussed hair pouring herself a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I said, stopping beside the cabinet to get myself a coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s my early morning running buddy,\u201d the teasing tone to her voice made me smile.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, sorry about that. I needed an excuse to get off the phone.\u201d</p><p>Ashton laughed and handed me the pot of coffee. \u201cNo worries. Mom covered for you according to the note she left us.\u201d She pointed to the letter lying on the bar.</p> <p>I reached over and picked it up.</p><p>Good morning girls,</p><p>I hope you enjoyed your early morning run. I have to say that when Caroline called me this morning and mentioned that you two were out running I was a little surprised. I could have sworn I\u2019d passed both your doors and they were closed tightly. But do not worry, I didn\u2019t share that information with my sister. She believes you both enjoyed a nice long run before coming inside to eat some of the bacon and eggs I fried up.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Mom</p><p>I smiled to myself and laid the letter back down.</p><p>\u201cHow does your mom manage to be so cool and mine is a crazed psycho?\u201d I asked, taking a sip of my black coffee.</p><p>Ashton didn\u2019t even deny my mother\u2019s insane tendencies. She gave me a sad frown and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d your mom call so early this morning?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my shoulders and set my cup back down. I didn\u2019t really want to talk about this but I knew hashing it out with someone other than my mom would make my decision easier.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p>Ashton\u2019s eyes widened and she leaned forward on the counter resting on both elbows and studied me a moment. I knew she was trying to gauge my reaction to this news.</p><p>\u201cYou were expecting this, right?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. But not so soon and maybe not to a girl only five years older than me.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped, \u201cUncle Nolan is engaged to a twenty-three year old?\u201d</p><p>It sounded ludicrous when she said it aloud, too. My dad was not an attractive guy. Sure, I loved him but he was old and balding. Not to mention he had a potbelly. \u201cCrazy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, real crazy... are you okay? Is he going to call you?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I had ever been okay. Even when both my parents lived at home. They fought constantly. Most of my memories growing up had a scene in them where my mother was screaming at my dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. He\u2019s supposed to call today. His fianc\u00e9e... she wants me to be her maid-of-honor. I\u2019ve never even met her. I think I\u2019m going to ask him if I can just be his best man. I think I could rock a tux.\u201d</p><p>Ashton let out a long sigh then walked around the bar to stand beside me. She wrapped her arm around my waist and squeezed. \u201cWhen you want to talk, rant or even cry, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes teared up and I swallowed the lump in my throat. I didn\u2019t like people thinking I was weak. I\u2019d never been one to share my emotions. I kept things inside. Dealt with them on my own. But knowing someone was there and cared\u2014 it meant a lot. More than she would ever know. I rested my head against hers and we stared out at the backyard together in silence. There wasn\u2019t much more to say. Just having someone there beside me made things so much easier.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Beau: What days do you have to be in Florida for practices?</p><p>Me: Three days a week starting in July.</p><p>Beau: Bama is the same. We\u2019ve really only got June to take that camping trip.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m ready when you are.</p><p>Beau: You talked to Lana?</p><p>Me: Not today. Just got back from the field house working out.</p><p>Beau: Ash is spending the morning with her. She\u2019s got some shit going on with her parents.</p><p>I stared down at Beau\u2019s last text. Lana being upset made me anxious. Not sure I liked that. I didn\u2019t have time for anything more than a summer fling.</p><p>Me: I\u2019ll call her. Thanks.</p><p>Beau: Be careful with her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. This wasn\u2019t his business. When I\u2019d been with Ashton he\u2019d been more involved than he should have been but I\u2019d let it slide because Ash was a part of his life too. But Lana... she was not his concern. Throwing the phone down on the bed, I headed to the bathroom for a shower. I\u2019d already planned out a day where I could have Lana all to myself anyway. It had been my inspiration while running up and down the bleachers one hundred times.</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>My mom called out from her office as I passed it on my way to the garage. I\u2019d hoped to sneak by her without having to answer her questions. She\u2019d been upset when Ashton had broken up with me. She\u2019d been even more upset when she\u2019d found out Beau had been my replacement. We\u2019d spent a lot of time in counseling together. We\u2019d had to deal with my dad\u2019s dishonesty and find a way to face the truth without ripping our family apart. I still wanted Dad to reach out to Beau but he wouldn\u2019t. There was no way Beau was going to make the first move. He had a lot of well-deserved bitterness inside him where my dad was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed to pick up Lana, you remember Ashton\u2019s cousin from Georgia. We\u2019re going to head to Mobile to do some shopping for camping gear and maybe catch a movie or something.\u201d</p><p>Mom tilted her head and frowned. \u201cIsn\u2019t Lana the daughter of that crazy sister of Sarah\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know much about Lana\u2019s mom other than Ashton was not a fan. Shrugging I shoved my hands in my pockets. \u201cLana isn\u2019t crazy. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph... well, don\u2019t get too attached. The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201d</p><p>My Aunt Honey\u2019s voice rang in my ears when not too long ago she\u2019d said the same thing about my dad and Beau. Scowling, I replied, \u201cYeah, I realized that when I found out dad was unfaithful and then lied about it to those he was supposed to love.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s back went ramrod straight. I hated the hurt look I\u2019d put in her eyes. She didn\u2019t deserve my anger. She\u2019d been a victim too.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have butted into your business. You\u2019re right. Go have fun. Enjoy yourself this summer. Everything changes this fall. There\u2019s a big sea out there with lots of fish and now you and Ashton have moved on. It\u2019s time you start sampling the variety.\u201d</p><p>Mom had loved Ashton. I think she may have even picked out our china patterns at one point. Hearing her say that I needed to start \u201csampling the variety\u201d was a major step for her. I walked across the room and bent down to place a kiss on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d I said before turning to leave.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, sweet boy,\u201d she replied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want to be there. I do. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never been in New York City and I\u2019ve never met Shandra. I\u2019d feel more comfortable if I could bring someone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bring anyone but your mother. I don\u2019t want to have to deal with her. I do want you to make time to spend with Shandra. She really wants to get to know you. We\u2019ve got some special news for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpecial news?\u201d</p><p>Dad cleared his throat and, covered the receiver on his phone, and spoke in a muffled voice to someone else. What other news could he have? He\u2019d already dropped the marriage bomb on me. Surely, they weren\u2019t moving to Alpharetta. That would be disastrous. My mother would not be able to leave the house without thinking everyone was talking about her or pitying her.</p><p>\u201cShandra wants me to go ahead and tell you. That way you can be prepared when you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014\u201d I replied waiting with a sick knot in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a big sister,\u201d he replied. His excitement was unmistakable.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? How? Does Shandra have a kid?\u201d Nothing else made sense. Why would he think I\u2019d be excited over a step-sibling I\u2019d never get a chance to know?</p><p>\u201cNo, Shandra doesn\u2019t have a kid, yet. You know how. You\u2019re eighteen years old, Lana. You know how babies are made... don\u2019t you? I assumed your mother explained that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI KNOW how babies are made Daddy. What I don\u2019t understand is... wait... she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d I asked in horror. My dad had gotten someone pregnant? He was almost fifty! Could old men do that? Ugh! Yuck. He was going to be like the kid\u2019s grandfather.</p><p>Dad chuckled into the phone, \u201cYes, Shandra is pregnant. We\u2019d planned on getting married this Christmas. She loves Christmas in New York but well, the baby will be here by Christmas so instead of waiting we decided to go ahead and have a summer wedding.\u201d</p><p>I was speechless. How did one respond to this kind of news? I sank down on the backdoor steps of Ashton\u2019s house and rested my forehead on my knees.</p><p>My dad continued to chatter on about the wedding and baby plans. They would be moving out of Manhattan and to New Jersey so that they could afford a house. I wouldn\u2019t have a room but I could share the baby\u2019s room when I came to visit. He told me I was welcome anytime.</p> <p>\u201cLana?\u201d Sawyer\u2019s voice was a welcome distraction.</p><p>Lifting my head, I stared up at Sawyer who was standing in front of me with a worried frown. I wondered how much he\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I need to go. My, uh, friend just got here and we have plans. I\u2019ll call you back later when I\u2019ve decided what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are coming though\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Daddy, I need to go now. I\u2019ll call when I know.\u201d I clicked end before he could say anymore. I couldn\u2019t yet stand up to leave; I needed a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Sawyer asked, lowering himself to sit down beside me when it was obvious I wasn\u2019t about to get up.</p><p>I started to nod my head and ended up shaking it \u201cno\u201d instead.</p><p>His arm wrapped around my shoulders and he pulled me up against his side. That small offer of comfort caused my eyes to fill with tears. I buried my head into the curve of his arm, and tried to muffle the sob I couldn\u2019t control.</p> <p>Sawyer didn\u2019t try to offer me any encouragement or pointless words. Instead, he held me tighter and dropped small little kisses on my hair, temple and forehead as I cried in his arms. I\u2019d never really cried on anyone before. Opening myself up to sharing my emotions was new for me. The part of me that was shocked by this behavior was pushed aside as I soaked in all the comfort I could get. This would be fleeting but while I had it, I would take it.</p><p>After several minutes, I managed to control my tears. Reaching up, I wiped at my face. Thankfully, Dad had called me before I had a chance to put on makeup. I\u2019d have been humiliated if I\u2019d smeared mascara all over Sawyer\u2019s white polo shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Sharing with Sawyer how my dad had a pregnant twenty-three year old fianc\u00e9e wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d ever do. It was too much for me to take in. I didn\u2019t want to see pity in his eyes when he looked at me. I preferred the lust or attraction. If he pitied me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, sitting back up and checking to see how wet I\u2019d gotten his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dry,\u201d he assured me with a smile. I could still see the concern in his eyes as he searched my face. Part of me wanted him to know everything about me. Except a bigger part knew he\u2019d never look at me the same if he knew how pathetic my life really was.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on each corner of my mouth before covering my mouth with his. He didn\u2019t try to get me to open up for him. Instead, he kept it gentle and sweet. \u201cMmmmm\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking about those sweet lips all morning,\u201d he whispered against my mouth.</p><p>Melting into him was easy and unavoidable. I couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of Sawyer. He pulled back, way before I wanted him to and ran his hand through my hair before wrapping several curls around his fingers. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go finish getting ready? I\u2019m anxious to get you all to myself for the day.\u201d</p><p>My legs suddenly were in complete working order again. I stood up and smiled down at him, \u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer stood up and started to follow me inside when he stopped. \u201cUm, yeah, uh, I think I\u2019ll just wait in the truck if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Ashton wasn\u2019t inside. She\u2019d left with Beau an hour ago but I knew that wasn\u2019t why he didn\u2019t want to come inside. There had to be a lot of memories in this house he wasn\u2019t ready to revisit right now.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t be long,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Pulling onto the dirt road that led out to the field seemed like a bad idea. I\u2019d just spent the day with Lana, all alone. We\u2019d bought her a sleeping bag, backpack and a few other supplies for our camping trip. Then instead of a movie she\u2019d talked me into playing eighteen holes of putt-putt golf. It had sounded like a stupid idea but listening to Lana\u2019s laughter and seeing her strut around when she\u2019d gotten a hole-in-one had been more entertaining than any movie.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to one of these since...\u201d she trailed off biting her bottom lip.</p><p>The last field party Lana had been at, she\u2019d covered for Beau and Ashton. When the realization that Lana had known Beau and Ash were messing around behind my back and not told me, I\u2019d been upset. I\u2019d always thought she was on my team. It wasn\u2019t her fault. I had moved on enough now to see that clearly. Reaching across the seat, I grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cThe last time was when Beau and Ash were messing around behind my back. Although you covered for them that night it wasn\u2019t your fault. No worries, okay.\u201d</p><p>She let her bottom lip pop free of her teeth and it appeared red and swollen. Well damn, that was just too tempting. I let go of her hand, slid my hand between her thighs, and pulled her over to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better. You were too far away,\u201d I whispered before I bent my head so that I could pull her bottom lip into my mouth and gently suck on it. The surprised little noise she made had me pulling her closer. I let my hand slip further between her bare legs and squeeze the soft skin of her thigh in my hand.</p><p>Lana pressed her chest against mine and made a pleading noise in her throat. Picking her leg up, I draped it over my knee and slid my hand up a little higher inside her thigh. Her breathing hitched and I realized my heart was racing the closer I got to the edge of her panties.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Lana said breathlessly as she gave me a gentle push breaking the kiss. She quickly slid her leg off my knee and closed her legs. I\u2019d been really close to doing something I hadn\u2019t done but once in my life; I\u2019d been in seventh grade and a little confused as to why Nicole wanted me to touch her panties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, sitting back in my seat and focusing on the trees in front of me instead of checking to see if she was mad at me or worse, terrified. I needed to get a hold on my pounding heart first. I\u2019d been so close and she\u2019d been so warm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I just... I\u2019ve never done anything like that before and I got a little nervous. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that.\u201d</p><p>Her small hand covered mine and my tight fist eased under her touch.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d I replied, finally turning to meet her eyes.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise, \u201cYou either\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>I let out a chuckle and flipped my hand over so that our palms were touching. Then I threaded my fingers through hers. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that before. Unless you count seventh grade when Nicole locked us in Kayla\u2019s closet during a game of spin the bottle and forced me to touch her panties or she\u2019d tell the whole school I was too scared to kiss her.\u201d</p><p>A small bubble of laughter escaped Lana\u2019s mouth and she slapped her free hand over it to keep from laughing out loud. I smiled and squeezed her hand. It was a funny story.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you, what we almost did blew that very strange and disturbing memory out of the water.\u201d</p><p>This time the laughter was too loud to cover up with her hand and I reached over and pulled her hand from her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t. I like to hear you laugh. And that is one helluva funny story. So laughing is expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Nicole threatened you,\u201d she said, still laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cReally? Have you met Nicole? She was determined to lose her virginity before high school if at all possible. I think Beau may have helped her reach that goal our eighth grade year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter faded away and a serious thoughtful expression replaced it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going through that head of yours now?\u201d</p><p>A forced smile immediately appeared on her lips, \u201cNothing, sorry.\u201d She glanced out at the bonfire in the distance between the pecan trees. \u201cYou ready to get out?\u201d</p><p>She was very closed off about a lot of things. The more she didn\u2019t want to tell me the more I wanted to know about her.</p><p>Her phone began singing some sappy love song I\u2019d heard before on the radio and she reached into her purse and pulled it out. Instead of answering it, she quickly turned it off and slipped it back inside the pocket of her purse.</p><p>\u201cNo one important?\u201d I asked, wanting her to share something, anything with me.</p><p>She shook her head and reached for the door handle, \u201cNope. No one I can\u2019t call back later.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she jumped down out of my truck before I got out on my side. Lana McDaniel held everything close. I wondered if I\u2019d ever really know what she was thinking.</p><p>Sitting on the tailgate of Jake\u2019s truck with Lana tucked between my legs, I was satisfied. Ash curled up in Beau\u2019s lap wasn\u2019t even on my radar. I\u2019d managed to talk to everyone, Beau included. We discussed football, college, and our camping trip without any problems. It was nice. Lana was nice. No, Lana was more than nice. Having her in my arms made everything bearable.</p><p>\u201cHeads up, Kyle and Nic just showed up,\u201d Ethan said, before taking another swig of his beer. Nicole hadn\u2019t been around much since Beau and Ash had hooked up. She\u2019d made a go for me a few times. Once, I\u2019d even been tempted to take her out to my truck one night and just screw her. Get it over with. But I couldn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want my first time to be with Nicole in the back of my truck at a field party. I\u2019d waited this long, I could wait longer. Ash was going to be my one and only. But that plan was now over. I figured one day the right girl would come along and when that happened the place wouldn\u2019t be important. Just so it was with the one person I couldn\u2019t live without.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming this way,\u201d Kayla said smugly. The girl loved drama. With Nicole around drama was bound to follow.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go, baby?\u201d Beau asked Ashton, starting to shift so he could stand her up.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not scared of Nicole, Beau. What\u2019s she going to do to me? Hmmm?\u201d Beau chuckled and leaned in and gave Ashton a kiss on the nose. My chest ached only slightly at the sight of them. Nothing like the times in the past when I\u2019d been unable to take a deep breath when he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cWell, look at the Vincent boys. Getting along. Both of you all snuggled up to a girls. No one trying to beat up the other one. Looks like Sawyer has moved on, Ash,\u201d Nicole drawled out as she winked at me and sauntered over to stop in front of Lana who stood in her way.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve gotten over your Ashton depression, why don\u2019t you and I go out one night and have some fun?\u201d</p><p>Lana tensed in my arms. A protective streak coursed through me and I pulled her up against me tightly, placing my hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll have to pass, Nic. I\u2019ve already found someone to spend time with this summer.\u201d</p><p>Nicole smirked as she let her gaze travel up and down Lana as if she wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cYou can do much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need someone with experience after wasting all those years with the preacher\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>I heard Ashton ordering Beau to calm down and ignore her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into overused merchandise. I\u2019ve got standards, you know.\u201d</p><p>The surprised laugh from Lana had me smiling like an idiot. I loved making her laugh. She\u2019d relaxed and leaned into me when I\u2019d tightened my hold on her. Knowing I made her feel safe and unthreatened was a heady feeling.</p><p>\u201cOnce the Vincent boys were the hottest thing around. You\u2019ve not lived up to your potential. You\u2019re both boring. One day you\u2019ll crave that excitement you missed out on,\u201d Nicole snarled at me before flipping her dark brown hair over her shoulder and walking over to Kyle, who had stood silently while watching her make a play for me.</p><p>\u201cCome on Kyle, I\u2019ve had enough of this place.\u201d She stalked past him and Kyle threw me an apologetic look before following her.</p><p>\u201cWhy does he put up with her?\u201d Ashton asked as they walked away.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s an easy lay,\u201d Jake replied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to sleep in Beau\u2019s tent then who is going to sleep with me? I don\u2019t want to sleep in a tent all by myself. There are black bears in the Cheaha Mountains. I know this for a fact because I googled it.\u201d</p><p>Ashton threw me a saucy smile over her shoulder, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you could share a tent with Sawyer. I have no doubt he\u2019d rather share with you than Jake.\u201d</p> <p>I flopped down on her bed and groaned in frustration. Sharing a tent with Sawyer would be difficult. We\u2019d been on two dates since the field party and not once had we done anything more than kiss. After I\u2019d put the brakes on his hand slowly creeping up my thigh, he\u2019d been hands off on my body.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t offered that and I am not asking him. Can I get a lock for my tent?\u201d</p><p>Ashton laughed and threw another pair of shorts on her bed to pack. \u201cBears can\u2019t unzip tents, Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, chainsaw psychos who wander the woods looking for young girls all alone to chop up into pieces can,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cThere are no chainsaw psychos! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve never been camping. It\u2019s safe, Lana. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy for you to say. You\u2019ll be snuggled up safely in the arms of Beau Vincent. I\u2019m more than positive he could take on a black bear,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Ashton pulled a large red backpack out of her closet very similar to the royal blue one that Sawyer had helped me pick out. The excitement for our upcoming trip made me wish I could share in her joy. But every time I tried to get excited visions of black bears, snakes, and chainsaws haunted my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cStop frowning. You\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll get someone to share a tent with you. You won\u2019t be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the tiny little bikini Ashton dropped on the bed, I picked it up and raised an eyebrow in surprise. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing your mom hasn\u2019t seen this one?\u201d</p><p>Ashton rolled her eyes and snatched it out of my hand before glancing back at the door to make sure it was still closed. \u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t. I bought it for this trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bet you did,\u201d I teased.</p> <p>Ashton frowned, \u201cShhhh... do you not remember all the begging I had to do to make this happen? The only saving grace we have is the fact Sawyer is going to be there and they believe you and I are sharing a tent. And I might have left out the fact Beau will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshton! You did not! What if they ask his mother?\u201d I asked horrified.</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna happen. My parents and Honey Vincent aren\u2019t exactly chummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you say so,\u201d I replied just as my phone alerted me that I had a new text message.</p><p>Sawyer: What\u2019re you doing?</p><p>Me: Watching Ash pack</p><p>Sawyer: Why aren\u2019t you packing?</p><p>Me: B/C I\u2019m stressing over the black bears that are going to eat me in my sleep</p> <p>Sawyer: HA! No black bears will eat you. They don\u2019t do red heads. You\u2019re safe.</p><p>Me: Very funny. I happen to know that they aren\u2019t very picky and that there are plenty of them in Cheaha.</p><p>Sawyer: Naw, I\u2019ve never seen one there.</p><p>Me: Well they\u2019re there. Google it.</p><p>Sawyer: I\u2019ll keep you safe.</p><p>Me: Maybe during the day but at night when I\u2019m alone in my tent they\u2019ll come for me.</p><p>Sawyer: Alone in your tent? Um, no. You\u2019re in my tent.</p><p>I lifted my head to see Ashton watching me as I texted back and forth with Sawyer.</p><p>She was amused to say the least, \u201cWell, what\u2019s he saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m sharing his tent.\u201d</p><p>Ashton raised her eyebrows, \u201cTold ya.\u201d</p><p>Me: Are you sure?</p><p>Sawyer: Hell yeah I\u2019m sure. Why do you think I\u2019m going on this camping trip?</p><p>Me: Um... because you like to sleep on hard rocky ground and get chased by bears?</p><p>Sawyer: Funny. Go take your cute little ass to your room and get packing.</p><p>Me: Yes, sir.</p><p>\u201cOh, ye of little faith,\u201d Ashton said in a singsong voice as I stood up slipping my phone into the pocket of my shorts.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, you know everything,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cYou going to go pack now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I need to get on that. Do we really have to leave so early in the morning though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. It\u2019s a five hour drive then we need to hike up to our camping spot and put up our tents before the sun goes down.\u201d</p><p>It was still dark outside when Sawyer drove up in a Suburban that belonged to his dad. It had room for eight. This way we could all drive up together. I\u2019d packed as much clothing as I could in my backpack. Ashton had assured me there were showers on the grounds we could go use. I was not about to get in snake-infested water to wash up.</p><p>\u201cGood morning sunshine,\u201d Sawyer said as I stumbled out the door. We had overslept and there had been no time to make coffee.</p><p>My eyes focused on the styrofoam cup in his hand as he extended it to me. \u201cYou drink it black, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I said grabbing a handful of the black t-shirt he was wearing until he was close enough for me to kiss. I laid a very loud smack on his mouth before taking the cup from his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to get that kind of greeting I may just start showing up every morning with a cup of coffee in hand,\u201d Sawyer drawled in a sexy voice as he slipped his hand around my waist.</p><p>\u201cWe need to load up. Back away from the girl lover boy and help out,\u201d Jake grumbled as he took my backpack and sleeping bag from the front porch and headed to the Suburban with it.</p><p>Sawyer chuckled and picked up the extra duffel bag that Ash and I had packed with a few things we couldn\u2019t fit in our backpacks. He looked at me and raised his eyebrows in question.</p><p>\u201cThe backpacks didn\u2019t have enough room in them. Besides, that isn\u2019t all mine. Ashton and I both needed a few more things,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking a camping rule but because you look so amazingly hot in those little hiking shorts, I\u2019ll overlook it.\u201d</p><p>I put the steaming cup of coffee to my lips to hide the silly grin on my face. Who would have known Sawyer Vincent could be so good at flirting?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the duffel?\u201d Toby demanded as Sawyer threw it up to him so he could strap it on top of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cAsh and Lana had a few things that wouldn\u2019t fit in their backpacks. Shut up and strap it down,\u201d Sawyer replied and turned back to look at me with a cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cKayla tried this and I made her take it back inside,\u201d Toby complained.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t our fault you\u2019re a sucky boyfriend Toby, now strap the duffel down,\u201d Beau said in an annoyed tone as he walked around from the backside of the Suburban.</p><p>I made my way over to the SUV to get in and stopped because I wasn\u2019t sure if I should assume I was riding in the front with Sawyer. I searched the yard for Ashton but it was still dark out and the front porch light only lit up part of the yard.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Sawyer\u2019s new girl?\u201d an unfamiliar voice asked from behind me. I spun around to see a petite girl with a headful of pale blonde hair that sticking out in wild ringlets everywhere. Her eyes were a bright blue. So startling that they had to be contacts. She had a golden tan that didn\u2019t match up with the pale color of her hair, at all. But she was really pretty.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, well no. We\u2019re just friends,\u201d I replied.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cYou aren\u2019t just friends. Sawyer doesn\u2019t kiss his friends. If he did, I\u2019d be lined up waiting for my turn. I\u2019ve been his friend since kindergarten and not once has he kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was the only response I had for her. It was too early and I hadn\u2019t finished my coffee yet. My verbal skills were lacking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Heidi. Kayla is one of my best friends. We cheered together all four years of high school. Jake and I have an on again off again thing going. Right now, it\u2019s on,\u201d she winked at me and took a sip from her thermos.</p><p>\u201cYou getting in? I think Jake and I are going to take the back,\u201d she paused and looked around, \u201cunless Beau and Ash are taking it. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for the Beau Vincent love marathon the whole way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre four people sitting in the back? Won\u2019t that be crowded?\u201d</p><p>Heidi frowned as if this just dawned on her. \u201cOh, I guess we can\u2019t all sit in pairs.\u201d</p><p>Now, I really wasn\u2019t sure where I should sit. Sawyer came up beside me and opened the passenger side door. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting up here with me. If I have to drive the whole way, I at least deserve to have you to entertain me.\u201d</p><p>That answered my question.</p><p>Heidi tilted her head back to look at Toby and Jake strapping things down on top of the Suburban. \u201cSo, how are we sitting? I\u2019m ready to get in and I don\u2019t know where to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh and I are in the back. Someone will have to ride back there with us if we\u2019re all going to fit,\u201d Beau informed her as he opened the door and helped Ash inside.</p><p>\u201cJake you\u2019re in the back beside Beau. Heidi can sit with Kayla and me in the middle,\u201d Toby piped up.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have to get stuck in the back by Beau? Why can\u2019t you?\u201d Jake snapped.</p><p>\u201cBecause Kayla is my girlfriend. Heidi is your fuckbuddy,\u201d Toby replied, jumping down and checking the straps one more time with a hard tug.</p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t call me that!\u201d Heidi yelled.</p><p>Toby shrugged, \u201cSorry Heidi, I call \u2018em like I see \u2018em. If the two of you ever make it exclusive, I\u2019ll be sure to change my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I can\u2019t believe is you just said fuck in the pastor\u2019s yard,\u201d Jake smirked as he walked around the corner of the vehicle toward us.</p><p>Sawyer leaned down and whispered in my ear, \u201cThey\u2019re going to argue about this for a few more minutes. Go ahead and get in.\u201d</p><p>He held my hand and helped me up. I loved how he made me feel special when he did little things like that. \u201cI\u2019ll stop by a Starbucks and get you some more coffee as soon as we get out of Grove,\u201d he promised before closing the door.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Lana was holding her fresh cup of coffee close to her nose smelling it at her leisure. I\u2019d decided to drive through Mobile just so we could find a Starbucks. She was much more awake and alert than when she\u2019d staggered out of the house earlier in a sleepy haze. I\u2019d wanted to cuddle her up and take her back to bed but that wasn\u2019t something I could act on. She\u2019d drawn a line with us physically and I was trying to stay behind that line. But the more time we spent together made it harder and harder.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it Starbucks coffee just smells better than anything you can make at home?\u201d She asked, cutting her eyes over in my direction with a flirty bat of her eyelashes. If it weren\u2019t for the fact I already knew the girl had no clue how to flirt, I\u2019d think it was on purpose. The more I got to know her the more I realized that she really had no idea how tempting she was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a head game. They do an excellent job of marketing,\u201d I replied, reaching for my cup and taking a long swig before setting it back in the cup holder.</p><p>\u201cHmmm... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried buying the Starbucks brand at the grocery store and making it at home but it doesn\u2019t smell the same.\u201d</p><p>I started to reply but Jake yelled out, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough room in this backseat for me and Beau. We\u2019re cramped up. Heidi and I need to switch spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stick Ash in your lap Beau and scoot over,\u201d I replied, glancing over at Lana who was staring at me with a surprised look in her eyes. Winking, I reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked</p><p>She just shook her head and smiled back at me.</p><p>\u201cAH! God, that is so much better,\u201d Jake groaned loudly. \u201cThrow me my pillow Heidi. I\u2019m going to need to go to sleep. Ash in Beau\u2019s lap is going to get out of hand soon enough and I\u2019d rather not watch.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightened at his words but only for a second. It hadn\u2019t bothered me to suggest Ash sit in Beau\u2019s lap but the idea of him touching her still got to me. Threading my fingers through Lana\u2019s, I focused on the road and the fact Lana would be cuddled up to me in my tent for the next three nights.</p><p>The tents were all set up and the fire was blazing brightly by the time the sun set over the Cheaha Mountains. The girls had all hiked up to the bathrooms to get showers. We\u2019d had to set up camp closer to the public bathhouse than I preferred but Ashton had pouted when I suggested we move out another mile. Beau had dropped everything in his hands and without looking to me or anyone else for agreement, he began setting up camp. Ash had never pouted on me when she wanted her way. It was strange to see her voice an opinion. It was even weirder to watch Beau give in to someone so easily. She really was different with him. She didn\u2019t bend to his will and ask him what he wanted first. The free-spirited little girl who would rather throw water balloons at cars, roll yards with toilet paper, and sneak out of her bedroom window to go comfort the trashy barmaid\u2019s son was back. She\u2019d just needed Beau to help her find herself again. A lump formed in my throat at the realization it was my fault she\u2019d lost herself. I walked out of the firelight and into the darkness to stare out at the shadowed nature around us. Pressing a hand against my chest, I rubbed hard forcing the emotion tightening my chest to go away.</p><p>Just when I thought things were getting better with how I felt about Ashton something always happened to send me spiraling back into the pain. Granted, it was getting easier and it wasn\u2019t anything near what it was in the beginning\u2014but it wasn\u2019t completely gone. I feared it never would be. Ashton would always be my biggest mistake. Not because I loved her but because I lost her.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d Beau\u2019s voice broke into the silence around me. Dropping my hand from my chest, I stuck it into my pocket and nodded without turning to look back at him</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing out here? Getting away from Jake\u2019s bitching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust looking around,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Beau stopped beside me. I could see him staring out in the same direction as me from my peripheral vision.</p><p>\u201cYou seem happy with Lana. Ash said Lana really likes you.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the silent warning in his voice. If I hurt Lana, I hurt Ashton and Beau wouldn\u2019t be okay with that.</p><p>\u201cLana is great. She knows where I stand. August will be here soon and I\u2019ll be going to Florida and she\u2019ll be going... wherever it is she\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>Beau turned his head to look at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know where she\u2019s going to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s never come up.\u201d</p><p>Beau shook his head, \u201cOnce, not too long ago, you were the good brother. You were careful with everyone\u2019s feelings. It was fucking ridiculous how polite and thoughtful you were. You\u2019ve changed, man. Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but I miss that guy. He was someone I always admired. I couldn\u2019t be proud of my choices but I was always so damn proud of yours.\u201d</p><p>The anger that had surfaced instantly was gone with that last sentence. Beau turned and walked back to the campsite leaving me there to think about what he\u2019d said. Knowing he was proud of me made my eyes burn. That wasn\u2019t something I ever imagined my tough ass brother admitting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Lana</p><p>I sat on my sleeping bag checking my text messages that had magically appeared when we\u2019d made it to the bathhouse. Reception out here in the wilderness wasn\u2019t so good. But there was Wi-Fi at the bathhouse which was surprising and kind of funny. Sawyer, Beau and Toby were still outside putting out the fire and making sure all our supplies were packed up safely for the night. We\u2019d sat around the fire and roasted weenies and marshmallows. Sawyer had packed a few cold things in a cooler that we had to use tonight because by tomorrow night the ice would have melted and everything would\u2019ve been ruined. I didn\u2019t even want to think about what we\u2019d have to eat tomorrow night.</p><p>Dad: I need you to call me.</p> <p>Dad: Please call me honey. I can\u2019t seem to get a call through to your phone.</p><p>Dad: I called the house. Sarah told me you were camping. Be safe and call me as soon as possible.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to talk to him just yet. I\u2019d have to call him once I got back to Ashton\u2019s. But right now, I needed more time.</p><p>Mom: You do not have to go to New York City.</p><p>Mom: Why didn\u2019t you tell me the slut was pregnant?</p> <p>Mom: I do NOT want you going up there. Your father is completely screwing up your life. Just ignore him. He can rot in hell for all I care.</p><p>Mom: Don\u2019t you call him! Sarah said he called asking where you were. And you didn\u2019t tell me you were dating SAWYER VINCENT! I\u2019m so excited for you.</p><p>I\u2019d finally managed to have something that had been Ashton\u2019s. My mother adored Ashton and most of my life I\u2019d had to hear how perfect Ashton was and how I should try to be more like her. It\u2019s no wonder I was so mean to her when we were kids. Shaking my head, I deleted the rest of her texts without reading them.</p><p>Jewel: You decided on what to do about college yet or have you even spoken to your Dad about the money?</p><p>Jewel: You can ignore me but when you\u2019re stuck in Alpharetta commuting to the junior college while everyone else is off living a real college experience...you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d done something!</p><p>She was right. I needed to talk to Dad about the money I needed. I\u2019d gotten a small scholarship but if I was going to go to an out-of-state college, I needed help financially. I\u2019d been accepted and my registration was paid. The trouble was that due to my dad\u2019s income I couldn\u2019t get any extra money. I hadn\u2019t applied for loans in time and now I needed help.</p> <p>The tent flap opened and Sawyer ducked inside grinning at me. \u201cWaiting up for me?\u201d</p><p>My heart fluttered and all worries of school were pushed aside. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to slay all those hungry black bears circling the tent first,\u201d he teased.</p><p>I started to reply when he yanked his shirt over his head and his very well defined bare chest was inches from my face. Swallowing hard, I focused on breathing properly. His abs were so perfect they looked unreal. I mean, I\u2019d seen him shirtless before but never this closeup. His cargo shorts hung on his hips. Even his hips were defined. The small patch of dark hair that trailed from below his belly button to beneath the waist of his shorts made me gulp. Suddenly it was very, very hot in the tent and I needed someone to throw cold water on me or fan me.</p><p>\u201cLana,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s voice broke into my thoughts and I lifted my eyes from his tantalizing flat stomach to his meet his gaze. Oh my. Licking my lips nervously I tried to think of a response but Sawyer was laying me back and covering my mouth and body within seconds. His lips were gentler than the look in his eyes had been. I gasped as his bare chest brushed the thin material of my tank top and Sawyer\u2019s tongue was in my mouth teasing, tasting and driving me crazy.</p><p>I needed to feel him. Sliding my hands up his arms, I felt him flex under my touch. Loving the powerful feeling that came with the knowledge I could affect him with just a touch, I continued my exploration of his muscular back. I grazed his mouthwatering abs with my nails eliciting a groan from him. His mouth left mine and he began kissing a trail from my jawline down my neck. The closer he got to my chest the heavier my breathing became. Holding himself over me with one arm he took his other hand and traced the neckline of my tank top with his finger while watching me closely. I knew he was waiting on permission to go further and although I knew letting him go any further wasn\u2019t a very good idea I couldn\u2019t tell him no. The needy gleam in his eyes was impossible to deny. For fear my voice wouldn\u2019t work I leaned up and into his touch in response. His eyes widened in surprise then a glazed look came over them as he lowered his head. He kept his eyes on mine until his mouth pressed onto the top of my cleavage that was showing just above the neckline.</p><p>His green eyes held my attention as his tongue darted out and took a small lap at the swell of my breast then trailed along the top until it met the crease between the two of them. One big hand slid underneath the bottom of my top and left a sizzling hot trail up my stomach until it stopped at the underside of my bra. Something close to a whimper escaped me and that was all the encouragement Sawyer needed. His hand slid over the lace of my bra and found the front clasped and quickly unsnapped it. I closed my eyes tightly as I felt both my breasts spring free. No one had ever touched me like this.</p><p>When his calloused hand covered my right breast, I almost shot straight up. The jolt that went directly to the small ache between my legs shocked me. He eased my tank top slowly up my body. If I was going to stop him then now would be the time. I opened my eyes and started to say something but his dilated pupils and awed expression stopped me. Instead, I leaned up and lifted my arms as he took the tank top and bra off me. This was it. My first time topless in front of a boy. And it wasn\u2019t just any boy. It was the only one I\u2019d ever imagined doing this with. Every fantasy I\u2019d ever conjured up about Sawyer Vincent touching me held nothing to the reality of it.</p> <p>\u201cLana,\u201d he whispered, staring down at me. I shifted, opening my legs so that he rested between them and his arousal pressed directly on the ache between my legs.</p><p>\u201cOhmygod,\u201d I moaned loudly and Sawyer\u2019s mouth was on mine. His slow sweet kisses were gone and he consumed my mouth with a wild urgency. My body bucked against his as if it had a mind of its own and this time, Sawyer groaned. Both of his hands covered my bare breasts. He rolled each nipple between his thumb and finger sending my world spiraling out of control. His mouth smothered my response to him but at the moment I didn\u2019t care. It was as if someone had shot fireworks off in my body. I clung to him afraid I might be falling somewhere I couldn\u2019t come back from. The pain had ricocheted into a pleasure I didn\u2019t know existed.</p><p>As I slowly came back to earth, I realized two things. Sawyer was no longer touching my chest. His hands were on either side of my head with handfuls of the sleeping bag underneath me tightly in his fist. His head was buried in the curve of my neck and shoulder. Sawyer was breathing deep and hard. His body was held rigid over mine and I carefully unwrapped my legs from around him where I\u2019d been holding him in a vise-lock. Sawyer didn\u2019t move or relax. Worry and embarrassment at my reaction to what we\u2019d been doing started settling in. Was he okay? Had I just had an orgasm?</p><p>His warm mouth pressed a kiss to my neck and I shivered underneath him. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he demanded in a hard whisper. I stilled, instantly worried I\u2019d done something else wrong.</p><p>We lay there for a few more minutes in silence and my concern began to grow.</p><p>Finally, he slowly lifted his head then let go of his death grip on the sleeping bag and pushed himself up off me careful not to put any pressure between my legs. Humiliation washed over me when I saw him reach for my tank top. Without saying anything, I let him put it on me. He pulled it down over my bare chest and stomach then quickly let go of it and sat back on his sleeping bag. I\u2019d done something wrong. My stomach felt sick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Sawyer lifted his head so he was looking in my direction but I didn\u2019t meet his gaze. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked in a deep husky voice I\u2019d never heard him use.</p><p>Covering my face with my hands so he couldn\u2019t see the tears welling up in my eyes, I replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did that. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sawyer was in front of me pulling my hands away from my face and forcing me to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? Lana, do you understand anything that just happened?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged then shook my head no.</p><p>Sawyer let out a small laugh and reached to pull me into his lap. \u201cThat was the single most incredible moment of my life. Don\u2019t be sorry for it. Please,\u201d he said in the same low sexy tone he\u2019d used before.</p><p>I studied him a moment. \u201cBut... I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer leaned in and kissed the tip of my nose then kissed each of my eyelids. \u201cLet me explain it to you then. I just had a beautiful girl trust me enough to touch her and see her in a way no one else ever has. I got to hold her and watch her and feel her as she came apart in my arms. It was like nothing else I\u2019d ever experienced. She was breathtaking and she was responding to me. She wanted me. I was the one making her spiral out of control.\u201d</p><p>Oh. But.... \u201cBut you acted tense or angry when I reacted that way and moved away from me like you didn\u2019t want to be near me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer chuckled, \u201cLana, I was using every amount of self-control I could find to keep from pulling off those shorts of yours and going somewhere neither of us are ready to go. For a moment there, all I saw was red-hot need and I came real close to taking it. What you thought was anger was me forcing myself to calm the fuck down.\u201d</p><p>The hardness I could still feel under my butt as I sat in his lap told me he hadn\u2019t exactly calmed all the way down.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still\u2014\u201d I trailed off and a crooked grin appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I doubt I\u2019ll get rid of that without a really cold shower which I think I may need to go take in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Oh, wow. I knew enough to know a guy could go through a lot of pain if a girl worked him up enough and he didn\u2019t... get his release. The ache had gotten so intense before I\u2019d broken into a million pieces. I couldn\u2019t imagine being forced to stay in that state with no end. He\u2019d held me while I found my release.</p><p>\u201cI could... help,\u201d I offered quietly and Sawyer\u2019s body went rigid at my words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could help with your um... need for release. I mean it is my fault you\u2019re like this. I could... I mean, I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit,\u201d he muttered, covering his face with his hand and rubbing it hard. \u201cLana, you can\u2019t say things like that to me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it only makes me hurt worse thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Crawling off his lap, I didn\u2019t raise my eyes to see what his reaction was. Instead, I took a deep breath and reached for the button of his shorts. His hand grabbed mine, \u201cOh no. I\u2019m not letting you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer shook his head, \u201cNo, Lana. I\u2019ll go up to the bath house and fix this.\u201d</p><p>Shoving his hand away with more strength than was required, I continued to undo his shorts.</p><p>\u201cOhgod,\u201d he groaned as I pulled them down. He lifted his hips so I could pull them down far enough down his hips. I was on a major power trip. Seeing Sawyer Vincent completely fascinated with everything I was doing was sexy, not to mention fun.</p><p>I pushed the nervous, reserved Lana who was screaming in my head that I could not touch a boy there, far away. I reached into his boxers and my hands felt his warm, silky erection.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Sawyer exhaled in a deep voice that sent shivers through me.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>I opened my eyes as the warmth of the early morning rays hit the tent. Last night\u2019s events slowly washed over me and the body I had pressed up against me made me smile. Lana McDaniel had rocked my world last night. When she\u2019d come in my arms, I was pretty damn sure nothing could ever be that hot. But then, the expression of awe on her face with her mouth slightly open in wonder as she gently used her innocent ministrations to give me my release had been the absolute sexiest thing I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Pulling her tighter against my chest, I inhaled the sweet, subtle scent of her shampoo and closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said groggily as she rolled over in my arms until she was facing me. The shy smile on her face said she knew that she\u2019d made me a very happy man last night.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019\u201d I murmured before softly kissing her mouth.</p><p>She backed away and covered her mouth to keep me from doing anything more.</p><p>\u201cMorning breath. I need to brush my teeth,\u201d she explained as she kept her hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it smells as sweet as the rest of you,\u201d I assured her, ducking my head and kissing her neck before sniffing her skin loud enough to make her giggle. I wasn\u2019t one for giggling but that giggle was sexy and rare. I liked it. A lot.</p><p>\u201cGet up; we got a waterfall to find. It\u2019s gonna be hot as hell in a few hours and we need to be close to the cold water to cool off when it hits.\u201d Jake\u2019s voice boomed over the campsite.</p><p>Lana pushed away from me and sat up. I rolled over on my back and watched her as she gathered her supplies to get ready.</p><p>She flashed a smile back at me as she reached for the zipper of the tent. I noticed her discarded bra from last night and I sat up and grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go out there like that,\u201d I said in a more demanding voice than I\u2019d intended. The idea of Jake or anyone else seeing her braless in that skimpy little top sent a possessive jolt through me. No way in hell.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d She frowned, staring down at my hand on her arm.</p><p>I picked up her bra and dangled it in front of her. \u201cYou need to put this on.\u201d</p><p>She held up the clothes in her arms, \u201cI\u2019m putting on my swimsuit under my clothes. I don\u2019t need my bra today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah you do. You\u2019re not walking out of this tent with your tits only covered up by that thin piece of cotton.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged on her lips and she snatched the bra out of my hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The waterfall was only a five-mile hike, which was a good thing because if I\u2019d had to hear Heidi complain one more minute, I was going to lose it.</p><p>I searched for Lana and found her sitting out on a rock across the water beside Ashton. I stood there and watched them. Ashton\u2019s laughter always made me smile. Hearing it ring out over the water as she talked happily with Lana made things feel right. Ashton had held my heart for so long that even after her betrayal I\u2019d have taken her back without question if she\u2019d asked. As much as I loved my brother, I wasn\u2019t sure I wouldn\u2019t still. My eyes shifted to Lana who was talking now. Her happy expression made me feel like a king. She\u2019d been in an excellent mood all morning. Knowing it was because of me was nice. The memory of Lana\u2019s touch last night far exceeded anything I\u2019d ever experienced with Ashton. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that.</p><p>Ashton had owned me. I\u2019d have moved heaven and earth to make her happy. It was different with Lana. I enjoyed her company and being with her was exhilarating. But I knew what love felt like and what I was feeling for Lana wasn\u2019t even close. It was more intense but only physically. The idea of leaving her in August didn\u2019t ache the way it did when I thought of Ash being so far away.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s one hot piece of ass. If you get bored and want to trade tent buddies just let me know.\u201d I jerked my head to glare at Jake as he stood smirking with his attention focused on Lana.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d I demanded, towering over Jake by only a few inches. I fisted both my hands prepared to knock him on his ass if he dared repeat his crude comment.</p><p>\u201cWhoa Saw, calm down bud. You do realize I wasn\u2019t talking about Ash, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jake held up both his hands and backed away from me. \u201cI know who you were talking about and I suggest you take your perverted eyes off her. She isn\u2019t up for grabs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, what the hell did you do Jake? Not sure I\u2019ve ever seen Sawyer so ready to pummel someone other than me before,\u201d Beau drawled in a lazy amused tone.</p><p>\u201cShut up Beau,\u201d I snapped not looking back at him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s gone apeshit. I just made a comment about Lana. Last time he talked about her she was just a fucking \u2018distraction\u2019. I didn\u2019t know he would go all territorial,\u201d Jake replied, glancing over my shoulder toward my brother. I could see the request for backup in his eyes and it only pissed me off more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right bro. Back off. You\u2019ve been referring to Lana as a distraction for over a week. If you\u2019ve gone and changed your mind then you might want to let everyone know.\u201d</p><p>I hated it when Beau had a valid point. He was the Neanderthal. Not me. He wasn\u2019t supposed to make sense. Jerking my shirt over my head, I threw it on the rocky ground and dove into the water. I needed to be near Lana. That was the only thing that was going to calm down the violent storm inside me.</p><p>Lana</p><p>I wanted a shower before I crashed. I was exhausted. Today had been a blast but between the heat, swimming and hiking I could hardly keep my eyes open. I plugged up my phone on the small ledge over the sink in the bathhouse and went to get cleaned up. Ash had said her head hurt and she wanted to lay down a few minutes before coming to take a shower. Heidi and Kayla both said they were too tired to walk up here and shower, which I thought was gross. They decided the water at the falls was enough of a bath for them.</p><p>I\u2019d sweated on our hike back and I knew they had too but it wasn\u2019t my business. If they wanted to go to bed nasty, then so be it. Walking up here alone with the bears, snakes and psycho chainsaw men had taken a great deal of bravery on my part.</p> <p>I was also anxious to get back to Sawyer. The hope that we might have a night similar to last night had been at the forefront of my thoughts all day. Ashton had mentioned my silly smile and I\u2019d been vague with my reply as to why I was so giddy. Anyway, I was pretty sure she knew exactly why.</p><p>After finishing my shower, I dried off and slipped on my tank top without a bra this time and the pink striped boxer shorts I\u2019d brought to sleep in. It was dark and I had to carry my supplies and dirty clothes back with me. I could hold those in front of my shirt. Sawyer would never notice I\u2019d gone braless outside of the tent. His possessive reaction to my walking out of the tent without one this morning had surprised me. No one had ever been possessive of me. Maybe the healthy response would\u2019ve been to stand my ground and force him to accept I was my own person. But I didn\u2019t. I wanted to be wanted.</p><p>Picking up my phone, I noticed all the missed calls and text messages. Sighing, I scrolled through them and saw my dad had called twice. My mother had called fifteen times and then they\u2019d both left several text messages. I needed to call one of them back. Mom would keep me on the phone forever and I really wanted to get to that tent.</p><p>So, I tapped my dad\u2019s name and waited as the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cFinally. Is there no reception up there? I\u2019ve called you several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy. Sorry, but yes, the reception is shoddy up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you finally got my messages and called. I need to talk to you about the wedding. There\u2019s been a change of plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShandra\u2019s grandmother lives on the coast in South Carolina. She\u2019s wealthy and her home is a historical landmark. She has offered it to Shandra to use for the wedding. Since Shandra can\u2019t have her Christmas wedding in New York she\u2019s decided a summer wedding on the coast would be more fitting. I want this perfect for her. Special, ya know?\u201d he paused waiting on a response from me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes Daddy, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay, good. This is going to cost a good bit more than originally planned. Also, family members that her grandmother insisted should attend are flying in from all over. The house is going to be packed.\u201d</p><p>Still not sure what it was he wanted to tell me other than share his wedding plans, which I did not think was a very urgent matter, I waited.</p><p>\u201cThere just isn\u2019t room for you at the house. I can\u2019t very well make Shandra\u2019s grandmother give you a room when she\u2019s being so generous already. Plus, the cost of travel is really making my budget tight. Flying you out and paying for your hotel room just isn\u2019t possible. I mean, I want you there but I just don\u2019t see how I can afford to get you there.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes. Tears welled up in my eyes and I wiped at them furiously. I would not cry over this. I would not.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Alright,\u201d I managed through my clogged throat.</p><p>\u201cSo you understand, right?\u201d</p><p>He was spending all his money on a wedding to a girl he was about to start a brand new family with. He couldn\u2019t manage to find money to fly the daughter he already had out to be with him for his big day. As much as it hurt, this was something I could live with. I knew though, the reality of what he was telling me was so much more.</p><p>A new wife, a new house, a big wedding, a new baby... my dad wasn\u2019t going to help me with college. I didn\u2019t even have the courage to ask anymore. If I had to be disappointed and let down by him one more time, I wasn\u2019t sure I could deal.</p><p>\u201cLana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay Daddy. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would. Shandra is very worried this will upset you. I told her you were nothing like Caroline and this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go. I don\u2019t want to use up all my battery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, of course. Well, have fun and enjoy your summer. Maybe I can make it out to see you this fall. Which college did you finally decide on?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be going to the local junior college. My dad had a new family.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go Daddy,\u201d I replied and clicked end.</p><p>The tears trickled down my face and I felt my hardened resolve not to let my dad or my mother hurt me anymore melt away. How much was I supposed to take before I crumbled? Holding all this in was eating me alive. I needed someone to listen to me. Someone to hold me while I cried. I just needed someone to care about me. Not themselves. For once, I needed it to be about me.... I needed Sawyer. I splashed water on my face and dried off all the tears. I didn\u2019t want to answer any questions on my way to find him. He was the only one I wanted to talk to about this.</p><p>Grabbing my bag, I tucked my phone inside and headed out the door. He\u2019d be waiting on me. He\u2019d listen. Just as I stepped onto the path leading down to our campsite, Sawyer came barreling toward me. Relief washed over me the moment I saw him. But it was short lived. The serious expression on his face surprised me.</p><p>\u201cSawyer,\u201d I began and he rushed past me toward the bathhouse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time right now, Lana,\u201d he called back at me.</p><p>Stunned, I stood there frozen in my spot.</p><p>Within seconds, he was running back out of the bathhouse with a dripping wet rag in his hand. A determined set to his jaw. His eyes flicked past me. As he rushed by, I reached out and grabbed his arm. He was starting to scare me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked</p><p>\u201cLana let go. I can\u2019t talk to you right now. Ash needs me.\u201d</p><p>As his words registered in my head, I snatched my hand away from him. He didn\u2019t offer an explanation or apology. Instead, he ran off leaving me standing there alone. My emotions were already in tatters so I tried to reason that something must really be wrong with Ashton. Panic sent me running after him.</p><p>I stopped the moment I saw Sawyer bend down behind Ashton and gently pull her hair back. She was sick. Sawyer wiped her mouth and then folded the rag carefully and began washing her pale face.</p><p>\u201cI got you Ash. It\u2019s okay,\u201d he murmured as she laid her head against his chest weakly.</p><p>Jealousy washed over me like a tidal wave, even though I knew she was sick. I didn\u2019t like seeing him so sweet and protective of her. Taking a step forward I asked, \u201cAsh, you okay?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s head snapped up but I didn\u2019t meet his gaze. I wasn\u2019t sure I could. She raised her head and let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve got a migraine. Too much sun but Beau took the car to the nearest store to get me some pain medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ve got her, Lana. You can go on to the tent,\u201d Sawyer\u2019s demanding voice sliced through my already broken spirit. I couldn\u2019t stand here and watch this. Ash was sick but she was in good hands. The Vincent boys were taking care of her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I managed to respond and turned to walk toward the tent. Standing outside of it, I hated the idea of going inside. The memories from last night were in there. I needed to forget those memories. My life was out of control enough. I didn\u2019t need Sawyer Vincent\u2019s help to break my heart. My dad was doing a fine job all on his own. I\u2019d loved two men in my life and I\u2019d not been enough for either of them. I would never be their first choice.</p><p>A fresh tear rolled down my face. Before anyone could see me cry, I opened the tent and crawled inside. Moving my sleeping bag back to the far corner of the tent as far away from Sawyer\u2019s as possible, I curled up inside of it and cried. I cried because my dad hadn\u2019t wanted me. I cried because my dreams of college had slipped through my fingers and I cried because I\u2019d let myself believe Sawyer could possibly fall in love with me.</p><p>I woke up early and peeked over at Sawyer. He was sound asleep in his sleeping bag. The pain he\u2019d inflicted last night hadn\u2019t eased with sleep. Grabbing my things, I quietly exited the tent. I didn\u2019t want to be in there with him when he woke up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d Jake knelt down over the fire adding some fresh logs.</p><p>Running my hand through my hair self-consciously, I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have coffee, want some?\u201d Jake asked, standing up and lifting a pot of coffee up to show me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you make that?\u201d I asked walking over toward him. I could almost smell the coffee.</p><p>\u201cI brought a coffeemaker with me. Used the electricity up at the bathhouse,\u201d he explained, pouring some of it into a styrofoam cup.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to drink it black. I don\u2019t have cream or sugar,\u201d he said holding the cup out for me.</p><p>\u201cI always drink it black,\u201d I replied, taking a small sip.</p><p>Jake raised his eyebrows, \u201cReally? That\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I turned to walk up to the bathhouse and get dressed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t get a thank you?\u201d</p><p>I glanced back over my shoulder, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019ll always be that way. He\u2019ll never really move on. She\u2019ll always be the one.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and took a deep breath as the knife he\u2019d plunged into my stomach and twisted caused too much pain to keep me moving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being mean. I\u2019m just being honest. You\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp nod of my head, I forced my feet to move. I needed to get away. No more truth. I\u2019d had a little too much of that in the past twelve hours. I needed a break. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>I\u2019d royally screwed up. Old habits die hard and my need to help Ash and protect her was a very old habit. Last night when Beau had left me with her, asking me to take care of her while he went to get the pain meds, I\u2019d taken one look at her pale face and panicked. I\u2019d needed to be the one to ease her pain. It just flipped a switch in me.</p><p>When Beau had returned and she\u2019d curled up in his arms as he rocked her and soothed her, the reality of the situation washed over me. I\u2019d been a stand-in. She\u2019d not clung to me that way. She never would again. She was Beau\u2019s.</p> <p>Opening the tent and seeing Lana curled up as far away from my sleeping bag as she could get told me all I needed to know. She\u2019d seen what I hadn\u2019t last night until it was too late. Only twenty-four hours before I\u2019d been touching and kissing her body in places that had given us both our first real experience with pleasure. I\u2019d been so tempted to reach for her and pull her against me as she slept but I knew my touch wouldn\u2019t be welcome. I\u2019d been abrupt and rude to her when she\u2019d inquired about Ashton. Looking back, I knew I\u2019d not wanted her to see me taking care of Ashton. I wanted her to go away so she wouldn\u2019t see me treating Ash with a tenderness no one else had ever brought out in me. This was my secret moment with Ash. My step back in time when she\u2019d turned into my arms. Lana being there had caused things in me to stir I didn\u2019t understand. With Lana standing there wide-eyed and hurt it made what was happening wrong. It screwed with my head.</p><p>She\u2019d been gone from the tent when I woke up and she\u2019d ignored me ever since. I didn\u2019t know what to say to her. How did I explain last night? How did I make that better? Since we started our hike this morning she had been leading the group like a woman intent on getting away. I didn\u2019t catch up to her. She\u2019d refused to make eye contact with me over breakfast and I was too much of a chickenshit to force her to acknowledge me.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have stayed back at the campsite with Ash and Beau?\u201d Heidi whined behind me.</p><p>\u201cBecause Ash is recovering from her migraine last night and Beau is taking care of her. Trust me, they want privacy. At least, I know Beau does,\u201d Jake chuckled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sick, Jake. She isn\u2019t going to screw Beau on the hard ground in a tent,\u201d Heidi hissed.</p> <p>\u201cWho said she was gonna be the one on the ground?\u201d Jake replied.</p><p>Listening to talk about Beau and Ash\u2019s sex life wasn\u2019t something I was in the mood for. I quickened my pace until I was only steps behind Lana. The little shorts she was wearing cupped her ass tightly as she took each long stride.</p><p>I\u2019d had my hand on that sweet little bottom just the other night. I was having my doubts that I\u2019d ever get that chance again. The idea bothered me. No, I wasn\u2019t okay with that. I wasn\u2019t ready to let her go. August wasn\u2019t here yet. I wasn\u2019t ready to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ever speak to me again?\u201d I asked. She paused before continuing her uphill trek.</p><p>\u201cSure. What do you want to talk about?\u201d she replied in a bored voice.</p><p>\u201cLana, please slow down and talk to me,\u201d I pleaded.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t slow down. If anything, she picked up her speed. If she kept this up, she was going to have to break into a run.</p><p>\u201cNothing to talk about Sawyer. I\u2019d rather just walk.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out I grabbed her hand and stopped her. She tried snatching it back and I held firm.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d she snarled, finally lifting those bright green eyes to meet mine. The hurt in them made my knees weak. Ah, damn. What the hell had I done?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lana, please talk to me,\u201d I begged, closing the distance between us.</p><p>\u201cKeep walking folks. Nothing to see. Let Sawyer attempt to clean up the mess he\u2019s made,\u201d Jake announced as the others walked past us.</p><p>Once they\u2019d gotten far enough ahead, I let Lana pull her hand free of my grasp.</p><p>\u201cFine. Talk,\u201d she said, crossing her arms protectively over her chest.</p> <p>\u201cLast night...\u201d I began trying to think of how I could explain this to her without making it worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you since you seem to have lost your words. Last night Ashton got sick and you had an excuse to hold her and take care of her. You went into protect-and-comfort-Ashton mode. Nothing or no one else mattered because you love her. She needed you and you were right there for her without question. You wouldn\u2019t let me help her because you couldn\u2019t stand the thought of missing the chance to hold her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Being tuned into helping Ashton is a habit. I\u2019ve been doing it for most of my life. That kind of habit is hard to break.\u201d</p><p>Lana let out a hard laugh, \u201cReally? Well, isn\u2019t that a cute little tidy way to wrap up everything I just said.\u201d Lana took a step toward me, pointed a finger at my chest and jabbed me with it. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being second choice or third choice. I\u2019ve got enough of that in my life. Last night, I needed someone too. I needed someone to listen to me. Too bad no one wants to be Lana\u2019s shoulder to cry on. No one cares that Lana needs someone to give a crap about her.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glistened with unshed tears and my chest got so tight I felt like it was about to crack open.</p><p>\u201cThis is over. Leave it alone. I\u2019m done.\u201d Lana spat, then turned around and began to walk away. Acting quickly, I reached out and wrapped my hand around her arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened last night? Why did you need me?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders heaved and I pulled her back against my chest and held her whether she wanted me to or not.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Sawyer,\u201d her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cNo. Now tell me what you meant by all that.\u201d</p><p>Another sob broke free and she shook her head angrily. \u201cNO. You don\u2019t get to demand answers. I don\u2019t tell people much. I keep my emotions inside. But last night, I wanted to tell you,\u201d she let out a short sad laugh. \u201cI thought I might have someone who wanted to listen. Someone who would care. But I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t. I do care. I want you to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d she growled, pulling against the hold I had on her.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong last night Lana. I\u2019m so sorry. Please forgive me. Please, please forgive me. It\u2019ll never happen again,\u201d I paused, unsure if I was ready to bare my soul to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It won\u2019t happen again. Because I\u2019m done with trying to make people care about me. I shouldn\u2019t have to work so hard to get those that I love to love me back. No one else has to try so damn hard. No one. Just me. Just Lana McDaniel. I\u2019ve had it. If I am so difficult to want then I don\u2019t need anyone. I\u2019ve managed alone this far. I\u2019m a freaking pro!\u201d</p><p>If it was possible for someone else\u2019s pain to break your heart then Lana\u2019s pain had just shattered mine. Emotion burned my throat as I tightened my hold on her. I\u2019d wanted inside her head. She was so closed off and I\u2019d wondered why. Now I knew. She didn\u2019t trust anyone enough to let them in\u2014until last night. She\u2019d decided she could let me in, and what had I done? I\u2019d thrown her trust in her face. God, I was the world\u2019s biggest idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I whispered, pressing a kiss to her temple. \u201cCan you forgive me? Can you trust me to put you first? I swear what happened last night will never happen again. It was the first time I\u2019d had to deal with something like that since the break-up. When Beau came back and Ashton scrambled into his lap and arms with desperation to be near him. It didn\u2019t hurt the way I thought it would. It just slapped some sense into me. She didn\u2019t need me anymore. She wasn\u2019t mine to protect. I could move on. It was time. Last night was a closure I needed.\u201d I stopped and grabbed Lana\u2019s shoulders and turned her around to face me. Her red swollen eyes just about sent me to my knees.</p><p>\u201cThis is new for me. I\u2019m learning how to have a relationship with someone other than Ashton. I made a horrible mistake. It was like a relapse. But you,\u201d I reached up and tucked the tear dampened hair that had worked its way loose behind her ear. \u201cYou touch a place inside of me that Ashton never did. I feel things with you I never felt for her. I loved her for a very long time. I can\u2019t help the fact I still want to be there if she needs me. Next time there is a choice to make it will be you I choose first. I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Lana searched my face as if she was waiting for more. I wasn\u2019t sure what else I could say.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy always being second best. Soon, I\u2019ll be third best with my dad. I keep getting pushed down the list with him. Maybe that makes me selfish but I just need there to be someone who I can run to. Last night I was running to you,\u201d she paused and swallowed. \u201cYou would think after the rejection I\u2019ve been dealt in my life that I\u2019d be used to it. But it doesn\u2019t get easier. Not really. It makes you cautious. It makes you careful not to get your hopes up. I got my hopes up with you. It\u2019ll be hard for me to hand that kind of trust over again. This doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t still see each other this summer. It just means we need to take a few steps back. We sped forward the other night in the tent. Now, we need to back up.\u201d</p><p>She was forgiving me. I could earn her trust again. She\u2019d open up to me again and I\u2019d be ready for it. I would be there when she needed me.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I replied. I slipped a finger under her chin and tilted her head back. \u201cI need to kiss you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered as my lips touched hers.</p><p>Lana</p><p>Beau had the camp packed up and strapped down on top of the Suburban when we arrived back at the campsite. He said Ashton needed to sleep in a decent bed tonight and we were all going to go to a hotel then head home in the morning. No one argued with him. I think we all were ready for a real bed anyway. I almost sighed in relief.</p><p>I told Jake to sit up front with Sawyer and said I\u2019d sit in the back beside Ashton. I just wasn\u2019t ready to spend any more time with Sawyer right now. I\u2019d forgiven him but my heart was still wounded. Ashton had understood and she\u2019d reached down and held my hand as I slid in beside her. It had been a quiet trip.</p><p>We were at the closest affordable hotel and the guys were getting our rooms. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was sharing a room with Sawyer or if I was expected to get my own. I had enough to get my own if I needed to. No reason to save up for my college dreams. My dad had shot that hope down.</p><p>Sitting in the lobby of the hotel, I waited with the other girls. I was still dirty from our day outdoors and I wanted a shower. Not to mention I was exhausted physically and emotionally.</p><p>Sawyer walked toward me with his backpack and mine slung over his shoulders. \u201cYou need to get anything out of that duffle bag you and Ash are sharing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... yeah. I guess. Are we sharing a room?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer looked concerned as he closed the short distance between us. \u201cI thought we were okay. You didn\u2019t sit beside me but I figured you wanted to check on Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I was just wondering. I can get my own room if needed.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer reached out and slipped his hand in mine. I let him thread his fingers through mine. \u201cI want you with me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and forced a smile. He bent down and kissed me on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to fix this. I promise you. You\u2019ll trust me again,\u201d he whispered before straightening back up and leading me toward the elevator.</p><p>We all managed to get rooms on the same floor. Sawyer slipped the key card into the door to room 314 and opened it up. He held out his hand for me to enter first. The room was roomier than most hotels I\u2019d stayed at but then he\u2019d been determined that we were staying at the Marriott instead of the mom and pop motel across the street. A king sized bed sat in the center of everything.</p><p>\u201cOne bed,\u201d I said, glancing back at him.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any doubles available. Is this okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I replied and reached for my backpack still on his shoulder. \u201cCan I take a shower first?\u201d</p><p>He slid it down his arm and handed it to me. \u201cOf course. Take your time. I\u2019ll order us some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I turned to walk into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cLana?\u201d His voice sounded sad. I hated making him sad but I didn\u2019t have the energy to do anything about it. I was drained.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I asked and turned to look back at him. He reminded me of a lost little boy. His perfect face was troubled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing an idiot,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already forgiven you, Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>He looked defeated. \u201cHave you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy forgiving you doesn\u2019t make my heart hurt less. It takes awhile to heal.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for his response. I closed the door behind me and turned on the shower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Sunlight poured in through the window and an arm held me tightly while a leg had me pinned to the bed. Sawyer had snuggled up against my back at some point last night. I\u2019d eaten the cheeseburger he\u2019d ordered me and a few bites of chocolate cake before curling up as far away from his side of the bed as possible and falling asleep instantly. I was still on my side but Sawyer was pressed up against me. He was holding onto me like some sort of lifeline.</p><p>I reached up to move his arm so I could get up and go use the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please, just let me hold you a little bit longer,\u201d he mumbled into my hair.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d I replied</p><p>\u201cMmmmhmmm and I\u2019m enjoying myself. Please, just a little bit longer.\u201d</p><p>I smiled for the first time since the Ashton incident.</p><p>\u201cYou can still enjoy yourself without me,\u201d I teased.</p><p>He froze for a second before snuggling even closer to me and moving his hand so that his palm covered my bare stomach where my tank top had inched up in my sleep.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t enjoy it without you. You\u2019re what I\u2019m enjoying,\u201d he whispered in a deep sleepy voice as he took a small nip at my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I squealed and he chuckled, sending chill bumps over my arms from the warmth of his breath tickling my ear and neck.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d he replied in a more serious tone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to point out I\u2019d been with him for three days. I knew what he meant. Mentally and emotionally, I\u2019d been checked out yesterday. My chest didn\u2019t ache this morning and I could breathe deeply again. Maybe it was the fact Sawyer\u2019s big arms were wrapped around me giving me a false sense of safety.</p><p>\u201cCan I go to the restroom, please?\u201d I asked, tickling his arm with my nails.</p><p>\u201cWill you promise to come back?\u201d</p> <p>I had planned on jumping in the shower again and getting ready. However, as much as I hated to admit it, I\u2019d missed him too.</p><p>\u201cYes, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want,\u201d he murmured in my ear and pressed a soft kiss to my temple.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>\u201cBring the small bottle of mouthwash with you,\u201d I called out when I heard the bathroom door open.</p><p>Lana walked around the bed and handed me the bottle of mouthwash. \u201cHere ya go.\u201d</p><p>I opened it and took a swig. Then swished it around some before swallowing it.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just swallow that!\u201d</p> <p>Grinning, I reached up, grabbed her tiny waist and pulled her down on top of me.</p><p>\u201cI believe I did. I probably need mouth to mouth to save me from the poisoning,\u201d I teased leaning up and taking a nip at her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cMouth to mouth won\u2019t save you from poisoning. You need your stomach pumped,\u201d she informed me as she pressed a kiss to the side of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHmmmm... well that sounds like a lot of work. I\u2019ll think about it later.\u201d I slipped my hands into her messy curls and brought her mouth down to mine. Just as she opened her mouth to let me inside, Lana\u2019s phone started singing.</p><p>She pulled back from the kiss. I needed this kiss. I needed reassurance I hadn\u2019t lost this... whatever it was we had between us. \u201cDon\u2019t answer it,\u201d I begged, reaching up to kiss her chin. Laughing softly she curled back into my arms and let me get a taste of her minty toothpaste flavored mouth. But the minute the ringing stopped it started up again. Lana lifted her head and glanced over at her phone with a frown. I fought the urge to grab the phone and throw it against the wall to shut it up.</p><p>\u201cIt might be an emergency,\u201d she said and I loosened my hold on her and let her crawl off me and check her phone. The tense expression that came over her face had me sitting up and checking to see who was bothering her. Because it obviously wasn\u2019t a welcome call.</p><p>Mom - flashed across the screen.</p><p>Lana slipped out of bed, \u201cI need to take this. She\u2019ll just keep calling until I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello Mom,\u201d her voice sounded tired instead of worried by her mother\u2019s determination to get her on the phone. Lana walked around the bed and headed for the bathroom. Once the door clicked into place, I threw the pillow across the room and muttered a curse. She wouldn\u2019t be shutting me out if I\u2019d been there for her. I was willing to bet she\u2019d been going to tell me what crap her parents were putting her though the other night. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about how to fix it. I\u2019d know what needed to be done.</p><p>\u201cNo MOM!\u201d I heard her raised voice and I jumped out of bed to go listen at the door. I was invading her privacy but she was upset. I had my reasons. It was a damn good reason.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to call him. I don\u2019t want you to ask him. He\u2019s moved on, Mom. He\u2019s getting himself a brand new family now and we are his past. Just let this go. I\u2019ll figure this all out. Just leave it alone. Please.\u201d</p><p>Was she talking about her Dad?</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m an adult. You can\u2019t continue to try to make all my decisions for me. I get to make those now. So please, back off.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from the door and walked over to the window overlooking the mountains we\u2019d left last night. Why did I care so much about finding out her problems? It wasn\u2019t like we were an actual couple. I tensed up as that realization came over me. I had no claim on Lana. If Ethan or anyone else asked her out again, I couldn\u2019t stop her from saying yes. Someone else could touch the soft smooth skin on her arms, her thighs, her stomach, her... oh, hell no. I needed to fix this and fast. This was more than a fling now. Sure, we were going our separate ways in August but right now, I didn\u2019t want to share. I wouldn\u2019t be able to share. I was pretty damn sure I\u2019d rip another guy\u2019s arms off his body if I saw him touch her.</p><p>The bathroom door opened and Lana stepped out. A forced smile touched her lips as her eyes met mine.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I asked, hoping to God that she\u2019d tell me what was going on in her life.</p><p>Instead, she only shrugged. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cLana, listen, we need to talk about something,\u201d I began walking across the room so I could touch her in case I needed to beg.</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cIf this is bad news I really don\u2019t think I can handle that right now. Give me a few hours first, please.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell, if the pain in her voice didn\u2019t rip me in two. I pulled her against my chest and held her there. She was stiff as a board at first but I continued to rub her back and kiss the top of her head until she relaxed and wrapped her arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t bad. But it is time sensitive,\u201d I explained.</p><p>She tilted her head to look at me, \u201cTime sensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. As in someone could lose a limb if they stepped out of line.\u201d</p><p>Lana pulled back and the frown puckering her brow was adorable.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world are you talking about, Sawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact I want... no, I need, for us to be exclusive until we part ways when we head off to college.\u201d</p><p>Lana made a small \u2018o\u2019 with her mouth and then she nodded slowly, \u201cOkay. That sounds like a good plan. But why would someone lose a limb?\u201d</p><p>I traced her bottom lip with my finger, \u201cBecause if they touched you, I\u2019d have to rip off the offending limb.\u201d</p><p>A small bubble of laughter escaped her and then she bit down on my finger. Her eyes smiled up at me like a playful kitten.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want to play rough, do you?\u201d I picked her up and threw her down on the bed before covering her body with mine.</p><p>Lana</p><p>The ride back to Grove went fast but then I\u2019d slept most of the way. Jake had not been happy when Sawyer informed him that I was sitting up front. I felt bad about it but I liked knowing Sawyer wanted me close to him.</p><p>Everyone had loaded their gear into their cars and left. Ashton had even gone inside to go to bed. She was still pretty weak. Sawyer took my bags and put them inside the door of the house, then looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cCome with me for awhile,\u201d he said, pulling me back outside onto the porch and closing the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t tired from all that driving?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and pulled me up against him. My aunt and uncle weren\u2019t home but they could drive up at any minute. I wasn\u2019t sure what they\u2019d think of this.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let me go check on Ash and I\u2019ll be right back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here,\u201d he replied, letting go of my hand so I could run back inside.</p><p>I knocked softly on Ashton\u2019s door then peeked my head inside. She was already curled up under the covers. Closing her door softly, I headed back to Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cShe okay?\u201d he asked as I stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He rested his hand on my lower back and led me toward the Suburban. \u201cFirst things first, I\u2019ve got to go get my truck from the house. I want you to be able to sit close enough to me so that I can touch you if I want to.\u201d</p><p>Smiling to myself, I climbed inside.</p><p>I\u2019d been to Sawyer\u2019s house with Ashton before. We were younger and I never went inside. We mostly just swam in the lake back behind his property. Walking in the front door with my hand clasped firmly in his was a little nerve-wracking. His parents weren\u2019t home and he\u2019d convinced me to come inside.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he motioned for me to go ahead of him down a staircase leading to what looked like the basement.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we going down here?\u201d I asked, peering back at him over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThis is my cave. Go on,\u201d he encouraged me.</p><p>His cave... hmmm. I walked the rest of the way down the stairs and stopped at the bottom unsure which door to open. There were two. One on my right and one on my left. Sawyer reached over me and twisted the knob on the right door then reached in and flipped a switch. The lights came on and I stood there in wonder as I took in the room.</p><p>It was huge. Two large black leather sectional sofas sat in the middle of the room in front of a massive flat screen television that hung on the wall. A crimson refrigerator with the University of Alabama\u2019s logo on the outside sat against the left side of the room and a black marble countertop, complete with a sink, sat off to the left of the fridge. On the other wall, shelves and shelves full of trophies stretched from floor to ceiling. Framed football jerseys stood among the trophies. Under the television sat a long black narrow table complete with an Xbox and a Wii. Photos also cluttered the surface. All of them carefully framed. Sawyer\u2019s mother had to have done that. I couldn\u2019t imagine him actually framing photos to sit out.</p><p>\u201cYou thirsty?\u201d he asked, walking over to the fridge and opening it. \u201cLooks like Loretta came this week. It\u2019s stocked. Coke, Mountain Dew, blue Gatorade, or bottled water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoretta?\u201d I asked confused.</p><p>\u201cThe housekeeper. She does all the grocery shopping too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d People actually had housekeepers that did their grocery shopping? How odd.</p><p>\u201cUm, water is fine.\u201d I walked over to the shelves and began reading the plaques on the trophies. MVP seemed to be the most popular award he had received.</p><p>\u201cHere ya go,\u201d he handed me a water and turned his attention to the shelves. \u201cMom did all this. She wanted somewhere for all of this to be displayed. She actually tried to turn one of the guest bedrooms into a \u201cSawyer Shrine\u201d or so my father called it. He refused to let her and suggested she stick them down here. I agreed with him just so they would be somewhat hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of them,\u201d I replied, taking a sip of the water.</p><p>\u201cYeah, there is.\u201d He nodded his head toward the couch, \u201cCome sit down with me. We can find us a movie to rent off iTunes.\u201d</p><p>I followed him to the end of one of the leather sectionals. He set his Gatorade down, reached up, took my water and set it down beside his. \u201cCome here,\u201d his voice dropped to that husky whisper that made my heart speed up. I let him pull me down onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this mouth all day,\u201d he confided before covering my lips with his. I licked at his bottom lip and he opened for me letting me leisurely taste him. The gentle pressure of his mouth was perfect and made me a little dizzy.</p><p>His hands slid up my thighs until both hands were cupping my butt. One of his fingers traced the edge of my panties. \u201cI really like this skirt,\u201d he murmured against my lips. I really liked it too at the moment. My breath was coming in short little gasps as he slid one hand inside the edge of my panties and my bare butt was being caressed by one hand while his other hand slipped slowly back down my thigh while shifting closer to my inner thigh. I knew what his next move would be. What I didn\u2019t know was if I was going to let it go that far.</p><p>Then he moaned into my mouth as his fingers touched the inside of my thigh and my leg fell open of its own accord. The slow easy kiss became frenzied as we both fought to calm our breathing. His hand inched higher and higher up my now exposed thigh. The second his finger grazed the outside of my panties, I jerked in his hold and something very close to pleading squeaked in my throat. Sawyer pulled back and his accelerated breathing made me tingle with pleasure. I loved knowing I did this to him.</p><p>He kissed down my neck until he met the curve of my shoulder. He went very still. His warm breath bathed my chest and neck. His hand slowly moved again. One lone finger slipped inside the edge of my panties and made direct contact. He murmured something against my neck but I couldn\u2019t focus enough to understand. My brain was in a foggy haze and my heart was about to pound out of my chest. The urge to move against the hand that now cupped the crotch of my panties was strong. But I waited while he eased his finger further inside and gently ran it along the folds.</p><p>\u201cOhohohmygod,\u201d I managed to get out in a breathless chant.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so warm,\u201d he whispered in a strained voice as he began kissing the spot where he had buried his head in my neck.</p><p>When he slipped his other hand over my leg and pulled it further open before reaching down and pulling my panties to the side as he gently stroked me, I started to come apart in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d he encouraged as I clung to him calling his name and wanting it to never end.</p><p>When I could finally catch my breath, his fingers left me and pulled my panties back into place; then I was being cuddled in his arms while he whispered things against my neck between kisses and little nibbles.</p><p>Sawyer finally lifted his head from the now tender skin along my neck where he\u2019d loved thoroughly. \u201cThat was... that was... damn,\u201d he whispered before claiming my mouth for another kiss. After a long leisurely kiss, Sawyer lay down on the couch and tucked me back against him. \u201cLet\u2019s watch that movie now,\u201d he said in a teasing voice.</p><p>The minute Ashton pulled her Jetta into the clearing down by the Vincent\u2019s lake, Sawyer came jogging toward us. His hair was slicked back and wet with droplets of water flying off the thick locks. The navy blue swim trunks he was wearing hung on his waist and showcased his delicious abs and hip bones.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure he isn\u2019t running out here to see me,\u201d Ashton quipped as I sat there staring at him in awe.</p><p>Snapping myself out of my worshipful gaze, I opened the car door and stepped out. Sawyer was beside me instantly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever get here,\u201d he said in a pleased voice as his cold wet hand clasped mine and pulled me up against his chest. He was getting my dry clothes damp but I wasn\u2019t going to complain.</p><p>\u201cSorry, we overslept,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize to him. He was the one who kept you out late,\u201d Ashton teased and headed off in the direction of Beau as he made his way toward her.</p><p>\u201cI had a good time last night,\u201d Sawyer informed me in a husky whisper.</p><p>We\u2019d gone to get something to eat at Hank\u2019s then we\u2019d gone out to the field. There was no party last night. Sawyer took advantage of the location and brought a large blanket for us and we lay on our backs under the stars. I pointed out different constellations and he tried to get his hands under different parts of my clothing while pretending to listen to me. It had been perfect.</p><p>\u201cI did too,\u201d I replied, smiling up at him.</p><p>He lowered his head to kiss me softly then whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go see if I can\u2019t teach you how to do a flip off that rope swing.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I stifled a giggle. \u201cNo way. You tried that once and I ended up with ten stitches in my head.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer rubbed his hand gently over the back of my head where I\u2019d sliced it open on a rock when I\u2019d panicked at ten years old. When Sawyer had said, \u201cLet go of the rope, NOW\u201d it had taken me a few seconds to obey. Those few seconds were the difference between me landing in the deep water and me landing on the edge of the shore. I never tried that swing again.</p><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t let you get hurt this time. Besides, I was like ten. I sucked at teaching people things. I\u2019m so much better now.\u201d He squeezed my hand and brought it to his lips before leading me out toward the lake.</p><p>Laughter and squealing traveled across the water loud and clear. At least twenty or so people were already here. This was supposed to be the last party at the lake before everyone went off to college. I\u2019d never been down here with more than just Sawyer, Ashton and Beau. Girls were lying out on the pier, guys were climbing the tree in order to do dangerous tricks off the rope swing and not one person had a beer in their hands. It was a miracle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not going to go on that rope with me? I\u2019ll hold the rope; you hold me and no flips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise no flips?\u201d I asked him, watching his face for any sign of a fib.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d he assured me reaching for the hem of my shirt and pulling it off.</p><p>He stopped and held it in his hand staring at the bikini I\u2019d only bought because Jewel begged me to. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d normally wear but I figured if I was coming to Sawyer Vincent\u2019s lake party as his date I needed to be able to keep his attention even with the other bikini-clad girls running around. Especially Ashton. When I\u2019d seen the red bikini she\u2019d laid out to wear, I knew I had to step-up my game.</p><p>\u201cUh, would you consider putting this shirt back on?\u201d he asked me as he started to put it back over my head.</p><p>I reached up and stopped him, \u201cNo, Sawyer, stop.\u201d</p><p>He stepped in closer and frowned down at me, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot to this swimsuit, Lana.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around and took note of all the other swimsuits girls were wearing. Mine was not even one of the skimpiest ones. Turning my attention back to him, I took the shirt out of his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a bikini, Sawyer. If you look around you\u2019ll notice a lot of them. We girls tend to wear them when we swim.\u201d My voice dripped with sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, Lana, but I don\u2019t like the idea of everyone seeing so much of you. This thing barely covers up your boobs. I\u2019m scared even to see how much of your sexy ass it shows off.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He was jealous.</p><p>\u201cMy bottom is covered.\u201d I turned around and shimmied out of my cut-off blue jean shorts with my butt facing in his direction.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d he groaned and reached out and pulled me back toward him. \u201cCould you at least not do that little booty shaking thing with little pieces of fabric being your only cover?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it, I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d he whispered, resting his hands on my waist.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d I replied, turning around to press a kiss on his pouty lips. He really was very unhappy about this bikini. \u201cCome on, I thought we were going to do the rope swing.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea. One of those tiny strips of material may fall off on impact.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I reached for his hand and pulled him toward the tree, \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous, Sawyer. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Muttering under his breath, he followed me to the tree. He went up behind me with his hands on my bottom. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was helping me up or trying to cover me up. Either way, it was cute.</p><p>Once we made our way out onto the limb and a guy I didn\u2019t know threw the rope back toward Sawyer, I realized I may have spoken too soon. This was terrifying from up here.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down,\u201d Sawyer directed as he held onto my waist and moved in front of me so he could grab the rope. He squatted down, \u201cSteady yourself by holding onto my shoulders then wrap your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>I studied his back and wondered if it would be that big of a deal if I just went back down the tree the dry way.</p><p>Sawyer glanced back at me. \u201cCome on, Lana. I got this. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure about the \u201cfine\u201d part but I gave in and did as instructed.</p><p>Sawyer stood up and I wrapped my arms around his neck and closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cTake one of your arms and put it under my arm. If you do it this way you\u2019re going to choke me to death,\u201d he informed me with an amused tone.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that. I guess that might be a bad idea. I gripped his shoulder tightly with one hand while sliding the other one under his arm. I stretched both arms until I could clench my hands, tightening my hold on Sawyer\u2019s body</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Now hold on baby, \u2018cause here we go,\u201d and we were airborne on his last word.</p><p>I opened my eyes just in time to see him let go of the rope and closed them back again, squealing as we plummeted toward the water.</p><p>The lake water wasn\u2019t as cold as I\u2019d expected when we dropped down into it. I was extremely grateful. I released Sawyer and kicked my legs, pushing my way back toward the surface. It was then that I noticed my bottoms had slipped down underneath my butt. Reaching down and tugging them up, I was glad Sawyer wouldn\u2019t know he\u2019d been partially right about my swimsuit coming off during impact.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s head emerged a few seconds after mine and he was grinning like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked</p><p>He winked and reached over and pulled me up against him. \u201cI can see real good under this water,\u201d he murmured and understanding dawned on me.</p><p>I slapped him on the arm and he laughed then dropped a quick kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cWanna go again?\u201d he asked with a smirk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>After a week of dates with Lana\u2014either at my house, at the field party, or at Hank\u2019s it was time I took her somewhere nice. She never complained and was open to anything I suggested. Even the other day when I\u2019d asked if she\u2019d wanted to go with me to pick out stuff for my dorm room she\u2019d gone with me happily. Granted, I had to rein her in on her decorating ideas. I was a guy and our curtains and quilts didn\u2019t need to match. I just needed something dark enough to block out the sun on mornings I might actually get to sleep in.</p><p>Today, I\u2019d decided to surprise her with a trip to New Orleans. It was a two-hour drive from Grove. The only info I\u2019d given her was that she needed to wear a sundress and comfortable shoes. The restaurant I was taking her to that night was too nice for shorts and required a little bit of a dressier look. We\u2019d be doing a good amount of walking the streets too. As much as I loved her legs in heels, I didn\u2019t figure she\u2019d thank me for not warning her about the walking.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t think of a time I\u2019d been this anxious to see someone. She\u2019d fallen asleep in my arms last night and I\u2019d had to sneak out the window in Ashton\u2019s room that Beau had used many times when we were kids.</p><p>I pressed the button on the garage door opener and started to back out when my eyes landed on Ashton standing in front of her Jetta, directly behind me. Opening my truck door, I stepped out and walked out to where she was standing.</p><p>Tears were streaming down her face and her shoulders were shaking with loud sobs. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cAsh, what\u2019s wrong? Is Lana okay?\u201d My heart constricted. Why else would Ash be in my driveway crying like someone was dead? God, please tell me Lana was okay. I\u2019d just left her in her bed a few hours ago. She\u2019d been fine.</p><p>\u201cAsh, tell me what\u2019s wrong now.\u201d I felt my throat tighten up and I resisted the urge to grab her shoulders and shake her. I needed her to speak.</p> <p>\u201cLana is fine,\u201d she sobbed and I took a deep gulp of air as my panic eased off. This wasn\u2019t about Lana. I could calm down.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Beau\u2014he... he,\u201d she burst into tears again.</p><p>\u201cIs Beau okay?\u201d I asked and she shoved Beau\u2019s cell phone into my hands.</p><p>\u201cJust read that text,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>Read what text? Shaking my head, I looked down at Beau\u2019s phone. The text that had Ashton all upset was already opened on the screen.</p> <p>Sugar: Hey sexy. I had a blast dancing with you last week. And you owe me one more game of pool. That was an unfair game and you know it. You distracted me. So you find another night away from that ball and chain of yours and get your gorgeous ass back to the bar next weekend when I\u2019m back in town XOXO.</p><p>I lifted my eyes to meet Ashton\u2019s red swollen ones and all I could think about was exactly how I was going to murder my brother.</p><p>Lana</p><p>Sawyer: I can\u2019t make it. Not sure if you\u2019ve talked to Ash but Beau cheated on her and she needs me. I\u2019ve got to go beat his sorry ass and then see what I can do to calm her down. She was outside on my driveway this morning bawling her eyes out.</p><p>I reread the text message from Sawyer for the third time before I finally put my phone down. I don\u2019t know what surprised me more: Beau cheating on Ash or Sawyer dropping me to fix her problems. He could have at least called me. Maybe asked for my help with Ash. He\u2019d done neither. Because this was what he\u2019d been waiting on. All this time, I was just a fill-in while he waited. Beau served Ashton up to him on a silver platter and I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think I stood a chance of holding onto him. He loved her. He just liked me. I was the summer fling. She was the girl he wanted to spend forever with.</p><p>Picking my phone back up, I found Jewel\u2019s number and pressed send.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you called me. How\u2019s it going with Mr. Hot and Sexy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. I need to leave. Can I come there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, oh. That doesn\u2019t sound good. Of course, you can come here. Do I need to come get you? Because it could be like tonight before I get there. I have plans with this fabulously hot lifeguard. He has the best ass I\u2019ve ever seen. His hair is a little long but I can overlook that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll get a ride. I\u2019ll see you in a few hours. Thanks Jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problemo, chica. See ya soon.\u201d</p><p>I hung up the phone and dialed one more number.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the cautious tone in Ethan\u2019s voice told me he knew who was calling.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ethan, it\u2019s Lana and I have a huge favor to ask you but I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, okay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a ride to the beach.\u201d</p><p>Ethan pulled into the parking lot at the condos where Jewel was staying. Her car was parked over to the left side of the building so I knew I\u2019d found the right place.</p><p>\u201cI know you said you didn\u2019t want to talk about it but I need to know something, Lana. Sawyer is going to lose it when he finds out you\u2019re gone and he\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>Cringing at the predicament I\u2019d put Ethan in I reached into my purse and pulled out five twenty dollar bills and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money. Just some kind of explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau and Ash are no longer and Sawyer is busy comforting her and helping her nurse her broken heart. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>Ethan frowned, \u201cAre you sure about that? I can\u2019t think of any female that could ever turn Beau Vincent\u2019s head from Ash. He\u2019s been in love with her since we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, believe it. Guess he got his fill and moved on. Luckily, she has the other Vincent boy in love with her to pick up the pieces. If she is smart, she\u2019ll grab hold of Sawyer and not let go. His love for her is unbreakable and unconditional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you and Sawyer at the field and out in town. He seemed completely over Ash to me. He watched you with such a predatory gleam in his eyes; I was scared to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>My heart broke a little more and I forced the pain away. I would not do this. Sawyer Vincent would not break me. I was stronger than this. \u201cWell, looks can be deceiving. I don\u2019t want to talk about this, Ethan. Please, just take the money so I don\u2019t have to feel guilty about asking you to drive me all the way out here after how things went down with you and me. I hate I was so blinded by Sawyer that I didn\u2019t give you a chance. I learned a lesson.\u201d</p><p>Ethan took the money I was thrusting at him. \u201cI\u2019ll accept it if that\u2019s what is going to make you feel better but I don\u2019t want to take the money.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and pressed a kiss to his cheek. \u201cThank you for being there for me when I needed someone. You have no idea how rare that is for me.\u201d</p><p>I reached for the door handle and jumped down out of his Jeep. Reaching into the back, I started to grab my luggage when Ethan reached over me and picked up both suitcases. \u201cI got it,\u201d he said before turning and heading for the condos.</p><p>\u201cWhich floor?\u201d he asked as he stopped beside the elevators.</p><p>I followed behind him carrying my cosmetics and toiletries bag. \u201cBottom, that one right there,\u201d I pointed to unit 103 just as the door swung open and Jewel stepped outside squealing. \u201cYou\u2019re here, you\u2019re here! Oh, and you brought one of the cuties from Wings with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again, Jewel,\u201d Ethan said politely setting my luggage down outside the door and stepping back to let me pass.</p><p>\u201cYou too, uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan. His name is Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she snapped her fingers like it had been on the tip of her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ethan, you want to come inside? We\u2019re having a party tonight. You\u2019re welcome to stay and crash.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced from Jewel to me and then shook his head, \u201cNah, I need to head out. I have plans tonight but thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww, phooey,\u201d Jewel pouted. It was so obviously fake; I wasn\u2019t sure why she attempted it. Unless of course she thought it looked believable.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, Lana,\u201d Ethan said with a concerned expression.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Ethan. Thanks again.\u201d He nodded and headed back toward his Jeep.</p><p>Once he was in his Jeep and pulled out of the parking lot, Jewel grabbed my arm and tugged on it, \u201cCome inside. Tell me all about Grove while I fix myself a sandwich.\u201d</p><p>I picked up my luggage and carried it inside. \u201cWhich room do you want me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown the hall, it\u2019s the third door on the left. You have the best view of the ocean from that room. Don\u2019t lie on the bed yet. We need to strip that bed and wash the quilt and sheets. God only knows who\u2019s used that room during one of our parties.\u201d</p><p>Cringing, I made a mental note to go buy some Clorox spray and wipe the place down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Banging on the door to Beau\u2019s trailer I mentally cursed him. He\u2019d had to have Ashton so damn bad he snatched her away from me and for what? He\u2019d lost her within seven months. How stupid could one man be?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell Sawyer?\u201d Beau demanded as he opened the door glaring at me as if he had reason to be mad.</p> <p>I shoved past him and slammed his phone down on the beat-up coffee table where I\u2019d once sat and played Go Fish at two o\u2019clock in the morning with Beau while waiting on his mom to get home from work.</p><p>\u201cYou better have a real good reason for this Saw,\u201d he growled, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cAsh had your phone,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Beau looked down at his cell phone on the table and back to me. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>The lack of concern was my first hint that we had a big misunderstanding on our hands.</p> <p>\u201cYou got a text... from a girl,\u201d I continued and waited for him to look worried or guilty or something.</p><p>He continued to look confused. The innocence of his lost expression told me all I needed to know. Beau hadn\u2019t cheated on Ash. Thank God. Maybe it wasn\u2019t too late for Lana and me to get to New Orleans today after all.</p><p>I picked up the phone and handed it to him, \u201cRead the text from Sugar.\u201d</p><p>Then as if a light went off Beau\u2019s eyes widened and my moment of relief was replaced by disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSugar texted me? And Ash read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you stupid asswipe. Haven\u2019t you learned by now that when you CHEAT you get CAUGHT! Dammit, Beau, how could you do this? She loves you. She\u2019s a complete mess. I found her on my carport bawling her eyes out this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Beau\u2019s face went pale and he grabbed a pair of discarded jeans, jerked them on and turned to run out the door.</p><p>I followed him, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she Saw? Where\u2019s Ash?\u201d he yelled as he ran to his truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you where she is. You\u2019ve destroyed her Beau.\u201d</p><p>Beau stopped and stalked back toward me with an angry snarl on his face. \u201cSugar is my fucking AUNT. My mother\u2019s baby sister. Now tell me where my girl is before I beat the shit out of you.\u201d His voice had gone from a cold menace to a roar.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you have an aunt named Sugar? Aunt Honey\u2019s younger sister\u2019s name is Janet,\u201d I yelled back. Not sure what he was trying to do here. I was his brother for crying-out-loud. I knew his family tree.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well my mama\u2019s name is Paula, but that ain\u2019t the name she goes by, now is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet goes by Sugar?\u201d I asked with relief.</p> <p>\u201cYES! Now where the hell is my girl?\u201d</p><p>I was pretty sure we\u2019d woken up the entire trailer park.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at home. Go,\u201d I replied and Beau turned and ran to his truck. It roared to life and he spun out of the driveway. I just hoped he didn\u2019t run over anyone on his way to her house because I was willing to bet he wasn\u2019t going to stop if he did.</p><p>Sinking down onto the steps, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and texted Ash.</p><p>Me: It isn\u2019t what it looks like. Beau is on his way over. Listen to him. Just so happens Aunt Honey has a younger sister, her name is Sugar. Tell Lana to get ready I\u2019m on my way there to get her.</p><p>Ashton: Oh no. I made a mess of things. I\u2019m so sorry Sawyer.</p><p>Me: Not that big of a deal. It got straightened out pretty fast. Watch for Beau. He sped out of here for your house like there was a fire.</p><p>Ashton: Okay</p><p>I decided against sending Lana a text. I had a feeling I was probably in trouble because of the last text I\u2019d sent. It didn\u2019t explain things well but I was in a hurry to find Beau and get Ashton calmed down. Showing up and explaining was the best idea.</p><p>Beau met me at the door of Ashton\u2019s house when I got there. The serious expression on his face surprised me. Surely, he\u2019d been able to clear things up with Ashton. Didn\u2019t she believe him? \u201cHey, things okay?\u201d I asked, walking up the steps.</p><p>\u201cThat depends on you,\u201d Beau replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh is upset but not with me. She\u2019s upset with herself. Running to you when she thought I\u2019d cheated on her was her first reaction. It has always been the three of us. She didn\u2019t think about going to anyone else. She just figured you would know how to fix it. You always did fix the messes we managed to get into. I\u2019m warning you now that if you so much as blame, raise your voice or even look at her wrong when you walk in that house and hear what she has to tell you, that I will take you down. She got upset. She acted on instinct. What happened as a repercussion isn\u2019t her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell are you getting at Beau?\u201d I asked, starting to feel anxious as I pushed past him and into the house. Ashton was standing in the kitchen with swollen red eyes and chewing on her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the two of you?\u201d I asked in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m just here for Lana. Whatever other problems y\u2019all have, I\u2019m out. Fix them yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhnoohnoohno,\u201d Ashton started muttering. Her worried eyes lifted to look at Beau for help.</p><p>\u201cJust give it to him, Ash,\u201d Beau encouraged gently.</p><p>\u201cGive me what?\u201d I demanded. Then my eyes noticed the piece of paper dangling from her right hand.</p><p>I walked over to her and snatched the paper out of her grasp. Perfectly scripted handwriting covered the page in what appeared to be a letter. Dropping my eyes to the bottom of the page Lana\u2019s signature stood out at me and my heart stopped beating. Nononononono, please God no, I begged silently as I began reading.</p><p>Ashton,</p><p>Let me begin by saying, thank you. I needed an escape this summer from the craziness that is my life. You helped make that possible. I needed to talk about my dad and how I felt and you were there for me. No one has ever been there for me before. Knowing someone cared was more precious to me than you could have ever imagined.</p><p>But, I made the mistake of opening my heart up to someone who clearly could never feel the same about me. I knew Sawyer loved you. I\u2019ve known it since we were kids. I thought maybe just getting his attention for a short time would be enough. It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019ve grown up with two parents who never once thought about me in the choices they made. My emotions weren\u2019t something they concerned themselves with and maybe that is my fault because I didn\u2019t speak up. I just pushed the hurt and anger deep inside me. I wanted to be strong because I knew they were weak. I\u2019m tired of being strong. I\u2019m tired of being second best. I need someone to love me.</p><p>Staying in Grove isn\u2019t a possible option for me. I let myself hope for too much. I\u2019ve been broken too many times. I can\u2019t stay somewhere near... someone who will eventually destroy me.</p><p>Please tell your parents thank you for me. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stick around for goodbyes and explanations but I think you understand why I had to go. You had the right Vincent boy all along. Don\u2019t take him for granted this time. He loves you in a way that I hope to one day inspire in someone. He would give up the world for you. When you have someone that special, that incredible who loves you, don\u2019t let it go. This is your second chance to treasure what you\u2019ve had all your life. Sawyer was always the Vincent boy worth fighting for. He\u2019s the special one.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t say where she went? Did she go home? How did she get there?\u201d I was going to throw up. Tears stung my eyes and I swallowed the lump in my throat. I didn\u2019t have time to cry like a damn baby. I needed to find Lana, NOW.</p><p>Folding the paper neatly, I stuck it in my pocket and pulled out my phone.</p><p>Her phone went straight to voice mail. Shit.</p><p>\u201cDid you try calling her? Have you called her mom?\u201d I asked Ashton while trying her number again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t raise your voice at her. I know you\u2019re upset but remember my warning. And for the record you\u2019re not all that damn special. Just throwing that out there.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about Beau\u2019s warning. I needed to find Lana. \u201cI\u2019m not raising my voice. I need to find Lana,\u201d I yelled, glaring at him as I slammed my fist against the brick fireplace. The pain wasn\u2019t enough to numb the agony in my chest.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, stop! You\u2019re bleeding. Beau, do something,\u201d Ashton\u2019s worried voice sounded like it was coming down a tunnel.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS SHE?\u201d I roared, beating my fist against the wall trying to stop the tears blurring my vision. I had to find her. She needed me. Oh God, she needed me.</p><p>Pressing both my palms flat against the brick, I dropped my head and let the tears roll freely. I\u2019d lost her. I couldn\u2019t lose her. She was so broken and I didn\u2019t even know. I wanted to find her dumbass father and beat his face in until the ache inside me, from her words in that letter, eased. How could they overlook her? How could anyone overlook her?</p><p>\u201cSawyer, we\u2019ll find her,\u201d Ashton said as a small choked up sob escaped her. \u201cBeau, he\u2019s crying. I can\u2019t stand this. Do something,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give us a minute, Ash?\u201d Beau replied.</p><p>I heard Beau whisper to Ashton and kiss her before her footsteps faded down the hall.</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019ve got to get a fucking grip. You\u2019re losing it and that shit ain\u2019t gonna help nothing. Plus you\u2019ve got Ash in tears.\u201d</p><p>He had no right to tell me how to handle this. I\u2019d lost her trying to help him.</p><p>I pushed myself off the wall and walked away while I wiped the proof of my breakdown from my face.</p><p>\u201cLook, bro, I get it. You love her. I know that feeling real well. But crying like a fucking pussy ain\u2019t gonna do one bit of good. We have to find her. It takes big boys to do that. Think you can dry up the well and help me think this through?\u201d</p><p>I froze and dropped my hands to my sides. What had he just said?</p><p>Turning around I stared at him, \u201cDid you just say, \u2018I love her\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Beau rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned against the doorframe. \u201cReally Saw? You gotta ask me that?\u201d He shook his head as if I were the biggest idiot on the planet. \u201cLet me ask you something. When you lost Ash... did you cry? I know we beat each other up and you did a lot of yelling. But did you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded, \u201cDid you want to? Or were you just mad as hell?\u201d I thought back to those weeks after our breakup. I didn\u2019t remember fighting back tears. Not once.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. \u2018Cause although you loved Ash, she wasn\u2019t the one. When you fall for the one that owns you, she\u2019ll be the only one that has the power to make you cry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Lana</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you where I am, Mom,\u201d I repeated for the fifth time.</p><p>\u201cLana Grace McDaniel! You are only eighteen years old. It\u2019s dangerous for you to travel alone. I am your mother! I need to know where you are. Come home. Just, wherever you are, come home. Ashton has called three times and that Sawyer\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hear it. I don\u2019t care. Just please, Mom, if you want to talk to me don\u2019t bring him and Ashton up, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will hang up this phone and turn it off. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>I heard my mother\u2019s sharp intake of breath. I\u2019d never spoken to her like that before but I was tired of it. She never listened to me. She tried to control me. No longer. I was eighteen years old but I felt so much older. I always had.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cNow, if there is nothing else you\u2019d like to say, I need to go. I\u2019ll call you again soon. Trust me when I tell you I am completely safe. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is about your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, it isn\u2019t about him. Not anymore. My decisions are about me. From here on out what I do won\u2019t take into account what you or Daddy do or say.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s silence was so rare I wondered if she\u2019d hung up on me. That would definitely be a first. Then, I heard a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Lana. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t know it. Not really. I wasn\u2019t sure Mom understood the concept of loving someone else more than herself.</p><p>\u201cSure, Mom. Love you too,\u201d I finally said. I\u2019d done enough as far as honesty went for one conversation. I did love her and I wasn\u2019t sure she could take any more of the truth.</p><p>Pressing end, I went ahead and turned off my phone before dropping it in my largest piece of luggage. Not that I thought my mom was smart enough to trace me or anything. I wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d even think about that method of finding me. I figured if I kept it off, unless I was checking in, then I was safe. Maybe I should buy one of those disposable cell phones and use it for calls from now on. I remembered an episode of CSI where that method worked.</p><p>Shaking my head at my own scheming to keep hidden from my mom, I walked over to stand in front of the large window centered in the left wall. Jewel hadn\u2019t been kidding about the view. I could see the pool to my left since we were on the bottom floor but straight ahead was nothing except white sandy beach and the Gulf of Mexico. I could stay here the rest of the summer. Figure things out. Heal. Then go back to Alpharetta and face my future. Maybe I could get a job or two that paid well. Save up for two years and then go to the University of Georgia. Not my first choice but it was better than staying at home and going to the community college. It would be more affordable to go to the state college than go off to Florida. Grimacing at my stupidity, I thought about all the things I\u2019d sold on eBay once I heard the news Sawyer had signed with Florida. I figured, if I could save up enough money, my dad would help me. I\u2019d applied, gotten accepted, and used the small scholarship I\u2019d received from the local ladies\u2019 club my mother was a part of to pay for my registration. I still needed so much more.</p><p>Not that it mattered. I\u2019d have never been able to go through with it now. Maybe it was fate\u2019s way of stepping in and fixing my stupid planning. It wasn\u2019t meant for me to be at the University of Florida. I wasn\u2019t meant to be with Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cHey, chica stop staring out at the gorgeous beach with that sad face and get your hot little pink bikini on and come soak up some sun with me.\u201d</p><p>I turned around to see Jewel standing in the doorway. Her long blonde hair was pulled up in a high ponytail and she was wearing a lime green string bikini that made her tan seem even darker.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your date? And what happened to you and Heath? I thought he was spending the summer here with you.\u201d When she\u2019d told me about her date with the lifeguard, I\u2019d been so focused on breathing through my broken heart that I hadn\u2019t processed her comment.</p><p>She waved a hand as if batting away a fly, \u201cHe caught me with this beach volleyball guy that, like, plays on a pro-team. So hot, Lana, I mean so hot. And soooo worth it. Heath flipped his lid and left. It was for the best. We had just about squeezed all the good out of that relationship. Time to move on.\u201d</p><p>That was Jewel for you. She could jump from one guy to the next and never look back. Any guy who went into an exclusive relationship with her was just asking for trouble. Jewel couldn\u2019t do it. However, she could be a friend. Maybe not the best one in the world but she\u2019d been the only one I\u2019d ever really had. Right now, she was a lifesaver.</p><p>\u201cLet me get changed and I\u2019ll meet you out there in a few minutes,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She nodded and turned to walk away when I thought about my mom.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jewel,\u201d I called out.</p><p>She turned back to look at me with that carefree expression she always wore like a crown. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell my mom or dad I\u2019m here if they call, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jewel nodded, \u201cNo worries. I\u2019d want to hide from those two if they were my \u2018rents too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ashton, if she calls... I don\u2019t want her to know either.\u201d</p><p>Jewel\u2019s eyes went wide in surprise, \u201cWow, really? What\u2019d the ever perfect cousin you love so much do? I can so, go pull her pretty blonde hair if I need to. She\u2019s a little too prissy perfect for my taste anyway.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I couldn\u2019t help but smile. Yep, Jewel might hit on the guy you like and dress slutty for confession in hopes of tempting the priest but she\u2019d have your back in a fight if the chance ever arose. \u201cAshton did nothing to me. Still love her, just need some distance from Grove right now and everyone in it.\u201d</p><p>Jewel puckered her lips as if wanting to ask more and trying to keep from it then finally nodded, \u201cGot it. Don\u2019t tell one fucking soul that inquires about you that I\u2019ve seen you. Done. Now get your perky ass in a bikini and slather on some sunblock because God knows you don\u2019t need any more freckles.\u201d</p><p>Not being able to use my phone sucked. I needed something to read while I lay on the beach. My phone had my Kindle app on it. I didn\u2019t have an actual book with me and all Jewel had were magazines that I wasn\u2019t in the mood to read. I already knew those \u201cHow To\u201d articles did not work. I\u2019d tried most of them.</p><p>Lana waved happily when she glanced up at me through her hot pink aviator sunglasses. She had a great setup out here. Two lounge chairs and large beach umbrella already tilted to shade the entire empty chair. She was bathed in the sun\u2019s rays with a magazine in her lap and a large hurricane glass in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou look smoking, Lana banana,\u201d she called out then whistled.</p><p>I was beyond getting embarrassed by Jewel\u2019s comments.</p><p>I sat down in the shaded chair, leaned my head back, and sighed. This was nice. The breeze, the sound of the ocean...</p><p>\u201cHere take a sip. It\u2019s got orange juice, pineapple juice, ginger ale, and vodka. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>I started to shake my head but instead reached for the cup and thought, what the hell.</p><p>Taking a sip of the tropical flavored concoction, I realized it was really good. I could easily drink the whole thing. But I didn\u2019t. I needed my sense about me right now. Drinking away my problems was a weak thing to do.</p><p>I handed the drink back to Jewel, \u201cYum. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jewel started to stand up, \u201cYou keep it. I\u2019ll go make another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I don\u2019t want to drink. Not now anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jewel frowned and took the glass before settling back in her chair.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>No, probably not.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Jewel sighed, \u201cOkay, fine. Be warned, I\u2019m only going to let that answer fly for a little while. Eventually you are going to tell me what happened in Grove.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. She had supplied me with an escape and she was keeping shut about it. When I was ready, she deserved an explanation.</p><p>The phone in her lap began singing Circus by Britney Spears. It was Jewel\u2019s theme song.</p><p>She glanced down at the phone, and then up at me, \u201cIt\u2019s your mom.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been prepared for this. \u201cAnswer it. Act like you haven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d</p><p>Jewel grinned. She loved the idea of getting to lie. It was ridiculous but she liked the feeling it gave her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>She was quiet a moment. My mom was probably talking a mile a minute.</p><p>\u201cSo, wait... she\u2019s just missing? Have you talked to her?\u201d Jewel winked at me. She was good at this.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. No, she hasn\u2019t called or anything. Should I try calling her? I can see if she answers my phone call and tells me where she\u2019s gone off to.\u201d</p><p>She was really good. Heck, I almost believed she didn\u2019t know I\u2019d left Grove.</p><p>\u201cOff? Ouch. Who pissed in her Wheaties?\u201d I covered my mouth in shock. She\u2019d just said pissed while talking to my mother.</p><p>\u201cWeird, Mrs. Mac, but no, she hasn\u2019t called me. I was hoping she would but I haven\u2019t heard anything yet. I\u2019ll let you know if I do.\u201d</p><p>My mother hated it when Jewel called her Mrs. Mac. Actually, my mother just hated Jewel. This phone call had to be annoying her to no end.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go, Mrs. Mac. Sorry, but my lifeguard is here and he is one yummy number, ya know? I\u2019ll call if I hear anything,\u201d she cooed and then hung up her phone. She double-checked to make sure it was disconnected before grinning up at me. \u201cGo ahead and say it. I rocked that phone call.\u201d</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t completely numb inside, I\u2019d have laughed. \u201cYes, you were amazing. I\u2019ll never be sure if you\u2019re telling the truth again because that was completely believable. I\u2019m almost convinced you haven\u2019t seen or heard from me.\u201d</p><p>Jewel giggled and leaned back in her chair, \u201cWhatev, you\u2019re the only person on earth who can read through my lies. I prefer to think of it as acting. I so, think I need to move to Hollywood. I\u2019d be brilliant on the big screen. Or maybe just a CW show...ooooooh. I could be on Vampire Diaries and lure Damon away from his infatuation from Elena. Then I could do one of those naked scenes he likes to do so much.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes as she went on and on about a naked Damon and how amazing she\u2019d look on television.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Three days and nothing. Not even her mother could find her. I was empty. Nothing mattered anymore. I didn\u2019t want to get out of bed. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that maybe today she\u2019d call. Maybe today, I\u2019d find her.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sleep. Each night, I lay awake in my bed staring at the ceiling and going over all the thoughtless things I\u2019d done to her. She\u2019d been so damn sweet, too. I hadn\u2019t deserved her but she\u2019d wanted me. Me. No one else. Even after I called her a distraction she\u2019d forgiven me. When she\u2019d needed someone to hold her and listen to her, I\u2019d pushed her away to comfort Ashton while she threw up. She\u2019d forgiven me for that one too. Hell, all she\u2019d done this month was forgive me for my stupidity. I wasn\u2019t sure I could focus enough next week when I had to go to Florida for the first week of practice. How did I just leave Grove and not know Lana was okay, not get the chance to hold her and tell her how sorry I was? How could I go without being able to tell her that I was in love with her?</p><p>Picking up the nearest thing I could get my hands on, a random picture frame, I hurled it across the room and roared in frustration. Anything to release the fear, pain, and suffocating feeling of loss churning inside me.</p><p>\u201cYou put a hole in the sheetrock. Your mama ain\u2019t gonna be real happy about that one I\u2019m guessing,\u201d Beau drawled and I jerked my gaze toward the door to see him standing there watching me.</p><p>\u201cLike I give a shit,\u201d I replied with an angry snarl.</p><p>Beau shrugged, \u201cJust sayin\u2019 you might want to go back to pounding your fist on brick since you can\u2019t break that. Then again, you need those hands in working order for next week. Florida\u2019s gonna need their golden boy draft pick if they want any chance at taking down the Tide anytime in the next four years.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was trying to get my mind off Lana but it was pointless. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to argue SEC football with him. At the moment, I didn\u2019t give a shit who won what. I just wanted Lana back. I dropped down to sit on the sofa behind me and let my head fall back on the black leather.</p><p>\u201cI gotta find her Beau,\u201d the desperate sound in my voice wasn\u2019t lost on me.</p><p>\u201cWe will. Just takes some time. The girl doesn\u2019t want to be found. She\u2019s smart. She covered all her tracks.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have covered everything. Someone had to have helped her. But who?</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t just disappear like that. It isn\u2019t like Grove has any damn taxis she can hail. Heck, she can\u2019t even call one because they don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s at least thirty miles to the nearest bus station. SOMEONE had to have helped her. That\u2019s my missing clue.\u201d</p><p>Beau sat down on the sofa across from me. \u201cHer mama called that friend of hers at the beach, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closing my eyes. I\u2019d met Jewel. There was no way she just dropped everything and hauled ass that quickly to Grove to pick up Lana. No possible way. Even if she\u2019d wanted to, she couldn\u2019t have pulled that off.</p><p>\u201cShe hadn\u2019t heard from her. Lana\u2019s mom said she was positive. She\u2019d talked to Jewel herself and the girl didn\u2019t have a clue. Nor was she really worried about it.\u201d</p><p>Beau frowned, \u201cHer friend didn\u2019t care that she was missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met Jewel. She\u2019s interested in partying and guys. That\u2019s the extent of her concerns. I spent an entire meal trying to keep her hand off my dick. Trust me. The girl is shallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because she\u2019s a party girl doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t loyal to her friends. You spent what, one meal with her? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough time to decide about a person\u2019s loyalties. She annoyed you but Lana doesn\u2019t seem like a girl who\u2019d put up with someone who had no good qualities. She\u2019s pretty damn guarded. If she calls Jewel a friend then there is something about Jewel you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Beau had a point.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re right.\u201d I stood up and reached for my phone. I now had Lana\u2019s mother\u2019s number on my speed dial.</p><p>\u201cWho you calling?\u201d Beau asked, leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees.</p><p>\u201cLana\u2019s mom. I need Jewel\u2019s number.\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded, \u201cNow, you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>After getting Jewel\u2019s phone number and assuring Lana\u2019s mom I\u2019d call her if I found out anything, I quickly hung up and dialed the number she\u2019d give me.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d A bright chipper voice said after the third ring.</p><p>\u201cJewel? This is Sawyer Vincent,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cOooooh, well, isn\u2019t this a surprise? I don\u2019t recall giving you my phone number, Sawyer Vincent. Did you miss me so much you went to the trouble of hunting it down?\u201d she cooed into the phone. Beau was wrong about this. I was already cringing. Now the chick had my number and the ability to annoy the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, well, I\u2019m hoping you can help me out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want, I\u2019m sure I can accommodate. I\u2019m very talented with my hands... and mouth.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to take a hint. That much I was sure of.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to Lana recently? Has she called you? I know her mom has called you and you didn\u2019t know anything but I\u2019m desperate. I need to find her. If there is anything you know please, please tell me. I need her. Please.\u201d I stopped begging and prayed silently this phone call wasn\u2019t in vain.</p><p>\u201cUh, wow. Um, what the heck happened with you two? I mean her mom called and was worried and I thought maybe Lana had taken off because of her dad or something. I\u2019ve been expecting her to call me but she hasn\u2019t yet. Is this your fault? Did you hurt her?\u201d</p><p>The small ray of hope I\u2019d had was extinguished. I\u2019d known better than to think Lana had run off to Jewel. Besides, it was impossible. Who would have taken her to Jewel? This girl really didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with her. I need to see her. If she calls you or you have any idea where she could be, would you please call me? I\u2019ll pay you for your trouble; just please let me know if you can think of anything. I\u2019m not looking for her for her mother\u2019s sake. This is for me. Just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoookay Sawyer Vincent. I\u2019ll be sure to let you know if anything comes up. But dang, I\u2019m curious now. Did little Lana Banana snag herself a guy finally? I hope so, \u2018cause the girl is way past due.\u201d</p><p>Gripping my phone tighter, I worked on controlling the need to tell the bitch off. The sole reason being that I couldn\u2019t burn this bridge.</p><p>\u201cJust call me if you hear anything, okay?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cSure, sexy. In the meantime, you could come visit me. I\u2019d make you real happy. I\u2019m staying at Kiva Dunes condos on West Beach. Unit 103. My room is on the far corner looking straight at the water instead of the windows facing the pool.\u201d I tuned her out as she drawled on. The girl didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, just, if you hear anything. Thanks.\u201d I pressed end before she could tell me how happy she could make me.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Beau asked</p><p>\u201cShe knows nothing. Your guess about her having some winning qualities was way off course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d was his only reply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Lana</p><p>The music was thumping outside my window and the strangers I didn\u2019t know filling up the living area of the condo were getting louder. I would think since this was a condo that the people in the other units would complain. But apparently this was a party hub. The speakers out at the pool were blasting dance music. I could hear the same noise going on over my head. This entire place was crazy. It wasn\u2019t a large building. It had, at the most, 30 units and according to Jewel they were all used by their owners. They weren\u2019t rented out. I closed my blinds to give me a little privacy. Three different people had already knocked on my door. After the second knock, I stopped answering. Drunk guys with equally drunk girls looking for a place to have nasty, unprotected, disease infested sex. Shuddering at the thought, I went to the private bathroom attached to my room. I was thankful for this small area of peace.</p><p>\u201cOpen this door right now, Lana,\u201d Jewel yelled while banging on my bedroom door. Great, she was already drunk and going to force me to party. Sighing, I headed to open the door and get this over with. I just wanted a long hot bath.</p> <p>Jerking the door open, I started to tell her I wasn\u2019t interested when she barged past me slamming the door behind her. She locked it then spun around to face me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the HELL did you do to Sawyer Vincent?\u201d she demanded with a look of awe on her face.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to talk about Sawyer. \u201cI told you I don\u2019t want to talk about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to because I just lied out my ass for you while the boy begged and pleaded with me to call him if I heard from you or had any idea where you might be.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d called Jewel?</p> <p>\u201cWhen? Just now? He called you?\u201d I asked confused.</p><p>\u201cYES, he called me. Sexy southern drawl and all. He was pitiful I tell you. PI-TI-FUL. What did you do? Can you give me lessons? \u2018Cause girl, you must have rocked his world.\u201d</p><p>Sinking down onto the bed behind me I stared up at her shaking my head. Why would he be calling me? He had Ashton now. Couldn\u2019t he just be happy? Why would he be begging Jewel for help? For Ashton\u2019s sake. That was the only thing that made any sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say exactly?\u201d I asked</p><p>Jewel propped one hand on her hip and shook her head, \u201cOh no. You don\u2019t get to ask the questions first. I do. I ask and you answer. Then, and only then, will I tell you what was said between us.\u201d</p><p>Dang.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t make me do this. I don\u2019t want to talk about him.\u201d \u201cNo more begging. I\u2019ve had my fill for the night, thank you very much. Now, talk.\u201d Just thinking about him made me anxious. How was I supposed to talk about him? Standing up, I began to pace in front of the bed. I could do this. I wanted to know what he said to Jewel and what she said back because if Jewel let anything slip, I needed to pack up and leave. I didn\u2019t want Ashton or my mom showing up here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with Sawyer Vincent since I was a kid. He has been in love with Ashton for just as long. They broke up about seven months ago because she fell in love with his cousin Beau. Don\u2019t ask me why because I can\u2019t figure it out. Sawyer is perfect. Beau is... well Beau is a heathen... but he is insanely in love with Ashton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, both of these boys are in love with Ashton?\u201d Jewel asked</p><p>\u201cYep. Always have been,\u201d I replied then took a deep breath before I went on. \u201cI thought that once Sawyer had time to get over Ashton then I would step in and make a move. Try to get his attention.\u201d The hurt painful laugh that escaped me bordered on a sob. I hated my weakness when I mentioned his name.</p><p>\u201cI did this whole makeover thing in hopes of attracting Sawyer. It was well past time for me to stop looking like a mouse anyway. I did it because I wanted to be a girl who could catch Sawyer\u2019s eye. And it worked. He noticed me. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Please God, let that be enough for her. I didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so if it wasn\u2019t enough then why is the boy begging me to help him find you? Because from the way he sounded you got to him a lot more than you think,\u201d Jewel assured me.</p><p>I was going to have to tell her everything or she\u2019d end up assuming the wrong thing and tell him where I was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did. Because when Ashton wants something, Sawyer will move mountains to get it for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Beau, right?\u201d Jewel asked.</p><p>Turning from her so the tears stinging my eyes were hidden, I shook my head. \u201cNo. Beau cheated on her. I was really shocked because he is so completely infatuated with her but she had proof. Soon as she found out, she ran to Sawyer. He dropped me like I was on fire and let her run straight into his arms.\u201d Sniffling, I wiped at the tears that had managed to escape before looking back at Jewel.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019s desperate to find you because Ashton is upset that you left?\u201d</p><p>All I could do was nod.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jewel muttered, and then an angry scowl came over her face. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat her pretty little face in.\u201d \u201cJewel, no. Don\u2019t blame Ashton. None of this is her fault. She can\u2019t control the fact Sawyer loves her. They were a couple for three years. He\u2019s her safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sucks balls. You know that, right?\u201d The disgust in her face almost made me smile. Almost.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. But I walked into this. I took a chance.\u201d Shrugging, I walked over to sit back down beside her on the bed. \u201cWe both know it was time I started taking chances. I crashed and burned but I learned from it.\u201d</p><p>Jewel wrapped her arm around my shoulder and pulled my head against her shoulder. \u201cAh, damn. This sucks,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t tell him anything. He did beg and plead with me to call him if I heard from you or I thought of somewhere you could be. He said he \u2018needed\u2019 to find you. I was mistaken with his anxious tone. I figured you\u2019d wrapped the boy around your finger and gotten angry with him and left him high and dry. I didn\u2019t realize he was trying to ease some other girl\u2019s guilt. She may be your cousin, but I am not a fan. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>We sat in silence for awhile. Finally, I sat back up. \u201cThank you for lying. I have complete faith in your acting abilities.\u201d</p><p>Jewel smirked, \u201cSo you wanna run off to LA with me? We could rock that town. Me and you.\u201d</p><p>A real laugh managed to bubble up and I shook my head, \u201cNot right now. Maybe someday soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome out here and party. Forget everything. Drink one of my tropical drinks. I have one I make with coconut rum that is to die for.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cGive me a few more days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure babe.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>Sawyer was always the Vincent boy worth fighting for. He\u2019s the special one.</p><p>I reread that last line for what felt like the hundredth time. I was packed up and headed to Florida. It had been over a week now and no Lana. No sign of her. No text. Her phone still went directly to voice mail. She\u2019d called her mother again to check in but the number had been unknown and she hadn\u2019t been able to trace it. All I knew was she was alive. That small amount of knowledge kept me from losing my mind. I lived for those calls from her mom telling me what Lana had said. It was my only connection to her and although I wasn\u2019t a fan of her parents, I was starting to have an odd sort of affection for her crazy mother. She did love Lana even if she sucked at showing her. The woman was definitely controlling but Lana was doing a number on her right now and I was willing to bet that relationship would be forever changed for the better.</p><p>Folding the note Lana had left Ash into the worn creases where I\u2019d opened and read it and then folded it again, I slipped it into my pocket. I didn\u2019t go anywhere without it. Having it close to me reminded me that when I found her, I could fix this. She\u2019d misunderstood and it was my fault. If I\u2019d have opened my eyes and realized I was in love with the girl this wouldn\u2019t have happened. Unfortunately, Lana hadn\u2019t known. She thought I still loved Ash.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, you ready?\u201d my dad called from the foyer. I wasn\u2019t ready. I didn\u2019t want to leave Grove. What if she came back and I was gone? Besides, how the hell was I supposed to concentrate enough to throw a football? This week was going to be a disaster.</p><p>\u201cComing Dad,\u201d I called back. I grabbed my phone so I could look again at the picture Ash had texted me from our trip to the mountains. Lana had been hiking up the rocks toward the waterfall in Cheaha and Ash had snapped a picture of her just as she\u2019d glanced back laughing. It was the only picture I had of her. I\u2019d had it printed and framed so I could keep it by my bed. Some nights staring at it was the only thing that kept me going. I slipped my phone into my pocket. I had my note and my picture. It would have to get me through the next few days.</p><p>When I got to the bottom of the steps, Ethan was standing in the foyer talking to my dad. His eyes met mine and something felt off. There was something I was missing.</p><p>\u201cEthan?\u201d</p><p>He shuffled his feet, \u201cHey Sawyer I, uh, forgot you were heading out today.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been to a field party, or anywhere else for that matter, since Lana left me. \u201cYeah, practice is starting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came by to ask you something but it can wait until you get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now, might as well ask.\u201d God help him if he asked me if Lana was available. I\u2019d break his damn neck.</p><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s about Lana,\u201d he began.</p><p>I looked over at my dad, \u201cCan you give us a sec, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, my father nodded and grabbed one of my bags and before heading outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lana?\u201d I asked, making sure he heard the warning in my words.</p><p>Ethan sighed, \u201cNot sure how to ask this,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d choose my words carefully, bro,\u201d I replied.</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting that loud and clear.\u201d Clearing his throat, he shifted his feet again. \u201cDo you, uh, love her? Lana, that is.\u201d</p><p>The fact he\u2019d felt the need to clarify it was Lana he was asking about pissed me off. I didn\u2019t like her being compared to Ashton. She was so much more than what I\u2019d had with Ashton. There was no comparison.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I clipped out.</p><p>\u201cI mean, do you love her more than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking say it,\u201d I snarled. That was a cliff Ethan didn\u2019t want to step off. Ethan\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I get it,\u201d he backed away and moved toward the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you wanted to say? Find out if Lana was available? You know she left me right? No one can find her.\u201d</p><p>Ethan swallowed hard and shook his head slowly, \u201cUh, no, I mean I heard something. I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go if that\u2019s all you needed.\u201d</p><p>Ethan turned and headed out the front door. \u201cGood luck in Florida. I\u2019ll uh, see ya when you get back. Looking forward to hearing about it. The rest of us are going to have to live vicariously through you and Beau now. Since our football days are over.\u201d</p><p>His voice was still tense but I could tell he was trying to calm me down. If I was a good friend, I\u2019d apologize. Right now, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d do that next time I saw him. Slipping my hand in my pocket, I rubbed Lana\u2019s letter gently between my fingers. I had to find her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Lana</p><p>My freckles were just getting worse. SPF 80 wasn\u2019t even helping. Sure, my skin wasn\u2019t red but my freckles were getting a tan. Not something I wanted. Even so, this was good therapy. Laying out here in my safe shaded area made me feel like I was hidden from the world. I was hidden from everyone who had the power to hurt me. Too bad it was a fleeting thing. I\u2019d have to leave at the end of the month and head back to Alpharetta and my mother. I did not want to think about that. Facing her, after hiding away for over a month, would be difficult. But I was still checking in.</p><p>She kept trying to get me to talk about Sawyer. It always ended with me hanging up. I figured she\u2019d eventually stop it. Maybe when we got the wedding invitation from Ashton in a few years she\u2019d finally let go of her hopes that Sawyer Vincent was interested in me. My stomach rolled and I fought off the sick feeling that thought instigated.</p> <p>\u201cLana?\u201d A familiar voice interrupted my thoughts and I shifted around to see Ethan standing behind the chair where Jewel normally lounged. in She wasn\u2019t here today. She\u2019d taken off on a shoe-buying splurge.</p><p>\u201cEthan?\u201d I replied in shock. I hadn\u2019t expected to see him again.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, sorry to just show up but you can\u2019t exactly be reached by phone these days.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He\u2019d tried to call. That surprised me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Do you want to sit down?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the chair beside me and thought about it a minute before he walked around and took a seat. He must intend to stay awhile.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s this about? Is there something you wanted to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t lie back in the chair. He sat on the edge facing me with his elbows resting on his knees. His head was under the shade of the umbrella and the serious expression on his face worried me. If this was about Sawyer, I wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>\u201cYou, uh, enjoying yourself?\u201d he asked</p><p>\u201cYes, but I have a feeling you didn\u2019t just drive an hour and a half to ask me if I was enjoying myself.\u201d</p><p>Ethan chuckled and shook his head, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. Spill it Ethan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Sawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Shut it, Ethan. I retract that. I don\u2019t want to know what you have to say,\u201d I reached for my bag and started to stand up. \u201cIf you want to visit and talk about the weather and try one of Jewel\u2019s tropical drinks you are more than welcome. But I will not talk about Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, please don\u2019t go,\u201d he begged, standing up with me.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ignore my wishes?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His shoulders slumped and he shook his head. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t bring him up.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back down, I put my bag back beside me and reached inside to get a granola bar. I grabbed an extra one and handed it to Ethan who had also sat back down.</p><p>\u201cHere, have a granola bar.\u201d</p><p>He reached for it and gave me a weak smile, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>We sat in silence and ate our granola bars. Once I finished mine, I turned to look at him. His face was troubled and I almost asked him if Sawyer was okay. The fear that Sawyer could be hurt or sick battled with the fear Ethan would tell me something I couldn\u2019t handle.</p><p>\u201cSo, when do you leave for college?\u201d I asked, trying to think of anything other than Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cNext month and you?\u201d</p><p>I hated admitting this to anyone. Nevertheless, it was time I faced the facts. \u201cNot sure. I\u2019ve had a change of plans due to my dad\u2019s sudden lack of money. So, I\u2019ll be going to the local community college the next two years. I\u2019ve got to figure out what to do after but I have time. Plenty of it.\u201d The sourness from speaking the words aloud settled in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m sorry Lana. I always imagined you going to an Ivy league or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not me.\u201d I\u2019d been worried about things other than my education. Bad move.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Ash?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about her either if you don\u2019t mind. And the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>He was determined to discuss Sawyer with me. Did he want to know if it was clear for him to ask me out? Surely, he didn\u2019t want to give that train wreck another try. I\u2019d been a horrible date.</p><p>\u201cBeau didn\u2019t cheat,\u201d he blurted out quickly.</p><p>Why did that news hurt? Why the heck did I care that Sawyer had been dissed for Beau, yet again? If Beau hadn\u2019t cheated then Ash was still with him. She was crazy in love with the guy. Why, why, why? I should not care that Sawyer was alone. I should not care that he got what was coming to him. I should not.</p><p>This does not matter. If not this time, there will be a next and a next and a next and each time Sawyer will go running back to her\u2014hoping, waiting and breaking his heart and mine in the process.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about Beau either, okay. Actually let\u2019s not talk about anyone in Grove, except you.\u201d I replied with a stern tone that I felt guilty for using. Ethan was nothing but nice.</p><p>\u201cJust thought you\u2019d like to know,\u201d he replied, shifting in his seat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. I closed that door. Or rather it was slammed in my face and I walked away after adding a padlock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, sometimes things aren\u2019t what they seem,\u201d he began and I held up my hand to stop him.</p><p>\u201cStop. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here. But if it\u2019s because Sawyer put you up to it or Ashton, I\u2019m asking you as a friend to please leave.\u201d</p><p>Ethan let out a weary sigh, \u201cNo one knows where you are. I kept your secret. Just like I promised. I just thought maybe I could come explain some things for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you explain anything for them? If I\u2019m not mistaken, you were interested in me and Sawyer came and swooped in and took me right out of your grasp. Am I wrong about that?\u201d</p><p>Ethan let out a hard laugh and shook his head, \u201cNo, you got it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then why are you here trying to help Sawyer smooth things over?\u201d \u201cBecause he\u2019s my friend,\u201d Ethan replied. \u201cAnd so are you.\u201d</p><p>He was such a nice guy. Bless his heart; he had no idea what he was mixed up in. This was not fixable.</p><p>\u201cWell then, you need better friends,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cSawyer had never poached on any girl he thought his friends might be interested in. When he acted the way he did with you, I didn\u2019t like it but I knew something was different. You must\u2019ve gotten to him in a way no one else did because he was not acting like himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a means to get back at Ashton,\u201d I replied sourly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe in the beginning you were, Lana. I thought that too at one point. I know now that it changed. It became something more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough. Whatever it became, it wasn\u2019t enough. No one will be able to compete with her,\u201d the tears clogging my throat just pissed me off. I was not going to cry again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no competition,\u201d he said softly and I refused to cry in front of him.</p><p>\u201cJust go, Ethan. Please,\u201d I turned my head away from him and closed my eyes. After a minute of silence, I heard him stand up and walk away.</p><p>Silent tears streamed down my face as the words, \u201cThere\u2019s no competition\u201d replayed over and over again in my head.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been home an hour when Beau called me. He asked me to meet him down at the bar for a game of pool. I\u2019d tried to tell him I just wanted to take a hot shower, two Tylenol and get in bed. My body ached. How the heck did he not want to curl up and crash too? Besides, what about Ashton? Didn\u2019t he want to go see her?</p><p>Pulling into the gravel parking lot, I looked around for Beau\u2019s truck. I found it over by the far end of the building. Ethan\u2019s Jeep was right beside it. I needed to apologize to him anyway. I stepped out of my truck and headed for the door.</p><p>It was a slow night but then not many people came to the bar on a Wednesday. Thursday through Sunday were the busy times here. I\u2019d only been a few times with Beau but I\u2019d passed the place several times. I knew which nights had a full parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it ain\u2019t my favorite nephew,\u201d Aunt Honey called out from behind the bar.</p><p>I nodded my head in her direction, \u201cHey, Aunt Honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a beer? I can already tell you that you\u2019re probably gonna need it.\u201d</p><p>What the heck did that mean? I started to tell her no and then figured if I couldn\u2019t have a hot shower and painkillers a beer was the next best thing. \u201cSure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on over to the boys. They\u2019re waiting on ya. I\u2019ll bring ya a beer in just a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cTold ya not to call me ma\u2019am. Makes me sound like somebody\u2019s mama,\u201d she teased and shot me a wink.</p><p>She really was a piece-of-work.</p><p>I made my way over to Beau who leaned up against the edge of a pool table with his ankles crossed and a frosty mug of beer in his hand. It was the expression on his face that tipped me off that this wasn\u2019t just a friendly gathering. I was here for a purpose. Slipping my hand into my pocket, I held Lana\u2019s letter between my fingers. Remembering her words helped me deal. If this was bad news, I needed a reminder that she was out there and that she loved me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Beau?\u201d I demanded the moment I was close enough.</p><p>\u201cI got some answers for you that you\u2019re gonna want. But you need to remain calm while you get those answers.\u201d</p><p>My heart sped up and I froze, \u201cLana?\u201d</p><p>Beau nodded, \u201cYep. Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. But it ain\u2019t my story to tell,\u201d Beau turned his head and I followed his gaze to Ethan standing a few feet away from us. \u201cGo ahead E, before he loses it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shifted his gaze from me to Beau and I could see the fear in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d I started toward him, ready to shake him until he told me what he knew.</p><p>Beau\u2019s hand clamped down on my shoulder and stopped me. \u201cYou won\u2019t get your answers if you hurt him.\u201d He turned to Ethan. \u201cEthan, tell him. I told you, I won\u2019t let him rip your balls off.\u201d</p><p>My heart started racing and the blood boiled in my veins. The idea that Ethan had somehow had a hand in Lana\u2019s disappearance was making it hard for me to take calm steady breaths.</p><p>\u201cYou better do this quick E, cause he\u2019s gonna blow in a second and I\u2019m sore as shit from this week. I really don\u2019t want to have to stop this,\u201d Beau urged.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah. Um, well, you see Sawyer. I got a call from Lana\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell is she calling you?\u201d I demanded, taking another step toward Ethan who backed up a step.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck on with this E,\u201d Beau growled as his hand tightened on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo. Before. She called me before. The day Ash thought Beau cheated. She called me that day and told me she needed a favor. She said she couldn\u2019t stay here anymore and needed my help. I picked her up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS SHE?\u201d I roared, taking another step his way. Both Beau\u2019s hands clamped down on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cEasy bro,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cLord have mercy boy. Drink this beer and chill out. The girl is safe and if you\u2019ll let the kid talk you\u2019ll find out where she\u2019s at,\u201d Aunt Honey stood in front of me shoving a mug of beer into my hand. \u201cHere, hold this. That way you can only hit him with one fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Mama. I got this,\u201d Beau said behind me.</p><p>\u201cHmph, don\u2019t look like it. But I hope you\u2019re right. I ain\u2019t payin\u2019 for no repairs if he goes bat shit in here,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Setting the beer down on the edge of the pool table, I didn\u2019t take my eyes off Ethan. He knew where she was. He KNEW where she was.</p><p>\u201cI took her to her friend\u2019s condo at the beach.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019d called Jewel... wait. He\u2019d taken her there?</p><p>\u201cDid you see Jewel? Did she actually go into a condo?\u201d I asked, hoping that I\u2019d been played by that crazy ass friend of hers.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I carried her bags to the door. Jewel came outside squealing and all happy to see her. Then I went back,\u201d Ethan began.</p><p>The words that he went back sent off a possessive blaze of fury. I shrugged off Beau\u2019s grasp and stalked over to tower above Ethan, \u201cWhat does that mean? You went back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. He ain\u2019t finished. Don\u2019t fuck him up now,\u201d Beau growled, hooking his arms in both of mine from behind and pulling me back.</p><p>Ethan wiped at his forehead nervously and gulped. \u201cListen man, I didn\u2019t know. I thought you\u2019d moved on. I didn\u2019t know how you felt about Lana. When I came to your house Saturday to talk to you about Lana that was the first time I realized that I\u2019d made a huge mistake helping her run away. So, I went back. I was going to fix it. She wouldn\u2019t listen to me. Hell, I couldn\u2019t even say your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was there? When did you go?\u201d I was backing up. I needed to know. I had to get to her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s there. At the condo. Condo unit 103. Kiva Dunes,\u201d he called out and I started running for the door.</p><p>Then the words from the phone conversation with Jewel came back to me, \u201cIn the meantime you could come visit me. I\u2019d make you real happy. I\u2019m staying at Kiva Dunes condos on West Beach. Unit 103. My room is on the far corner looking straight at the water instead of the windows facing the pool.\u201d The crazy bitch wasn\u2019t so crazy after all. I\u2019d bet my ass the room was Lana\u2019s. Jewel was trying to tell me without ratting out Lana. Beau was right. Lana was careful with who she let get close. Jewel was one helluva liar though. I\u2019d completely believed her. The dumb blonde thing she had going really threw me off.</p><p>I reached for my truck door and realized my hands were shaking. I knew where Lana was. And I was going to get her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Lana</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stay in this room one more night. Of course, I didn\u2019t want to go out into that wild mess either. Before it got too carried away, I locked the door to my room and went to the window to escape. I didn\u2019t want anyone making themselves at home on my bed while I was out. I didn\u2019t think any of them would attempt to get in the window. I\u2019d been locked away for two weeks. Everyone knew, by now, that my room was off limits.</p><p>Making sure no one saw my escape, I headed down to the water. Just a long walk to stretch my legs and breathe in the clean ocean air and then I\u2019d head back to hole-up for the night. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t be so restless tonight. Breaking into a jog, I pushed all those memories that tended to creep in when I let my guard down to the back of mind. I imagined myself running from all of it. Leaving it in the past as my hair flew out behind me. Silent tears streamed down my face as I let it go... one memory at a time.</p> <p>Sawyer</p><p>This place was like a frat house. I didn\u2019t like that. I didn\u2019t like it at all. I started to knock on the door when music pounded through the thin walls. Some bikini-clad girls leaned over the railing on the second floor and called out what all they wanted to do to me if I\u2019d just come on up. Shaking my head, I headed for the corner room that faced the ocean.</p><p>A guy had a girl pressed up against the side of the building and I was more than positive they were having sex. This crap had surrounded Lana for two weeks. I was going to kill Ethan once I got back home. She didn\u2019t belong here. If someone had touched her... I stopped myself. I couldn\u2019t do this. I had to win her back. If I went all caveman, she would fight me.</p><p>Turning the corner the window facing the ocean greeted me. I glanced at the other windows to this unit and they all faced the pool. It had to be Lana\u2019s room. I knocked and waited but there was nothing but silence. The lights were off. Could she actually be somewhere in this wild bunch of people? I reached down and thought I\u2019d check and see if the window was locked. It wasn\u2019t. Not smart, Lana. Didn\u2019t she know better than to leave her windows unlocked? Anyone could have gotten in. I didn\u2019t want to think about it. I needed to focus.</p><p>Pushing the window open, I stepped inside the room and the sweet smell of her perfume filled the room. Jewel had given me directions straight to Lana and I\u2019d missed the cue. The room was empty. I glanced over toward the door and realized it was locked. So, she\u2019d escaped through the window. She wasn\u2019t at this party.</p> <p>She\u2019d be back. I just needed to wait. I was close. Sitting down on the bed, I reached over and took a pillow. Holding it to my nose, I inhaled. God, I missed this smell. Burying my face in her scent, I sat watching the window... waiting.</p><p>Lana</p><p>The tears were dried on my face as I made my way back to the condo. I\u2019d run for over an hour. My lungs burned and my legs would probably feel like Jell-O tomorrow. I wasn\u2019t big on exercise so this was gonna hurt.</p><p>Pulling up my window, I stepped inside to find someone sitting on my bed in the dark. Naturally, I screamed.</p><p>\u201cLana, it\u2019s me.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s hands were on my arms instantly. Sawyer... Sawyer was here.</p><p>I stood frozen, trying to decide if I\u2019d passed out from the running and this was a dream.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words \u201c I\u2019m sorry,\u201d snapped me out of my shocked haze and I jerked out of his grasp and moved away from him and toward the door quickly.</p><p>\u201cLana, please don\u2019t. Please listen to me. Don\u2019t shut me out. You have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea? Me? Yes, I have an idea. I want you to leave. Do you understand me? LEAVE. I. Do. Not. Want. To. See. You.\u201d I was yelling but I knew no one would hear me over the noise outside.</p><p>\u201cLana, please,\u201d Sawyer begged and walked toward me hesitantly. I closed my eyes and crossed my arms protectively over my chest. I hated how the pleading sound in his voice pulled at me.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever felt one small amount of anything for me, you\u2019ll leave and let me move on,\u201d I whispered fiercely.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t respond, I was torn between joy that he was leaving meaning he felt something for me, no matter how small it may be, relief that he wouldn\u2019t be here to witness me crumble to the floor, and agony because seeing him had completely ripped me open.</p><p>I heard the faint rattle of paper and I opened my eyes slowly to see Sawyer standing in the same spot with a worn looking letter in his hands. He began to read:</p><p>\u201cI made the mistake of opening my heart up to someone who clearly could never feel the same about me. I knew Sawyer loved you. I\u2019ve known it since we were kids. I thought maybe just getting his attention for a short time would be enough. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>My chest felt like it was going to explode. He had the letter I\u2019d left Ashton. Oh, God.</p><p>He lifted his eyes from the paper and looked directly at me with so much pain in his eyes and something else... \u201cI loved Ashton once. She was my childhood crush. She was all I really knew. But when she left me, I didn\u2019t cry. When you left me, I wept like a baby.\u201d</p><p>I stopped breathing as he lowered his eyes back to the paper in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve grown up with two parents who never once thought about me in the choices they made. My emotions weren\u2019t something they concerned themselves with and maybe that is my fault because I didn\u2019t speak up. I just pushed the hurt and anger deep inside me. I wanted to be strong because I knew they were weak. I\u2019m tired of being strong. I\u2019m tired of being second best. I need someone to love me.\u201d He stopped reading and lifted his eyes to stare at me once again. \u201cYou should never and I mean, never, be anyone\u2019s second choice. Anyone who doesn\u2019t see you for the incredible gift you are is a blind bastard.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his eyes back to the paper and began reading again,</p><p>\u201cStaying in Grove isn\u2019t a possible option for me. I let myself hope for too much. I\u2019ve been broken too many times. I can\u2019t stay somewhere near... someone who will eventually destroy me.\u201d His green eyes lifted to meet mine and the tears glistening in them took my breath away. \u201cIf I lose you because of the blind idiot I\u2019ve been then I will be the one who is destroyed.\u201d</p><p>He continued to read:</p><p>\u201cYou had the right Vincent boy all along. Don\u2019t take him for granted this time. He loves you in a way that I hope to one day inspire in someone. He would give up the world for you. When you have someone that special, that incredible that loves you, don\u2019t let it go. This is your second chance to treasure what you\u2019ve had all your life. Sawyer was always the Vincent boy worth fighting for. He\u2019s the special one.\u201d Sawyer slowly folded the paper and rubbed his thumb over it as if it were something precious then tucked it back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cAshton didn\u2019t have the right Vincent boy. I know this because I understand now what love really feels like. The kind that consumes you. Love holds the power to break you. It holds the power to complete you. When I read this letter, I was standing in Ashton\u2019s living room after fixing things for her and Beau, which was all I wanted to do. They belong together. They\u2019ve always belonged together. I get that now. Not because she chose him, but because you chose me. Until you, I was lost. I thought Ashton was what my life was supposed to be. Letting go of the comfort zone that our relationship represented was hard. Then you came into my life like a light bursting through the darkness. You made everything make sense.\u201d He took a step closer to me and I fought the urge to throw myself in his arms.</p><p>\u201cLana. I think about you every minute of every day. When I\u2019m with you, my world is complete. When I touch you, I understand the meaning of life. When I lost you, I completely shattered. You. Own. Me.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down my face and dropped from my chin. That wasn\u2019t enough. This time I needed more.</p><p>Sawyer reached out for my hand and pulled me closer to him. I wanted to melt in his arms but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lana. I love you so much. Everything about you. The way you lips curl up slowly when you smile, the freckle right under your perfect little bottom, the way your laughter sends warmth flooding through my veins, how your touch lights me on fire. I love you and I will spend the rest of my life making sure you know that you are my number one. You will always be my number one.\u201d</p><p>That was it. That was enough. That was all I\u2019d ever need to hear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty- Five</p><p>Crazy Girl by The Eli Young Band woke me up from a very good dream. Stretching, I felt Sawyer\u2019s arms tighten around me. \u201cCrazy girl, don\u2019t you know that I love you?\u201d kept playing and I turned to look up at Sawyer who was reaching for my phone.</p><p>\u201cWhy is my phone turned on and why is it singing a country song?\u2019 I asked groggily as he looked at the screen and then dropped his gaze to mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mom. Talk to her or she\u2019ll worry.\u201d</p> <p>I gaped at him, \u201cMy mom? But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got your phone out of your bag last night and turned it on. Finding you had my adrenaline pumping so calming down was hard to do. I changed your ringtone to the song that makes me think about you.\u201d He lowered his mouth to mine and sang, \u201cHave I told you lately, I love you like crazy, girl?\u201d along with my ringing phone. I couldn\u2019t get mad at him while he was doing something like that. Early-morning-singing-Sawyer was just too freaking sweet. Even if he\u2019d made it possible for my mom to call me.</p><p>Sighing, I took the phone from him and answered, \u201cHi mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lana, you\u2019ve turned your phone back on. I\u2019m so glad. Does this mean you\u2019re going to come home? I\u2019m so ready to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not coming home. Not yet anyway.\u201d I met Sawyer\u2019s gaze and wondered what I was going to do. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be welcomed back at Aunt Sarah\u2019s after I\u2019d run off like that. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you doing this? Is it still about Sawyer? I can tell you that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it isn\u2019t about Sawyer,\u201d I replied, reaching up and running my hand through his messy hair. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect. I just don\u2019t really know yet how I\u2019m going to finish my summer.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer frowned and his arms tightened around me like I was going to vanish into thin air.</p><p>\u201cWait, did you just say Sawyer was perfect? I thought you were mad at him. I mean, I agree with you he is a lovely young man. We\u2019ve spoken a lot over the past two weeks and I think he really loves you. The boy has been so upset. He calls me all the time to see if I\u2019ve heard from you. Even though every time you called I called him right away and told him what you said and that you were fine. Oh no. I didn\u2019t mean to tell you that. Don\u2019t be mad at me, honey. He was just so worried.\u201d</p><p>I smirked up at him, \u201cHe can be pretty persuasive. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very good catch, Lana. Wealthy family and going to Florida for college too. I was so surprised when he told me he had gotten a scholarship there for football. That\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mom it isn\u2019t. Dad isn\u2019t going to be able to help out.\u201d Saying that never got easier.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Yes, he is going to help. The alimony he gives me every month will more than pay for it. Besides, I\u2019m selling the house and downsizing. It\u2019s too much house for just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, no, you love the house and I don\u2019t think you understand how much it\u2019ll cost with books and living expenses\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Lana. I checked into all of that while you\u2019ve been gone. You\u2019re still getting mail and I had to pay a few more fees and get the first quarter paid for. I\u2019ve held off buying things for your dorm room until you come home to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLana, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sawyer sat up quickly and pulled me up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs that Sawyer? Are you back in Grove?\u201d my mother asked, as I patted Sawyer\u2019s chest to silently calm him down. I\u2019d teared up listening to my mother and he\u2019d gone into panic mode.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s Sawyer. He, uh, found me last night,\u201d I replied into the phone while smiling at Sawyer who was watching me carefully with frown lines between his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cFound you? Where are you? How did he find you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with Jewel all along. She covered for me and honestly, I have no idea how he found me, unless...,\u201d I paused before I finished that thought. I didn\u2019t want to have to explain this all to my mother and she would want to know. I was pretty sure who\u2019d ratted me out. Ethan was the only one in Grove who knew where I had gone.</p><p>\u201cListen Mom, I\u2019ll call you later. I\u2019ve got to figure some things out today but I\u2019ll be sure to let you know. Let me talk to Sawyer, okay, and thank you, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Lana.\u201d</p><p>I disconnected and laid my phone down beside me before crawling over on top of him. \u201cSo, how\u2019d you get my whereabouts out of Ethan? And is he still alive?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer chuckled and shifted me so I was straddling him. \u201cYes, he\u2019s still breathing. Actually, I left him completely unharmed. I ran out of there so fast once I had your location, I didn\u2019t even say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, now tell me how you got it out of him,\u201d I replied, running my hands up his bare chest. I\u2019d missed touching him.</p><p>\u201cHe just told me,\u201d he said in a husky whisper. His attention was focused on my hands as I traced circles around his very firm pecs.</p><p>\u201cThe guilt got to him, I guess,\u201d I murmured before leaning down to press a kiss to the bruise just over his ribs. \u201cDid those big mean football players hurt you?\u201d I cooed, raining a trail of kisses across his abs and back up his chest.</p><p>\u201cUh huh, I can show you a lot of other places they hurt me too,\u201d he sighed, running his hands down my back to cup my butt.</p><p>\u201cMmmmkay, just let me finish kissing these booboos and I\u2019ll get to the other ones next,\u201d I cooed.</p><p>\u201cPlease, take your time,\u201d he groaned, slipping his hands inside my panties.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered me about how you got my hideout location from Ethan,\u201d I reminded him as I slid down his body so I could kiss just below his belly-button.</p><p>\u201cGaaah, baby,\u201d he arched into me then took a ragged breath, \u201cwho\u2019s Ethan?\u201d he asked in a low deep voice.</p><p>I lifted my eyes to meet his fascinated gaze. \u201cYou remember Ethan. Your friend who told on me,\u201d I reminded before I licked gently at the skin right above his boxers.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuuuuuck,\u201d he moaned, tangling his hands in my hair.</p><p>I decided to let the Ethan thing go. I was having too much fun watching the guy I loved come apart in my arms. Slipping a finger into the top of his boxers, I leaned forward and whispered in his ear. \u201cAny booboos down there I need to pay attention to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, lots and lots,\u201d he croaked out.</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I called out in way of a greeting as I knocked once on his office door and stepped inside. My dad was sitting behind the large mahogany desk that he\u2019d had shipped over from somewhere he and mom had visited. I didn\u2019t remember the details.</p><p>\u201cSawyer,\u201d he replied, looking up from the paperwork on his desk. \u201cHow was practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to learn a lot this year. Being red shirted was a smart move.\u201d</p><p>Dad nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cBeau had a good week too. They\u2019re starting him on the offensive line.\u201d It drove me nuts that he never asked about his other son. The one he\u2019d ignored. The one he never claimed.</p><p>Dad frowned and looked back down at his paperwork, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Your cousin has always excelled as a receiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my brother. Beau\u2019s not my cousin. He\u2019s my brother.\u201d I\u2019d never forced my dad to face this. I\u2019d been so angry with Beau about Ashton when this all came out, I\u2019d let this slide. If Beau didn\u2019t want to deal with it then I\u2019d figured why should I? But it wasn\u2019t fair. This farce my dad lived wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Clearing his throat, he took off his reading glasses and leaned back in his chair to level his gaze on me. \u201cYou want to talk about that? Is that what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. I want to talk about that.\u201d I didn\u2019t snap. I kept my tone level. Yelling wouldn\u2019t get me anywhere.</p><p>\u201cBeau is biologically mine, yes. But I didn\u2019t raise him. I didn\u2019t love his mother. Your uncle did. Not me. I do not see Beau as my son. My nephew, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is your son. His dad died when he was six years old. He\u2019s needed a dad for twelve years now and you did nothing. Not once did you check on him. Not once did you tell him you were proud of him. Not once did you make his life easier.\u201d I stopped as my voice got louder and louder.</p><p>\u201cTell him I was proud of him? For what? Being a loser? Coming to football practice with a hangover? Hanging out in bars? What the hell was I supposed to be proud of? Huh? Please tell me that.\u201d</p><p>My hands balled into fist and I took a deep breath. I was so close to taking a swing at my own dad. \u201cHe was stuck with Aunt Honey who left him at home alone when he was just a kid. If he hadn\u2019t lived in a trailer park where people deal drugs and God knows what else, maybe he would\u2019ve known better. But he didn\u2019t. He made mistakes. He had to learn things the hard way. He had to learn everything the hard way. Because YOU WEREN\u2019T THERE,\u201d I pointed my finger at my dad and snarled. \u201cBeau straightened himself out. He got a football scholarship to the UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA for crying out loud. He found a way to make money so he could buy himself a truck. He loves his mama and takes care of her even though she did nothing to earn his help. Why? Because he loves her. She\u2019s all he has ever had. He made himself and what he made is one damn fine man. I am so proud to call him my brother I am bursting with it when I see him. And YOU, you did nothing. Not one damn thing to make him. Nothing,\u201d I finished and turned to leave his office. I didn\u2019t want to stay here. Not under this roof. Not with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d my dad\u2019s voice called out after me and I stopped and squeezed my eyes closed tightly before turning back around to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I let him figure it all out on his own. I was afraid of your mother finding out. I was afraid of this town finding out. I didn\u2019t want to lose this life I\u2019d built for myself. You\u2019re wrong about one thing though. I did check on him. Why do you think you got away with sneaking out to go get him out of jams or going to stay with him when he was alone? Did you think you were just that good at being sneaky? You weren\u2019t. When you left to go to him, I followed you. I watched you both. I watched as you fixed his problems, got him out of messes and stayed by his side when he was alone. I was always there. I was proud of you for being there for him when I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not proud of myself, Sawyer. I\u2019ll live with this regret the rest of my life. Nevertheless, I am proud of Beau. He has turned into the man I always hoped he would be. He\u2019s tougher than you because of the life he lived. He is harder around the edges but he\u2019s a good boy.\u201d</p><p>My dad reached down and opened a drawer in his desk that he always kept locked and pulled out a large scrapbook and laid it on the desk. \u201cGo ahead, take a look.\u201d</p><p>I walked over and opened the leather binding to see pictures of Beau as a baby. Pictures of the two of us in our football helmets when they were bigger than we were. Each page held memories of Beau\u2019s life. Every article where he\u2019d been mentioned in the paper had been carefully clipped and placed in the pages. After I turned the last page, I saw a picture of Beau in his practice gear standing on the field at Bryant-Denny stadium last week during practice. Lifting my eyes, I stared at my father and saw a man I didn\u2019t know existed.</p><p>\u201cI went to both your practices last week. You both made me proud.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head trying to take this all in, I sank down into the chair behind me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you reach out to him? If you have all this, you have to love him. You have to care about him. Why aren\u2019t you doing something about it? He needs you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hates me and I don\u2019t blame him,\u201d Dad said, taking the binder and placing it back in the drawer.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, he hates you. You\u2019re his father and he thinks you care nothing for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Beau. Better than anyone. Do you really think he\u2019d listen to me? That he\u2019d forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, he doesn\u2019t have to forgive you. He doesn\u2019t have to like you. But he needs to know you love him. That you\u2019re proud of him. All you have to do is tell him. How he handles it or takes it isn\u2019t what\u2019s important. What\u2019s important is that he knows. What\u2019s important is that you tell him.\u201d</p><p>Dad sat down at his desk and neither of us spoke. There was nothing more to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Lana</p><p>My mother was sitting on Aunt Sarah\u2019s couch drinking tea when Sawyer and I stepped into the living room.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d My aunt and uncle had welcomed me back and assured me they were just glad I was safe. They didn\u2019t know the details but understood I had a lot going on with my parents.</p> <p>\u201cLana,\u201d she smiled at me and then turned her smile to Sawyer. \u201cHello Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Ms. McDaniel,\u201d he replied politely.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming for a visit,\u201d I said, trying to figure out what was going on.</p><p>\u201cPaperwork came that you needed to sign and I figured we could go do that shopping for your dorm room,\u201d she explained.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t told Sawyer about Florida yet. I was afraid my mother was being optimistic and we might not actually be able to make it work. \u201cOh, um, okay,\u201d I trailed off, trying to think of a way to get Sawyer out of here before Mom said anything else about college.</p> <p>\u201cWould it be okay if I came too? Lana did get to help pick out my dorm necessities so it\u2019s only fair I get to help pick hers out,\u201d Sawyer drawled in an amused voice as he walked over to sit down in my uncle\u2019s recliner.</p><p>\u201cOf course. That would be lovely! Wouldn\u2019t that be lovely, Lana?\u201d my mother asked a little too enthusiastically.</p><p>How was I going to get out of this one?</p><p>\u201cMom, we need to make sure everything is sqaured away and okay before we go buying dorm stuff. I mean, there is still a chance this might not work and I\u2019ll need to stay home two years and go to a community college. What if the house doesn\u2019t sell?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer sat up from his relaxed position and leaned forward, \u201cWhat? Why might this not work? I was under the impression it was a done deal.\u201d He was directing his question to my mother like he knew what the heck he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cSawyer\u2014\u201d I began and was cut off by my mom.</p> <p>\u201cIt is Sawyer,\u201d she soothed. \u201cLana, the house is sold. I made enough money to pay for all four years of your education and buy myself a nice sized condo on the beach. That way when you run off and leave me for Florida I can still be close enough to my sister when I need some company.\u201d</p><p>She said Florida. Would Sawyer think I was chasing him? Smothering him? Cringing, I forced myself to meet his gaze. He grinned and stood up and walked over to me.</p><p>Both his hands wrapped around my waist and he pulled me up against him and bent his head down to whisper in my ear, \u201cDid you really think I would be this excited about college if I thought I\u2019d be leaving my girl behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew. And if you for one second try and back out of following me to Florida I will personally kidnap you and haul you there with me,\u201d he teased, and then pressed a trail of kisses across my face until his mouth hovered over mine. \u201cI\u2019m not losing you again. You\u2019re with me. I want you there beside me. Always.\u201d</p><p>*Beau</p><p>Sawyer bailed on me this morning, for a girl. I couldn\u2019t help but smile. I was the one who normally bailed on workouts. It was a nice change for it to be him not showing up. I couldn\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d want to go shopping with Lana and her mom. That woman was whack. Not to mention it was shopping. Who goes shopping with their girl? Then again, Ash had never asked me to go shopping with her. If she asked, I\u2019d go.</p><p>Running down the bleachers, I slowed my pace. This had been my hundredth trip up and down. It was time for weights. When I reached the bottom, I wiped my forehead with my towel and took a long swig from the water bottle I\u2019d left on the bottom bleacher.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Beau.\u201d The deep familiar voice behind me wasn\u2019t one I cared for. Putting my water down I slung my towel over my shoulder and turned around to face Harris Vincent, my uncle/biological father.</p><p>\u201cSawyer isn\u2019t here,\u201d I replied and headed down the last few steps and toward the field house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to see Sawyer. I\u2019m here to see you,\u201d Harris called out and I stopped walking. Me? He wanted to talk to me? His dirty little secret? I turned back around.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d was the only response he was getting out of me. I would stand here and listen to what he had to say for one reason and one reason only\u2014Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cI uh, I saw your practice last week. You looked good out there.\u201d</p><p>My practice? What the hell was he talking about? I had practices in Tuscaloosa. Surely, he didn\u2019t mean those.</p><p>\u201cI came to watch. You\u2019re gonna do good there.\u201d</p><p>Taking a step toward him so he could hear me without me yelling, I asked, \u201cYou came to my practice at Bryant-Denny? Why would you do that?\u201d The man hadn\u2019t even come to the hospital when I\u2019d broken my collarbone in little league. He wasn\u2019t exactly active in my life.</p><p>\u201cI went to see both my sons\u2019 practices last week.\u201d</p><p>I froze. He\u2019d called me his son. I started shaking my head, \u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t get to do that. I\u2019m. Not. Your. Son.\u201d</p><p>I had to get away from this man. He was Sawyer\u2019s father; I did not want to hurt him. But DAMN if he was gonna call me his son.</p><p>\u201cYou are my son. I don\u2019t deserve you but you are mine. You can deny me. You can hate me and you have every right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I do,\u201d I roared.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact, I\u2019m proud of the man you\u2019ve become. The man you\u2019ve become without any help from me.\u201d</p><p>I was taking loud hard gasps of air. What was he doing? Why was he doing this?</p><p>\u201cProud of me? Why? Because I can play some football? Because I\u2019m playing at your alma mater? Because that\u2019s just bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Harris shook his head, \u201cNo, not because you\u2019re playing on the same football field I once played on. Although, that does make me feel a touch of pride. I can\u2019t help it. But that is only a brief moment in your life. The man you turned out to be is what makes me proud. You made bad choices and you got on the wrong path but you were also strong enough to get off that path and find one that would take you somewhere in life. The world wanted to call you a loser but you were so much stronger than they realized. You fought back. You grabbed the life you wanted and you fought for it. Even when the rest of the world didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make anything of yourself. You proved them wrong. That, son, is why I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to yell from the top of my lungs at the unfairness of this moment. I\u2019d needed this man when I was young and scared. But now? I didn\u2019t need him now.</p><p>\u201cA wise man once told me that you don\u2019t have to forgive me. You don\u2019t have to like me. But you need to know I love you. That I\u2019m proud of you. All I needed to do was tell you. How you handle it or take it isn\u2019t what\u2019s important. What\u2019s important is that you know.\u201d He gave me a short nod and the worry lines and defeated expression as he turned around to walk away made something inside my chest burn. I didn\u2019t understand this but I didn\u2019t have to. Not right now.</p><p>\u201cHarris,\u201d I called out to his retreating form. He stopped and turned back to look at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, Beau?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed nervously unsure how to say this exactly. Because his words didn\u2019t make this better. It didn\u2019t fix the past. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of this just yet. I may never know what to make of this.\u201d I paused as a memory came to me of Harris standing at the fence during one of my high school football games as he thoroughly told-off my coach after I\u2019d been pulled from a game. I\u2019d missed practice the day before because my mama had gotten sick with the flu and I\u2019d needed to take her to the Urgent Care center in Mobile. It was the closest free health care place around.</p><p>I\u2019d been put in the game once the coach walked back to the sidelines. Every time I glanced back at the fence during that game, Harris had been standing there with his arms crossed in front of his chest as if he was standing guard over something or someone.</p><p>\u201cThat game, in high school when I\u2019d missed practice the day before. I was benched. Then, after coach got back from a very heated discussion with you, he put me in the game,\u201d I stopped and studied his face and saw the answer in his expression. \u201cYou forced him to put me in, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Harris gave me a sad smile, \u201cWasn\u2019t your fault you had to take your mother to see a doctor. It was an unfair decision on Coach Madison's part and I reminded him exactly how unwise of a decision it would be to leave his best wide-receiver on the bench.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t correct all the wrong. But it did tell me that at times, even if I didn\u2019t realize it, he had looked out for me. I\u2019d just not known. Other instances in my life when things looked bad and then all was suddenly okay with no explanation. Had it always been him?</p><p>\u201cCoach wasn\u2019t a big fan of mine,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Harris raised one eyebrow, \u201cWell, you weren\u2019t exactly the most dependable guy on the team.\u201d</p><p>I let out a short laugh. \u201cI played just as good hungover as I did sober.\u201d</p><p>The smile on his face wasn\u2019t something I was accustomed to seeing directed my way.</p><p>\u201cYou probably did,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>We stood there staring at each other as if we were afraid everything would go back to usual the moment he walked away.</p><p>\u201cLook, son,\u201d he cleared his throat, \u201cor Beau if that\u2019s what you\u2019d prefer I call you. If you want to go get something to eat sometime, or get a drink, or whatever... just call. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>He turned and started walking away when I didn\u2019t respond. Before he got too far away I called out, \u201cYou can call me son, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Epilogue</p><p>Four years later...</p><p>Sawyer</p><p>\u201cCome here, beautiful,\u201d I called out as I pulled off my helmet and held my arms open for Lana as she ran onto the field toward me. She was wearing her blue tank top that had the Florida Gator emblem on the front. I knew the back of it said Vincent #10. I\u2019d had it made for her before my first game this season. She squealed and jumped up into my arms.</p> <p>\u201cYou did it! You did it!\u201d She rained kisses all over my face and I enjoyed every minute of it while holding her up with my hands cupped on her tight little ass.</p><p>\u201cWell, I did have some help,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Laughing she ran her hands through my sweaty hair and kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all nasty, baby.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back and looked down at me and a smirk appeared on her perfect plump lips, \u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</p> <p>What about that amused her, I had no idea but it did. She looked to be on the verge of laughing about something. Then she grabbed my face and pressed those lips against mine and I didn\u2019t care anymore. I just wanted this.</p><p>\u201cCongrats, bro,\u201d Beau\u2019s voice called out and I opened my eyes as Lana let my mouth go. I slid her back down my body to stand beside me as I turned to see my brother walking toward me in crimson and white. Ashton was beside him in a jersey almost identical to Beau\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. You played good. That catch you made in the third was unreal. I had to keep myself from hooting on the sidelines.\u201d</p><p>Beau chuckled and shook his head, \u201cI warned them that although we whipped you guys the last three years that the best quarterback the SEC had ever seen would be starting this year.\u201d</p><p>Ashton let go of Beau to come over and hug Lana. It was our fourth year at the University of Florida. Ash and Lana talked several times a week. Beau and I managed to work out together on breaks when we were both back home. Beau even came to Christmas dinner the last two years. When he called our father \u201cDad\u201d before leaving to head back to school after that first winter break, I thought our dad was going to breakdown and weep.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t happened overnight but slowly Beau and Dad were finding ways to mend what was broken.</p> <p>Beau was planning to propose to Ashton during the SEC championship game this year. The Florida Gators and the Crimson Tide would face off one more time this season. Other than us, no one else had been able to touch Bama this year. The plan was to have our parents there, even Aunt Honey, when Bama faces the Gators in the SEC game. \u201cWill you marry me, Ashton Sutley Gray?\u201d would be flashed on the big screen in the last quarter when only one minute was left in the game.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to listen to hours of Beau\u2019s planning and scheming. He wants it just right.</p><p>I reached over and picked up Lana\u2019s left hand to kiss the marquis cut diamond that now rested on her ring finger. Our engagement, last month, hadn\u2019t been quite as big of a production, although it had made the ten o\u2019clock news. After winning my first game as the starting quarterback for the Florida Gators, I\u2019d bypassed all the media vying for my attention and gone straight to Lana as she made her way to me. The offensive line assistant coach had kept the ring tucked safely in his pocket during the game but he\u2019d placed it in my hand once the game was over. She ran into my arms like she always did after a game but this time, instead of picking her up, I dropped to one knee. I\u2019ll never forget the look on her face or the way she sounded when she\u2019d said \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>No longer was it me, Beau and Ash against the world.</p><p>I had Lana and she was the number one player on my team. </p> </body></html>"]
