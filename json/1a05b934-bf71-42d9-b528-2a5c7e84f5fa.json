I knew for my foolishness I deserved nothing more than to spend my remaining days there, a wretched captive, an illegally freeclaimed woman, alternately forced to attend to satiating Lucien Dredmore\u2019s lusts and left to pine in solitude for the life I had so thoughtlessly thrown away. This was what women like Lady Walsh endured.</p><p>But I was not Diana Walsh, and I\u2019d cut out my own heart before I allowed Lucien Dredmore to ever touch me again.</p><p>A thorough search of the chamber\u2014which despite its sumptuous trappings was little more than a prison cell\u2014turned up no exit or the means by which I might create one. The only entry had been locked in three places from the outside by his minion, Connell. Masonry had replaced the glass panes in the single window frame on the opposite wall, too. As I poked at the brick, I wondered how many other women had suffered this fate, and what had happened to them once Dredmore had tired of them.</p> <p>\u201cHe probably buries them under the rose hedges,\u201d I muttered, absently clutching at my pendant for comfort. \u201cPlease God, if you\u2019ll get me out of this I\u2019ll never glance at another man again. I swear it.\u201d I looked down at the dark stone and realized otherworldly intervention was right in my hand. \u201cBloody hell. Harry.\u201d</p><p>My eager fingers fumbled a bit with the clasp, but at last I released it and dropped the pendant on the floor, backing away from it quickly.</p><p>My grandfather\u2019s specter materialized instantly, and as soon as he looked round he shouted at me. \u201cDo you know where you are? Do you know who he is? Have you lost your tiny mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to see you, too,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up once I get out of here.\u201d When he didn\u2019t reply, I added, \u201cYou keep saying you\u2019re Harry Houdini, the world\u2019s greatest escape artist. Well, then here\u2019s your chance to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d He went to the window and poked at the brick. \u201cAfter what you\u2019ve done, it would serve you right if I left you here to rot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know what I\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guardian spirit knows everything. Watches everything, whether he wishes to or not.\u201d He eyed me. \u201cRomping with that bastard in the dirt like some scullery wench. If I were your father, I\u2019d give you the thrashing of your life.\u201d</p><p>He was right, but I refused to cringe. \u201cI suppose you never lost your head in a moment of passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. If I hadn\u2019t sired your mother, you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d He searched along the baseboards before testing the door. \u201cI was fortunate in my choice of wives. Bess forgave me my dalliance and took me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not named Bess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re named after my best mate\u2019s wife. I comforted her after his untimely death, rather more than I should have.\u201d He sighed and rubbed his eyes. \u201cThe result was your mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did have a forgiving wife.\u201d I sat on the bed. \u201cDid this Charmian raise my mother, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to think of her family and her other children,\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe remained secluded in the country for her confinement, and even kept your mother for a time after her birth. Her family grew suspicious, however, so she sent Rachel to me as soon as she was old enough to travel.\u201d</p><p>It had never occurred to me that there would be someone else I hated as much as Dredmore, until Harry began haunting me. \u201cHow did you persuade my mother to name me after the adulteress who abandoned her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, not directly. I merely insured that Rachel heard the name in a dream just before your birth.\u201d Harry glanced at me, and his anger faded into weariness. \u201cDon\u2019t judge your namesake so harshly, lass. Charmian never forgave herself for giving up our child. It broke her spirit as well as her heart. She died only a few years after sending your mother to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her the benefit of the doubt,\u201d I said, \u201cif you\u2019ll agree to overlook my lapse in judgment tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray you don\u2019t end up in the same condition as your grandmother.\u201d He eyed my belly before he turned round to inspect the rest of the room. \u201cThe door and window are impassible from the inside of the room. Even if you could get at the locks, there is nothing you can use to pick them.\u201d He turned about one last time, studying my prison. \u201cIt will have to be a possession, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d He floated out through the door.</p> <p>\u201cHarry!\u201d I went over and pounded on the door. \u201cCome back here.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, but in came Connell, who slammed the door behind him. I shuffled back, unsure if I should try to dodge round him or kick him in the unmentionables.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been ill,\u201d he told me as he walked right up to me and studied my face. \u201cYou believe you\u2019ve been poisoned. There\u2019s blood coming from your lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? There\u2019s no bloo\u2014\u201d</p><p>My head snapped as he slapped me, hard enough to make my ears hum.</p><p>\u201cNow there is.\u201d Connell handed me the container of scented powder. \u201cToss this in the guard\u2019s face. It will blind and choke him long enough for you to get outside. Then lock him in.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cConnell, why are you helping me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharm, it\u2019s me, Harry.\u201d For a moment I saw the old man\u2019s face appear atop Connell\u2019s, like a half-transparent mask. \u201cI\u2019ve taken possession of this man\u2019s body.\u201d He glanced down at himself. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d He stretched out an arm. \u201cVery strappy fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of there,\u201d I almost shrieked.</p><p>\u201cIf I dispossess him now, he\u2019ll regain his senses immediately and spoil your escape.\u201d Harry/Connell patted my cheek. \u201cNow remember, give the guard a good dousing with that powder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re possessing a guard, so why don\u2019t you simply walk me out of here?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo time to explain that now,\u201d my grandfather said. \u201cThere\u2019s a guard in the front hall, and one repairing the door you smashed in the kitchen. Once you get out of here, go to the servants\u2019 stairs and take the tradesmen\u2019s entrance out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I gingerly tested the bleeding cut on the inside of my lip before smearing the sides of my mouth with the blood to make it look more convincing. \u201cOnce I\u2019m outside, then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find three horses in the stables,\u201d he told me. \u201cSaddle the black gelding with the white star on his nose. Ride through the pasturelands, and don\u2019t allow anyone to see or stop you.\u201d</p><p>I stirred the powder with a fingertip. \u201cYou\u2019re certain this will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a hoodlum, you silly twit. I was Houdini.\u201d He gave me an awkward, one-armed hug. \u201cAnd your lover will not remain in town forever, so you had best get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormer lover.\u201d I dragged some hair over my eyes and went to stand by the door. \u201cDid you become Houdini as a cover for the spying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t worked it out yet?\u201d Incredibly, he chuckled. \u201cI possessed the body of a spy, Charm, and used him as my cover. Being a spy concealed the fact that I was, ah, Houdini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you have to hide that?\u201d I demanded. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve read everyone adored him\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone but your parents, and that story will have to keep for another time. Wait.\u201d He picked up my pendant from the floor and set it on a table near me. \u201cCount to ten after I leave, put this on, and don\u2019t take it off unless you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed now that I\u2019m . . . never mind.\u201d He opened the door and hurried out.</p><p>I slowly counted to ten before I put my pendant back on, drew a deep breath, and then bowed over, concealing the powder behind my arms. \u201cPlease . . . help me,\u201d I called out in a strangled, frightened voice. \u201cI\u2019m throwing up . . . blood. I think I\u2019ve been . . . poisoned . . .\u201d</p><p>I had to keep that up for several minutes until the brute who had brought me to the room from the garden stepped in and scowled at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d he demanded, peering at my face and then straightening. \u201cWhere did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I hurled the scented powder in his face, shoving him aside and darting past him through the door. As he coughed, I slammed the door shut and engaged the locks.</p><p>He began immediately swearing at me and hammering on the door\u2019s inside panel, but I didn\u2019t linger to hear his poor opinion of me. I ran down the hall to the servant\u2019s stairs then took them to the first floor, where I stood in the shadows until I saw the guard there rushing upstairs. Then I ran round the corner and fled to the deliveries door.</p><p>It refused to open at first, but then the knob gave way and I was outside. I scanned the grounds to look for other guards and saw the coast was clear.</p><p>Bunching up my skirts and running across the lawn put me in view of the house, but I felt sure I had another minute or two before Powder-face and Dredmore\u2019s other hooligans came after me. I made it to the stables and darted inside, stopping long enough to listen for a moment and glance out. Lamplight flicked against the side windows of the house, descending from the second to the first floor.</p><p>I turned and dashed to the stalls, where five black horses were watching me with some interest.</p><p>\u201cAll right, which one of you has a white star?\u201d I went to the center stalls, avoided a nip from a cranky-looking mare with a white stripe, and then found the gelding, a placid-eyed fellow who nuzzled my fingers looking for a treat.</p><p>\u201cSaves you for the ladies, does he?\u201d I glanced at the saddles hanging on the end wall before I took down a bridle from a post peg and unlatched the stall door. The gelding dipped his head as I bridled him, and only gave me a mild look of surprise when I tossed a blanket over his back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, no time for anything else,\u201d I told him, and climbed up the side of the stall to swing onto him. The only times I rode horseback were when I dressed as a native male, so I was used to sitting astride. For his part the gelding turned his head as if to inspect me. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, just pretend I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>I guided him out of the stall and rode him to the double doors, where I reached up for the latch pull. Dredmore had installed a mechanized opener, the wheels of which whirred as four telescoping bars pushed open the big doors. Through them I saw the indistinct shapes of two men halfway between the stables and the house.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s make a run for it.\u201d I thumped my heels into the gelding\u2019s sides, and he trotted out with a sedate, fastidious trot. \u201cI said run, my lad, not mince.\u201d</p> <p>After two more insistent thumps, the gelding reluctantly stretched his legs and galloped across the lawn away from the manor and across the clearing that led to the cliffs.</p><p>I reined in the gelding when I reached a grove of cypress and took cover there to watch for Dredmore\u2019s men. When the horse became restless, I stroked his neck. \u201cI know, George, first time you get a decent rider and now you have to wait. You don\u2019t mind if I call you George, do you? You look like a George.\u201d</p><p>George snorted and dropped his head to crop some grass.</p><p>I rode horseback often enough not to be sore, but one already tender portion of my anatomy made me acutely aware not only of how daft I\u2019d been, but why women were rarely seen in public the day after their weddings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wager he isn\u2019t suffering,\u201d I muttered to the gelding as I watched several men riding Dredmore\u2019s other horses gallop past. \u201cI imagine he\u2019s swaggering about and bragging of his conquest and feeling quite the master of all he surveys. I should have set fire to that damned hovel of his before I escaped.\u201d</p> <p>Once the posse had disappeared over the next hill, George and I came out of the cypress and went in the opposite direction, toward the first spread of pasturelands that surrounded the city. The gelding perked up as soon as we were in the clear, and I eased off the reins to let him have his head.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d I said as he went into that mincing trot again. \u201cThis is probably the only chance you\u2019ll ever have to really run.\u201d</p><p>George seemed to understand me and took off in a long, elegant lope that gradually increased in speed until we were fairly flying across the pastures. I glanced back now and then, but no one appeared behind us. Dredmore\u2019s men were too accustomed to dealing with ladies, I imagined.</p><p>I stopped the gelding twice: once to water him at a spring-fed trough in a cow pasture, and the second time just within sight of the city\u2019s streets. George had proven himself a worthy steed, so I abandoned my initial plan to turn him loose outside Rumsen and instead rode him through the back alleys to Halter\u2019s, a small stable near my flat that I often frequented.</p><p>A few minutes after I rang the service bell, John Halter came out of the barn in his shirtsleeves, his penders still hanging round his hips. \u201cWe don\u2019t open \u2019til dawn, so you can . . . sod me, Miss Kit? That you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, John, it\u2019s not me.\u201d I handed him the reins and dismounted. \u201cIt\u2019s just George here. Say hello to my mate John Halter, George.\u201d</p> <p>The gelding blew out some air.</p><p>\u201cMorning, George.\u201d John gave his neck a few gentle slaps. \u201cSo why is this big fellow getting me up out of bed before I\u2019ve had m\u2019tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night George wandered away from home and has since become lost,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can tell by the sadness in his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger looks right happy to me.\u201d The stablemaster frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s George\u2019s home, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Morehaven.\u201d</p><p>John swore softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watered and rested him. He\u2019ll need a rub and some feed, and his master will pay you when he comes to collect him.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019ll likely have some questions, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll let George answer what he can.\u201d John sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not here, Miss Kit. Best you go on home.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>From John Halter\u2019s I did go home, arriving at my door a few minutes before sunrise. I scowled at the row of wardlings nailed above the entry before I went inside and bolted the door behind me.</p><p>Glancing down, I saw how my night\u2019s adventures had reduced Bridget\u2019s beautiful gown to little more than a bundle of dirty rags. I stank of horse sweat and my own sweat, and something else.</p><p>Beneath it all, I smelled of Dredmore.</p><p>I was distracted from my dark thoughts by looking at my bare forearm. Dredmore\u2019s men hadn\u2019t found my pendant but had relieved me of all my other, borrowed jewels before locking me up; hopefully Bridget\u2019s husband could use his influence to get them back, because I could never afford to replace them. A suspicious little trickle between my legs made me crane my head round, and I saw spots of blood on the back of my skirt.</p><p>Reminders of more things that could never be taken back.</p><p>I ran to my bath, tearing off the gown before I grabbed my sponge and stepped into the tub. The cascade doused me in frigid water as I scrubbed myself all over, washing away the sweat and the blood, the dirt and the tears.</p><p>And Dredmore.</p><p>After ridding myself of all the unwanted reminders of the night before (as well as a layer or two of my skin) I dried my hair and dressed, ignoring the siren song of my sympathetic bed. I\u2019d triumphed over a tragedy of my own manufacture; my life would go on. My monthlies had just finished, so chances were that I would not become pregnant. If anything I could be grateful to Dredmore for smashing the last of my romantic notions.</p><p>Men and romance, two notions I fully intended to avoid in the future like the rats and plague they were.</p><p>When I arrived at the Davies Building, Horace Eduwin Gremley the Fourth stood hovering just outside the main entry. He rushed over as soon as he saw me turn the corner.</p><p>\u201cMr. Gremley.\u201d I bobbed. \u201cYou\u2019re in early today. Making up some hours to allow for an early day on Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. Ah, Miss Kittredge.\u201d His eyes darted back before returning to gaze at me with a kind of wild distress. \u201cI bear unhappy news this morning. Mr. Davies\u2019s solicitor paid an early call. About you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d I looked over his shoulder at the stone-faced doorman who was decidedly not watching us. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been evicted,\u201d Fourth blurted out. \u201cThis very morning, I fear. The solicitor quite forcefully communicated Mr. Davies\u2019s desire that you not be permitted in the building by the doorman or any of the other tenants. Unfortunately he was not at all forthcoming as to why such a grossly undeserved action is being taken.\u201d He twisted his hands together. \u201cI assured the man that you are the kindest and most considerate of tenants, but he refused to be swayed. I cannot fathom why Mr. Davies would do this to you.\u201d</p><p>I could. Walsh, or Dredmore.</p><p>I looked up at my office window. \u201cHave they closed it up, or cleared it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. Mr. Docket told the solicitor that he would see to your belongings.\u201d Fourth grimaced. \u201cAs soon as he mentioned casting them into the incinerator, the solicitor happily agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry,\u201d I told him. \u201cDocket is a mate; he won\u2019t torch my things. If you would be so kind as to drop him a note through the tube and say that I\u2019ll arrange for a cart to come round tonight, after the building closes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cMiss Kittredge, I cannot express how sorry I am about this. I will be writing a letter of protest to Mr. Davies as soon as I return to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind, Mr. Gremley.\u201d I patted his arm. \u201cBut under the circumstances, it would be wiser not to openly associate yourself with me.\u201d</p><p>His expression changed to one of unhappy understanding, and he offered me a sad smile. \u201cYou should know that your advice to me was brilliant. I was introduced to Maritza Skolnik by her father, who also obtained her consent to be my escort on Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Skolnik was no fool; within a fortnight he\u2019d have Mr. Gremley engaged to his daughter. But as she was a lovely, gentle creature, I imagined Fourth could look forward to a very pleasant future. \u201cI\u2019m so glad. I wish you and the lady all the best, sir.\u201d</p><p>Fourth hesitated before bending and giving me an awkward peck on the cheek. \u201cAs I hope for you, Miss Kittredge.\u201d With his face still turning red, he hurried off.</p><p>Davies had always been a conservative man but genial landlord; he wouldn\u2019t have thrown me out unless he\u2019d been given ample cause. Walsh, or Dredmore. Whichever man had made the complaint against me, I knew I would not be invited to renew my tenancy at this or any other of Davies\u2019s buildings.</p><p>I might have sought sanctuary with Rina or Bridget, both of whom had been completely justified in their advice to me, but I couldn\u2019t do it, not yet. Not until I found out which man was responsible.</p><p>I walked slowly back toward my flat, but had no interest in spending the day alone sulking. I also realized that there might be other reasons I was being hounded. What was Nolan Walsh hiding? Was it as Dredmore had hinted, that I\u2019d inadvertently stumbled onto something that threatened Walsh more than the scandal of divorcing his young wife?</p><p>And then there was Dredmore. He was a man of the world, an important man not to be trifled with. Why had he pursued me, and seduced me, and imprisoned me? I was young, healthy, and attractive, but hardly anything beyond that. Rumsen was filled with women whose beauty made me seem a veritable troll by comparison. Hundreds of posh, nubile women Dredmore could take to wife with a snap of his fingers\u2014professional, talented women he could purchase for the night or however long he wished to use them. Lucien was not only rich and mysterious, he was virile and handsome. Virtually any female within the city would be eager and happy to oblige him.</p><p>My stomach growled, so I changed direction and went to the fruit market, where the stands were just opening for the morning\u2019s business. There I walked along until I reached the old peach seller, who had just sliced open a red-gold beauty to release the delicious fragrance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was where Dredmore had claimed he had seen me the first time. Where he had . . . no, the most powerful deathmage in the country could not have looked across a market and fallen in love with me at first sight. One required a heart for such a thing to happen. But why would he wish me to believe he\u2019d done so?</p><p>\u201cTrying to tempt the browsers?\u201d I said over the open crates.</p><p>\u201cAlways, miss, always.\u201d She handed me a slice. \u201cNorth country golders, sweet as honey this year, they are.\u201d</p> <p>I popped the fruit in my mouth and found it to be precisely as she claimed, as well as sun-warmed and remarkably juicy. \u201cIt\u2019s scrumptious.\u201d</p><p>She looked side to side before shoving a small paper sack in my hands. When I reached for my reticule, she shook her head. \u201cA gift, dearie.\u201d She gave me a meaningful look. \u201cI\u2019ll wager you could use a bit of sweetness today.\u201d</p><p>That put me on alert. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over the crates. \u201cBunch of beaters came round earlier, asking after a gel who looks a bit like you. They said she lives a goldstone round the corner.\u201d When I glanced round she added, \u201cNo one knew this gel, \u2019course, so they went off. I heard one of them say something daft about looking for her in some eagle\u2019s nest.\u201d She straightened and said in a louder voice, \u201cMorning\u2019s a bit chilly, don\u2019t you think, miss? Best cover up until the air warms.\u201d</p><p>I drew my hood over my head. \u201cI will, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>If Inspector Doyle had sent beaters looking for me, it was either to bring me in on another phony charge or to give me protection. I wanted to believe it was the latter, and might have, if my eviction from the office hadn\u2019t taken place. Dredmore might have filed a charge against me as well, and he had a legitimate one: I\u2019d stolen George. Although anyone with enough coin to afford one motored about in a carri, horses remained the primary means of transport round the city. No young blue ever made a circuit of the parks in a carri, and even merchants who could afford a fleet of carris still kept horses as a show of their wealth and status. Because of this, horse thieves remained universally reviled by all the citizens of Rumsen, and when convicted were regularly sentenced to be whipped in public to serve as a warning to others.</p><p>Dredmore would love to see me bound to a punishment post and lashed until I bled, I thought, my mood dark. He\u2019d probably volunteer to ply the whip\u2014</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>As much as I hated him and his spectacular arrogance, Lucien had employed his unsavory methods in an attempt to protect me. Whatever we had been to each other before last night, the man and I were no longer enemies. I didn\u2019t know what we might become, but our interlude in the maze had changed everything.</p><p>I took my bag of peaches to a little children\u2019s park three blocks north of the market. A few nannies were pushing prams along the walks, but the benches and sandboxes were empty. I sat down on a bench half-hidden from the street by a large red-and-white-striped glory bush and took out a peach.</p><p>\u201cNorth country golders,\u201d Doyle said as he sat down beside me. \u201cI hear they\u2019re as sweet as honey this year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat they are.\u201d I took the other peach from the sack and offered to him.</p><p>We sat and ate the fruit in silence. Doyle left me briefly to purchase two mugs of spiced tea from a cart. I warmed my hands against the sides of the hot porcelain before taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cI came in to find a stack of complaints on my desk this morning,\u201d Doyle mentioned as we watched a fierce-looking nan bend over her pram to coo at her fussy charge. \u201cFunny thing, they all bore your name. Busy night, Kit?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>He blew some steam from his mug before tasting. \u201cThe commissioner would very much like to, what were his words . . . oh, yes. \u2018See that one dragged through the streets by her ankles.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I turned up my toes. \u201cNot much to them. Knots had better be tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also received a very interesting communication from Lord Dredmore.\u201d Doyle finished his tea with a few swallows. \u201cIt seems that someone trespassed onto his property last night and stole a black gelding from his stables.\u201d</p><p>I made my sigh heavy. \u201cHow terrible for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis particular gelding was trained to be ridden only by a lady,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cAnd yet no sidesaddle was found to be missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I heard someone mention rumor of a black horse this morning, too.\u201d I pretended to think. \u201cOh, yes. One was found at dawn standing outside Halter\u2019s stables. Lovely big black fellow, name of George.\u201d I glanced at him. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a man over to collect George and pay Halter for his troubles.\u201d He regarded me directly. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve told you how dreadful my morning has been, you will tell me exactly what you were doing last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore being kidnapped and held against my will at Morehaven, or after?\u201d I enjoyed the shock on his face. \u201cYou really should do some investigating now and then, Chief Inspector. I thought you Yardmen were trained for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Lord Dredmore abduct you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pompous, controlling ass; I\u2019m difficult to scare off, and we\u2019re competing for the same job.\u201d I dropped my peach pit back into the bag.</p><p>Oh, and he believes that he\u2019s in love with me. I kept that thought in my head.</p><p>\u201cWere there any witnesses to your abduction and captivity?\u201d Doyle persisted.</p><p>\u201cWho were not in the employ of Lucien Dredmore? Ah, no, sorry. He\u2019s not that stupid.\u201d I saw the lines round his mouth deepen. \u201cJust forget it, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do that just now.\u201d He put his hand over mine. \u201cDid he hurt you, Kit?\u201d</p><p>Beyond all hope of recovery, I was beginning to believe. \u201cNo. Dredmore could never do anything to me but make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Here was my opportunity for some genuine revenge. Tom Doyle could take me to a physick, who would examine me and find the physical evidence of what Dredmore and I had done. Since I was unmarried and had never been charged with soliciting favors from gentlemen, I could claim ravishment and have Dredmore charged with assaulting me. Without witnesses it would be difficult to see him convicted, but filing the complaint along would be enough to destroy his reputation. He\u2019d never again be invited to the governor\u2019s mansion to show off his grubby bag of tricks.</p><p>It will end here and now. The memory of Lucien\u2019s voice in the gardens at Morehaven echoed in my mind. All you need say is no.</p><p>\u201cNothing else happened between me and Dredmore last night that concerns the law,\u201d I told Doyle.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll change your mind after I tell you why I\u2019m here.\u201d He finished his tea. \u201cYou\u2019re wanted at the magistrate\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourt?\u201d I frowned. \u201cWhy, whatever for?\u201d</p><p>He took my mug from me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be arraigned on charges of practicing magic in a residential area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I did practice magic, which I don\u2019t, my office is in the business district.\u201d When he said nothing, I added, \u201cMy landlord had me evicted from the building about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe address cited in the warrant is for your flat, Kit.\u201d He rose and carried our mugs back to the cartlass, who tucked them in her wash bin before handing Doyle back fo\u2019pence for the return of her crockery.</p><p>I went to the fountain to wash the peach juice from my fingers, and was drying them with my kerchief when Doyle joined me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a barrister?\u201d he asked. When I shook my head, he sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ll need one. A good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t afford so much as a bad one, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, Kit,\u201d he snapped, startling a pair of passing nans. \u201cHave you any idea of how much trouble you\u2019re in? These are serious charges. Violation of trade practice law carries a sentence of three to five years, hard labor. What the devil have you been up to on the Hill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to help someone.\u201d Before he could shout again, I added, \u201cYou needn\u2019t fuss at me, Inspector. I was warned; I knew something like this might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are worth a bit of risk.\u201d I smiled up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d pay attention to the flowers for the next few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, Kit, but my beaters are standing just over there, and they\u2019d give chase.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll speak for you at court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd say what? You know I\u2019m a good lass because we played together as children? You\u2019ll get the sack.\u201d I turned round and held my wrists behind my back. \u201cDo your job, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later the cold steel cuffs of Doyle\u2019s shackles clamped over my wrists. \u201cCharmian Constance Kittredge, you are charged with practicing magic in a prohibited area. Be advised that anything you say while in my custody can be entered into evidence and used against you. You are permitted representation before the magistrate. If you cannot afford such representation, an aid-solicitor will be summoned to counsel you and speak on your behalf. Do you understand what I have told you?\u201d</p><p>The reasons, no, but the words, of course. \u201cI do, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, then.\u201d He arranged my cloak so that it covered my manacles and then took my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chief Inspector Doyle spared me the humiliation of taking me to Rumsen Main first to be glassed and recorded. While I knew eventually I would have my image and personal information added to the vast number of criminal countenances and case files kept in the police archives, the reprieve gave me a bit of time to decide what next I would do.</p><p>My enemy\u2014either Dredmore or Walsh\u2014had thrown down the gauntlet by having me hauled before the magistrate. My choices were to fight, arrange bail and flee, or surrender myself to an unhappy fate.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to run away or give up, which meant I needed to arm myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Montford District, the building where the magistrate courts were housed, stood in the shadows of Montford Central, the judgment courts. Both were named for Lord Montford, the Queen\u2019s Architect, whose building designs had been brought over along with Crown law after the Rebellion had been crushed. The only way I\u2019d ever see the inside of Montford Central was if I killed someone, burned down a block of houses, or did something equally as dastardly; Montford District was reserved for civil and common criminal cases.</p><p>I suppose I should have admired all the grandeur of the soaring Doric columns and the heavy chiselwork above the archways, but the stodgy, Crown-nodding affectedness of the building\u2019s design ruined any appreciation I might have for the bloody place. So did being hauled to it as a prisoner.</p><p>Doyle brought me into the great hall, which had been hung with paintings depicting the Empire\u2019s triumph over the rebels and stone plaquettes inscribed with tiresome axioms about the nobility of justice.</p> <p>\u201c \u2018 The law of the Crown is a spring of life,\u2019 \u201d I read one out loud as we passed it. \u201cDo you think our forefathers would agree, Chief Inspector, seeing as it put most of them facedown in shallow, unmarked graves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d he warned as he steered me through a security checkpoint and down to an entry marked Advocacy.</p><p>Inside were two chairs, a table, and a balding solicitor in a shabby suit who barely glanced at us. \u201cMorning. This the Murphy gel, or the Holmes boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKittredge,\u201d Doyle told him.</p><p>\u201cDamn it all. I told Scotty I didn\u2019t want that one before I left the office.\u201d The solicitor dug through his papers until he found a thick bundle of papers and scowled at me. \u201cYou know why you\u2019ve been brought up before the magis, miss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wrongly charged with practicing magic in a residential area,\u201d I said, sounding as forlorn as possible. \u201cAnd what is your name, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouglas Clark, at your service.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to get up or bow. \u201cYou can leave her, Chief.\u201d</p><p>Doyle removed my manacles. \u201cKeep your chin up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I watched him go before I sat down beside my aid-solicitor. \u201cI\u2019m not lying, sir. The charges being brought against me are utter nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always are, dearie.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019re young, which will help, although you can\u2019t claim ignorance of the law. That always sets hissonor\u2019s wig on end. Someone coerce you to wave your wand in the wrong place? Your da, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an orphan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Got a teller off last month for having a home seeing by blaming her brother for not paying their rent. And her without a proper license at all.\u201d Clark studied my face. \u201cWhat sort of magic you practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t go in denying your business, miss. They wouldn\u2019t file charges without hard evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have none. I\u2019ve never practiced magic.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the papers and scrabbled through them, his frown deepening with every page he turned. \u201cNo witnesses, no confiscations, no testimonies. That can\u2019t be right. Hang on, here it is.\u201d He pulled out a paper and held it up. \u201cHis lordship charges that the defendant bespelled her physical residence to protect the occupants and repel intruders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did nothing of the kind,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>He nodded absently. \u201cThey\u2019ve listed some enchanted objects that were found openly displayed on the exterior of your residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven wardlings, nailed above my entry,\u201d I said. \u201cPut there by a police warder, not me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe cops?\u201d He glanced up, completely perplexed. \u201cWhy\u2019d they want to ward your place, then?\u201d</p><p>I detailed the attack on me by the snuffmages as well as my subsequent detainment and drugging at Rumsen Main. \u201cI did not fashion or display the wardlings. There is no other magic item on the premises or in my possession.\u201d I almost reached for my pendant before I thought better of it. \u201cNor have I uttered a single spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d He dug down to the very last page of the charge statement, and after reading it sat back in his chair. \u201cThe charges are being brought by Lord Nolan Walsh. Himself \u2019s one of them bankers downtown what\u2019s got more money than H.M. What in sweet Mary\u2019s name did you do to bring his wrath down on your head, gel?\u201d</p><p>So Walsh, not Dredmore. An invisible burden lifted from my shoulders, not that I welcomed the tiny surge of relief that came with it. \u201cI\u2019m working for Lord Walsh\u2019s wife, Lady Diana. Someone inside his household has been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Clark held up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me any more. I can\u2019t have knowledge of that and stand for you.\u201d He studied the statement a second time. \u201cThis police warder, will she bear witness that she was the one who put up the protection at your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never read so much as a tea leaf in your kitchen?\u201d When I shook my head, he gathered up his papers and stuffed them in his case. \u201cThis is how it will go, then. I\u2019ll refute the charges, have you repeat the statements you\u2019ve made to me to the magis\u2014and only about the coppers warding your place, if you please\u2014and then we\u2019ll see just how much money the banker spent on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he bribed officers of the court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bring you up on charges, probably several of them.\u201d Clark regarded me steadily. \u201cBut it\u2019s your lucky day, my lass. He didn\u2019t think to bribe me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Clark and I were summoned before the bench a short time later. The wood-paneled courtroom was divided into two, and my aid-solicitor led me to a stand on the right in front of several rows of pews that were occupied here and there by several gentlemen, including Tom Doyle.</p><p>I nodded to Doyle but then saw the face of the young clerk sitting beside him. \u201cMr. Gremley?\u201d</p><p>Clark hushed me and had me sit in one of the two chairs behind the stand while he took the other.</p><p>\u201cNot a word out of you until I say so,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd not a peep about Walsh or working for the wife.\u201d</p><p>The bailiff entered, calling for everyone present to stand. \u201cAttention, attention, the seventh court of Rumsen city is now come to order, the Honorable Jason Newton presiding.\u201d</p><p>A stout middle-aged man in an ancient white wig and dusty-looking blue robes trudged in and took the chair behind the magistrate\u2019s desk on the platform at the center back of the court. He looked at me for several moments before saying, \u201cBe seated. Mr. Jones, you may present the first case.\u201d</p><p>The magistrate\u2019s clerk rose from his seat to the right of the bench and called out, \u201cCity of Rumsen versus Miss Charmian Constance Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>Clark urged me up on my feet again as the clerk handed the magistrate the warrant.</p><p>Magistrate Newton put on a pair of reading spectacles and reviewed the warrant. \u201cAid-solicitor Clark, Miss Kittredge appears to be charged with illegal practice of magic. How does she plead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot guilty, your honor,\u201d Clark said promptly.</p><p>\u201cBarrister Fordun,\u201d Newton said to the prosecutor. \u201cI dislike seeing unprotected young ladies in my courtroom. This had better be very good.\u201d</p><p>The man standing behind the opposite stand adjusted his new wig before standing, which gave Clark time to speak in his place.</p><p>\u201cIf it pleases the court and the Crown,\u201d Clark said quickly, \u201cmy client wishes to enter statements that will doubtless convince Your Honor to dismiss these charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, doubtless.\u201d Newton eyed me. \u201cWell, young miss? What have you to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>I went to the stand and tried my best bewildered look on the magistrate. \u201cYour Honor, I am being charged with practicing magic in my home, which is located in a residential area. I have never done so, and the evidence being brought forth to condemn me is police property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally it is in their custody,\u201d Fordun said. \u201cThey confiscate any magic paraphernalia in such cases, so that it might be presented in evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cThe wardlings that were found nailed above the entry to my flat are property that belong to the police, and were put there by a police warder. They are not mine, nor is their display my doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this warder present?\u201d Newton snapped.</p><p>\u201cHer supervisor is, Your Honor,\u201d I heard Doyle say behind me. \u201cI am Chief Inspector Thomas Doyle, assigned to Rumsen Main. After Miss Kittredge was the victim of an unprovoked and brutal attack, I sent our staff warder to search and secure the young lady\u2019s home, in the hope of preventing a second assault on her person.\u201d</p><p>The magistrate turned to Fordun. \u201cWhat other evidence do you have to support these charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman\u2019s home has not yet been searched, Your Honor,\u201d Fordun said quickly. \u201cI am convinced that when it is, we will find ample evidence of her crimes.\u201d</p><p>Newton sighed. \u201cInspector, you said your warder searched the young lady\u2019s home. Did she find anything unlawful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Honor,\u201d Doyle said, \u201cand she searched the premises quite thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds to me as if someone is trying to use my court to attack this young lady again.\u201d The magistrate handed the warrants back to his clerk. \u201cMiss Kittredge, have you at any time practiced magic in your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Honor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a statement to the contrary given by a titled gentleman,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cHe was most emphatic about her criminal behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he personally witnessed her committing these crimes?\u201d Newton asked with exaggerated patience.</p><p>\u201cThe gentleman in question is a pillar of the financial community, Your Honor,\u201d Fordun assured him. \u201cHis assurance of her character is certainly good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>The magistrate looked out. \u201cIs there anyone else present who has knowledge of this young lady\u2019s character?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do, Your Honor.\u201d That was Fourth, and he cleared his throat twice before continuing. \u201cI have enjoyed the privilege of being acquainted with Miss Kittredge as a business associate for several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness? What\u2019s this?\u201d Newton looked over the rim of his glasses. \u201cShe\u2019s a working gel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed she is, sir,\u201d Fourth said. \u201cShe keeps an office downtown in the Davies Building, where I am also employed. In all the years I have known her, Miss Kittredge has never once practiced any form of magic. She does not believe in it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI challenge this testimony,\u201d Fordun said at once.</p><p>\u201cMr. Jones, summon the court detector,\u201d Newton said.</p><p>I turned to Clark and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s a detector?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUseless,\u201d he murmured back. \u201cCoin holes, the lot of them, but old magis like Newton think they\u2019re infallible.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later an elderly man in a plain dark green robe was led into the courtroom. Milky cataracts occluded his eyes, and he appeared to be completely dependent on the clerk guiding him up toward the bench, for when the clerk stopped, so did the detector.</p> <p>\u201cMagistrate,\u201d the old man said in a surprisingly strong voice. \u201cHow may I serve the court?\u201d</p><p>Newton gestured for Fourth to join the old man, and the clerk guiding the detector turned him to face him.</p><p>\u201cHold out your hands, palms up,\u201d the clerk told Fourth. \u201cStand still and do not speak unless you are spoken to.\u201d</p><p>Fourth did as he was instructed, and the old man rested his fingers over both palms. \u201cYou are the witness whose testimony has been challenged.\u201d</p><p>Fourth swallowed. \u201cI am, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d The detector moved his fingertips over the palms under them. \u201cWhy are you here, young man?\u201d</p> <p>Fourth glanced at me. \u201cTo help a friend who has been unjustly persecuted, sir. That is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all.\u201d His wrinkled brow furrowed. \u201cSomething . . .\u201d He slowly turned his head toward me, although it was obvious from the vacancy of his eyes that he was stone-blind.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the prosecutor demanded, his tone impatient. \u201cIs the boy lying to protect this female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The old man turned back toward Newton. \u201cThis young man speaks the truth, Magistrate. His testimony may be accepted as such.\u201d</p><p>Fordun seemed to explode. \u201cI challenge the use of this detector, Your Honor. He is clearly unable to discern the falsehoods being presented by this boy. I demand to bring forth my own detector, who will refute his findings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d the detector said as he nodded at the prosecutor, \u201cis your liar, Magistrate. I needn\u2019t touch him to ferret that out.\u201d</p><p>Newton sighed. \u201cSit down, Mr. Fordun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not on trial,\u201d Fordun snapped. His voice rose to a near-bellow as he addressed the magistrate. \u201cYour Honor, I vigorously insist you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn my court, sir, you insist on nothing,\u201d Newton shouted over him. \u201cNow take your seat and stay your tongue, or I\u2019ll have you charged with contempt and hauled out of here in shackles.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately for Fordun, he appeared so furious as to be rendered speechless, and stalked back to his seat. The detector tugged at his guide until the clerk brought him over to me and Clark.</p><p>The old man held out his hand but didn\u2019t touch me. He seemed to be fanning me as if he were afraid I\u2019d faint. \u201cRemarkable. I can almost feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel what?\u201d Clark wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNothing that is lost is gone forever, my dear,\u201d the detector said to me, but not in a kindly or reassuring manner. He sounded so stern it almost seemed like a reprimand for some wrong I had done.</p><p>I felt puzzled, but he had supported Fourth, so I tried to be polite. \u201cI will remember that, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His lips drew back from yellowed teeth in a pained grimace. \u201cI think you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it pleases the court,\u201d Fordun said, and barely waited for Newton\u2019s nod before he continued, \u201cI believe from the detector\u2019s address of this defendant that she has somehow tampered with his ability to carry out his duties. Indeed, she may have bespelled him as well as her aid-solicitor before being brought before Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>The detector chuckled and shook his head. \u201cAs she is, she can bespell no one and nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were not asked to testify,\u201d Fordun flared.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your service, detector,\u201d Newton said, and gestured for the clerk to remove the old man. As soon as he left, the magistrate clasped his hands and regarded Fordun. \u201cBarrister Fordun, in consideration of your previous service to the Crown, I will not issue an arrest warrant for you on charges of obstructing justice and accepting bribes. However, I do intend to file a lengthy and detailed complaint with your superiors. If you have accepted some sort of remuneration for these theatrics of yours today, I suggest you spend it at once, or hide it under your mattress evermore.\u201d</p><p>The prosecutor paled. \u201cYou cannot suspect me of wrongdoing, Your Honor. I am charged with enforcing Her Majesty\u2019s law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, sir, you have utterly failed the Crown today.\u201d Newton toyed with his gavel as he regarded me. \u201cMiss Kittredge, I would very much like to hear precisely why you are really here in my court, but I daresay that once I know the reason it will cause an equal amount of havoc in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless it would, Your Honor,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He glared at Fordun. \u201cI find that the Crown has not fulfilled its obligation of presenting proper evidence or any lawful substantiation of the charges against the defendant. The charges against Miss Kittredge are hereby vacated, and this case is dismissed.\u201d</p><p>He slammed his gavel down once.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay the holidays at the farm,\u201d Doyle said as he tucked the riding blanket over my skirts. \u201cMum wouldn\u2019t let you leave before Christmas, and the snow usually cuts off the roads up there until well into February anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to your parents\u2019,\u201d I told him for the third time. \u201cI have to work\u2014I have to find a new office\u2014and my home is here in the city.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t start the motor. \u201cLord Walsh will be out for blood now, Kit. He won\u2019t rest until he\u2019s driven you from Rumsen, and that might well be in a gravecart.\u201d</p><p>Snow was beginning to fall, so I pulled up my hood and tugged on my gloves. \u201cIf that happens, Chief Inspector, then I\u2019m counting on you to send him to the gallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang you, Kit.\u201d He thumped the dash with his fist. \u201cYou\u2019d rather lose your life than give up this damned independence of yours?\u201d</p><p>I saw a dark figure standing between the two court buildings. Not a flake of snow marred his long black hair, and not an ounce of pity softened his eyes. I thought he might approach us, but he simply stood there watching.</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t live as I want,\u201d I countered, looking away from Dredmore to Doyle, \u201cthen why go on?\u201d</p><p>A loud whine turned into a quick smash, and a large, jagged hole appeared in the glasshield in front of me. I glanced down to see gleaming shards covering the blanket over me, toward which Doyle pushed my head.</p><p>\u201cStay down\u2014\u201d He drew his pistol and leapt out of the carri, crouching down low.</p><p>Someone had shot at us. I heard another bullet ping off the radiator grill before Doyle fired in return and men began shouting.</p><p>I lifted my head just enough to see over the dash, and watched as Dredmore advanced on a red-cloaked figure taking cover behind a tree. He ignored the shots being fired at him as he brought up both hands and made a strange slashing gesture.</p><p>The tree fell over, its trunk sliced apart. A moment later a wide spray of red splashed the snowy ground, and the head of the snuffmage rolled through the gruesome puddle.</p><p>Doyle jumped in and started up the motor. \u201cHold on, Kit.\u201d</p><p>He drove off toward the street at a reckless speed.</p><p>I stared back at Dredmore, who was standing over the dead assassin, and then focused on my hands, mainly to avoid seeing the drivers frantically diverting their horses and carris out of our path. \u201cThat was meant for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Doyle gave me a quick glance. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Seeing Dredmore kill with just a gesture, however, was making my heart pound in my ears.</p><p>A few minutes later Doyle stopped the carri in front of my goldstone, but when I tried to climb out he caught my arm.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd freeze? Why?\u201d My eyelashes and hair were already icy, but then I saw the front entry to my flat standing open. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Doyle snatched at me but I was too fast for him. I nearly fell as my boots slid on the icy slush covering the floorboards of my front hall, and I grabbed a wall hook as I spotted the broken glass and wilted flowers on the threshold of my front room.</p><p>\u201cThey might still be in here,\u201d Doyle told me as he caught up. \u201cGo outside and wait like a good gel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave off, Tommy.\u201d I picked my way round the slush and went into my flat.</p><p>Whoever had broken into my home had not been instructed to take anything; every possession in the room had been systematically smashed, slashed or shredded. A plaster-dusted, twenty-pound hammer lay on the floor under the holes it had knocked through my paintings and walls. Cold wind washed my face as it blew in through the shattered windows, and had begun to freeze all the food that had been emptied out of my icebox and pantry.</p><p>More ice was forming from the puddle coming out of my bath; I looked in to see three small fountains of water gushing from the pipes that had been torn out of the walls. My sink and old bathtub had also made the acquaintance of the hammer, judging by the pieces they lay in.</p><p>At first I couldn\u2019t understand the torn, twisted mound of material heaped atop my commode, until I made out the pattern of my favorite red bodice. Every garment I owned had been emptied out of my armoire and dressers, torn apart, and shoved into the loo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To my surprise, seeing the destruction of my wardrobe hurt most. I\u2019d never been much of a fancy dresser, but because I\u2019d left Middy with only the clothes on my back, it had taken me years to put together a decent, serviceable supply of skirts, bodices, and cloaks. Some I\u2019d taken in trade for my services; others I had saved for months to afford. And there, dangling from beneath the pile, a torn strip of pink from the gown Rina had lent me, the gown I\u2019d not had the chance to return.</p><p>My friends had dressed me in their finery; my foolishness had now cost two gowns, my virtue, my office, and my home. What did I have left?</p><p>\u201cKit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe main shutoff valve for the pipes is out by the boiler,\u201d I told Doyle. My voice sounded flat and hollow, echoing in my own ears. \u201cOr whatever is left of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit.\u201d He put a hand under my elbow. \u201cCome away now.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my arm away. \u201cGo and shut off the water before the place floods out. Please, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he left I went to my cashsafe to see if I did have anything left. The door had been badly dented, but it had not been opened; the locks had held. Quickly I used the combination to release them and clean out the safe, putting all the cash I had to my name in my reticule. Happily I\u2019d never trusted banks, and kept only a small amount of funds in my business account, to which Walsh had likely already helped himself. Then I went upstairs to see what more he\u2019d done.</p><p>Doyle stood waiting at the bottom of the stairs when I came back down. \u201cDid they get at the rest?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cHe must have sent in a whole gang. By the look of things they were well paid, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my men question the neighbors,\u201d he assured me. \u201cWe\u2019ll find them, Kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d My heart felt like a stone in my chest. \u201cIf you would post a beater outside to watch the place, I\u2019ll have someone over before nightfall to board up the windows and doors.\u201d I walked out.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Before I could answer, he said, \u201cWherever it is, he\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back at him. \u201cNot this time, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Wrecker met me on the street halfway to the Eagle\u2019s Nest; he removed his cap and held it between his hands but couldn\u2019t seem to get any words out.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d I told him. \u201cI need someone to board up the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on his way.\u201d He scuffled his heels round the snow a bit. \u201cI\u2019m real sorry, Miss Kit. No call to be doing such things to a lady like you. Carri\u2019s over here.\u201d</p><p>Wrecker drove me the rest of the way to Rina\u2019s house, where I found her wrapped in furs and pacing back and forth in the alley. As soon as she spotted us she ran to the carri and practically dragged me out of it.</p><p>\u201cBugger all, Kit. Someone said you\u2019d nearly been shot outside court. I nearly worried myself into the vapors.\u201d She smothered me with her furry collar before holding me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cInside. Now.\u201d</p><p>I followed her inside, up the stairs and into her chambers, where she divested me of my cloak and used her fingers to loosen the icy tresses round my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put a tray upstairs, madam,\u201d Almira said as she came out of the kitchen. \u201cMiss Kit.\u201d She folded me into her arms and gave me a tight hug. \u201cGo on with you.\u201d</p><p>Rina guided me upstairs to her chambers and forced me to drink a cup of tea so hot it scalded me into silence. Which was handy, as she had a great deal to get off her chest.</p><p>\u201cBleeding Walsh\u2019s going to pay for this, I swear on the cross.\u201d She threw her furs over a chair and kicked a tuffet across the room. \u201cHaving you tossed out your office, then taken into court like some two-pence alley-tart\u2014and then, while you\u2019re ducking bullets, razing your place? It\u2019s too much, even for a nobheaded, tightassed son of a poxbox like him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d For some reason I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Dredmore, and how quickly he had killed the snuffmage outside court. Why had he come there? To see me convicted, and applaud as I was sent off to prison? Or to bribe someone to place me in his custody? Why had he bothered to defend me?</p><p>\u201cWrecker\u2019ll do him in a minute,\u201d Rina was still ranting. \u201cNo, I think he\u2019ll do him in hours and hours, while we have a bottle of wine and watch and make useful suggestions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRina.\u201d I waited until she looked at me. \u201cWrecker will do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after what old blueballs did to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo killing, no torture,\u201d I told her flatly. \u201cThe same goes for Dredmore. He saved my life.\u201d I set down the cup before rising and reaching for my cloak.</p><p>She positioned herself in front of the door. \u201cYou\u2019re not going back out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d Even if I had nowhere else to go. \u201cIf Walsh learns that I\u2019m here, he\u2019ll come after you and your gels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, God.\u201d Her smile was a dreadful thing to behold. \u201cLet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him do things to you that make my misfortunes look like a spring stroll down the prommy?\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll call on Bridget\u2019s Charles. He\u2019ll squash Walsh like a gnat.\u201d She went to her desk. \u201cI\u2019ll have him come round and you can tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina. Stop.\u201d I joined her at the desk and took the pen and foolscap out of her hands. \u201cJust stop now. It\u2019s done. It can\u2019t be undone, none of it.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cDo you even know what you look like, Kit? You\u2019re as white as bone. There are marks on your wrists from the shackles and glass all over your bodice. You\u2019re shaking.\u201d She held out trembling hands. \u201cGod blind me. I\u2019m shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re angry, and hurt, and frightened.\u201d I touched her cheek. \u201cBut one thing we\u2019re not, the one thing we will never be, is daft. We need to take some time now to think and to plan.\u201d I put my reticule in her hands. \u201cThis is every pence I have left in the world. I need you to hold it safe for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t risk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. I needed a new gel\u2014and so I hired one.\u201d She tucked a piece of my hair behind my ear. \u201cName of Connie. A bit dark and on the skinny side, but some gents like that.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWalsh knows my middle name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Rosie, or Lucy, or . . .\u201d She stopped and suddenly smiled. \u201cPrudence.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cIf I like the looks of someone, can I give him a free one?\u201d I asked my new employer, and then hissed as a hairpin dug into my scalp. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not selling or bartering or giving anything to anyone under my roof,\u201d Rina told my reflection. She pinned the new switch in several more places. \u201cYou\u2019re a good gel, and you\u2019re going to stay that way.\u201d</p><p>I tucked my bottom lip under my top teeth to keep from correcting her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that; you\u2019ll scrape off the tint.\u201d She sprayed my switch with a light mist of her perfume and stepped back. \u201cYou make a pretty hothead.\u201d</p><p>I studied my reflection in Rina\u2019s vanity glass, turning my head this way and that. The elegant scarlet curls of the expensive hair switch should have made my tanned skin appear yellow, but instead they brought out the pinkish tones and gave me a rosy look.</p><p>\u201cBridget has freckles,\u201d I mentioned. \u201cI always wanted freckles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always wanted to be a man, a firebrigader, a pilot, and seven feet tall. Let us be grateful that heaven has remained stone-deaf to your prayers.\u201d She went to her working-hours armoire. \u201cTake off everything, including your drawers.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t mind the switch or the lip tint, but I couldn\u2019t imagine myself parading about in one of Rina\u2019s filmy business garms. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I be Prudence the new scullery, or Prudence the apprentice cook?\u201d</p><p>She began pushing hangers back and forth as she searched through a rainbow of cutout velvets, thin silks, and spangled nettings. \u201cHe\u2019ll be expecting that.\u201d</p><p>I got up and joined her. \u201cBut my posing as a working strumpet would be a complete stunner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may stir up trouble on the Hill, poke your nose in the wrong corners, and have all the worst sort of friends\u201d\u2014she turned and held a bronze satin corset against my front before replacing it in the armoire\u2014\u201d but you\u2019re still a decent woman with a business and your own home. You\u2019re regarded as such by all who know you. Women like you would rather starve, go to prison, jump a cliff, or embrace a blade than give it up for money.\u201d An odd look came over her face. \u201cNo matter how desperate you lot become.\u201d</p><p>She was only repeating the words her father had hurled at her the one time she had tried to see him. I knew because I had taken her. \u201cRina.\u201d</p><p>The side of her mouth curled. \u201cNo worries. We\u2019ll need a nudie. Be right back.\u201d She hurried out.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what a nudie was, so I went to refill my tea and sat down on the window seat. Fingers of icy air poked at me from where they crept under the sill, and I saw drifts piling up on the street below. The temperature was still dropping, which would keep trade light tonight.</p><p>It had been a bright and sunny day two years ago when I\u2019d taken Rina on the shopping expedition. She\u2019d hated the proper bodice and skirts I\u2019d lent her for the excursion, and had refused to take off her hat and veil, even when we stopped for tea and cakes. I hadn\u2019t understood until after I made her come with me into the glove shop.</p><p>\u201cYou paid for tea, and you need a new pair for church,\u201d I\u2019d argued as I dragged her in through the entry. \u201cBesides, I can\u2019t afford anything grander than kid, so they\u2019ll be warm and serviceable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d She looked at the proprietor, who was coming round from behind the counter to wait on us. \u201cI\u2019m certain that you\u2019ll find that here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLadies.\u201d The shopkeep, a pleasant-faced older man with ruddy skin and a suggestion of native round the eyes, bowed politely. \u201cMay I be of service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to see something in thin kid for my friend here,\u201d I told him as I ushered Rina over to the counter.</p><p>\u201cI have all colors dyed, bleached, or natural,\u201d he said, holding out his hand to Rina. \u201cIf the lady would let me size her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t,\u201d Rina said, taking off her hat and veil and gazing at him with big eyes. \u201cI\u2019m a four slim, remember?\u201d</p><p>Watching the change that came over the shopkeeper was like seeing a man turned to stone. \u201cCarina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Da.\u201d She offered him a beautiful smile. \u201cHow\u2019s trade?\u201d</p><p>Much bellowing had followed, all from the glovemaker, who had called his daughter nine kinds of a slut before I\u2019d tried to intervene. Then he had told me exactly why he and his family had washed their hands of their strumpet daughter before kicking us out of the shop.</p><p>Once we were in the cab I hailed, I\u2019d turned to Rina. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that was your father\u2019s shop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have gone in, and I wanted to see him,\u201d she\u2019d said simply. \u201cI haven\u2019t, you know. Not once since Medford broke our engagement. Last time I saw Da was when he\u2019d tossed me out the house and bolted the doors. When I wouldn\u2019t leave the front stoop he had the servants summon a beater to drive me off.\u201d</p><p>That was the last of our shopping excursions, and although I hadn\u2019t known until it was too late, I\u2019d always felt guilty over causing the ugly reunion. Now I\u2019d reminded her of it again.</p><p>Rina returned with what appeared to be a pair of flesh-colored stockings sewn to the bottom of a thin corset-style bodice in matching fabric. \u201cHere, this one should fit you.\u201d</p><p>My gaze went to the open crotch. \u201cI can\u2019t wear that contraption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a nudie, and it\u2019s to preserve your modesty, madam.\u201d She tossed the odd garment at me. \u201cYou wear it under your negli, and it keeps your naughty bits from showing through.\u201d</p><p>I held up the crotchless bit. \u201cNot here, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right. Sorry.\u201d She went to her dresser and began sorting through her lingerie. \u201cThe open crotch is for convenience; some gents can be too impatient to wait.\u201d</p><p>She produced something that looked to me like a thin nappy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to diaper me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re called knickers,\u201d she explained as she brought the abbreviated garment to me. \u201cAll the rage across the pond.\u201d When she saw my face she held it up against her pelvis. \u201cYou see? You put them on just like drawers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m to wear drawers without legs under stockings and a corset without a crotch and then a gown on top.\u201d I caught the knickers she tossed to me. \u201cCouldn\u2019t I pretend to be a client? A fully dressed, male client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Rina admitted, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t any men\u2019s clothes small enough for you here. I\u2019ll send out for some tomorrow, but in the meantime you\u2019ll have to be patient, Prudence.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a narrow look. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnormously.\u201d She went round me and began unfastening my waister. After a moment she added, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to go off on you before, love. That business with Da back then, that was all on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never stopped wishing I could do something about it.\u201d I pulled my bodice carefully over my head so as not to dislodge the switch. \u201cExpose Medford\u2019s son for what he did, or at least make him tell your da the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one would believe the word of a woman over a man\u2019s,\u201d Rina said, her tone firm. \u201cIf someone had, the rot bastard would\u2019ve just had all his mates swear that I\u2019d bedded them, too.\u201d She helped me step out of my skirts. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something happier, please. Like that clerk from your building who stood up for you in court. He sounds promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourth?\u201d I chuckled as I stripped out of my drawers and held up the knickers. \u201cHe\u2019s just a lad. Besides, I practically have him married off already. Do I put both feet through the holes here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne in each.\u201d She held my elbow to keep me from toppling over. \u201cYou\u2019ve not lost your head over that towheaded copper, I hope. He\u2019s pretty enough until you see all that disgusting truth and justice gleaming in his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector Doyle\u2019s a good sort.\u201d I hauled the knickers up until they covered my front and back bits. \u201cHe spoke up for me in court, you know. He didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Rina held out the nudie. \u201cStep into it. That\u2019s it.\u201d As I braced my hands against her shoulders, she pulled the flesh-colored garment up my legs and over the knickers. \u201cMaybe he fancies you. He\u2019ll want marriage and a baby every year, you know. His sort always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not having babies; Tom Doyle\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s.\u201d While Rina laced up the back, I pulled over my shoulders the short penders and buttoned them to the edge of the corset, which kept the flimsy, skintight contraption in place. \u201cMarriage is also not in the cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCards can be shuffled, love.\u201d She came round to inspect the front. \u201cOnce this thing with Walsh goes away, you can move on, start over. Maybe go up to Settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll it does there is rain.\u201d I plucked at the fabric clinging to my breasts. \u201cThis is too small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Stop fussing.\u201d She brought a sheer gown made of diagonal strips of black net and deep gray satin over from the armoire. \u201cThis one will do.\u201d</p><p>I refused to allow the colors to remind me of Dredmore. \u201cCan\u2019t I wear something with a bit more cheer to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a lovely little pink thing,\u201d Rina said. \u201cThat and a switch with ribbons and tails, and you can play Daddy\u2019s Despair.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cI\u2019ll wear the black and gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward.\u201d A knock sounded on the door, making Rina glance at her pin watch. \u201cIt\u2019s past time I got downstairs to manage the gels. Finish dressing and then go to the Amber Room on two. And unless you want to earn your keep the hard way, Kit, keep the damned door locked.\u201d</p><p>Draping myself in the black and gray gown didn\u2019t make me feel any less naked, but I didn\u2019t see anything showing through when I checked the full-length glass. Wearing the garments of a working strumpet had to be my most scandalous disguise yet, but after I made a few rounds of the room I began to appreciate the lightness of the nudie and the unrestricted movements I could make in the loose gown.</p><p>Comfortable as I was, it still required a fair amount of nerve to step out into the hall and make my way to the stairs. There I froze halfway to the second floor as a blond gel with an older gent passed by me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a decent fire built?\u201d the man was asking her. \u201cMy feet are ice blocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries, dearie.\u201d The strumpet dropped me a wink. \u201cI\u2019ll have you thawed in no time.\u201d</p><p>The man hadn\u2019t even glanced at me, I realized, and I chuckled as I continued down. My costume was as good as a cloak of invisibility.</p><p>A few gels had already brought up their first clients of the night, judging by the noise coming from behind the closed entries I passed. I heard one shrill voice demanding to be spanked harder, and cringed as the gel in the room obliged, making him shriek all the louder.</p><p>\u201cHey, Birdie\u2019s been holding out on us,\u201d a sodden voice said behind me, and a damp hand turned me round to face three gents and the gels they\u2019d hired. The one holding my arm grinned and stepped closer. \u201cOh, I do like gingers, I do. What\u2019s your name, ducks?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019At\u2019s Prudence.\u201d The busty blonde clinging to his arm tried to pull him back and gave me a hard look. \u201cHer\u2019s been hired out for an all-nighter, \u2019aven\u2019t you, dearie?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and tried to hurry off, but the blonde\u2019s gent wouldn\u2019t release me.</p><p>\u201cMust be good,\u201d the drunk told his mates. To me he said, \u201cWhatever he\u2019s paid, I\u2019ll double it.\u201d He tried to shove me into the blonde. \u201cI want to see the two of you have a go at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t entertain ladies,\u201d I said without thinking, which made all three men burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cGel\u2019s got a sense of humor, too. Capital.\u201d The drunk cuffed my shoulder. \u201cTell you what, Pru. Since you\u2019re so shy, you can play the maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d a voice I had never wanted to hear again said. \u201cShe cannot.\u201d</p><p>I looked between the drunk and the blonde and saw the dark figure standing just beyond the group. He\u2019d donned a heavier cloak and a mask that covered every feature above his mouth, but the voice was unmistakable.</p><p>I glanced at the blonde. If I went with her and her client, I\u2019d have to perform an illegal sexual act with another woman for which the Church said I would be damned for all eternity. Or I could go to Dredmore.</p><p>I really had to think about it.</p><p>\u201cMilord.\u201d I didn\u2019t smile or natter on about how happy I was to see him; I had a few shreds of pride left. I gestured in the direction of the Amber Room. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t go running off to do the dirty right away, ducks,\u201d the drunk said, and wheeled round to give Dredmore a foolish grin. \u201cCome and have a drink with us first.\u201d</p><p>I waited for Dredmore to refuse the offer. Instead he came and put an arm round me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be delighted,\u201d he told the drunk.</p><p>I felt no shame in playacting the strumpet. My garms may not have been to my personal taste, but I didn\u2019t consider myself superior to Rina or her gels. Had fate been only a fraction more unkind to me, I might have sold myself on the streets of Middy.</p><p>But to be marched along and obliged to behave like Dredmore\u2019s whore made me feel as if I\u2019d poured several gallons of lamp oil over my head while standing next to a bonfire. It wouldn\u2019t take much of a spark to set me off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why had he come? Furthermore, how had he known that I\u2019d be here?</p><p>You\u2019ve been spending too much time in the company of strumpets.</p><p>I held my tongue until we reached the large party chamber the gents had rented for their revelries. I couldn\u2019t make myself cross the threshold, not until I felt Dredmore\u2019s hand at the small of my back.</p> <p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cBored.\u201d I wondered how I might get rid of him in front of six witnesses. Perhaps when he lit one of his infernal cigars I would accidentally tip an oil lamp in his lap.</p><p>At first glance Rina\u2019s party room resembled a parlour, with settees and lamps and elegant drapes. Then I noticed how wide the settees were, and some baskets that contained unmarked bottles of golden liquid, lengths of satin ribbon, and, of all things\u2014</p><p>\u201cPeacock feathers?\u201d One of the gents reeled over to a basket and plucked out a long plume. \u201cNow, what can you do with one of these beauties, love?\u201d</p><p>His strumpet, a leggy brunette who had thin lips beneath too much tint, whispered something in his ear, making him roar with laughter.</p> <p>Dredmore steered me round the others to a settee by the crackling fire in the hearth. Rather than sit I leaned against one arm and held out my hands as if to warm them.</p><p>He hovered, not quite touching me but close enough to keep the others from hearing him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have run from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run.\u201d I turned my hands over and wriggled my fingers. \u201cI rode.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI suppose I should be grateful that you left Velvet at a decent stable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVelvet.\u201d Of course, because he was black.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t name him.\u201d He came to stand beside me. \u201cYou could have killed yourself, riding alone in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced up at him. \u201cDisappointed?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cI came to court today for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw,\u201d I acknowledged. \u201cYet you never made it into the courtroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting by the prisoner\u2019s gate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they brought you out, I was going to take you from them. Then I had to deal with that snuffmage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor which I am grateful, Lucien.\u201d I had to say that much.</p><p>He regarded me for a long moment. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two bickering already?\u201d The drunk thrust a tumbler of gin into Dredmore\u2019s hand and then presented me with a much smaller measure in a finger glass. He lifted his own drink, sloshing a bit over the brim as he toasted me. \u201cHere\u2019s to all the gels with ginger curls, be they east or west, they shag you best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the compliments of discriminating, fine young gentlemen.\u201d I pretended to take a sip and watched Dredmore do the same.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, you two.\u201d The drunk gave me a playful push that almost knocked me over. \u201cHave a sit and get acquainted.\u201d</p><p>To avoid another shove, I went and sat on the end of the settee farthest away from Dredmore. Naturally he followed and boxed me in by seating himself directly beside me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d The drunk patted my head with a clumsy hand before stumbling back over to the blonde.</p><p>I felt Dredmore\u2019s arm snake along my shoulders as I watched the others cavorting. \u201cMadam Eagle will not allow you to remove me from the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGing doesn\u2019t seem to fancy you as much as me, mate,\u201d the drunk called out, and slapped the blonde on the hip. \u201cThis one\u2019s more than willing, if you want a swap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I fancy him, sir.\u201d Before Dredmore could accept the offer, I turned and linked my arms round his neck. \u201cI just take a little while to warm up.\u201d</p><p>I swung a leg over his, straddling him much as he had done to me last night, which allowed me to hide the hand I slipped between our bodies. I slid my fingers between his legs, taking secure hold of his testicles before I put my lips next to his ear.</p><p>\u201cTell him you\u2019re pleased with me,\u201d I warned, \u201cor I\u2019ll squeeze until your eyes pop out your ears.\u201d</p><p>The grip I had on him demanded immediate obedience, but Dredmore only turned his head to brush his mouth across mine.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe Dredmore was kissing me while I had my fist round his stones, and he took advantage of my shock by seizing my wrist and dragging my hand up so that I was gripping his shaft. When I jerked he held me fast and looked over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTonight I must hold on to my Prudence,\u201d he told the drunk. He looked into my eyes. \u201cWhatever it costs me.\u201d</p><p>His play on words brought another round of laughter from the men, but I dug my nails into him.</p><p>\u201cWe should perhaps go to our room,\u201d I suggested through my teeth, \u201cso that you can begin to pay for your pleasures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent suggestion.\u201d He released my wrist, clamped his hands on my waist, and stood with me still on him. The unexpected movement forced me to cling to him as he strode out of the room and into the hall, where he did not put me down but continued on to the Amber Room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re carrying this a little too far?\u201d I asked as he entered and kicked the door shut behind us. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not a native. Your saving my life doesn\u2019t mean you now own me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalsh has men out searching for you.\u201d He set me down and went to the window to check the street. \u201cIf I could find you, so can they. We have to go, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He came to me, seized my shoulders, and shook me hard. \u201cFor once in your life, you daft twit, listen to me. That snuffmage wasn\u2019t the only one sent after you. And what Walsh\u2019s men did to your flat is what they were told to do to you. When they learn that you\u2019re here\u2014and they will\u2014they\u2019ll come for you.\u201d</p><p>I wrenched out of his grip and folded my arms. \u201cLet them. Rina has Wrecker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalsh has twenty Wreckers out there tonight,\u201d Dredmore said. \u201cThey\u2019ll surround the place, put a few guards on the outside doors, and cut the kneecapper\u2019s throat. Then they\u2019ll look for you, Charmian, and they\u2019ll take their time. Especially with the women.\u201d</p><p>Bile rose in my throat, and I swallowed against it. \u201cI\u2019ll call Rumsen Main and speak to Inspector Doyle. He\u2019ll send his men over to protect the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis superiors won\u2019t permit it,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him what you told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalsh owns the police commission; he\u2019ll already have warned them to stay out of his way.\u201d Dredmore sighed. \u201cEven if your friend Doyle found a few survivors tomorrow, the commissioner would be more inclined to give Walsh a medal for cleaning up a disgrace to the city.\u201d</p><p>Almira came in carrying a tray with a bottle of champagne and a silver bowl piled high with strawberries. \u201cWe\u2019ve trouble downstairs,\u201d she said as she thumped down the tray. \u201cTwo blokes with a warrant, wanting you, Kit. They say they\u2019re Yard but they look like fists for hire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you should have no problem telling them I\u2019m not here,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cThe warrant\u2019s for a search of the place,\u201d the cook told me, \u201cand Rina\u2019s had to let them in.\u201d She glanced at Dredmore. \u201cIf you mean to fool them, milord, you two had best get busy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and once the cook departed he took my arm and tugged me over to the bed.</p><p>I resisted. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. We can play cards.\u201d</p><p>He straightened my wig. \u201cCards, in a brothel. Yes, that should be quite convincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very well.\u201d I drew back the coverlet and sheets, rumpling them in the process. \u201cI\u2019m not taking off my clothes, and neither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Dredmore turned me round and pushed me onto my back, reaching to pull up my skirts. \u201cNew lingerie?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down and seized his wrists. \u201cBorrowed, not mine.\u201d I heard a shriek from down the hall and cringed. \u201cTake off your jacket.\u201d</p><p>Before he did Dredmore retrieved the champagne and strawberries and brought them to the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother with that,\u201d I urged when he uncorked the bottle with a loud pop. \u201cJust come down here and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen do not kiss harlots,\u201d he said as he straddled me and yanked at my bodice, tearing it open. \u201cNot on the mouth, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I muffled my own shriek as he poured some champagne on my front. \u201cLucien.\u201d The cold, bubbly stuff felt shocking on my skin. \u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>As the door flung open he popped an overlarge strawberry in my mouth and put his to work on my champagne-soaked skin.</p><p>\u201cPolice,\u201d a rough voice called out, and I closed my eyes briefly.</p><p>Dredmore made a vague gesture I couldn\u2019t see, mesmerized as I was by the sight of his lips on my breast and the feel of his tongue as he licked some drops of champagne from one tight, reddened peak.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here for a woman,\u201d the intruder added. \u201cName of Charmian Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore raised his head an inch. \u201cThis one\u2019s called Ginger,\u201d he said as he stared down at me and used one hand to cover my now-rosy breast. \u201cIf you want her, you\u2019ll have to wait your turn. I\u2019ll be another hour.\u201d</p><p>A crude snicker answered him. \u201cNot tonight, sir. Sorry to bother.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I heard the door slam I removed the strawberry, which I\u2019d bitten in half, from my mouth. \u201cGood.\u201d I chewed and swallowed, and then on impulse offered him the rest. \u201cYour reward, sir.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore took a bite, watching me as he removed the remainder from my grasp and brought my hand to his mouth. One by one he sucked the traces of juice from my fingers, causing a terrible heat to gather inside me. I could also feel his muscles tightening under his garms, and the hard bulge of his shaft now pressing between my legs.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThis is a pretense, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d His eyes gleamed as he lashed my palm with his tongue before he caught my mouth with his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The taste of the strawberry sweetened the kiss, which was not at all sweet, but wet and deep and passionate, and seemed to last an hour. I was very glad I was not a harlot, I thought as I worked at the buttons of his shirt and opened it to bare his chest. They had no idea what they were missing.</p><p>\u201cI like this lingerie,\u201d Dredmore mentioned as he tugged the knickers out of the way and found the open crotch with his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d As his fingers breeched me I arched up, catching my breath when I felt my body receive him with a soft slickness that should have been embarrassing. \u201cWhat if someone comes in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am a deathmage.\u201d He shifted over me, reaching down to open the front of his trousers. \u201cI\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien, you can\u2019t, ah.\u201d Words deserted me as he worked the swollen head of his penis past my folds. Nothing had ever felt so good, or so right, as the way he came into me. I found my voice somewhere. \u201cYou\u2019re determined, then? I cannot persuade you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmian.\u201d He penetrated me with a single, forceful movement. \u201cBe quiet and think of England.\u201d</p><p>As I relished the stretching sensation his shaft created inside me, his advice made me frown. \u201cGod, why?\u201d</p><p>What followed was, like our first time together in his gardens, utterly astonishing to me. Dredmore moved in me with what should have been the most basic of motions, pressing deep, dragging out, and then forging back in. Magic was made from the delicious friction involved, perhaps, or the way my body responded, rather like a mad creature on its own. I could not keep my hands from him as the pleasure built between us, and the damp sounds of our coupling grew louder and faster and wetter.</p> <p>Dredmore seemed equally undone; he bent his head to alternate between kissing my mouth and sucking at my breasts, while I scored his shoulders with my nails and pressed my lips to his chest. The room seemed to dim as the ache inside me swelled, tormented now by the hard thrusts of his shaft into me. I could feel the heat we stoked growing liquid and spreading out, melding us in our frantic movements.</p><p>I found I could not wait for him as I hurtled through the dark and shattered under him, my whole being consumed by the delight of it. Distantly I heard his voice, rough and shaking as he jerked atop me, and the luscious pulse of his seed jetting and flooding my clenching sheath.</p><p>I murmured some nonsense, holding him fast to me as we drifted together, bound by body and heart. Now I understood why women could not resist men; they were our physical completion.</p><p>Dredmore eventually withdrew from me, turning onto his side and gathering me against him. He seemed to take quite a long time studying my face. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone had come in,\u201d I answered truthfully, \u201cI think I would have killed them. That and we should never play cards.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly and brushed some hair back from my eyes. \u201cI should like to spend the next week in this bed with you, but we must go.\u201d</p> <p>I recalled the unfortunate aftermath of our first lovemaking and gave him a narrow look. \u201cTo where, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA place safer than this.\u201d He propped himself up on one elbow. \u201cThere is something I have to show you.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. \u201cI believe I have seen everything you have now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis you have not.\u201d He rose from the bed and offered me his hand. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>I went to the armoire and found a reasonably decent dark blue gown with white braided trim, and after washing up at the basin in the corner I dressed in it. Dredmore came to button up the back for me and draped his cloak over my shoulders, pulling up the hood to conceal my head. \u201cStay behind me on the way out, and don\u2019t say a word to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of imprisoning me again,\u201d I told him, \u201cyou\u2019ll lose more than a horse this time.\u201d Which made me think. \u201cSomeone will see us leave the house. Walsh will know you have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he will,\u201d Dredmore said as he led me to the door and opened it a gap to look through and check the hallway.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou want him to come after you for saving me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want him to believe I did my job.\u201d He glanced back at me. \u201cLast night he hired me to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His confession struck me hard, and left me feeling numb and daft, as if he\u2019d already shoved a dagger between my ribs. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too busy making arrangements to get you out of the country.\u201d He saw my face and took my cold hands in his. \u201cI intended to tell you when I returned this morning, only to find you\u2019d escaped right back into Walsh\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have said something last night.\u201d But I\u2019d barely given him a chance to tell me anything before my temper had gotten the best of me. \u201cHow much am I worth dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>I felt a little miffed. \u201cSurely I\u2019m worth more than twenty pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. He gave me twenty thousand.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cConnell will have the coach out back by now. Come.\u201d</p><p>Still reeling from the thought that my death would be worth a small fortune to Nolan Walsh, I followed Dredmore out into the hall and down the back stairs. Almira intercepted us by the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou sneaking away without paying, milord?\u201d</p><p>Dredmore placed enough coin in her hand to make the cook gasp aloud. \u201cIf anyone asks,\u201d he told her, \u201cplease tell them that you saw me leave with Miss Kittredge, and that she was fighting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Kit?\u201d Almira peered round him. \u201cYou\u2019re not fighting this gent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell anyone who asks that I did.\u201d I pushed back the hood enough so that she could see my face. \u201cAnd please, do tell Rina I\u2019ll be in touch when it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore hustled me out into the side alley, where Connell was waiting with the coach. I peered up at him, hoping to see a hint of Harry in his face, but the man ignored me. Dredmore retrieved a woolen blanket from the rear-facing seat, wrapping it about me before he scooped me up and placed me on his lap.</p><p>\u201cI can sit over there,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThis is warmer.\u201d He glanced out through the side window before clamping an arm round my neck. \u201cWe\u2019re being watched. Struggle.\u201d</p><p>Out of reflex I did, and then I caught a glimpse of two nobbers trotting toward the coach. \u201cLet go of me, you bastard,\u201d I cried out, loud enough for them to hear before the horses were slapped and the coach took off.</p><p>Dredmore released me as soon as we were out of view and called up, \u201cGo to the blackstone, Connell. Stay to the alleys.\u201d</p><p>I slid off his lap as soon as he removed his arm, but stayed close to him. \u201cYou have a house in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral.\u201d He tucked in the blanket round me before leaning his head back and closing his eyes. A shaft of light from a gaslamp we passed briefly illuminated his weary features.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagined I\u2019d find you in some gutter today,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cWith your throat cut and your blood draining into the sewers. It was not an image I found conducive to slumber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if your beheading that snuffmage should give me sweet dreams?\u201d I pulled the blanket up under my chin. \u201cMaybe it would have been better all the way round if I\u2019d ended up in the gaol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d He turned his head to regard me. \u201cWalsh\u2019s consortium controls most of the city, including the police and the courts. You\u2019d have been found dead in your cell within an hour of your incarceration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of murder for hire, why would Walsh offer you twenty thousand, simply to kill a nobody like me?\u201d My feet were freezing, so I tucked them up under me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s frantic to see you dead, but I can\u2019t fathom why,\u201d Dredmore admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s gone beyond the truth behind the attacks on his wife. Something happened last night that made him terrified of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I thought back over the dinner. \u201cI know I spoke out of turn a few times, but he mostly ignored me. The only time he became really agitated was when I challenged him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Walsh is a pawn in a much larger game.\u201d He felt me shivering and pulled me closer, lifting one side of the blanket over him in order to share his body heat. \u201cWhen you spoke of the wound paste, he reacted strangely. He stared at you for several moments.\u201d</p><p>I remembered that look. \u201cAs if he were seeing me for the first time. But that old trick isn\u2019t anything important. Other than it\u2019s being used to drive his wife mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s something else.\u201d He looked out as the coach came to a halt. \u201cThe snow is knee-deep. I\u2019ll have to carry you.\u201d</p><p>I pushed off the blanket. \u201cShould I struggle again for the benefit of the neighbors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no neighbors.\u201d</p><p>I saw why when he helped me out. \u201cDredmore, this is Feathersound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He swung me up into his arms.</p><p>I linked my hands behind his neck. \u201cThe lord mayor allows you to make use of his private residence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis former private residence.\u201d He carried me up the steps and through the door Connell had unlocked and held open. \u201cHe signed the deed over to me for services rendered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the governor know about this?\u201d I frowned as I saw his driver lighting a candle to illuminate the dark hall. \u201cNo servants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficially the house has been closed for two years.\u201d He set me down and instructed Connell to light the fires before taking my hand. \u201cUnofficially, it\u2019s haunted. Legally, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore guided me into Feathersound\u2019s library, which appeared to be as large as my entire flat. Every wall had been fitted with shelves from floor to ceiling, save the center of one where space had been made for a massive cherrywood secretary. \u201cYou cheated the mayor out of his home by telling him it was haunted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I saved his life from what he believed was the vengeful spirit of his former business partner.\u201d He went to the hearth and lit the kindling under a large stack of split seasoned oak. \u201cThe specter turned out to be the gifted and rather resourceful aide of the mayor\u2019s opponent, who had hoped to frighten away his competition before the election.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell the mayor that,\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cAfter I assured His Honor that I had dispelled the spirit from the premises, I discreetly arranged for the mayor\u2019s opponent to withdraw from the election.\u201d He sat back on his heels and watched the flames catch. \u201cDirectly after that, he and his aide left Rumsen.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t killed them, as everyone had believed. \u201cYou blackmailed him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI persuaded him to relocate to a city in the east where he might enjoy more success in the political arena.\u201d He rose and brushed some melting snow from his shoulders before regarding me. \u201cWhy are you smiling at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in magic any more than I do.\u201d And now I had proof of it. \u201cYou\u2019re an investigator like me. You only dress it up with spells and nonsense to hide your methods. So how did you disguise the blade you used on the snuffmage outside court? Was it some sort of trick, like the way you pretended to pop through the floors at Morehaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Charmian.\u201d He removed a dust drape from a cushiony lady\u2019s armchair by the fire and gestured for me to take a seat in it. When I did, he said, \u201cI will answer your questions, but you must first do something for me.\u201d</p><p>My first, automatic response was to refuse, but Dredmore had just diverted Walsh\u2019s men from harming Rina and her gels, and had provided safe sanctuary for me. I owed him some cooperation, and we both knew it. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your pendant and hand it to me.\u201d</p> <p>The moment I did, I knew Harry would appear, but at least Dredmore wouldn\u2019t be able to see him. I reached up, unfastened the catch, and held out the chain to him.</p><p>The moment the pendant left my fingers, my grandfather\u2019s misty form appeared. He didn\u2019t say a word, but lunged at Dredmore, who quickly pocketed the pendant. As soon as he did, Harry turned semitransparent.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth did you do that, you silly twit?\u201d my grandfather shouted.</p><p>\u201cBecause I asked her to.\u201d Dredmore looked directly at Harry. \u201cHello, Ehrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my grandfather?\u201d I looked from Dredmore to Harry and back again. \u201cHang on. You can see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trick, Charm.\u201d Harry solidified enough to cast a shadow on the faded but still colorful Turkish rug. \u201cHe\u2019s only making a pretense so he can use you. You must leave here at once.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather send her out to die in the snow than tell her the truth?\u201d Dredmore came to stand behind me, and I saw his angry expression reflected in the oval mirror above the mantel. \u201cShe\u2019s your own flesh and blood, old man. She deserves to know more than the bits and pieces that you\u2019ve been feeding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems to be able to see and hear you quite well,\u201d I advised my grandfather. The thought of how he had possessed Connell at Morehaven, and the prospect of him doing the same to Dredmore, made me gesture at a cluster of brass-studded bronze leather armchairs. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all sit down and talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down and talk. With him?\u201d Harry uttered a bitter laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what spawned him, or what his sort can do.\u201d He looked at Dredmore for the first time, and there was pure hatred in his eyes. \u201cBut I know, boy. I know exactly what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told her what you\u2019ve done?\u201d Dredmore asked this with exquisite courtesy. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you explain that, Ehrich? Or are you leaving that for others to do, just as you did in France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he was Houdini,\u201d I told Dredmore, and watched the white puff of my breath float from my lips. \u201cWhy is it so cold in here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is his doing.\u201d He eyed my grandfather. \u201cNo more half-truths, Ehrich. Tell her who you were before you took possession of that Crown spy. Who you were when Harry White led his regiment into the Br\u00e9ch\u00e9liant, and what you were when you came back out.\u201d He waited, but Harry said nothing, and the ticking of the great clock by the door seemed to grow very loud. \u201cI see. She\u2019s good enough to torment, to use, to manipulate, but not worthy of the truth. Fortunately for you, Charmian is now under my protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d I stared at him. \u201cYour what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d Harry strode forward without looking, banged into an end table, and caught it before it toppled. When he took his hand from it he left an icy print of his palm and fingers. \u201cYour father may have wanted recompense for being taken. Like the others, Jack deserved it. But his battle was never yours. You can bloody well do as you like, but you won\u2019t drag my granddaughter into it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in it to her ears.\u201d Dredmore was sneering now. \u201cYou had your chance to do right by her, Ehrich. More than a thousand of them, I should think. But you sacrificed her, and her mother, and her grandmother on the altar of Queen and country and your own pathetic schemes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019ll cut her throat?\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes took on a strange purple glow. \u201cI will end you first, boy.\u201d</p><p>The mention of murder made it high time for me to intervene. \u201cWhatever quarrel you two have with each other, it\u2019s nothing to do with me. Lucien, I can look after myself, so stuff your protection. Harry, I\u2019m not interested in carrying on whatever feud you have with Dredmore or his father.\u201d I remembered Hedger\u2019s strange reaction to learning that Harry was my grandfather. \u201cIs there anyone who likes you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d that was all my grandfather got out before Lucien stepped between us. His broad back kept me from seeing what he did, but his back muscles shifted, and then Harry abruptly vanished.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I asked, shuffling back a few steps.</p><p>\u201cI banished him back to the netherside.\u201d Dredmore turned to face me. \u201cAs long as you are with me, he cannot manifest or meddle with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s never meddled.\u201d When he would have come closer I went round behind the chair. \u201cYou, on the other hand, have inflicted an excessive amount of damage to my reputation, my person, and my life.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. \u201cHow have I harmed you, Charmian? By wanting you? By taking what you freely offered me? Or by trying to shield you from Walsh and dark forces that you cannot even begin to fathom?\u201d He extended his arms in a helpless fashion. \u201cPlease, enlighten me as to which it was.\u201d</p><p>I did. \u201cYou abducted me and held me prisoner against my will. You raced about assassinating snuffmages, never mind that I might be blamed for the murders. Oh, and you also agreed to kill me for twenty thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took that fool\u2019s money to give to you,\u201d he shouted. \u201cIt was to help you settle into a new life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I left Toriana with you for some secluded lovers\u2019 nest overseas,\u201d I tacked on, \u201c where I could nightly entertain you until you tired of me? I\u2019d rather work for Rina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well.\u201d He turned away. \u201cI\u2019ve tired of you already.\u201d</p><p>That stung, more than I cared to admit. \u201cProblem solved, then.\u201d</p><p>I came round and sat in the armchair. \u201cBefore I\u2019m forced to leave the country and flee for my life, perhaps you should tell me about this thing between you and Harry. Start with how you\u2019re able to see his specter, and exactly how you sent him off.\u201d I was particularly interested in the latter so that I might do the same if Harry became troublesome.</p><p>Dredmore went to the overly large secretary and opened the upper cabinet, sliding aside a panel. \u201cHe\u2019s not a specter. He\u2019s a manifesting spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d I frowned as he shifted and I saw the rows of switches that the panel had hidden. \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>Dredmore put his thumb beneath one switch and glanced back at me. \u201cYou.\u201d He flipped the switch.</p><p>Two velvet-covered bars shot out from the ends of my chair\u2019s arms, bending at hidden joints and locking together at the ends. Before I could get to my feet, they retracted, shoving me back against the cushions. A smaller pair of bars swung out beneath my skirts and did the same, trapping my ankles in place. When I pushed at the bars locked across my waist, two cuffs popped out of them and snapped round my wrists.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother struggling,\u201d Dredmore told me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t the strength.\u201d</p><p>I tried but I couldn\u2019t budge the chair\u2019s automatic manacles. I\u2019d never heard of such mech, but Dredmore could afford things other mortals could only have nightmares about.</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cWhen you\u2019re finished,\u201d I said pleasantly, \u201cyou\u2019d better plan to sleep with one eye open for the rest of your bleeding life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I do already, Charmian.\u201d He turned his attention to the panel, and I heard doors being bolted and window latches fastening, and then a white-painted board descended from the ceiling.</p><p>I had nothing to do but wait and plot his slow, painful death, but still I jumped when the table beside me sprouted a complicated pile of gears, pulleys, and lenses.</p><p>\u201cIs it a torture device?\u201d I asked, wondering if he meant to feed my hands to it.</p><p>\u201cIt is called an illuminator. Let\u2019s hope it lives up to its name.\u201d He left the secretary, going round to all the lamps and turning them down until the room became shrouded in darkness. He pulled the chair to the other side of the table machine, and popped a matchit.</p><p>The bizarre rituals confused me, but the matchit didn\u2019t. Surely he wouldn\u2019t set me on fire, trapped as I was. \u201cLucien, perhaps I\u2019ve been too harsh. You and I should talk more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo shut up, Charmian.\u201d He used the flame to light a small row of candles inserted in the back of the device. As soon as their wicks caught, he adjusted a row of small mirrors, and several shafts of light merged and formed a glowing circle on the hanging board.</p><p>\u201cThere is a difference between spirits and specters,\u201d Dredmore said as he placed a cylinder lined with tiny, silverblack-etched glasses in front of the rows of candles. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was, not until after the war.\u201d He switched on the machine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes widened as a flickering picture appeared on the white board. In it tiny figures of soldiers marched across a field toward a forest, and they moved just as if I were standing there behind them, watching.</p><p>\u201cThe illuminator uses a zoopraxiscope to show many images in succession,\u201d I heard Dredmore say.</p><p>\u201cThen it needs a shorter name.\u201d Angry as I was, I couldn\u2019t stop watching the moving pictures. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA regiment in the North country.\u201d Dredmore left the machine running, picked up a fire iron, and poked at the logs in the hearth, creating an updraft of orange and yellow sparks. \u201cYour grandfather and my father were among them. They were friends once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien, your father is titled,\u201d I said. \u201cI know he\u2019s exempt from service. Think of a better lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Travallian was my mother, and her husband recognized me as his heir, but Jack, the man who sired me, was a commoner.\u201d Dredmore came to sit on the floor beside me. \u201cHe was also a tintest, attached to your grandfather\u2019s regiment.\u201d</p><p>Having such a large, dignified figure at my feet seemed ridiculous, especially when I couldn\u2019t kick him in the head, but it wasn\u2019t as if I could change seats. \u201cIs that why Lord Travallian disowned you and left the title to his nephew? Because you\u2019re a bastard in truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He curled a hand round my calf. \u201cAfter I discovered that Jack was my father, and what he could do, I told my mother\u2019s husband to disown me, and I cut all ties to my family.\u201d</p> <p>The rub of his thumb against the bare back of my knee made me grit my teeth. It also made my shoulders turn to pudding. \u201cHow noble of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I reached my majority, Jack came to see me. He told me how he and my mother had met, and why she married Travallian. He explained what had happened to him during the war.\u201d He glanced up at me. \u201cMy father was a Lost Timer. So was your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>For all his obsession with sciences and mech, my father had dearly loved history. Each night, when he came to tuck me in, he\u2019d tell me a story about strange people and their forgotten worlds, as if they were faeriestales. He particularly loved the mysterious and unexplained, like how the Nile people had built such enormous pyramids, or why four hundred Norders had vanished overnight from their first Torian settlement.</p><p>Da had mentioned the Lost Timers to me once, too, and now I searched my memory until I recalled something of what he had said. \u201cThat was what they called those soldiers who went missing in Britanny during the war. They got lost in some forest and weren\u2019t seen for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is how it began.\u201d Little prisms, cast off by the glass cylinder as it turned, slid down Dredmore\u2019s face and chest. \u201cOrdinarily the regiment\u2019s tintest remained behind the lines to protect their equipment, so my father wasn\u2019t even supposed to be with them. The depth and breadth of the Br\u00e9ch\u00e9liant made it impossible for Jack to capture the fighting from a safe distance, and he was obliged to follow the regiment into the forest. He thought he would be safe if he stayed in the trees.\u201d His voice went hollow. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what was waiting for him . . . for all of them.\u201d</p> <p>A deep suspicion began to gather inside me as I looked at the moving picture again. It had started over from the beginning and was showing the men crossing the field. \u201cIs this your father\u2019s work, then?\u201d I asked, nodding toward the board.</p><p>\u201cThe original ambrotints were his. I had copies made smaller to fit the device.\u201d He glanced at it and then got up to change out the glass cylinder, replacing it with another.</p><p>This time, the moving picture showed the soldiers creeping through the trees, sometimes looking back as if they sensed we were following them.</p><p>\u201cJack told me that from the moment he crossed over into the forest, he felt as if something was watching them,\u201d Dredmore said. \u201cWhen it grew dark, he began packing up his tinter to wait to shoot until he had morning light, but then there was light. Strange light that came out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Strange indeed. On the board I watched bizarre glowing streaks darting behind the trees, and while the silverblack on the glass ambrotints rendered all of the light gray, the faster the streaks moved, the brighter they seemed to flash.</p><p>\u201cLampflies,\u201d I murmured to myself as the soldiers came upon a dense grove of old oaks and more lights began filling the moving picture. \u201cA swarm might look like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the same,\u201d Dredmore said, \u201cuntil Jack told me the frost a month before the battle had already killed off all the insects.\u201d</p><p>I felt impatient. \u201cThen what were they? More specters? Leg-sprouting candles? Dancing Yuletide trees?\u201d</p> <p>The moving picture stopped as Dredmore changed cylinders again. New images appeared that showed the soldiers taking firing positions behind the oaks\u2019 immense trunks.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather assumed, not entirely incorrectly, that the lights were torches being waved by the Talian forces. As you see, he ordered his men to take up defensive positions in an old oak grove. He had no way of knowing that the lieutenant leading the enemy troops toward the grove from the other side thought the English were doing the exact same thing, and had put his men in identical positions. Which is all they wanted.\u201d</p><p>The moving picture started again from the beginning, showing the soldiers following the lights and then taking cover from them. Dredmore said nothing until I prompted, \u201cThey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trees.\u201d He switched off the machine and blew out the candles. \u201cThey took them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trees took them.\u201d I was right; he was mad.</p><p>\u201cThey seized every soldier on both sides of that grove. They pulled their bodies into their trunks. They swallowed them whole.\u201d Dredmore went to the mantel, bracing one arm against the carved, polished wood to look down into the merrily crackling flames. \u201cThe men had to become part of the trees so that the Aramanthan trapped inside could possess them and escape.\u201d</p><p>And for this he had trussed me to an armchair? He couldn\u2019t be drunk; he\u2019d barely touched the gin at Rina\u2019s. Harry\u2019s sudden appearance certainly hadn\u2019t frightened him out of his wits. No, whatever had addled his brain must be more serious than grumpy ghosts and the blue ruin. \u201cLucien, I\u2019m sure your father saw some terrible things during the war, but really. Man-eating trees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe oaks had been bespelled long ago. No,\u201d he added when I looked away, and came to loom over me. \u201cYou will listen to me this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d I was annoyed, but he was an unbalanced deathmage, and if regaining my freedom and preserving my ability to breathe meant catering to his insanity, then I\u2019d make a decent show of it. I glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m listening. Tell me the rest of this faeriestale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaeries didn\u2019t build the Br\u00e9ch\u00e9liant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the haven of the Druuds, the old high priests who protected humanity. A thousand years ago, they saved the world by putting an end to a civil war being fought by the Aramanthan. They combined their powers to lure all of the warring immortals and their minions into the forest, where they bound their spirits to enchanted stones and cast their bodies into the oaks. They then warded the forest itself to prevent anyone from entering it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing magic that, oh, didn\u2019t work.\u201d I controlled an impulse to begin tapping my slipper by nudging the edge of the Turkish rug with one toe. \u201cHow awful for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spells didn\u2019t fail.\u201d He walked over to an antique standing globe displayed beside the heavy tapestry window curtains, and with a nudge of his thumb set the little sphere to spinning. \u201cThe world changed. Over the centuries, weather, floods, and earthquakes created new paths round the old wards into the Br\u00e9ch\u00e9liant. The soldiers on both sides simply stumbled onto them.\u201d</p><p>I again marveled at how magic always seemed to evaporate at the most convenient moments. \u201cTragic.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore stopped the globe. \u201cTime had changed the immortal prisoners of the grove as well. Nothing remained of their bodies except dust. Their immortal spirits endured, however, trapped as they were in stones used by the Druuds to imprison them. By that time they had learned what they needed to escape.\u201d He came to me, and absently tucked a stray piece of my hair behind my ear. \u201cCan you guess what it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woodman\u2019s ax?\u201d I guessed. \u201cLightning? Termites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHosts, Charmian.\u201d He popped a matchit and lit the lamp nearest my chair. The frosted glass diffused the flame into a soft amber glow that gilded every edge in the room. \u201cLiving bodies that could house and transport their spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when the soldiers came, these imprisoned spirits dragged them into the trees so they might use them like carris.\u201d Did he even realize how ridiculous he sounded? \u201cIs this when the white rabbit makes an appearance and leads them and a little gel into a garden of talking flowers?\u201d</p><p>Instead of growing angry again, he smiled a little. \u201cI said almost the very same thing to Jack. He told me that at first none of the soldiers who came out of the forest truly believed what had happened to them. It seemed like nothing but a long, bad dream, until they discovered exactly how much time had passed, and how greatly they had been changed.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore setting me on fire suddenly didn\u2019t seem as bad as before, and once I convinced him to release me from the chair I\u2019d have to make a run for it. The window latches were the heavy, solid sort that were inclined to stick; it would have to be the door. \u201cI suppose their feet had been turned into roots, their arms into branches, and their hair into bird\u2019s nests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men found they could move objects, start fires, even see into the future,\u201d he said, and touched a center spot on his brow. \u201cFrom here, simply by thinking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind power.\u201d I sighed. \u201cOf course it would be that. Couldn\u2019t exactly walk about with roots for feet, could they? Imagine the dirt they\u2019d track everywhere. And the cobbler\u2019s bills.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou agreed to listen,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cSome of the spirits\u2014indeed, most of them\u2014wanted to atone for the great damage they had inflicted on the mortal world during the mage war. They guided the soldiers they had taken to take up their normal lives again, and to use their mind powers discreetly and wisely. They formed a secret association so they might help and govern each other. The less benign spirits were not so benevolent, and wanted to kill the spirits of the men they had possessed so the bodies would be theirs alone. To avoid another war, the two groups agreed to go their separate ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter which they all lived blissfully ever onward,\u201d I guessed, eyeing the high shine of the waxed cherrywood flooring. When I ran for it, I\u2019d have to be careful to keep to the rugs or my slippers would have me skidding straight into a collection of botany books.</p><p>\u201cThe group of men who hosted the benevolent spirits went back to England and called themselves the Tillers,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe others withdrew to Talia, and became known as the Reapers. Little is known about the Reapers except some rumors. It\u2019s said that they still desire to settle old scores.\u201d</p> <p>It was incredible how much detail he\u2019d worked into his delusion . . . or perhaps there was nothing wrong with his mind, and he\u2019d employed this complicated farce in hopes of bringing me under his sway. I began to suspect the latter. \u201cSo which was it? Harry became a Tiller, and your father a Reaper? Is that why you despise each other so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack was a Tiller,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHarry\u2019s spirit never did choose a side.\u201d</p><p>I decided I\u2019d indulged him long enough. \u201cI must say, that was an excellent story, Lucien. Quite imaginative, having the moving pictures to add such a dramatic feel. You could perform this show daily in the park. I think you\u2019d really clean up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are disregarding is that the Tillers and the Reapers did go back to live normal lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey became men of business, politics, and importance. They all succeeded beyond anyone\u2019s expectations. And they married and had families, because they never suspected hosting the Aramanthan spirits would change their physical bodies. Not until they realized that their offspring were not like other children.\u201d</p><p>My nose itched and I couldn\u2019t scratch it, and it was driving me insane. Just as he was. \u201cPlease, Lucien, stop. Just stop now. It was a good joke, a very good joke, but you\u2019re taking it too far. It isn\u2019t funny anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Tillers managed to hide what they were, but their children were born with abilities not so easily disguised.\u201d His voice dropped low, as if he were confiding in me. \u201cSome superstitious fools began calling their progeny names. Shade-born. Demonites.\u201d</p><p>I went still. Hellchild.</p><p>\u201cSome of the children had ordinary gifts, but others proved to be even more powerful than their sires.\u201d He went to the panel to flip some switches and the cuffs round my wrists parted, and then the bars folded themselves away. \u201cYour mother not only rejected her powers, Charmian, but I believe that she and your father used the nightstone to assure that you would never know yours.\u201d He came over to take my cold hands in his. \u201cThanks to them, you\u2019ve remained ignorant of the fact that you are spiritborn, and possess incredible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d I pushed him away from me and got to my feet, wincing as my muscles went pins and needles. \u201cMy parents are dead. I don\u2019t have any power\u2014mind, magic, or otherwise. I am an ordinary person, just like you. I don\u2019t even want to know what a nightstone is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not like anyone.\u201d He also stood. \u201cYou are a spell-breaker, Charmian. Perhaps the most powerful in existence. Magic cannot work in your presence because your own instantly unravels it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d I clapped my hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve managed to invest me with the one power that explains why magic never works. Oh, in my presence, of course,\u201d I added. \u201cOnce I leave the room, however, then it\u2019s business as usual. Wardlings and potions. Enchantments. I\u2019d like to leave now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can prove it.\u201d</p><p>I whirled round. \u201cHow? By not performing magic in front of me\u2014again? Yes, that should convince me. Go ahead.\u201d I gestured. \u201cFail to conjure something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is only one power that can overcome yours, Charmian,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHappily, it is mine.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the look in his eyes. \u201cYet somehow you\u2019ve never thought to use it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did try, but your parents made sure no magic could ever touch you.\u201d He took out my pendant and dangled it. \u201cThis is a nightstone, one of the last in existence. It was used by the old Druuds to imprison the mages in the Br\u00e9ch\u00e9liant. Your parents somehow mechanized it to shield your spirit in a similar manner. From what I have gathered by observation, it releases your power while holding you oblivious to both it and the forces within the netherside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the reason magic doesn\u2019t work near me?\u201d I nodded. \u201cI wonder what my Da\u2019s pocket watch does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me to demonstrate.\u201d He curled his fingers over my pendant, opened them, and it was gone. \u201cNow you are unshielded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d I folded my arms. \u201cYou can to turn me into a great fat frog. Or, if my mind power is now working, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes glittered as he came to me and dropped a small blue stone down the front of my bodice. As I tried to slap him, he said, \u201cTake off the cloak.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hand, which on its own had stopped and joined my other fingers to untie the strings under my chin. \u201cThis is ridicu\u2014\u201d I stopped when I realized I wanted to take off the cloak, more than anything in the world. \u201cWhat is this? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you, spell-breaker.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the cloak from my shoulders and straightened the dark blue gown I\u2019d borrowed from Rina\u2019s. Oddly, this gave me a distinct glow of pleasure. \u201cWhy does that feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to please me,\u201d he said. \u201cIn another moment you\u2019ll do anything I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Something began pulsing deep inside me, as if I\u2019d grown a second heart. \u201cOf course I will. Should I take off the rest of my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father became host to the immortals\u2019 greatest enchanter,\u201d Dredmore said as he went round me and encircled me from behind with his arms. \u201cAn Aramanthan who could bend anyone, even the most powerful spell-breaker, to his will. That was the gift Jack passed along when he sired me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why Harry wanted me to leave you.\u201d Poor Harry, he was a fool. \u201cHe knew you\u2019d try this.\u201d Not that I was especially worried, not with this delicious contentment glowing inside me. \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I choose,\u201d he whispered against my ear, \u201cfor the remainder of your days.\u201d</p><p>Delight sparkled inside me as I imagined it. \u201cYes, please, Lucien. I\u2019d like that. I like you.\u201d No, that wasn\u2019t right. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do, as long as I will it.\u201d The air pressed in against me, and then I was turning to put my arms round his neck. \u201cBut this is not real love, Charmian. This is enchantment. Enslavement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You know how much I fancy you. There will never be anyone else for me.\u201d I beamed at him. \u201cLucien, all I\u2019ve ever want to do is make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never wanted anything of the kind.\u201d He kissed my brow before he plunged his hand down the front of my dress, removing the stone he\u2019d dropped there. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve done this, but I had to show you.\u201d</p><p>A heartbeat later my mind and body became my own again, and I drooped, as limp as an underdone crispie.</p><p>\u201cOnce I release you from the enchantment, there is a period of weakness. It will pass in a few moments.\u201d He carried me over to the chair and sat down with me. \u201cThe longer I bespell you, the greater the weakness. With each hour that passes, more of you surrenders to my control, until I command the very beat of your heart. Then I can never release you, or you will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d I didn\u2019t try to fight him off or argue; I was too stunned. \u201cI really wanted . . . I would have happily . . .\u201d I stopped and stared at him. \u201cAnd you can do this to anyone, whenever you wish, just by thinking it and popping a stone down their dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone like us.\u201d His mouth curled at one corner. \u201cTo my everlasting regret, the power I inherited from Jack doesn\u2019t work on ordinary mortals. Only the spiritborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d I rested my cheek against his shoulder. \u201cHow do you live with something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI avoid the temptation to use it.\u201d He stroked my cheek. \u201cWhen I first encountered you at that merchant\u2019s house I knew you were like me; I sensed it at once\u2014but my power had no effect on you. I tried everything, even planting spell stones in your garments, but nothing worked. I believed it to be a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve actually tried to do this before to me?\u201d I sat up and remembered all the odd times I\u2019d found blue pebbles in my pockets. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be beaten senseless.\u201d I pushed away his hand. \u201cIs there anyone more powerful than you? Do they hire out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have our weaknesses.\u201d His expression became shuttered. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry. I\u2019d never use my power on you unless you were in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you say now. Next week you might decide to have me shine your boots with my tongue.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cNot that I mean to suggest you do.\u201d Something occurred to me, and I sat straight up. \u201cThat night in the maze, you didn\u2019t use your mind magic on me, did you?\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen any blue stone then, but it might have fallen out of my pocket while I\u2019d ridden back to the city on George. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran his thumb along my jawline. \u201cYou were wearing the pendant, remember? It\u2019s always protected you.\u201d</p><p>I glanced about. \u201cWhere is my pendant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have it back, in time.\u201d He turned my face toward his. \u201cCharmian. You can\u2019t keep wearing it. Your parents meant well, but nightstone is very dangerous and unpredictable. The manner in which they\u2019ve mechanized it blinds you to the netherside. If the mechanism were to fail at the wrong moment\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t convinced I wanted to see the real world anymore, much less the netherside of specters and mages and only sweet Mary knew what else. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s better that I not know such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever from what you are, love.\u201d He sounded weary now. \u201cNo more than I could.\u201d</p><p>I tucked my head against his neck, my eyes drooping. \u201cLucien.\u201d I yawned. \u201cWhy am I falling asleep on your lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a long day.\u201d He sounded peevish now, as if talking were too much effort.</p><p>The air seemed to be turning pink, and very hot, and with all my strength I pushed myself off him. My limbs turned to noodles and I landed heavily on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cCharm.\u201d He tried to reach out to me, but his hand fell against the cushions. \u201cFire.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth and began crawling toward it, the pink smoke coming from the logs making my eyes burn, but halfway to the hearth I couldn\u2019t feel my legs anymore. Nor could I turn over to see who had come into the room and was walking toward us.</p><p>A hard boot kicked me over onto my back, and I looked up to see Montrose Walsh standing over me, a noz over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cPoor Cousin Kit,\u201d he said through the mask. \u201cYou and your lover might be impervious to magic, but you\u2019re still obliged to breathe, now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The next hour came to me in blurry flashes as I drifted in and out of consciousness. I glimpsed Dredmore\u2019s body being dragged past me and dropped onto the dirty boards of a cart, and snow falling into my eyes. The cold roused me even as it chilled my limbs; the flashes grew closer together until they merged into a veil of snowy lace above my head. By the time my wits were restored they had moved us to another place and put me on a bed. Beside me Dredmore lay unmoving, but I shifted my arm to press against his side, and felt his ribs expanding and contracting.</p> <p>Lucien still breathed. They hadn\u2019t killed him.</p><p>Men\u2019s voices spoke in low, ugly tones all about us; I could hear Lord Walsh, his diseased son, and someone with a faint Talian accent. They were arguing over something. Montrose spoke insistently, his father responded harshly, and the Talian seemed to be trying to placate both of them.</p><p>The voices came closer, and I played dead. Through my lashes I could see Lord Walsh taking polished stones from a pouch, which he rolled in his hand like coins he was reluctant to part with, until he held them out and a black-gloved hand chose one. More words were spoken, none of which I understood, and the glove lowered a white stone to Dredmore\u2019s face.</p><p>I felt a movement of air over me, terrible and cold, which rushed at Dredmore. When I saw a wide, red streak of light shoot past my face, and felt Dredmore\u2019s body jerk, I almost screamed. Although I held my tongue I must have moved, for someone grabbed my hair and lifted my head, giving it a shake.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s come to,\u201d Montrose said, and my head dropped onto the pillow again. \u201cCan I have her, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That was the Talian. \u201cHe took great trouble to protect her. She must know something of value to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it out of her,\u201d Montrose offered. \u201cCome on, Dad. I did everything you asked. I haven\u2019t had a fighter in ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Monty.\u201d Walsh came to stand over me, his cologne filling my nostrils, and then he slapped me, hard. Through the ringing in my ears I heard him say, \u201cEnough stage play, Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p> <p>I surged up and drove my elbow into his diaphragm. As Walsh doubled over, I shoved him aside and ran. A short man with oily dark hair and a very sharp-looking dagger pointed at my belly brought me to a stop.</p><p>\u201cDredmore,\u201d I said, never taking my eyes off the blade, \u201cNow would be a very good time to demonstrate your deathmage magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be delighted, Charmian,\u201d Dredmore\u2019s voice rasped, \u201cif you would first remove this boulder from my brow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get to you just now.\u201d I regarded the oily-headed one. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d oblige him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss,\u201d he told me in a Talian-accented voice, and glanced down. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill the stupid bitch, Celestino,\u201d Walsh groaned from the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe will let her choose.\u201d The Talian gestured, and Montrose appeared with a length of rope. \u201cI can do as his lordship wishes, miss, and cut your throat. Or you can sit down and hold out your wrists. How will it be?\u201d</p><p>I backed up against the bed. \u201cScreaming and running away not an option? How disappointing.\u201d As the villains converged on me, I jumped up on the bed, tumbling backward across Dredmore\u2019s form and in the process knocking away the small white stone they had placed in the center of his forehead. Montrose uttered some vile words, while the Talian dove at the bed. Dredmore came out of his paralyzed state, grabbed me, and dragged me from the bed, thrusting me behind him as he assessed the two men.</p><p>\u201cI thought magic didn\u2019t work near me,\u201d I whispered as I glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not using it on you,\u201d he muttered back. \u201cAnd I have no power against Aramanthan-charmed icestone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have mentioned this earlier?\u201d We were cornered, and the Talian and Montrose were coming round the bed after us. I thought of what the diseased little sod wanted to do to me and shuddered. \u201cI\u2019d like to be killed first, if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has to die,\u201d Celestino said to Dredmore. \u201cZarath will see to it that you live for a very long time, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore\u2019s hand nearly crushed mine before he spoke to the Talian. \u201cI will give you what you want, as soon as you release Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>Montrose giggled. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a snow day in Hades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nothing but a stupid, nameless skirt,\u201d Dredmore continued, making me want to kick him in a few sensitive places. \u201cYou don\u2019t need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you seem to care for her, my lord.\u201d Celestino flipped his dagger over his hand in a flashy, useless show of dexterity. \u201cCooperate with us, and I will spare her life.\u201d He smirked. \u201cPerhaps Zarath will choose to make her your body servant.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore turned his back on them and grabbed me by the arms, kissing me hard on the mouth before hauling me through an adjoining door, slamming it shut in the Talian\u2019s face.</p><p>I glanced round us but saw no other door or window to provide an avenue of escape. \u201cLucien, we cannot stay in here forever.\u201d Indeed, the men on the other side of the door were hammering on it.</p><p>\u201cI know. I am about to be possessed by one of the Aramanthan, Charmian,\u201d he said as he braced his shoulders against the door panel. \u201cA Reaper warlord, who means to eat my spirit in order to own my body and use my power for his own purposes. I am too weakened by the drugs to fight him off, and he can control mortals the way I control the spiritborn. With my power added to his, no one will be able to resist him, not even you.\u201d</p><p>I saw the door shudder in its frame as someone on the other side bashed against it. \u201cLucien\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. When they are finished, it will be on you to put an end to it.\u201d His grip turned bruising. \u201cThis thing will occupy my flesh, but my spirit will go where it can never touch me. I understand now. I will be where Harry has been, all this time. Now swear to me that you will kill it. Kill my body.\u201d As I remained silent, he shouted it again. \u201cSwear to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d I saw the terror in his eyes, and it shocked me into agreement. \u201cI will. I swear it.\u201d And then, because I simply couldn\u2019t help myself, I said, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The door gave way, thrusting Dredmore against me. I held him as long as I could, my throat too tight now to speak.</p><p>\u201cSo touching.\u201d Montrose looped the rope round Dredmore\u2019s neck, dragging him back out of the way, and forced him to his knees. I started after them, but the Talian got hold of me again and marched me toward the door.</p><p>The knife at my throat kept me from struggling. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot have you in the room,\u201d he told me. \u201cNothing can interfere when the warlord takes possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat warlord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZarath, like we said.\u201d He grinned exactly as a child let loose in an unsupervised sweets shop would. \u201cDo not worry. Soon you will come to know him very well.\u201d</p><p>He guided me into the next room, the furnishings of which were oddly arranged in a half circle facing the wall. I saw an unframed oval of glass, through which I saw into the room where Dredmore was being held by the Walshes. I vaguely recalled seeing a mirror of the same shape on the other side.</p><p>\u201cYou trust them so much you have to watch them in secret?\u201d I asked as the Talian shoved me down in one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d He moved to stand behind me and placed the knife under my chin.</p><p>I heard Lord Walsh\u2019s voice, and glanced down to see where it came from: a small grate at the base of the wall.</p><p>\u201c\u2014my intent from the beginning,\u201d Walsh was saying. \u201cYour assaults on Lady Walsh have been entertaining, but I cannot fathom why you settled on her as a method of getting to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never touched your wife, you daft prick.\u201d Dredmore gritted his teeth as Montrose tightened the rope round his neck. \u201cThe Tillers will know what you\u2019ve done. The moment he begins casting, they\u2019ll come for you. My only regret is that I will not be here to watch your carcass being dragged from the river.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy dear Dredmore.\u201d Walsh\u2019s face stretched into a broad smile. \u201cThe wardlings that hang about almost every neck and door in the city have hearts of dreamstone. I know because our Talian friends forged them. The Tillers won\u2019t even know we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what dreamstone was, nor did I think Dredmore could be duped by anyone, but from the look on his face Walsh had done the very thing.</p><p>\u201cI take it you lot are Reapers?\u201d I asked the Talian.</p> <p>\u201cFor a stupid skirt, you know much.\u201d Celestino didn\u2019t sound as if he approved.</p><p>\u201cWomen in this country have always been vastly underrated.\u201d My throat tightened as Walsh took a gleaming red stone from a white velvet pouch. \u201cLord Dredmore is insanely wealthy, you know. If I could convince you to intervene on his behalf, I can guarantee he would see to it that you would never have to dirty your hands again with this sort of nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, miss.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cFor this, Zarath will make me king of my country.\u201d</p><p>I saw Walsh drop the stone in Dredmore\u2019s hand before he took the pistol from his son.</p><p>I reached out to touch the surface of the two-way glass. \u201cLucien.\u201d</p> <p>As if he\u2019d heard, Dredmore turned his head to look directly at me, put the stone in his mouth, and swallowed. At the exact same moment, Lord Walsh placed the pistol at his own temple and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Someone screamed\u2014me, I think\u2014and I gripped the knife at my throat with my fingers and wrenched it out of the Talian\u2019s hand. The blade cut deep into my fingers as I ran out and into the room where Lord Walsh\u2019s body lay on the floor, and his son gagged as he swiped at his father\u2019s brains, which were all over the front of his fancy jacket as well as the wall behind him.</p><p>I switched the bloody blade to my left hand, ready to use it as I stepped between the men and Dredmore. I stepped back until I could reach him. \u201cLucien, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d I reached out and grabbed his sleeve, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cLucien.\u201d</p><p>This time the red streaks of light came out of Lord Walsh\u2019s body, first from his slack lips, and then in a burst out of the hole in his head. They flew past me, surrounding Dredmore, who had doubled over, choking and heaving. The red lights swirled, closing in on him until his entire body glowed. At last he stopped fighting it and slowly stood, and the lights were sucked into the darkness of his eyes, dwindling until they were two tiny red glints.</p><p>\u201cDredmore.\u201d I told myself it had been a trick, one of his ridiculous illusions. \u201cSay something.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, but held up one hand and turned it over, as if he\u2019d never seen it before. Then he smiled, his face changing into something beautiful and terrible, his eyes taking on a horrid red glow. I didn\u2019t even resist as the Talian took the knife from my hand and forced me down on my knees.</p> <p>\u201cEcco, sovrano mio,\u201d Celestino babbled as he dropped down beside me. \u201cSia benedetto il compagno oscuro.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore looked round the room, and then spoke a single word. \u201cRieccomi.\u201d</p><p>His voice rang out, clear as church bells, and the wrongness of it set my skin to crawling. But the man had just been forced to swallow a rock; couldn\u2019t have been easy on his throat.</p><p>I was sure I could keep telling myself lies like that for as long as was necessary.</p><p>\u201cDove sono capitato?\u201d Definitely not Dredmore\u2019s voice, yet it came from Dredmore\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cIl continente Victoriana, sovrano. La Citt\u00e1 di Rumsen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t speak English,\u201d Montrose grumbled, \u201chow are the rest of us supposed to understand him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChiudi il culo,\u201d the Talian said, smacking the younger man in the back of the head.</p> <p>Dredmore spared Monty a glance. \u201cWho do you think gave you your tongue, boy?\u201d He took a step, looked down at his legs, and then pressed a hand to his chest and arm. \u201cStrong. Young. You chose well, umano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife knew this body would please you, Master. Especially after you were forced to wait so long in . . .\u201d The Talian gestured vaguely at Nolan Walsh\u2019s corpse. \u201cOur ships will be arriving at dawn with your army. We will meet them at the docks, and once you have marshaled them, we can move against the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad never said anything about blowing his brains out,\u201d Montrose muttered. \u201cAnd I still don\u2019t see how one man can control armies and cities just by thinking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a man.\u201d The thing in Dredmore\u2019s body eyed me. \u201cI am Zarath, warlord of the Aramanthan Scourge.\u201d He ran the tip of his tongue from one side of his mouth to the other.</p><p>That decided it for me. The thing had admitted what it was, and Dredmore would never lick his lips in such a repulsive fashion.</p><p>Celestino cleared his throat. \u201cMy lord, forgive the boy for speaking out of turn. Young Lord Walsh is much beloved by my wife, who in return for the sacrifice of his father\u2019s flesh humbly asks that you heal him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I will. Later.\u201d Dredmore ignored Montrose altogether as he reached down to take hold of my chin and lift my face. It was like being touched by a corpse. \u201cAnd this flesh? It too serves me?\u201d</p><p>Montrose snickered. \u201cNot bloody likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even know whose body you\u2019ve stolen?\u201d I asked Zarath. \u201cLucien Dredmore is a deathmage, and Grand Master of the dark arts. He can slice a man in half with one blow.\u201d I shoved a finger into his chest. \u201cGet out of him, this minute, or he will see to it that you suffer a long and ugly death.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything, and then Celestino began laughing. \u201cOh, miss,\u201d the Talian wheezed between guffaws. \u201cThe Aramanthan do not die as we do. They have lived for thousands of years here in our world as well as the netherside.\u201d</p><p>Zarath peered down at me. \u201cThe spirit of this body, this Dredmore. He was your lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs,\u201d I insisted. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis spirit has fled from his flesh, woman. Even if it were somehow to return, it could not take this body from me.\u201d His black eyes took on a scarlet sheen. \u201cWhat your lover is, is dead.\u201d</p><p>I could hardly hear him for the roaring in my ears, and then I heard nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cKit.\u201d</p><p>Big, gentle hands cradled my face, brushed back my hair, and checked my pulse. I knew that touch as well as the voice, but I didn\u2019t want to deal with Inspector Doyle just now. No, what I wanted was a nice room at Morehaven where I might sleep for a thousand years. That way I wouldn\u2019t have to think about magic, which I knew now to be real, spirit stones, or the man I loved being possessed\u2014his soul eaten\u2014by an immortal monster. I had to face it: Dredmore was dead, and I might as well be.</p><p>\u201cShould I send for a whitecart, then, \u2019Spector?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered for Doyle, my voice a rasping ruin. \u201cI\u2019m not injured.\u201d I struggled upright and looked past the man holding me. Tommy\u2019s beaters were searching through the wreck of an expensive-looking hotel room and coming up with nothing. I lay on the floor beside the bed, my arms and legs tightly bound with curtain cord. It was not the room where Lord Walsh had killed himself, either, for there were no brains on the wall.</p><p>\u201cThe concierge called the station,\u201d Doyle told me. \u201cEveryone on this floor heard a woman screaming for help.\u201d He held up a bit of torn cloth, and his angry expression grew especially fierce. \u201cYou chewed through this.\u201d</p><p>Small wonder my throat felt lined with cotton: it actually was. \u201cI missed my dinner bucket.\u201d</p><p>One of the beaters chuckled and earned a glare from the chief inspector.</p><p>\u201cHow can you joke about it? No, hold still.\u201d Doyle took out a pocketknife and sheared through the cords binding my wrists together before he chafed my hands to restore the blood flow. \u201cWho did this to you, Kit?\u201d</p><p>I could tell him the entire sorry tale, most of which I still didn\u2019t believe, and go quietly after. Not all the asylums in Rumsen were horrid. Wherever they sent me for treatment, Doyle would bribe one of the loon herders to look after me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell him the truth.\u201d Harry materialized behind the inspector, and his mostly transparent eyes fixed on mine. \u201cSay you hit your head, and that you can\u2019t recall. Now, gel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t recall.\u201d I looked at the glitter of white and blue stones scattered about the bed on the floor. \u201cI hit my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien Dredmore paid for this room,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cHe told the concierge that you were newlyweds before he carried you up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgree with him,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>One of the beaters made a scoffing sound, which he quickly turned into a fake cough as he moved to search the corner farthest from his boss.</p><p>Against his trouser seams Doyle\u2019s fingers knotted into fists. \u201cDredmore was also seen abducting you earlier from a brothel called the Eagle\u2019s Nest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a ruse, to protect Carina and her gels from Walsh\u2019s men.\u201d I watched Harry throw up his hands in disgust and felt a dismal satisfaction. \u201cI want to go home, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a home. Your property and monies have been seized by the Crown.\u201d Doyle studied my face. \u201cYou\u2019ve the clothes on your back, Kit. Now do you want to tell me what the bloody hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>The door to the adjoining suite opened, and Lord Lucien Dredmore swept into the room. His cloak swirled with imperial elegance, and the points of his snowy neckcloth stood in stiff relief against his dark skin. In his eyes I saw a dreadful shadowy presence, as if the evil demon inside him were looking out of them like windows.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you,\u201d the thing pretending to be Dredmore said as he strode forward, his gleaming boots thumping on the floor as the beaters scattered from his path.</p><p>\u201cLord Dredmore.\u201d Doyle\u2019s features took on a decidedly bland cast as he inclined his head just enough to suit courtesy. \u201cYou witnessed something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lifted his hand and pointed at my face. \u201cThis woman murdered Lord Walsh.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the five seconds of astounded silence that followed, I noticed that Harry had vanished again, Dredmore had acquired a faint Talian accent, and Doyle appeared ready to commit murder himself. Then, without devoting much thought to it, I relieved the inspector of his blade and launched myself at Dredmore, only to be hauled back by a strong arm.</p><p>\u201cKit.\u201d Doyle wrestled the knife from my hand before he shoved me away. \u201cHave you gone mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not Lucien Dredmore. Before Walsh killed himself, he forced the spirit of an evil warlord into Dredmore\u2019s body.\u201d I told Doyle the rest of it as quickly as I could, and added, \u201cHe calls him Zarath. He and the Talians have come to take over Toriana and go to war with the Crown. He\u2019ll use Lucien\u2019s power to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Dredmore smiled. \u201cSuch an entertaining tale. You should have become a novel writer instead of murdering fine gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Now I would have no trouble at all killing him. \u201cGive me back that blade, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d The thing wearing Dredmore\u2019s body cupped his fingers and snatched at the air. \u201cShe is on the rampage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us the room,\u201d Doyle said to the beaters, who hastily filed out.</p><p>\u201cYou must take her at once to prison,\u201d Dredmore told him, \u201cbefore she kills again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that right.\u201d Doyle glanced at me. \u201cI imagine I will, milord, but first I\u2019d like you to answer two questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the monster said. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Doyle watched him. \u201cIf Miss Kittredge murdered Lord Walsh, then how did she end up bound and helpless in this room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously she arranged to be found so,\u201d the monster replied. \u201cIt would make anyone believe her innocent of the crime she has committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put me here after you killed Walsh and Lucien, you evil ass.\u201d I tried to dodge round Doyle again, but he caught me and held me fast.</p><p>\u201cRight. Just one final question, then, milord,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWhat\u2019s Miss Kittredge\u2019s given name?\u201d</p> <p>Dredmore\u2019s eyes blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known her for several years,\u201d the inspector said. \u201cYou\u2019ve paid to have her investigated, harassed, and even snatched from the street a time or two, or so I\u2019ve been told. Tell me her given name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d My smile turned acid. \u201cBecause he\u2019s not Dredmore.\u201d</p><p>The thing lunged at Tommy, punching him in the gut and then the face, so fast his movements became blurred. The inspector flew across the room, hit the wall, and slid to the floor.</p><p>I braced myself for the same, but before it could touch me, Harry materialized between us. In his hand he held a pale stone that gave off beams of light. \u201cNever even think it, spirit-eater. This child carries my blood.\u201d</p><p>Zarath reared back, lifting his hands to block the light, and cursed viciously in Talian as he backed away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Harry said, following after him. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>I went to Doyle, who lay groaning and hugging his middle, and checked him over. Blood streamed from his nose, and I found a huge knot on the back of his head, but otherwise he was all right.</p> <p>Suddenly the door to the room slammed shut and one of the beaters came in. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he told me as he pocketed the pale stone. He was the beater who had snickered at me, but he wasn\u2019t laughing now. \u201cI\u2019ve sent the other coppers downstairs to clear the hall. Now, you\u2019re to leave Rumsen, this very minute. Get as far from the city as you can manage before dawn.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him. \u201cI thought you were arresting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of Victoria\u2014it\u2019s me, Harry, Charm.\u201d The beater knelt down and looked over Doyle\u2019s bloodied features. \u201cBlind me, this is Arthur\u2019s grandson. Fancy him becoming a Yardman. Ah, well.\u201d He tried to pull me away from him. \u201cYou\u2019ve little time left before the sun rises. I\u2019ll help you procure\u2014\u201d</p><p>I slapped the beater\u2019s broad cheek. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to help us? Why didn\u2019t you stop them from hurting Lucien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d He winced and probed the reddening side of his face. \u201cDid you have to smack me so hard?\u201d When I curled my fingers into a fist, he said quickly, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop them or help them. I\u2019m not part of this war. I can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a coward as well as a traitor.\u201d I turned my back on him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d</p><p>Light blasted me from behind, and when I squinted over my shoulder I saw the beater floating six inches above the carpet and glowing like a cop-shaped sun. At the same time everything in the room began to blow about as if in a high wind.</p><p>\u201cYou dare insult me,\u201d Harry said, his voice booming so loudly the windows rattled. \u201cWith the power I command, I could banish you to the netherside with a single thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this how you generally behave toward family?\u201d I sniffed. \u201cAnd you wonder why my mother wanted no part of you.\u201d</p><p>The light vanished, and the beater\u2019s feet dropped down on the floor. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d Harry said meekly. \u201cMy temper sometimes gets the better of me.\u201d</p><p>Doyle stirred, groaning a little.</p><p>\u201cHelp me with him,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be a part of this conflict,\u201d he said as he moved to the door. \u201cGood-bye, Charm.\u201d Out he went.</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d I rose to go after him, only to be yanked back down by a strong hand. \u201cDoyle, let go of me. He\u2019s getting away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you\u2019re not.\u201d With another groan he shoved himself upright and staggered to his feet, still gripping my wrist with an iron hand. He bellowed out two names, and a pair of his beaters rushed into the room. Neither of them appeared to be possessed by my grandfather.</p><p>\u201cLord Travallian has just assaulted me to escape custody. He\u2019s not right in the head. Find him and bring him back to the station.\u201d Doyle held up a hand. \u201cBe discreet.\u201d</p><p>The beaters touched the brims of their helmets before they trotted out.</p><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d I wanted to slap him. \u201cI told you, that thing is not Dredmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s an ancient magical being that possessed his body, and if we don\u2019t stop him, he\u2019s going to start a war.\u201d He prodded the back of his head and winced. \u201cHow does he mean to do that again? Toss a few pebbles at the whole of the militia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a thousand or so Talians,\u201d I snapped. \u201cHe can command entire armies with his mind, and he has Dredmore\u2019s powers now as well. For God\u2019s sake, Tommy, stop rolling your eyes at me like that. He\u2019s an immortal warlord, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been drugged and knocked about, Kit. If Dredmore had told you he was the Queen, you\u2019d have believed him.\u201d</p><p>I told him how wrong he was as he hustled me from the room, down the stairs, and out the hotel. I repeated the entire story as he pushed me into his carri and told his driver to take us to a street in the better part of the working-class quarter. I didn\u2019t begin begging until we arrived at a narrow greystone sandwiched between a carriwright and a pottery.</p><p>Doyle dragged me out of the carri, issued some terse instructions to his driver, and led me up the steps to the front door of the greystone. As I promised to prove everything to him if he would simply go with me to the docks, he pushed me inside and bolted the door behind us.</p><p>I paused for breath and took in my surroundings. Instead of a foyer or a hall leading to several flats, we stood in a tidy front room arranged with comfortable-looking walnut and leather furnishings. Someone had banked a fire in the broad-based riverstone hearth, beside which sat a little cart loaded with a filled BrewsMaid, neatly wrapped finger sandwiches, and a cloth-covered mound of tiny jam cakes.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d He prodded me toward an armchair before turning on the brewer. \u201cNot on your life,\u201d he added without looking at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll not make it as far as the steps outside.\u201d</p><p>I stopped inching toward the door. \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you back to the Main. They\u2019ll toss you in a cell and lose the latchkey.\u201d He took off his jacket and carefully rolled up his sleeves before he used the basin to wash his hands. \u201cThe Crown\u2019s seized everything of yours, so Walsh\u2019s men will be watching your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalsh can\u2019t watch everyone.\u201d I occupied the settee closest to the door. \u201cI have friends in other places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here.\u201d He filled a plate with sandwiches before he brought it to me. \u201cUntil I sort this out, you\u2019re under house arrest.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Doyle\u2019s food or protection, but my stomach chose that moment to gurgle loudly, and I needed to rest and think. I accepted the plate he offered with all the ladylike grace I could manage before I attacked its contents.</p><p>\u201cDredmore couldn\u2019t keep me locked up,\u201d I mentioned between bites of some rather marvelous salt-cured ham. \u201cWhat makes you think you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDredmore\u2019s an arrogant ass.\u201d He went back to the cart and returned with a steaming mug of rich, fragrant country black. \u201cI\u2019m your friend, and this isn\u2019t a prison cell.\u201d He offered me the tea. \u201cIt\u2019s my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m under your house arrest. I see.\u201d I put the plate on my lap so I could warm my hands on the outsides of the mug. \u201cDo you mean to shackle me to something immovable? Perhaps that secretary in the corner there. Looks too heavy for me to budge.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo doubt you\u2019d find a way, even if you had to drag it out of here after you.\u201d</p><p>He may have fumbled things back at the hotel and brought me here against my will, but Doyle did care. He was also a decent man who would be made to pay dearly for becoming involved in this. Especially after I . . . My thoughts turned the food I\u2019d wolfed down into an unpleasant lump in my belly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want any part of this, Inspector. If they find out you\u2019ve sheltered me, they\u2019ll take everything. Your shield, your money and property. Maybe even your life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an officer of the law, Kit, and until I\u2019ve sorted this out, you\u2019re in my custody.\u201d He nodded toward the mug. \u201cNow be a good gel and drink your tea.\u201d</p><p>I pretended to take a sip. Because it was so strong and bitter, country black was regarded as more of a man\u2019s drink. Customarily served as a morning brew, it roused sluggards from their beds and sent them off braced to build another bit of the Empire. Not at all the sort of thing to be serving to a lady at night, unless of course one had other motives.</p><p>I reached into my pocket, springing the back latch on Da\u2019s pocket watch that opened the back of the case, and removed one of the dippers before I pretended to check the time. Then, as Doyle fixed his own mug, I checked the tea.</p> <p>Fortunately for me Tom\u2019s crockery was all plain heavy white china, the sort a bachelor who hated female frippery bought for himself. When he came to sit beside me on the settee, he placed his own mug next to mine.</p><p>\u201cThe sandwiches were scrumptious; you should give up being a cop and cater picnics and hen parties instead.\u201d I handed him the empty plate. \u201cCould I have two more of those ham sandwiches? They\u2019re absolutely delicious.\u201d</p><p>As soon as his back was turned I took care of the present problem, and smiled when he brought me the food.</p><p>\u201cLovely, thank you.\u201d I settled back and let my eyelids droop a little. \u201cTell me something, Doyle. Why haven\u2019t you found yourself a wife yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, testing the tea before taking a swallow. \u201cMum says I\u2019m too particular. Da says it\u2019s the job.\u201d</p> <p>I used my hand to cover a yawn. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>He gave me the oddest look. \u201cCould be that I was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor twenty-odd years? My, you\u2019ve patience.\u201d I uttered a sleepy chuckle as I pillowed my head against my arm and the backrest. With Tommy Doyle it would be courtship, then engagement, then marriage and a house full of little ones. I would never give up what little freedom I had left for that, but still I felt as if I\u2019d been given a tremendous compliment. \u201cWell, whether that\u2019s true or not, I think your Grandda would have approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said we were meant for each other, but then he adored you almost as much as I did.\u201d He hunched his shoulders and gulped his tea. \u201cI\u2019m going to send you to my folks\u2019 place in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I watched him through half-closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay on the farm until I sort this out.\u201d He put down the empty mug and turned toward me, and put his hand over mine. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see if Grandfather was right about us.\u201d</p> <p>On impulse, I leaned forward and brushed my lips across his mouth. He stiffened, and then reached for me, only to look down at the hands that fell against his thighs. \u201cKit . . . you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI switched the mugs,\u201d I confirmed, catching him as he began to topple forward. \u201cIt was the country black that gave it away. It\u2019s the only tea strong enough to mask the taste of sleeping powder.\u201d I eased him back against the cushions. \u201cThat\u2019s why you didn\u2019t bother to shackle me to the furniture. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t . . . go,\u201d he said, slurring the words. \u201cHe\u2019ll . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d I got up and retrieved the crazy patch from the armchair and draped it over him. \u201cBut I made a promise to the man, and it\u2019s one I have to keep.\u201d I waited until his head slumped over before I helped myself to several things, including the heavy trench and long brim I found hanging on his coatrack. \u201cGood-bye, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I slipped out of Doyle\u2019s back door, the raw slap of air against my face reminded me that I couldn\u2019t chase after Dredmore on foot. I needed transportation that would conceal as well as convey me.</p><p>A quick peek inside the window of the carriwright\u2019s shop revealed about a dozen wagons, carts, and carris, all in various stages of disrepair. The lock on the back door would be simple to pick, but the carris would make too much racket, and I had no horse to draw the others. They would be watching anyone approaching the docks, too.</p><p>As I stepped back, my foot shuffled over the lip of an access hatch. The old sewer lines on the Hill and in the smarter quarters of the city had been sealed off or filled in, but here in the working quarter they hadn\u2019t bothered. Hedger had once told me that before the city\u2019s incinerators had been installed, all the old sewer lines had emptied out directly into the sea.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t forgotten the old tunneler\u2019s last warning, though: Ye\u2019re to go now, and ye\u2019re not to come back down here, do ye understand? Never again. I glanced up at the sky. Dawn would arrive in another hour, and so would the invasion. \u201cHarry? Harry, where are you? I need you.\u201d</p> <p>My grandfather\u2019s almost-transparent form appeared before me. \u201cReady to leave, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going belowground,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re coming along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from it down there,\u201d Harry snapped. \u201cNor can I help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, Harry.\u201d I crouched down and with some difficulty released the old hatch. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for your help. All you need do is come with me.\u201d</p><p>I climbed down the ladder and made my way through the malodorous confines of the old sewer, but as soon as I emerged into the tube junction Harry took on more substance and moved ahead to block my path.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as daft as you are stubborn,\u201d he told me. \u201cZarath is not Dredmore. He\u2019s not even a man. He hasn\u2019t the slightest regard for mortals. He\u2019ll crush you, Charmian, with no more than a pebble and a few words. Or he\u2019ll do things to you to make you wish you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Hearing him use my given name only made me think of Lucien and want to throttle my grandfather. \u201cMr. Hedgeworth,\u201d I called out as loud as I dared. \u201cI know the rounds have you in this section of the tunnels now. If you\u2019re watching us, please, come out.\u201d</p><p>The old tunneler emerged from behind a cluster of tubes. He\u2019d wrapped his stooped body in layers of thick meshing and held a pair of wicked-looking cudgels in his hands. \u201cGet out of me tunnels\u201d\u2014he pointed one of the clubs at Harry\u2014\u201cand take that thing with ye.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Harry. \u201cHow can he see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d my grandfather mumbled back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Hedgeworth, but we can\u2019t. I am in desperate need of your help. My grandfather also wishes to make amends for whatever caused this rift between the two of you.\u201d I turned to Harry. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>My grandfather made an exasperated sound. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Archibald. Put down those things.\u201d As the old man eyed me, he added, \u201cObviously I\u2019ve not possessed her. Nor has any other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Hedger agreed. \u201cWith what she can do, won\u2019t be long. Without that ginny bauble hanging about her neck she glows like a right black beacon. Soon as they come for the citizens they\u2019ll take her, too.\u201d He jabbed one of the cudgels toward me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why ye\u2019ll go topside, Miss Kit, this very moment, or I\u2019ll finish ye meself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? It\u2019s hopeless. You\u2019ve no option but to leave Rumsen and save yourself.\u201d Harry\u2019s tone grew wheedling. \u201cYou\u2019re the last of my mortal bloodline, Charm. I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had me, Harry.\u201d To the old tunneler, I said, \u201cMr. Hedgeworth, you may do exactly as you wish to me. From the sound of things, bashing in my skull will probably be a kindness.\u201d</p><p>Hedger\u2019s arm tightened, and for a moment I thought he really would strike me. With great reluctance he lowered the club and scowled. \u201cIf ye were a lad, I\u2019d not hesitate, ye know.\u201d</p><p>I kept my expression respectful. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Hedger jabbed his other cudgel at Harry. \u201cIf she\u2019s truly the last, then ye tell her everything. All of it, ye hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell me later,\u201d I assured him. \u201cFor now, I must hurry. Can you tell me if any of the old sewer lines to the docks remain open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He pointed across to a moss-covered hatch. \u201cThat one runs about three mile. Comes up into the alley behind the old fish tinnery.\u201d As I started for it, he added, \u201cHang on, Miss Kit,\u201d and bent down to open his kipbag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go on ahead and check the line. Wait here.\u201d Harry floated through the closed hatch and vanished.</p><p>\u201cSpineless sod.\u201d The old tunneler rummaged through his bag for a moment before he produced what looked like a large, rusty nail, which he tossed to me.</p><p>I caught it and turned it over in my hands. \u201cI can\u2019t really use this, Mr. Hedgeworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019 Tis an iron rail tie. Only thing what gets rid of Harry\u2019s sort, permanent-like.\u201d He tapped the left side of his chest. \u201cPlant it in the heart, straight through. As the body dies, the iron traps \u2019em inside it. They\u2019re dragged off with the departed spirit, and can\u2019t ever come back.\u201d</p><p>The blunt end of the rusty spike suggested that the only place I\u2019d be planting it would be the ground, but to avoid more arguments I nodded. \u201cI appreciate the advice.\u201d On impulse I walked to him and kissed his whiskery cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right, you know.\u201d</p><p>He looked over my shoulder at the hatch before he muttered, \u201cYe\u2019d be all right shed of him, Miss Kit. Harry\u2019s naught but trouble and tragedy awaiting ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family.\u201d There, I\u2019d said it. Out loud I\u2019d claimed Harry as my kin. It didn\u2019t feel as terrible as I\u2019d thought it might. \u201cWhy are you so angry with him, Mr. Hedgeworth?\u201d</p><p>He shuffled his feet. \u201cYe won\u2019t like knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like not knowing,\u201d I said.</p><p>Hedger heaved out a long breath. \u201cMe family were miners in Cornwall, cross the pond. Every man I knew and called mate worked down in the shafts.\u201d He shifted on his feet as he scowled, but his expression appeared more pained than angry. \u201cOne shift we hit a gas pocket, the tunnel blows, and we\u2019re trapped, fifty of us. Air goes thin, and we know we\u2019re done for, so we make our peace with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFifty of you.\u201d I felt horrified. \u201cBut surely you were rescued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were too deep, Miss Kit. Weren\u2019t nothing could be done for us.\u201d The corners of his mouth turned down. \u201cAll the others had blacked out, and I were a blink from it when I saw a bit of pretty speckled stone, all the colors of the rainbow, and picked it up for luck. Soon as it\u2019s in me hand, Harry shows up. Like some angel to save us.\u201d He started to say something, paused, and then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me any more, Mr. Hedgeworth,\u201d I hurried to assure him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I can tell ye. I have to, I think.\u201d He looked down at his battered waders. \u201cHarry led me out some back tunnel none of us knew were there. He\u2019d been digging himself, ye see. But as soon as I\u2019m topside, everything goes black again. Harry, he were in spirit form. Took me body over so he could use me to do sommat his spy business for him.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cBut he did save your lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. One. Me life.\u201d He spat on the ground. \u201cWhile he was riding me about like a carri, the rest of me brothers and mates choked to death in that hole. Forty-nine men, Miss Kit. After, when I was shed of him and came to, I went back to me village. Seen all me brothers\u2019 wives in black, all the other widows, and then everyone crowded round, wanting to know how I got out. How I could leave \u2019em behind. When I told \u2019em about Harry and what he did, they thought I\u2019d gone mad. Tried to send me to the loony bin, afore I nipped out of there, signed on a cargo ship, and came here. So yeah, Harry saved me life. It just cost me home, me family, me mates, everything in the world I cared for.\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly how that felt. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Hedgeworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, weren\u2019t none of yer doing, lass.\u201d He looked a little embarrassed now. \u201cI shouldna\u2019ve scared ye with me clubs. Ye\u2019re a good gel. Only make the old bugger mind ye, not the other way round.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d I took out my father\u2019s pocket watch. \u201cHarry\u2019s been gone almost ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Hedger made a rude sound. \u201cYe still think he\u2019s coming back for ye?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t afford to wait and find out. Since I couldn\u2019t drift through the hatch like Harry, I asked Hedger to help me pry it open.</p><p>Just as I stepped inside, he touched my shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll never tell ye anything unless ye force it out of him, Miss Kit. If naught else, make him tell ye his name. His true name, what he was born with, afore all the others.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, but before I could ask him what he meant the old tunneler scurried off, disappearing behind the snarl of tubes.</p><p>I turned and started down the old line. The rounded walls remained coated with a layer of dried, caked-on mold, and the lingering stench was equally alluring. But there was enough room for me to walk upright, and I didn\u2019t encounter any living vermin along the way.</p> <p>I knew I was getting close to the tinnery when I picked up the scents of old fish, brackish water, damp rope, and tar. Although Rumsen\u2019s fish market had relocated to the north side of the docks, where the fish merchants had built their new canning factories, the old tinnery was still used by anyone who needed inside space to work, mostly hull menders, trap builders, and net makers.</p><p>When I came to the end of the line I encountered the rotting wood of the planks nailed over the sea outlet, and carefully climbed up the rickety ladder to the topside hatch. I emerged in an empty alley just behind the tinnery, and stopped only to brush from my head and shoulders the snow that I\u2019d dislodged coming up.</p><p>Harry\u2019s form took shape beside me, but almost immediately he moved several feet away. \u201cArchibald gave you iron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nice, big rail spike.\u201d I patted my pocket. \u201cCan I try it out on you, see if it works like he said it would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a more pressing matter.\u201d He pointed out to sea. \u201cThe Reaper ships are beginning to appear on the horizon. Once their army is in place, all Zarath will have to do is cast a spell, wake the dreamstone, and take whatever he likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreamstone, icestone, spirit stone,\u201d I taunted. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you mages do anything without these bloody rocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all that\u2019s left of Aramantha,\u201d Harry told me. \u201cThe rest of it the ocean swallowed long ago, after the first mage war. That is how old and powerful we are, Charm. You can\u2019t fight my sort or kill them. You can never defeat them. Get away from here while you still can.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the cluster of vessels coming in with the tide. They were large military galleons flying Talian colors. \u201cIf I kill Dredmore before Zarath\u2019s army arrives, and I keep Zarath from possessing any other body, what happens then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWithout a physical form to channel and project his power, Zarath will be unable to use it. None of the other mages in his service have his gift for marshalling armies. If the men choose to fight, they\u2019ll have to battle like ordinary men.\u201d Harry glared at me. \u201cThese immortals aren\u2019t fools. You\u2019ll never get close enough. Even if you could kill Dredmore, Zarath will jump from him to the next warm body.\u201d As a flicker of daylight came over the horizon, he began to fade. \u201cFor all that is holy, Charm, please. When the fighting begins I have to retreat to the netherside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d When he didn\u2019t answer I stamped my foot. \u201cHarry, you can\u2019t be neutral anymore. You have to choose a side.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cRun, gel. Run for your life.\u201d</p><p>I had no burning desire to be Rumsen\u2019s savior. Since I\u2019d come here, the city had shown no particular affection for me. Nor did I want to kill Dredmore, who despite being an arrogant ass had cared for me in his own fashion. I even understood why Harry didn\u2019t wish to get involved; this business between the Reapers and the Tillers was none of mine.</p><p>But there were the women of the city, the women who were so often treated like so many nameless cattle, who would not know to run away. Carina, and Bridget, the cartlass round the corner from my building, they had no one to defend them. Even Lady Diana Walsh, snob that she was, would be left helpless before Zarath\u2014and from what I had seen in his bloody eyes, the women would be made to suffer unthinkable horrors.</p><p>I waited until my grandfather had almost faded from sight before I said, \u201cI\u2019m staying, Harry, and I\u2019m fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo like my Connie,\u201d he replied, but he was still shaking his head when he vanished.</p><p>Once Harry had gone my courage wanted to accompany him. To keep from changing my mind I crept along the back of the tinnery and peeked round the corner at the docks, which stood empty. Zarath and his men had either not arrived, or had taken refuge in one of the cargo houses to wait for the ships.</p><p>As I put together a plan, the wind off the sea made Tommy\u2019s coat flap. I cinched it tight and pulled the long brim down before I darted across to one of the scale shacks where fish were brought to be weighed. I opened the door to the stench of death, and the sight of a woman\u2019s mangled corpse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be.\u201d Something batted the long brim from my head. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Dredmore\u2019s little tart.\u201d A hard hand spun me round, and Montrose leered at me. \u201cNipped away from the beaters? You should have stayed in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousin Monty. How delightful to see you again.\u201d I looked round for Zarath and the others, but Walsh\u2019s son appeared to be alone. \u201cWhere are your Talian mates, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting in the cargo house with the master.\u201d He gestured toward the largest of them. \u201cZarath sent me to see if you\u2019d crawled out the rubbish yet. Don\u2019t know how he knew you\u2019d show yourself, but he did.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank a little. \u201cHow could he know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelt you like an itch he couldn\u2019t scratch. Seems the spirit-eater fancies the taste of cheap trollop. Meant to come back to the hotel to collect you for him once we\u2019d finished some business.\u201d He smirked as he nodded at the dead woman. \u201cLikes to play with them a bit first. Not especially careful, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d much rather be your plaything, Monty.\u201d I sidled up to him. \u201cYou wanted your da to give me to you, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He reached down and pinched my buttock through my skirts. \u201cSo you fancy it with me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I would, if you still had something to use. Too bad all you can do now is talk. And drip.\u201d I rammed my knee into his groin, delighting in the shrill squeak he uttered as he sank to the deck. I shoved him inside the scale shack atop the dead woman, mentally apologizing to her spirit as I did for the indignity. Even with his stones bruised Montrose could come after me when he recovered, which I didn\u2019t need, so I used Hedger\u2019s spike to jam the door latch.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t need the spike for my plan to work; all I needed was to get close enough to Zarath while making him believe he\u2019d already enchanted and enslaved me. I didn\u2019t expect it would be difficult. Spirit that he was, the warlord was still a male, and he had been very interested in my body. Finally I could make useful the ridiculous ways in which men regarded my sex.</p><p>I straightened my skirts and smoothed my hair before I hurried to the cargo house. I made no effort to be stealthy or silent as I hurried inside, putting on my best loon face as I looked about. \u201cLucien? Lucien, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Celestino showed himself first, and held a pistol that he pointed at my chest. \u201cDo not take another step, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lucien?\u201d I demanded, striding toward him as if I didn\u2019t see the gun. \u201cI have escaped those who tried to keep us apart, milord.\u201d I raised my voice and called out his name several times, wringing my hands as I did. \u201cPlease, Lucien, I need to see you so desperately.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore stepped out of the shadows, his head tilted back as he surveyed me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you evade the authorities?\u201d Celestino demanded.</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d I ran to Zarath as if he were a great pile of prezzies on Christmas morn and threw myself at him. \u201cThank heavens you\u2019re safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The warlord held me at arm\u2019s length. \u201cThe last time you saw me, you called me a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand, Lucien. That awful inspector person had me terribly confused.\u201d I smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been so lost and frightened. Finding you is such a relief.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cSo happy you tried to put a blade in me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was wrong to do that, and I don\u2019t know why I did. I\u2019ve been in such a muddle\u2014or at least I was, until I found this.\u201d I ducked my head, searching through my pocket until I produced the blue stone Dredmore had used to bespell me, and hoped Zarath wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same. Holding it made me want to weep, and to add to the effect I let the tears well up into my eyes. \u201cAs soon as I picked up the stone everything became clear again.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cThe stone made you think clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d I pressed myself against him. \u201cIt made me remember what was important. You, Lucien. I would do anything for you. Anything at all. It\u2019s just as you\u2019ve always said. I belong to you. I love you.\u201d I ran my fingertips along the front seams of his jacket. \u201cPlease, let me show you how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d His black eyes glowed red, and he latched on to my wrist. \u201cYes. I would enjoy a show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Celestino said, \u201cthis is a charade. The only reason this female came here is to harm you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps she did. It matters not.\u201d Dredmore lifted my chin to study my face. \u201cDid the old one not tell you, woman? Your power cannot drive me out. I am tethered by the spirit stone.\u201d</p><p>The damn stone they\u2019d made Lucien swallow; I\u2019d forgotten about it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand your magic, Lucien. I never have, and don\u2019t need to. I only want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Behind my simper I thought frantically. There was one more thing I could do, and I wasn\u2019t even sure it would work. But it was that or have relations with this thing, and I\u2019d stab myself in the heart before I did that willingly or otherwise.</p><p>Dredmore dragged me back to the cargo master\u2019s office, where he closed the door in Celestino\u2019s face. \u201cTake off those rags. From this day forth, when you are with me you will wear nothing but your skin.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cNothing would make me happier,\u201d I cooed as I reached behind me. \u201cI\u2019ll never again have to launder anything but our bed linens. Unless you hire a laundress for us. That would give me more time to attend to your every want and need, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Undoing my buttons also gave me time to tear open the packet I had tucked in the back band of my waister. I filled my hand with the powder, closing my fingers over it as I shrugged out of my bodice and let it fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou are taking too long.\u201d His gaze dropped. \u201cUndress faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe buttons are so small and slippery, and the excitement is making me all thumbs. Could you help with the rest?\u201d I presented my back to him. \u201cPretty, pretty please?\u201d</p><p>I felt him approach, but instead of unfastening my waister he grabbed a fistful of my hair and used it to drag me back against him. \u201cI will fill your belly with my seed,\u201d he muttered against my ear. \u201cAgain and again, until you swell like a ripe, fat date.\u201d</p><p>Cloaked as he was in Dredmore\u2019s body, I should have felt some small comfort. Over the last few days I had become embarrassingly fond of Lucien\u2019s touch. Yet even the brush of this imposter\u2019s breath on my skin nauseated me. I didn\u2019t bother to suppress my shudder, knowing that Zarath\u2019s ego would have him assuming I was shivering with delight or some other such nonsense.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait to see myself become so, ah, figgish.\u201d Of course if I turned and vomited all over his chest, he might begin to doubt the veracity of my ardor. \u201cI have something for you, too.\u201d</p><p>He jerked me round. \u201cI need nothing from you but silent obedience, woman.\u201d</p><p>Emphasis on silent, naturally. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. But this is something that you wanted from me that should keep me quiet for a time. You remember, you wanted me to . . .\u201d I let my voice trail off as I brushed my knuckles lightly over the front of his trousers and artfully puckered my lips. \u201cNow close your eyes, my love.\u201d When he didn\u2019t, I pouted. \u201cLucien, please. I can\u2019t do it if you\u2019re staring at me like that. I\u2019m a good gel.\u201d</p> <p>He smirked a little before his eyelids dropped.</p><p>I held my breath and flung the powder in my hand directly into his face. With my clean hand covering my nose and mouth I scurried backward until my shoulders slammed into a wall.</p><p>Dredmore coughed and choked, swatting at the cloud about his head. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot to mention, I borrowed some sleeping powder from that awful inspector.\u201d I watched him stumble. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re going to have a nice, long nap.\u201d</p><p>He fell to his knees, and tears rolled down his cheeks from his reddening eyes.</p><p>\u201cFollowed by a very massive headache,\u201d I added, feeling quite satisfied to see him slump forward into a limp mound.</p><p>My suspicions proved correct; Zarath might eat spirits, control armies, and command an invasion, but Dredmore\u2019s drugged body was as good as a gaol cell. I took the dagger he carried and looked down at his still form. Trapped as he was, I could kill Zarath now. Cut him open, reach into his belly, rip out the stone, and it would be finished.</p><p>Lucien could rest in peace.</p><p>Lucien.</p><p>I crouched down beside him, pulling his shirt free of his trousers to bare his flat, hard belly. I lifted the blade\u2014</p><p>Which decided to fall out of my hand. I couldn\u2019t do this to Lucien. I\u2019d held his body in my arms; I\u2019d covered great stretches of it with my kisses. Stabbing him in the heart would be like doing it to myself. Somehow I found my cheek pressed against his skin, and tears rolling over the bridge of my nose to plop down and slide into his navel.</p><p>Behaving like a silly female cost me as soon as I took in my first shuddering, sobbing breath, and a lungful of sleeping powder along with it. In one corner of my heart I knew I\u2019d done it on purpose. The sad truth of it was that I couldn\u2019t stop Zarath because I didn\u2019t really care anymore. Now that Lucien was dead, the world no longer held anything of interest for me. I reached for my pendant, for the comfort it gave me whenever I touched it, and then I went still.</p><p>The pendant. Lucien had never given it back to me.</p><p>I staggered to the door and fumbled with the knob until it opened. Outside the office Celestino came at me, and in a dreamy haze I saw the blade fly from my hand and bury itself in his shoulder. I wandered past the writhing, shrieking mound of him on the floor, and shuffled my way down a long row of large crates. One stood open, half-filled with straw, and it looked so comfortable that I chose it as my hiding place.</p><p>I had enough sense to pile the straw atop me and pull the slatted lid back in place before I closed my eyes and surrendered to a sleep from which I might never awake.</p><p>I dreamed of the maze at Morehaven, where I walked through the hedges looking for my pendant and my lover. I had the notion that Lucien had hidden it somewhere there, as I could feel it, like him, very near to me. Yet no matter where I looked neither he nor the pendant were to be found.</p><p>I gave up the search when I reached the center of the maze, where his mechanized statues lay in pieces round the reflecting pool. Sitting down in the exact spot where I had given him my virtue, I thought of all that had happened since I\u2019d come to Rumsen.</p><p>It should have taken some time for my life to parade before my eyes, but it had gone so quickly. I\u2019d only lived a handful of years, years I\u2019d spent as quickly and recklessly as my lost childhood. Now that I faced the end, I could only imagine how disappointed in me my mother would have been. I had survived losing her and my father, my home, and nearly all that I had owned in the world. I\u2019d tried to spit in the eye of fate by helping others, and perhaps I had, but in the end I had nothing left to show for it.</p><p>I might have another chance when the powder wore off. If I survived Zarath and the Reaper invasion, I might flee Rumsen and start over somewhere else, but I would do it alone.</p><p>All at once I understood how wrong I had been to spare Zarath.</p><p>\u201cLucien,\u201d I said out loud. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t . . . If I have another chance, I\u2019ll try again.\u201d</p><p>The reflecting pool began to bubble, and from it a column of water rose and shaped itself into Dredmore\u2019s form.</p><p>\u201cYou were fated to be the end of me, to release me,\u201d the man made of water said. \u201cI saw it over and over in my dreams. Now that you have defied the portents, I am neither alive nor dead.\u201d</p><p>Even in spirit form he was annoying. \u201cI did say I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>He sloshed over to the side of the pool and sat down on the edge. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so damnably stubborn, Charmian, I might have prevented this and saved us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been a docile, obedient gel, you\u2019d have never looked twice at me,\u201d I told him, ignoring the way his face was dripping onto my shoulder. \u201cSo here we are. I\u2019m a failure and you\u2019re a fountain. The city is about to fall to the Reapers. Everyone I care about will die.\u201d I glanced at him. \u201cWhy are you still here? Zarath said you\u2019d gone over to the netherside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not gone, not yet, but it is a struggle to keep myself . . . intact.\u201d He glanced at his broken mechs before he reached out as if to touch my face. \u201cAs I am I cannot be with you in this world or the next. Nor can I escape my prison. I would bear it for you if I could.\u201d He drew back his shimmering hand. \u201cBut you must release me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can wait. Come here.\u201d Dredmore offered me his hand and drew me down into the pool, where he melted away into the water. I lay back, floating on the surface, and the soft coolness sank into me, permeating every corner of my mind and spirit with all that had been Lucien. I saw his life, how dark and cold it had been. His mind power to charm had appalled his parents, who had sent him away to spend his entire childhood at the strictest of schools. Upon gaining his degree, Dredmore had been given a small fortune by his mother, on the condition that he leave England and never return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Making the crossing had been a wretched ordeal for Lucien. He feared the sea, for it was his only weakness. It prevented him from using his mind power, but worse, it terrified him. He couldn\u2019t even swim.</p><p>Once in Toriana, a spiteful relation had made public his illegitimacy and the name of his commoner father, rendering Lucien an instant outcast among the blues. He might have used his gift to make a place for himself among the ton through his ability to charm, but instead he walled himself up in Morehaven to learn all he could about the dark arts. For ten years no one but his servants had even acknowledged his existence.</p><p>Becoming a deathmage had gained him the entry into society that his unfortunate birth had denied him, and his grateful clients had certainly made him rich, but behind his practiced cynicism Dredmore remained a lonely, wretched pariah. Until the day Connell had driven him through the market and a shaft of sunlight had illuminated the face of a common gel buying peaches. And in that moment, the torrents of passion and longing had flooded Lucien Dredmore\u2019s cold heart, bringing with them the first hope he\u2019d ever known.</p> <p>It seemed ironic that for all his magic he had been made powerless against me, thanks to my pendant.</p><p>The pendant.</p><p>Something Harry had said the first time he\u2019d appeared echoed through my thoughts: After twenty years of waiting and watching, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m free. And the curious thing Hedger had spat at him: Without that ginny bauble hanging about her neck she glows like a right black beacon.</p><p>If Dredmore were to be believed, I was a spell-breaker. Which meant magic had no power over me, nor could it be used in my presence. It explained why Rina\u2019s teller had been powerless to read for me. The snuffmages\u2019 balls had been rendered useless the moment they came near me. I\u2019d kept Liv from strangling, not by slapping her, but by touching her. By sitting on the bench next to Bridget\u2019s Charles, I\u2019d broken the no-love spell placed on him in France by his mother.</p><p>Could it be that simple?</p> <p>Without that ginny bauble\u2014</p><p>Dredmore had been wrong. My parents hadn\u2019t created the pendant to protect me against magic. If I were a spell-breaker, I\u2019d never need that sort of protection.</p><p>\u2014ginny bauble\u2014</p><p>Something hurt my face, hitting me so hard my teeth chattered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dead,\u201d I heard a hard voice say. \u201cDo you hear me, Kit? Open your eyes this minute, or I swear I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>I opened one eyelid to see Carina standing over my crate with a lantern. Her hair fell in a tangle about her dirty, bruised face, and blood trickled from a nasty cut across the swollen bridge of her nose. She wore some sort of rough, ragged cloak covered with filth and soot.</p> <p>As she raised her hand to wallop me again I raised an arm to shield myself. \u201cStop hitting me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother of Christ, you deserve a proper thrashing. And you will get one, the moment we\u2019re out of this mess.\u201d The ferocious anger on her face twisted into grim satisfaction as she put aside the lantern, shoved her hands under my arms, and hauled me out of the crate. \u201cWrecker\u2019s outside with a cart. Come on.\u201d</p><p>The air smelled hot and smoky, and made me cough as Rina dragged me through the darkness. \u201cWhat\u2019s on fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything that isn\u2019t warded,\u201d she snapped. \u201cSo shake your ass.\u201d</p><p>As we emerged from the cargo house, I saw three things I couldn\u2019t quite comprehend: Wrecker dressed in soot-stained yellow; a gravecart filled with dead harlots; and the Hill on fire.</p><p>\u201cNo time to gawk.\u201d Rina jerked my arm as she marched to the back of the cart. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky to make it out of the city alive.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the corpses of a dozen battered gels. All of them I recognized from the Eagle\u2019s Nest. At the top of the pile lay Almira, her apron spattered with blood round a gaping black gash in her abdomen.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe have to go the police. We have to tell them\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe coppers are busy with the blues,\u201d Rina said as she climbed up and wedged herself in a corner before offering me her hand. When I didn\u2019t take it, she swore. \u201cKit, I swear, I\u2019ll tie you to the back and drag you by the rope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared,\u201d Almira said, lifting her head a little to glare at me. \u201cWe\u2019re not dead, you goose. It\u2019s a ruse\u2014tar and tomato juice\u2014and it itches like sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast you\u2019re on top, old woman,\u201d a younger voice complained. \u201cOuch, Jude, that\u2019s my tit. Get your knee off.\u201d</p><p>I climbed up and curled into the corner opposite Rina. \u201cWhy are they pretending to be dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBunch of Talians locked us up in the Nest before they set fire to it,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cWe got out through the old sewers, but if they see any of us I\u2019ve no doubt they\u2019ll try again. Little bastards are nothing if not determined.\u201d</p><p>So Rina and the gels had been fleeing for their lives . . . and had ended up at the docks. \u201cHow did you know where to find me, and why did you bother to look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old tunneler met us in the sewer. Said you were in trouble and directed me to the cargo house. I almost didn\u2019t come, you know.\u201d Rina turned her head toward Wrecker. \u201cTake the road that runs through the teller\u2019s quarter. They\u2019ve not burned anything there.\u201d</p><p>Setting fire to the great houses on the Hill would have diverted the militia and the police there to do whatever they could; the ton represented Rumsen\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful families. That had left the rest of the city vulnerable. I could even understand why the Reapers had tried to incinerate Rina and her gels; they probably thought I had gone there to seek haven.</p><p>But why set the other fires? Why burn the unwarded?</p><p>When I asked Rina that, she made a bitter sound. \u201cSorry to say they\u2019ve not stopped to have tea and chat about it. Too occupied with torching houses and slaughtering innocents, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018They\u2019ve gone after anyone what don\u2019t have them wardlings, Miss Kit,\u201d Wrecker said over his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re checking every door and neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure that they\u2019re sparing anyone with wardlings?\u201d When he nodded, I felt my stomach clench. Dredmore had been shocked by something Walsh had said about the popular talismans. Something about dreamstone. I looked over at Rina. \u201cWe have to stop. I need to find a charm maker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do, and for some very good reason,\u201d my best friend said in a murderously pleasant tone, \u201cbut we\u2019re not stopping. Not for you, or wardlings, or even Herself if she suddenly appears and steps in front of the cart. George can be King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen push me off in the teller\u2019s quarter.\u201d Before Rina could reply I reached for her hand and gripped it. Her fingers felt like ice, and I realized how hard she was trying not to tremble. \u201cCarina, when we first met, when you left my house and went back on the stroll, do you know why I didn\u2019t try to come after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSod you, Kit.\u201d She dug her fingernails into my palm. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter everything that had been taken from you, you deserved the right to make your own choices and live your own life, no matter what I thought of it.\u201d I kissed her cheek and whispered, \u201cTime to pay me back, my gel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Talians want you dead, don\u2019t they?\u201d When I nodded, she swore viciously. \u201cWrecker, find an alley behind the tellers\u2019 shops. And give Kit two of your blades.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed against the lump in my throat and smiled my thanks as the big man held two of his best knives over his shoulder. \u201cWhere are you going from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle, maybe, if we can make it that far before it snows or the Talians catch up. We\u2019ll stop at the lumber camps for provisions, see if we can pick up some trade.\u201d She reached into her pocket and took out a small, bulging reticule, which she thrust in my hands. \u201cThere\u2019s enough here to buy yourself a young horse or an old carri. Take it,\u201d she added when I tried to give it back to her. \u201cIt\u2019s the chance to change your mind and get the bloody hell out.\u201d</p><p>The cart stopped, and before I climbed down I tucked away the blades, reached over, and wrapped my arms round Rina. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again someday, you know.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a tight, trembling hug in return. \u201cNot if I see you first, you daft twit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Once the cart had gone I moved to the end of the alley to check the streets, which appeared empty, and the shopfronts, all of which were dark. Lamplight flickered in some of the windows on the second and third floors, and I noted which of the charm makers was closest to me before retreating back into the alleyway.</p><p>Pulling down the fire escape ladders would have alerted anyone within three blocks to my presence, but fortunately most of them had already been lowered. The tellers might have been spared by the Reapers, but none of them seemed to be assuming they were safe.</p><p>I climbed up to the second floor over the charm maker\u2019s shop, and leaned over to look through the grimy window into the flat inside. One candle stub burned on the opposite side of the room, and I made out the vague silhouette of an old man wrapped in a blanket.</p><p>I tested the window, found it to be locked, and had to tap on it several times before the old man came over and opened it a few inches. \u201cEvening.\u201d</p><p>Frightened, angry eyes glared out at me. \u201cWhat do you want, gel?\u201d</p><p>I thought of how to put it. \u201cCan you tell me what happens when a particular stone is charmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet stuffed.\u201d The window slammed shut.</p><p>\u201cWait, sir.\u201d I reached in my pocket for Rina\u2019s gift and tapped it against the window. \u201cI can pay you.\u201d</p><p>The window remained shut for another minute, then rose just enough for me to squeeze through. \u201cWell? Come on, then, before you\u2019re seen.\u201d</p><p>I wriggled through the gap and made a quick if undignified entrance. The flat inside smelled of paper and cabbage, and had almost no furnishings. Great circles of wardlings had been nailed to every wall.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d As soon as I had my feet under me I bobbed a curtsey for good measure. \u201cI am truly sorry to disturb you on such a night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Jasper, not sir, and you\u2019re about as sorry as the cat what got caught with the canary feathers.\u201d He retreated back to his chair by the banked fire and swaddled himself again with his blanket. \u201cGive me ten in silver. No, twenty.\u201d</p><p>I had enough coin in the reticule to pay him a hundred times that, but dutifully counted out twenty and handed him the stack.</p><p>He checked each piece with his teeth before they disappeared under the blanket along with most of his face. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, his voice muffled. \u201cWhich stone is it you want to charm?\u201d</p> <p>Since there were no other chairs in the flat, I went to stand by the mantel. \u201cDreamstone.\u201d</p><p>His head poked up. \u201cYou climb up into my flat to ask me about a faeriestale? Have you gone off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have heard of it.\u201d As he scowled at me I lifted my hands. \u201cPlease, sir\u2014Mr. Jasper,\u201d I corrected myself. \u201cI have to know what happens when it\u2019s charmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be charmed since there\u2019s no such stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how could you know of it? You must have heard something from someone,\u201d I wheedled.</p> <p>\u201cYears ago some miners told tales about it. Said it were found in some pisshole in Cornwall. They only wanted to scare folk.\u201d Jasper saw my expression and sighed. \u201cWay the story went, some mage had been digging up half of Cornwall looking for it. Only it were the miners what found it first. The mage brought down a tunnel on their heads, stole it from them, used it to put them to sleep, and left them to die. Only one came out alive, and his people said the mage had used the stone on him.\u201d</p><p>The story was too similar to Hedger\u2019s for me to doubt it. \u201cSo charmed dreamstone makes people go to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir minds, aye. Their bodies stay awake and do whatever the mage what bespelled them wills. That\u2019s why they are also called the possession stones.\u201d He made a rude gesture. \u201cOnly there weren\u2019t no mage, no miners, and sure as Satan no bloody dreamstone.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the wardlings he\u2019d nailed to the walls. \u201cIf a stone like it were real, Mr. Jasper, would it have to be carried or worn by the person it controls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it, once it was \u2019spelled? Stones give off power like the sun gives heat. All people\u2019d have to do is stand close enough to be caught in the radiance.\u201d He glared. \u201cDon\u2019t you know nothing about magic, gel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil a few days ago, I didn\u2019t believe in it.\u201d I tried to smile, but if what I suspected was true, in a few hours all of Rumsen would belong to the Reapers. \u201cIs there any defense against a stone that could do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Course there isn\u2019t. Why would there be ? It don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mage in the miners\u2019 story,\u201d I coaxed, \u201chow was he defeated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike all the evildoers, by being killed in a body what was outside after dawn.\u201d He chuffed out a breath. \u201cNothing made of darkness can stand the light of day.\u201d</p><p>Did that mean my grandfather was evil? Dredmore, now, he could be crowned Prince of Darkness and no one would even question it, least of all me. But as annoying as Harry had been since he\u2019d come into my life, he\u2019d never behaved in any particularly evil manner.</p><p>Except to Hedger, who hated him. And Dredmore, who despised him. And my mother, who had made me promise to wear for the rest of my life the pendant she\u2019d made to keep me from seeing him . . .</p><p>Confused and angry now, I strode over to the wall of wardlings.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014hey, you quit that.\u201d He got up and tried to stop me from removing one of his talismans. \u201cIs that why you really crawled in here? To steal my only protection from me? I\u2019m calling for a beater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best shout loudly, then. They\u2019re all up on the Hill.\u201d I brushed his hands away and wrenched the wardling from the wall, throwing it as hard as I could to the floor. Silver-white light exploded across the room as it shattered into three pieces.</p> <p>While the light faded and the old charm maker squawked, I picked up one of the pieces and examined it. The outside of the wardling, which appeared to be silver, had cracked like cheap porcelain. Beneath the faux metal coating lay a dirty, speckled gray stone disk.</p><p>\u201cGimme that.\u201d The old man brought over his candle, and as soon as the light from the flame touched the stone the speckles glinted with all the colors of the rainbow.</p><p>The flashing colors made me feel lightheaded. \u201cWhat was the light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDispelled its power, you did,\u201d he muttered, snatching the piece from me and turning it this way and that. \u201cShattering charmed stone always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is dreamstone.\u201d What was it doing inside the wardling?</p><p>\u201cThese wardlings were struck from pure silver, they said,\u201d the old man griped. \u201cCharged me double for \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently they lied.\u201d I picked up the other pieces. \u201cWhere did you buy them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cargo house down by the dock that deals in stone and metals.\u201d He brought the broken wardling over to the lit candle and studied it again. \u201cQuarry masters have been bringing \u2019em in by the shipload for months. Can\u2019t keep \u2019em stocked. Demand was so high they had to start importing \u2019em from Talia.\u201d He looked up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s all being sold now: Talian-made wardlings.\u201d</p><p>Walsh had said something about the Talians forging them, but I\u2019d assumed he meant forged as in hammering them out of metal. I was dealing with another counterfeiting operation, like the one that had robbed Rina\u2019s poor old gent Wiggins of his bacco boxes, only on a much grander scale. \u201cBut everyone still believes they\u2019re from the queensland.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders hunched. \u201cWe knew, but silver\u2019s silver. Don\u2019t matter if it\u2019s English or Talian.\u201d</p><p>Unless someone was planning to invade a country. \u201cIf every wardling in the city has dreamstone inside it then why haven\u2019t the stones affected the people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s always been thought stuff and nonsense. Stones always work their charms, unless . . .\u201d He fell silent, dropping the broken piece and shuffling back from it. \u201cNo. Couldn\u2019t be. They\u2019d never put so many unspelled stones in one place. Who\u2019d be mad enough to do that?\u201d</p><p>I went after him and grabbed his arms to keep him from crumpling to the floor. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they working, Mr. Jasper?\u201d When he didn\u2019t speak, I shook him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stone don\u2019t work its charm if it\u2019s raw. Never been spelled,\u201d he added, his eyes wide and his voice going hoarse. \u201cRaw stone soaks up power a hundred times quicker, too. Longer it\u2019s left unspelled, the more power it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything what lives: people, animals, plants. That\u2019s why all stone\u2019s spelled for the first time in the quarries, before it\u2019s shipped. To keep us safe.\u201d His face screwed up and he clutched at his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t take any more of this,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cMy heart\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d I helped him over to his chair and tucked his blanket round him. \u201cIf the stones in the wardlings were never spelled, then they\u2019ve been absorbing power for months.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cAye. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more question, Mr. Jasper, and I will.\u201d I bent down so I could see his face. \u201cWhat happens if a mage tries to spell all these raw dreamstones now?\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye to give me a hopeless look. \u201cHe\u2019s only got to spell one, gel. Raw stones stay connected to each other, like they are under the ground before they\u2019re mined. That and all the power they\u2019ve soaked up will cause the spell to spread on its own. There\u2019ll be nowhere to hide from them then.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to leave him like this, but I had to find Zarath before he cast the spell. \u201cI\u2019ll ask one of your neighbors to take you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019m the only one what has a carri.\u201d He sounded more peevish than worried. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend my last hours here, in my place.\u201d</p><p>I felt horrible. \u201cIs your heart really that weak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my heart, gel. The stones.\u201d He made a fretful sound. \u201cWith that kind of power, as soon as the spell\u2019s worked, we\u2019ll all go into the dreams. Every man, woman, and child in the city. No one will ever wake up from them. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>It seemed I was going back to the docks sooner than I\u2019d planned. I persuaded the charm maker to let me borrow his transport, which he stored in the merchant\u2019s carrihouse on the corner. Mr. Jasper gave me his keyfob, which he said the doorman would demand to see before letting me in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll return it as soon as I can,\u201d I promised.</p><p>\u201c \u2019 Twon\u2019t matter to me if you do,\u201d he muttered, staring into the hearth\u2019s embers. \u201cWe\u2019re finished, all of us.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t giving up, so I hurried down to the corner and presented the keyfob to the lad working the door.</p><p>He looked me over, his cheeks pinking as he did. \u201cYou\u2019re not Mr. Jasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow astute of you to notice,\u201d I praised him. \u201cI\u2019m Mr. Jasper\u2019s daughter, Constance Payne.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re Old Jasper\u2019s kid? But he weren\u2019t never married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch to my mother\u2019s everlasting sorrow, my father abandoned her after one night of love.\u201d I sighed. \u201cAfter enduring decades of needling guilt, he came to regret his cruelty and searched high and low for me until we were reunited. Now here I am, to run his every errand and make golden his final years. For which tonight I need his carri. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the back. Stall thirteen.\u201d Reluctantly he handed back the keyfob. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out driving by yourself, miss. There\u2019s a bad lot of furriners running about hurting people and setting fires. Burnt the Hill, they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the concern, but I\u2019ll manage.\u201d I walked back to stalls, found the one numbered thirteen, and surveyed Mr. Jasper\u2019s transport. Of course it was as old and cantankerous-looking as its owner, but as soon as I punched the ignition and cranked the motor it wheezed and chugged to life. As I wasn\u2019t used to driving, I took my time easing it out of the stall, then drove to the front, where the doorman opened the gate. Since it had no glasshield I had to squint against the smoke pouring out of the old coal burner into my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The lad held up his hand for me to brake, and once I had he handed me some gogs for my eyes. \u201cYou take care, miss,\u201d he yelled over the sound of the old motor.</p><p>I wanted to climb out and hug him, but settled for strapping on the eyewear and giving a fond wave.</p><p>The carri puttered along steadily as I drove it to the Silken Dream. From Bridget\u2019s storefront I could see the houses on the Hill still burning out of control, and the long line of carris and heavily laden carts clogging up the roads down. If anyone survived this night, it would likely be the rich, as they had all the cops dancing attendance on them.</p> <p>I knew Bridget kept a spare keylace in one of the lilac-filled planters flanking the front door, which I used to let myself in. The dresses on the forms in the front were all ball gowns, which would be impossible to put on without a maid, so I went to the back storeroom. There hung a selection of day and evening frocks on long racks, and I searched through them looking for something simple I could pull over my head.</p><p>\u201cThieving bitch. Get your filthy hands off my clothes.\u201d</p><p>I whirled round to see Bridget standing behind me, a pistol in her fist. \u201cBridget, it\u2019s me.\u201d I pulled up the gogs to show her my face.</p><p>\u201cKit?\u201d She lifted the lantern in her other hand and peered, and then lowered the gun. \u201cWhat in nine hells are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed something to wear.\u201d I gestured at my stained, torn skirts. \u201cSomething a bit cleaner.\u201d</p> <p>She set down the lantern. \u201cRumsen\u2019s been attacked, there are Talians out there torching the ton and slitting the throats of disbelievers, and not a cop to be had away from the Hill.\u201d Her voice climbed to a piercing octave. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve come to borrow a dress?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind lending me another one that will end up fit only for a ragbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind me.\u201d Bridget flung her hand about. \u201cTake whatever you want. I don\u2019t care. Take it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly need one, but thanks.\u201d I pulled a pretty light green silk from one of the hangers. \u201cWhy are you still here in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie got wind of this yesterday,\u201d she said as she came over to help me. \u201cI told him to take the kids and go south. We\u2019ve a place down in Zhuma, on the coast, where they can wait it out. They\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d</p><p>I knew her husband to be an extremely practical man who would naturally protect his family first. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t leave you behind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe thinks me and my parents are following him by train. Lift your arms.\u201d As I did, she pulled my skirts over my head and tossed them aside. Wrecker\u2019s knives, which I had forgotten, fell to the floor. Gingerly she retrieved them. \u201cWhy are you carrying kneecapper blades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a cannon\u2019s a bit too bulky.\u201d I watched her set them on a pin table. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you and your parents on a train now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Da; he won\u2019t leave the mill to burn, not with all the goods still on the looms. Mum won\u2019t leave him, so I had to stay to look after them. I only chanced coming to the shop to see if any of the gels were using it as a hidey-hole.\u201d She stripped off my petticoats. \u201cGod, you reek. Don\u2019t you ever bathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot of late.\u201d I wriggled as the first fresh petticoat went over my head, and withstood another atop that before I protested. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Any more and I won\u2019t be able to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are silk, not cotton. You can fly in them.\u201d Bridget eased the dress over my head and worked it down, straightening the full skirt and adjusting the sewn-in waister. \u201cI\u2019m going to the mill when I leave here, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ll stay until it\u2019s finished. You should come with me, love. Mum and Da have laid in enough supplies to last us to Doomsday, and Charlie left five of the stablemen behind as my guards. They\u2019re proper bruisers, all of them.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhen you get to the mill, take down all the wardlings your Da has about the place. \u201cI picked up a thin hairpin from a dressing table and tucked it inside my mouth. \u201cThen toss them in the gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stopped buttoning me up. \u201cThat\u2019ll mash \u2019em to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I told her what Mr. Jasper had said, and added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe it. Just do it for me. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I believe you.\u201d She backed away from me and pulled out the pistol. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to know is, how did a stupid little twit like you find out?\u201d</p><p>My heart almost stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jesting.\u201d She didn\u2019t take her eyes off me as she called out, \u201cShe\u2019s ready to go now, boys.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem real until two of Walsh\u2019s footmen came in. Even then I didn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cYou can\u2019t be part of this, Bridge. Not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not me? You still think I\u2019m a loomgel at heart? I haven\u2019t been, Kit, not for years.\u201d Her face changed as she put on one of her haughty Madam looks. \u201cI am Madam Duluc, wife to one of the richest men in Toriana and France. Why should I care about the likes of you?\u201d</p><p>She was acting. She had to be. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Bridget said to the men as they started toward me. \u201cShe\u2019ll try to run, this one. Get some rope.\u201d She handed one of the blades Wrecker had given me to the other brute. \u201cPut this in my carri. I want it as a souvenir.\u201d</p><p>Once the brutes had left and we were alone, I expected Bridget to lower the pistol and tell me it was all a farce. She didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really going to do this,\u201d I assured her. \u201cYou can\u2019t hand me over to them like I\u2019m nothing to you. I was your friend long before you met Charlie.\u201d When she said nothing, I felt my heart clench. \u201cSweet Mary, Bridget Sullivan. Were you ever mine?\u201d</p><p>A mask of real anger settled over her face. \u201cI never met anyone as bloody mule-headed as you, Kit. Told you to stay away from the Hill, didn\u2019t I? But no. You had to go nosing round Walsh and his business. You did this to yourself, dearie.\u201d She strode to me, grabbing me by the hair and jerking me close. In a murmur, she said, \u201cThey took Charlie and the kids, and they\u2019re holding them on a ship somewhere. Said I\u2019d only get them back alive if I did this. Sorry, love.\u201d In a louder voice she said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m done with you.\u201d She slipped her hand into a seam on the side of my skirt that shouldn\u2019t have been open. I understood why it was when I felt the second of Wrecker\u2019s blades being tucked in my garter. \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll shut up now, and when they take you to the master, give him exactly what he deserves.\u201d</p><p>I had to put on a show for Walsh\u2019s men when they returned, so I struggled and called out to her, begging for her to save me while wanting her to do no such thing at all.</p><p>Bridget pretended to be indifferent, although just as they dragged me off she looked sick.</p><p>Outside the shop the men used the rope to bind my wrists and ankles, so there was no getting to Wrecker\u2019s blade after they tossed me in the back of their carri. I fell over on my side and stayed there, enduring the jolting as I thought through every possible course of action.</p><p>Obviously Zarath wouldn\u2019t be fooled by renewed protestations of my love this time round. I\u2019d count myself a lucky gel to get a word out before he took retribution. As long as I was bound I couldn\u2019t use Wrecker\u2019s knife to defend myself. Anyway, the blade was steel, and would do nothing to hurt the Aramanthan. If I was smart I\u2019d plant it in my own heart as soon as I got a hand free. Zarath couldn\u2019t hurt a corpse.</p><p>But the Reapers intended to turn everyone in Rumsen into walking corpses, and I couldn\u2019t allow that, not if there was something I could do to stop them. I\u2019d also promised Dredmore that I would set his spirit free.</p><p>I smelled the docks a few seconds before the carri screeched to a stop. I closed my eyes and went limp, keeping up the pretense of a faint until one of them tossed me over his shoulder. From that vantage point I saw (upside down and in snatches, of course) that they were delivering me to a big clipper with black sails and a pitch-covered hull. Up the gangway we went, and I caught a few glimpses of a group of men in bankers\u2019 suits before I was dumped on the deck before them.</p><p>\u201cUntie her; she\u2019s not going anywhere. This is the one who attacked the master?\u201d one of the suits asked as the rope was removed from my wrists and ankles.</p><p>\u201cAye. Caught her at the gowner\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Through the slits of my eyes I watched the two footmen retreat before I concentrated on being nothing more than a pile of laundry.</p><p>\u201cVery good. I wasn\u2019t anxious to cut the throat of such a valuable pawn as Duluc,\u201d the suit said, his chilly voice closer now. He nudged me over with a careless prod of his shoe. \u201cI know this tart. She hires herself out to dispel magic.\u201d His tone hardened. \u201cBringing her here was foolish. Even on the Hill she has a reputation for being most effective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has but a few pathetic tricks,\u201d a new but very familiar voice replied. \u201cNone of them will stop us or save her now.\u201d Celestino. So he had survived my stabbing.</p><p>I could only cringe on the inside and pray that Zarath would make an appearance before his underling repaid me in kind.</p><p>\u201cI know what happened when the master returned to us,\u201d the suit said. \u201cIf she is so harmless, then why would Lucien Dredmore surrender his body to protect her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalsh said the fool was in love with her.\u201d</p><p>I dared lifted one eyelid, just enough to see the Talian, his hair hanging in oily rings over his forehead, his arm bound up in a sling tied over his blood-blotched jacket. He walked to me and as he crouched down I closed my eye again. \u201cWhy is she like this? Did you beat her into unconsciousness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d the footman said. \u201cShe fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are so delicate, the ladies of this country.\u201d Celestino stood up. \u201cBut this one, she is more like the cockroach. You must crush her under your heel slowly, like a tick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guessing what he meant to do, I bit the inside of my lip, but the boot that slammed into my belly kicked a cry of pain up through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat would be for stabbing me,\u201d the Talian mentioned as he drew back his boot. \u201cAnd this\u201d\u2014he kicked me in the back\u2014\u201cis for the master.\u201d</p><p>Knowing there would be more of the same or worse, I curled over and made pitiful noises, crawling a bit while I measured the distance between my body and the edge of the deck. There was railing to contend with, but not a great height of it.</p> <p>\u201cZarath wanted her alive, did he not?\u201d one of the suits inquired.</p><p>\u201cSo he will have her,\u201d Celestino said. \u201cA few broken bones will not make any difference to him.\u201d</p><p>When his boot struck my ribs, I turned onto my side, tucking my arms against me and wailing as if he\u2019d cracked something. The fourth time he came at me I let the impact roll me over\u2014and kept rolling until I collided with the railing.</p><p>I was up and over the side before anyone could react, and plummeted down the side of the ship like a stone. Before I fell between the hull and the dock into the murky water I reached out, catching a mooring rope with my hands. Splinters of oakum stabbed into my palms, and grabbing on in midfall nearly wrenched my arms out of their sockets, but I didn\u2019t let go. Once I stopped bobbing I swung my legs out and back, out and back until I had enough momentum to make the leap to the dock.</p><p>I collapsed on the boards as soon as I landed, and for a moment I wasn\u2019t sure I could rise again. Then I heard fast, heavy thuds and the gangway bouncing and struggled to my feet.</p> <p>I hiked up my skirts and ran from the ship to the way station, where I glanced back. Celestino and his men had reached the bottom of the gangway, but they weren\u2019t chasing me. They were just standing there, watching.</p><p>Slowly I turned round to see Dredmore walking toward me with an unhurried pace. He wore a new set of powder-free clothing, over which he had put on Lucien\u2019s greatcoat, and carried a strange black club covered with scarlet symbols.</p><p>\u201cOh, hello, Lucien.\u201d I had nowhere to run, and too many reasons to stay. \u201cDid you have a nice nap? Sorry about the headache. A little chamomile soother will work wonders on that. Shall I go fetch some for you from a cart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would return.\u201d He didn\u2019t try to club me over the head or grab me, but put his knuckles under my chin to tip up my face. \u201cMortal love makes you this foolish. But even if you could dispossess me, woman, the spirit of your man will not return to this body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And I was a fool for thinking I could do this.</p><p>Someone groaned, and I heard the door of the way station rattle. \u201cYou out there. I can\u2019t get out. Help me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Zarath ignored Montrose Walsh\u2019s squealing as he stroked my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cYou came to prevent me from casting the spell. That will not happen. You may watch instead. In a few moments, you and every mortal in this city will belong to me.\u201d</p><p>I turned my face away. \u201cNot if I break the spell first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not one spell, foolish child. It is thousands upon thousands. Once it is released, not even I could stop it.\u201d The scarlet symbols on the black club began to glow. \u201cBut I shall use it to send you into a waking dream, where you will know every time I take my pleasure of your pain and your flesh, where you can do nothing but feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow delightful.\u201d I shuffled back and reached behind me for the way station\u2019s door latch, and from it removed the iron rail tie I\u2019d used to keep Montrose imprisoned inside. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom why everyone finds you so utterly repulsive,\u201d I mentioned as I pocketed the spike. \u201cI mean, other than the way you talk, behave, think, and smell, you\u2019re quite the catch, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed hold of my bodice, tearing it as he jerked me close. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to hell.\u201d I spat in his face.</p><p>He took hold of my throat with one hand and cut off my air, and no matter how I clawed at him, kept strangling me. Shadows loomed before my eyes, inviting me to throw myself into them. Looking into death was such a terrible relief that I gasped.</p><p>Zarath\u2019s hand clapped over my mouth at the same time he released my neck, and the need to breathe overcame everything. I didn\u2019t realize he had shoved a stone into my mouth until it slid to the back of my tongue and went down my throat. It burned my insides as it went down, and I fought to stop it, coughing and retching violently. Nothing came out, and then I felt it in my stomach, hot and cold, an unbearable weight.</p> <p>Zarath put his mouth next to my ear. \u201cDo you feel her? That is my queen, Anamorg. She is inside you now, and she will keep you from breaking any spell. I have only to release her from the stone, and your body will be hers. Then Anamorg will devour your spirit, and you will be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a very pretty name, is it? Anamorg.\u201d I rasped out the words as I reached in my pocket for the rail tie. \u201cSounds to me like a disease of the bottom.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened with outrage. \u201cFor that I will make you know agony as you could not imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but it\u2019s my turn now.\u201d I threw myself against him, knocking him down on his back. I had only a moment to straddle him, raise the iron spike I\u2019d taken from the door handle of the way station, and strike.</p><p>I thought I might hesitate, staring down at Dredmore\u2019s face, knowing what I was about to do. Yet my hand never wavered or faltered, and I plunged the spike deep into his chest, thrusting it down with all my strength.</p><p>Zarath heaved me off, clutching the end of the spike as he convulsed. He rolled onto his side, curling over before he lurched onto all fours. His head came up and he roared out his pain and fury until the sound died and a bloody froth bubbled from his lips. I backed away into Montrose, who stood gaping at the sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he yelped.</p><p>Zarath staggered onto his feet, pulling at the spike as obscenely wet sounds poured out along with the blood from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI killed a monster.\u201d I couldn\u2019t bear to see him die, but I couldn\u2019t look away until I was sure he had. \u201cAnd I saved a man.\u201d</p><p>The Aramanthan reeled toward the ship, but he strayed too close to the edge of the dock, where he fell into the water with a tremendous splash.</p><p>Celestino, who had run toward us, stopped in his tracks. His eyes rolled back in his head, and he collapsed like a rag doll. I saw the other men by the gangplank do the same, and then Montrose fell in front of me, face-first into the dock.</p><p>I knelt on the edge of the pier, shoving my fingers deep into my mouth so that I might cast up the stone, but it wouldn\u2019t come out of me. The sensation of burning and freezing faded, leaving me with only the feeling of a rock in my belly. Anamorg, queen of the Reapers, waiting to awake inside me.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head and saw Inspector Doyle standing a few feet away. \u201cOh, hello, Tommy.\u201d Two beaters flanked him, and each held their nightsticks ready. \u201cFilthy day, isn\u2019t it? All this smoke is plaguing my eyes something awful.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>As I sat in Questioning at Rumsen Main Station I idly wished for a dagger. They\u2019d taken Wrecker\u2019s from me, but I didn\u2019t especially need a kneecapper\u2019s blade. Any dagger, even a penknife, would suffice for the last bit of killing I had to do.</p><p>I caught a whiff of piss as I imagined it. A quick slash across the carotid. Lots of blood\u2014lots of mess\u2014but they were used to tidying up death here. I knew no one would shout for help or call for the whitecart. If anything, they\u2019d have their tea hour down at the pub and share a few good-riddance pints.</p><p>They might still at that. I had one sleeve left intact. When they tossed me in my cell, I\u2019d be alone.</p><p>For now I\u2019d have to endure this. Sitting shackled to a chair for hours wasn\u2019t comfortable, but it was a nice break from the hell I\u2019d been through over the past two weeks.</p><p>Questioning, for all its hideous rep, wasn\u2019t as bad as all that. Dust coated the gaslight chimneys, all of which were blackened on the inside from long use. Yellowed wanted posts and faded ambrotype tints hung on point from a warped cork-backed board, on which someone had pasted a headline from The Queen\u2019s Voice: Your Colonial Taxes at Work. It hadn\u2019t taken that long for Her Majesty to decide to appropriate all unprocessed colonial gold for Herself, or men would still be out panning the rivers.</p><p>Grimy footprints and skid marks from rubber-soled shoes made odd trails across the cheap pine floor planks. Old pipe and cigar smoke had shriveled an orange-clove pomander hanging from the window bars to the size of a walnut.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t in any better shape. I needed a bath, a drink, and my head examined. Whatever they did to me, though, I wasn\u2019t explaining what had happened at the docks. I wasn\u2019t even sure I understood it. All I could feel was the awful weight inside me, like some hidden rot just waiting for the right moment to bloom.</p><p>Chief Inspector Tom Doyle came in and closed the door behind him. He didn\u2019t come at me but walked to one end of the room, and then the other.</p><p>I watched him back and forth it. Working three straight shifts hadn\u2019t wrinkled his jacket or trousers, and damp comb marks streaked his short hair. It didn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019d taken the time to wash up and shave. He\u2019d spent ten years in H.M.\u2019s Fleet, and now had a bit of that all-hands-on-deck look about him. Now I was the enemy, and naturally he had to evaluate my threat potential before he issued any orders. I wondered if he\u2019d ever dreamt we\u2019d come to this.</p><p>Doyle finally tired of pacing, yanked out the chair on the other side of the table, and dropped in it. Gave me that cool, flint-edged stare he\u2019d inherited from his Grandda, and said: \u201cWhy did you do it, Kit?\u201d</p><p>I gave him my full statement in four words. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d Of course I had, but admitting it wouldn\u2019t gain me much chance to finish the work. For that I\u2019d need a nice, quiet, isolated cell in lockup. \u201cIs that what this is about, then? You\u2019ve got the wrong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll send you to the gallows.\u201d Beneath his rage was something more I hadn\u2019t expected to see: regret. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI doubt it. They hardly ever hang women.\u201d A cramp in my right shoulder made me adjust the drape of my arms round the back of the chair. The five-link chain between my shackles jingled. \u201cYou\u2019ve no body, no credible witnesses. How could I have done him, what with me being such a young, helpless female and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve better.\u201d He bent to one side, took something from his case, and placed it on the table between us. A small, flat square, carefully swaddled in soft black cloth. He didn\u2019t have to unwrap it to show me what it was.</p><p>I stared at it, fascinated. \u201cYou\u2019ve glass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ve glass.\u201d He braced his hands on the table and leaned over it. \u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>It had to be a trick, the glass blank, the threat empty. Unless\u2014\u201cShow it to me.\u201d</p><p>Tom unwrapped the cloth to expose the plate inside.</p><p>Silverblack mottled the slick surface with splotches and lines. They formed the reverse image of a long dock, a tall woman, and the possessed lover she was straddling. This tint showed the finer details. The tears in her bodice. The blood on her mouth. The iron spike she was just about to thrust into the monster\u2019s chest.</p><p>Damn me, he had it all on glass. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it looks like.\u201d</p> <p>He picked up the ambrotype showing me killing Lucien Dredmore. \u201cThis is not you shoving a rail tie through the man\u2019s chest, then.\u201d Hot blue eyes shifted to the remains of my bodice. \u201cAnd I suppose that\u2019s not Dredmore\u2019s blood all over your tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Well, most of it wasn\u2019t his blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a homicidal twin sister tucked away somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cOnly child.\u201d</p><p>Tom checked his pocket watch. \u201cAfter you didn\u2019t kill Dredmore, did someone else kick him over the side of the dock and send him for a bathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d I wished I could explain, but he\u2019d never believe it. \u201cTommy\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInspector Doyle to the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector Doyle.\u201d So much for the tender bud of that relationship. \u201cI did not stab Lucien Dredmore in the heart or pitch his ass in the bay. I may have wanted to\u2014I may have even dreamt about it now and then\u2014but I am innocent of these charges being filed against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>I smelled piss again and glanced down. No wonder the floor and the seat felt tacky; the chap they\u2019d brought in before me had disgraced himself. Maybe the Yard hadn\u2019t cleaned it up very well in order to break down the resistance of subsequent suspects. The stench was certainly working wonders on me.</p><p>\u201cKit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening here?\u201d No, he couldn\u2019t, that much was obvious. \u201cThink about it, Tommy. I hate the bleeding bastard. Everyone knows that. They wanted him and me out of the way. One stone, two birds. So they arranged to make it look like I killed him, and we\u2019re both done for. Oldest trick in the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re being framed for Dredmore\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>I kept a straight face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who took this, and the others.\u201d He shoved the glass across the table at me. \u201cI was there at the docks the entire time, Kit. I watched you kill him. I arrested you at the scene.\u201d His blond brows formed a vee over his bright blue eyes. \u201cAnd I will testify.\u201d</p><p>So he would, because that was the sort of man he was. If things had gone differently, Tommy and I might have been mates. Another thing to regret, but not enough to keep me from hanging myself. It didn\u2019t matter. My life had ended hours ago when Zarath had shoved that spirit stone down my throat.</p><p>I had to finish this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say that we\u2019ve slept together,\u201d I said. \u201cMy barrister will use it to destroy your credibility\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pain exploded across my face and my head snapped to one side as his swinging hand connected with my cheek. I spat some blood-streaked saliva on the floor and rolled the bottom of my jaw.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Inspector. Go on, hit me again. Use your fist this time. I deserve it, lying bitch that I am.\u201d If I were very lucky, I might be able to goad him into breaking my neck.</p><p>\u201cSo you can use the bruises to discredit me?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat happened, Kit? What did he do to you? How in God\u2019s name did he drive you to murder? You were lovers.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019d rather bed a jackal.\u201d</p><p>Doyle took something from his pocket and tossed it down in front of me. The last time I\u2019d seen the old chain, Dredmore had made it vanish. Now, looking at it and the crystal-encrusted stone pendant hanging from it, I could hardly take in enough air to form words. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe recovered it,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe also have the murder weapon, which was recovered from the docks. It\u2019ll be tested. They\u2019ll find his blood on it.\u201d</p><p>My hand shook as I scraped my fingers against the table, catching the chain and using it to tug the nightstone to me. As soon as I covered it with my palm, I felt something like tiny gears inside turning a notch. Before Zarath had possessed him Lucien had said he would be where Harry had been . . . and then I knew. I knew it all.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the body?\u201d Without thinking I tried to stand, only to be jerked back as my shackles cut into my wrists. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown at the docks in a skip net,\u201d he said. \u201cAwaiting transport to the morgue. And why the devil do you care?\u201d</p><p>The pendant changed everything. \u201cI want a vicar.\u201d</p><p>Outrage flagged his cheekbones red. \u201cYou don\u2019t get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll confess,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cTo all of it. Everything. In my own hand, if you like. After I speak to my vicar.\u201d</p><p>He stared. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been Church.\u201d</p><p>I ran my tongue along the seam where my cheek met my gum line. \u201cRemorse has converted me. It\u2019s a miracle. Now, the vicar, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Fury left Doyle speechless, and he stalked out. As soon as the door slammed I hooked the hairpin nestled next to my bottom gum with my tongue and caught it between my teeth. I turned my face as far as I could to the left and spat it carefully over my shoulder. It fell neatly into my cupped hands. I took a moment to work my wrist until it felt looser, stretched out the chain between the cuffs, and went to work.</p><p>The air vent was too small, and I\u2019d never make it to the end of the corridor outside. That left the window, and the lock on the inside grid. Once I\u2019d opened it I shoved it up, catching by reflex the old pomander as it fell. I left it on the table along with my shackles for Doyle.</p><p>The pendant I took with me.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Escaping Rumsen Main in the middle of being questioned by Inspector Doyle proved almost comically simple; perhaps Tommy thought someone who had essentially just confessed to murdering the most important mage in the province incapable of such a feat.</p><p>As I jumped from the window to the alley, I hoped his anger and outrage over what he thought he\u2019d seen at the docks would keep him from returning to the questioning room for at least another half hour. I needed to put some distance between me and all the beaters Tommy would be sending out to hunt for me. Once again on foot, I made haste down the alleyways.</p><p>I wrapped the broken chain of my pendant round my fist. I\u2019d cherished it as a gift from my parents, and worn it practically every day of my life, but now it felt like an iron ball. As soon as this was over I\u2019d find a nice big furnace to toss it in. And then there was the stone in my belly, waiting like some slumbering, poisonous snake. Somehow I had to get that out of me before something woke up Zarath\u2019s queen and she had my spirit for tea.</p><p>I halted at the corner of the next street, forced to wait on a long row of hog carts coming down from the smoldering remains of the mansions on the Hill. Someone had piled costly furnishings, paintings, and other trappings of wealth in the back of the carts, right on top of the old, filthy straw. Even what didn\u2019t end up stained with the former occupants\u2019 waste and fluids would definitely absorb the distinctive stench.</p><p>Servants would have set fire to their masters\u2019 possessions before permitting them to be hauled away in pig carts.</p><p>I caught up to one of the tired-looking nobbers providing escort for the carts. Soot blackened the end of his nose, his eyebrows were gone, and patches of burnt flesh showed through the rags he\u2019d tied round both hands.</p><p>\u201cEvening,\u201d I said as I stretched my legs to pace him. \u201cAre you lads back from the Hill? Were you able to save anything from Walsh\u2019s Folly?\u201d</p><p>He spared me a tired glance. \u201cPiss off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lady Diana\u2019s cousin and companion, actually.\u201d I tried to pitch my voice to sound half-snobby, half-forlorn. \u201cHer husband got himself killed last night. I\u2019ve just come from the morgue, and now I\u2019ve got to break the news to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTha\u2019so?\u201d He looked a bit uncomfortable now. \u201cPitiful, this night\u2019s business. Bloody Talians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking all this?\u201d I gestured to the cart.</p><p>\u201cSome bigwig said move what we could down to the cargo houses.\u201d A glimmer of sour humor came over his features. \u201cWouldn\u2019t give us naught for hauling, \u2019course, so we had to make do.\u201d</p><p>Evidently the nobbers had loaded the ton\u2019s treasures deliberately into pig carts\u2014and everyone said they had no sense of humor. I let him hear a little of my chuckle before I turned it into a polite cough. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m headed. Milady and her maids were taken down to the docks for their safety. Can\u2019t find a cabbie to save my life, though.\u201d I tugged at my bloodstained bodice. \u201cI\u2019d walk, but I\u2019ve already been attacked once by some bloke covered in blood. Be all right if I walk with you, then?\u201d</p><p>He looked doubtful. \u201cWith this pong, you\u2019d want to?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and let my voice quaver a little. \u201cBetter than going on alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d He tugged on the lead rein, stopping the horses before offering me a hand. \u201cBut you\u2019ll ride this time, lass.

Once he whistled the tired horses shuffled back into motion, and we were off.</p><p>As I suspected, the smell drove everyone away from the carts, even the beaters who came trotting from the direction of Rumsen Main. I hoped as long as I kept my head down and didn\u2019t do anything to draw attention to myself I\u2019d be as good as invisible.</p> <p>Through the snarls of my hair I noted the brigadiers who were putting out fires by pumping seawater from tanker carts into the household tubes. If the owners survived the night, they\u2019d be returning to a wet, scorched mess, but at least the stone shells of their homes would still stand. I hoped my own place would still be intact, and then I recalled that it wasn\u2019t mine anymore. A laugh escaped me as I realized that I was not only a fugitive murderess but also a vagrant.</p><p>The cart creaked to a stop at the back of a loading dock, and the nobber helped me down from the seat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re keeping the gentry over there, with their boats,\u201d he told me, nodding in the direction of the yacht yards. \u201cI\u2019d walk you over, but I\u2019ve to unload all this scram first.\u201d</p><p>I started to thank him, and then did one better by giving him a deep, respectful curtsey. \u201cI will always remember your kindness, dear sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, now. Weren\u2019t nothing.\u201d He looked pleased and embarrassed. \u201cGet on with you, then.\u201d</p> <p>I started toward the yacht yard, but as soon as my escort went to hitch the horses I turned and hurried toward the docks. I could see the militia standing guard on the deck of the Talian ship, and counted among the prisoners shackled to the mast Montrose Walsh as well as Celestino. On the dock below stood a beater next to a row of bodies covered by blood- and soot-stained tarps; on the very end was one soaked with wide patches of brackish water.</p><p>This thing will occupy my flesh, Dredmore murmured from my last memory of him, but my spirit will go where it can never touch me. I understand now. I will be where Harry has been, all this time.</p><p>Zarath hadn\u2019t won. Not yet.</p><p>The beater bristled as I approached him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here, miss. Crime scene, this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector Thomas Doyle sent me,\u201d I lied. \u201cI am\u2014I was\u2014in the employ of Lord Dredmore. I\u2019ve come down from Morehaven to identify his remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d The beater looked confused. \u201cI thought he were already tagged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asked to confirm it\u2019s him.\u201d I walked past him, moving down the line of tarps. I glanced back. \u201cWhich one, please?\u201d</p><p>The beater took a step after me, stopped, and then waved an arm. \u201cOn the very end. Mind you don\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><p>I got to the tarp and dropped down beside it, gripping the pendant tightly as I uncovered Dredmore\u2019s head. Death had leached the cruel beauty from his features; they resembled a waxen mask cast in a too-smooth mold. When I lay my hand on his brow it felt like icy, damp stone.</p><p>\u201cI said not to touch!\u201d the beater called to me.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I removed the pendant from my pocket, carefully draping the chain round his neck before I stood and stepped back. \u201cAll right, Lucien. The spell is over. I\u2019m releasing you.\u201d</p><p>While I waited for Dredmore\u2019s spirit to return to his body, I wondered how he had fathomed the secret of my pendant. The mystery had come together for me only while Doyle had been questioning me, and even now I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d worked it out exactly right. My doubts loomed as Dredmore\u2019s body remained still and lifeless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do this to me, Lucien,\u201d I muttered, reaching down to smack his face. \u201cNot after all I\u2019ve gone through this night. You\u2019re a deathmage, damn you. Surely you can overcome it\u2014you must try. For me, please.\u201d</p><p>A shadow fell over Dredmore\u2019s body, one that was shaped like Inspector Doyle. \u201cStep away from the corpse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head. \u201cI lied to you, Tommy. I didn\u2019t kill Dredmore. He wasn\u2019t in his body, you see, because he put his spirit inside my pendant. Give him a minute and he\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that.\u201d He took hold of my arm. \u201cCome away now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he will wake up. He has to.\u201d My throat went tight as I considered the now very real possibility that I had been wrong about my parents, the pendant, everything. \u201cI worked it out, I know I did.\u201d Was there some sort of spell I was supposed to cast? Surely not. I\u2019d break it the moment the words left my lips.</p><p>\u201cMy fault she got over here, sir.\u201d The beater joined Doyle and glared at me. \u201cTold me you sent her.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the sky. \u201cLucien? I\u2019ve made a mess of this. I need you to tell me what to do. How do I fix this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharm.\u201d Tommy grabbed me by the arms and shook me until my teeth chattered. \u201cStop it. You can\u2019t do anything more for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d The moment he stopped I shoved him away. \u201cYou swore you wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTommy Doyle calls me Kit, Harry.\u201d I pushed him a second time as I advanced on him. \u201cOnly you call me Charm. Tell me how to bring Lucien back. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Aramanthan, and neither is he. There is no coming back for mortals.\u201d</p><p>He dodged my quick fist, teetered on the edge of the pier, and dropped into the water with a huge splash.</p><p>I leaned over to see that he bobbed to the surface, and ducked the white mist that rose from the water before I tossed a rope down to a very confused-looking Doyle. \u201cGrab hold of this, Inspector.\u201d</p><p>The beater came after me, his trunch held ready to pound my head in, but the white mist descended between us and reformed into Harry. That was enough for the beater, who spun round smartly and ran the other way, shouting for help.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t defy fate, gel.\u201d Harry blocked my path back to Dredmore. \u201cKilling him is what you were meant to do. What you were born to do. Even he knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he say I had to release him?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cDeath is his release.\u201d Something like pity glimmered in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll find another chap someday, Charm. One who will treat you as you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Since he was of no use to me, I forced myself to think. Mr. Jasper had said shattering the dreamstone dispelled its power . . . \u201cWhat if I break the stone? Will that free him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nightstone, my dear,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But I was a spell-breaker, and the stone was spelled, and suddenly Harry wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, old man.\u201d</p><p>I knelt down and pulled the pendant from Dredmore\u2019s neck. The only hard object I had was my father\u2019s pocket watch, and once I wedged the stone against the dock boards I pulled it out.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Harry sounded genuinely frightened and swiped at me, but his hand passed through my arm. \u201cCharm, if you smash it you\u2019ll be torn to pieces\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go and be with him.\u201d I brought down the pocket watch as hard as I could, smashing it into the stone. The watch\u2019s crystal shattered, and a piece banged into my chin, cutting me.</p><p>Harry let out a long breath. \u201cThank the Gods.\u201d</p><p>Blood dripped from my face onto the nightstone as I lifted the ruined watch a second time. \u201cGoddamn you, Lucien, come out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharm.\u201d</p><p>The second time I hit the nightstone I felt it crack. Purple-black light poured across my face, freezing my skin and blinding me. I fell back, feeling as if the dock had begun spinning like a top, and rubbed at my eyes until they cleared.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most stubborn, idiotic, mule-headed mortal female it has ever been my misfortune to know,\u201d I heard Harry say as the sky blurred and the Talian ship began to turn transparent.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Wait.\u201d I looked over at Dredmore\u2019s body, but it and the tarp were gone. \u201cHarry? Where is Lucien? What have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade your father happy at last, I expect.\u201d He sat down beside me, as solid as I was, and put an arm round my shoulders. \u201cClose your eyes now or you\u2019ll get very dizzy.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even blink; the world had gone mad. Night turned to day as the sun rose in the west and climbed backward through the sky. The tide rushed in and out. Great clouds of black smoke funneled down into the city, dwindling to thin streams before disappearing altogether. Cargo handlers working faster than could be followed dragged crates out to load them on ships that raised anchors and sails and moved against the wind out to sea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d I thought my eyes might pop out of their sockets. \u201cEverything is going in reverse.\u201d I raised a hand to cover my gaping mouth, only to see it growing as transparent as Harry. \u201cAm I dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear. You\u2019ve worked the only magic you can. Your father\u2019s science.\u201d My grandfather made a rude sound. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a pocket watch. It was another of his blasted mechs.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the ruins of the watch. \u201cWhat did it do before I smashed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now; you\u2019ve bonded his mech and her magic with your blood, and the watch\u2019s power has been released.\u201d His voice grew distant. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve turned time on its head, Charm.\u201d</p><p>I tried to stand, but my legs wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cWhen will it stop?\u201d</p><p>He was only a faint outline in the air now. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve returned to the beginning of it all, of course. Assuming you survive the journey.\u201d</p><p>Harry vanished, and then, so did I.</p><p>\u201cCharmian.\u201d</p><p>I floated through the darkness, seeking the voice calling my name. Only after some time did I realize it came from inside me, and was enough like my own for me to believe I\u2019d spoken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until it came again, and scolded me. \u201cI did not raise you to be ignorant, or a coward, and you have conducted yourself as a clever and resourceful woman. Since we were parted, you have made me and your father very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head and searched for a Harry-like presence, but no spirit appeared. \u201cMum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trifle with the passages between worlds as my father does,\u201d my mother said. \u201cI am quite content here. Or I was, until this moment.\u201d</p> <p>It had to be my mother; no one else could make me feel such guilt. \u201cBut you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is the death of the body, which comes to every person in the mortal world,\u201d my mother said primly. \u201cIt cannot be stopped or avoided; it must be accepted as inevitable. But that which animates us, that which is the essence of us; that never truly dies.\u201d A comforting warmth welled up inside me, as if I were being hugged all over. \u201cThis is not your time to leave this world, my dear. Or his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s dead, too.\u201d I should know, I\u2019d murdered him. \u201cMum, I don\u2019t think I can go on without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to now, Charmian.\u201d Something tugged at me, pushing me through the darkness. \u201cYou must return now, and put things to rights. When you wake, you will know what is to be done.\u201d</p><p>I felt the warmth receding. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Mum.\u201d</p> <p>In my mind she whispered, We\u2019ll be reunited someday, my darling. When it\u2019s your time, your father and I will be waiting for you.</p><p>As my eyes cleared so did the darkness, and I found myself looking across my desk at Lady Diana Walsh.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cAre you unwell, Miss Kittredge?\u201d Lady Diana asked, taking a lacy handkerchief from her reticule and touching it to the dark circles under her pretty eyes. \u201cIs that why you refuse to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick, milady.\u201d The burning sensation in my stomach had vanished. So had all my aches and pains and the soot blackening my skin. My mind began to reel as I glanced down at the little calendar I kept on my desk and saw the date. The date that was a fortnight past. The day I\u2019d met Lady Diana Walsh for the first time.</p><p>Time. Harry had said something about it. It took a moment before I remembered what it was.</p> <p>You\u2019ve turned time on its head.</p><p>\u201cThe attacks on your person are not the result of a spell, nor are the words cut into your flesh actual wounds,\u201d I told Lady Diana. \u201cYou are the victim of cruelty and contempt, not magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you\u2014?\u201d She stopped and rose to her feet. \u201cI should have known better than to come here. Good day, Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProof. Of course, you\u2019ll want that before you believe me.\u201d I took a flask from my drawer, went round the desk, seized one of her wrists, and pulled off the glove. \u201cHere, hold still.\u201d As I poured the brandy over her hand she uttered a shrill sound that I ignored as I picked at the edge of the letter S in SLUT, lifting the dried wound paste just enough to peel it off. \u201cYou see? Just as I said. The brandy acts as a solvent, but don\u2019t yank at it too hard, or it will still tear your skin.\u201d</p><p>Lady Walsh stopped protesting and stared. \u201cHow in the world . . . ?\u201d She went to work and in a few seconds had carefully peeled all the paste off her unmarked flesh. Her wide eyes shifted to my face. \u201cYou knew how this was done to me? Without ever meeting me? Who\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid this time I do have an urgent appointment across town,\u201d I told her as I reached for my walking cloak. \u201cPerhaps we could meet later, at your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not invited to my home. Nor can you tell me such things and then walk out.\u201d Her voice grew shrill. \u201cI must know who did this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few hours, you will. Or we\u2019ll all be dead. I\u2019m not quite sure how it will go.\u201d Once I fastened my cloak I grabbed my keylace from the wall hook. \u201cOh, and you should know that the only reason your husband married you was to get another heir. Your stepson is diseased and barren. Good day, milady.\u201d</p> <p>I ran past her footman for the stairs, praying that my assumptions about my own circumstances were just as correct. Puzzling that out made me forget about Fourth, who intercepted me on the stairs halfway to the first floor landing.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Gremley.\u201d Hoping to squeeze past him I moved to one side, but he did the same. \u201cI do beg your pardon, but I\u2019m in something of a hurry.\u201d</p><p>The clerk bent from the waist in one of his overdone bows. \u201cMiss Kittredge, I\u2019d hoped to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014run into me today,\u201d I finished for him. \u201cI regret to say that I cannot be your escort to the opening of the opera on Thursday next, excuse me, Friday next, as I will be away on business. Mr. Skolnik\u2019s unmarried daughter, Maritza, will make a fine substitute. She speaks no English, so your dear mother will be unable to grill her.\u201d</p><p>By this point Fourth\u2019s nonexistent chin had dropped to his reedy chest. \u201cMiss Kittredge, you have anticipated my every thought. How in heaven\u2019s name\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s magic. I was wrong. It does exist.\u201d I patted his shoulder. \u201cMust fly. Do enjoy the opera.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to stop me as I darted round him and made it to the basement access door on the first-floor landing.</p><p>\u201cDocket.\u201d My voice couldn\u2019t be heard above the clanking and hammering, but as soon as I spotted the bottom half of him sticking out from a familiar cabinet I didn\u2019t bother to shout again. I did rap my knuckles on the side of the HangItAll to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is it now?\u201d Docket emerged, his face shiny with sweat and patches of black grease. \u201cOh, Kit, fabulous. I\u2019m just putting the finishing touches on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014the HangItAll. Problem is that the boiler steam will soak all the garments you put in it, so best you call it the WashItAll.\u201d I paused to catch my breath. \u201cDocket, I need to borrow your carri for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWashItAll. That might work.\u201d As he looked at me, his grin turned upside down. \u201cSorry, my dear, but the carri\u2019s done for. Took it apart last week to repair the boiler.\u201d He squinted at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You look white as a wedding frock.\u201d</p><p>Without a carri I\u2019d never get there. \u201cI have to go.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019d stolen one. I hurried outside and looked down both sides of the street. No carris in sight, and the trolley wouldn\u2019t reach the corner stop for half an hour. I felt so desperate I even thought of the tubes, but even if I could survive the pressure of being shot through one, I\u2019d never fit inside.</p><p>I sat down on the curb to prop my head against my fists. I would not wail or weep or otherwise make a fool of myself. I would think of a way.</p><p>The clop of hooves came toward me, growing slower until they stopped. I raised my head to see a big black horse looming over me. He had been bridled but not saddled, and his sides were sweaty, as if he\u2019d been on a long run.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, what are you doing here?\u201d The horse dropped his head to nudge my shoulder, and I automatically caught his reins. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here. You weren\u2019t here that day. This day. We haven\u2019t met.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and tugged, pulling me to my feet. I had to hike up my skirts to mount him, which bared my legs almost to the knee as I rode down the street. Decent men stared, decent women turned away, but a few clerks and cartlasses laughed and waved me on.</p><p>I guided George across the city, out to the farmlands, and down the long road to my destination. The black iron gates were closed, of course, but George leapt over them, as quick and nimble as a hare.</p><p>I reined him into a respectable trot\u2014dashing up to the great ugly place would only alarm the hooligans guarding it\u2014but took him straight to the front of the house. Connell appeared before I could dismount, but as soon as he saw my face he turned and hurried back into the main house.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re here, George,\u201d I said as I dropped to my feet. \u201cOne of us has to go in there.\u201d</p><p>The big black horse eyed me before he turned and trotted off toward the stables.</p><p>\u201cCoward.\u201d I shook out my skirts and took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as I walked up to use the knocker. But the door was already opening, the man inside stepping out.</p><p>\u201cCharmian.\u201d Lucien Dredmore, resplendent in his usual silver and onyx, surveyed me from toe to crown and back again. \u201cAm I to understand my man correctly? You\u2019ve stolen one of my horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d He was alive. \u201cI am returning it.\u201d He was himself again. \u201cIt ran away and came to my building in the city and I have to sit down now.\u201d I was going to cast up my accounts, all over his boots.</p><p>The marble step felt so cold it was like perching on a block of ice. That was why I was shaking so badly. I felt a strong hand at the back of my head, an arm under my knees, and then he was lifting and carrying me through his dark dungeon of a house to a softer spot, a chaise lounge by a sunlit window. I heard him call for brandy, and then he was putting the rim of a glass to my lips.</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d When I didn\u2019t, he took hold of the end of my nose and pinched it shut.</p><p>I drank, and coughed, and felt the fire in my throat spread through my insides as it settled to an agreeable warmth.</p><p>He made me take another swallow and then he watched me until the shaking stopped. \u201cShould I call for the smelling salts, Charmian, or is that the end of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in shock before now. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are apologizing. To me.\u201d He put his hand to my brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve no fever. Were you thrown from my horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge would never unseat me,\u201d I said, and took a deep breath. \u201cThis morning I was tossed back through time. I\u2019m here because of that. Because I\u2019ve seen the future, and I need your help to change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have hit your head on something.\u201d Lucien glanced over at Connell. \u201cSend for the physick at once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait, please.\u201d I considered what to tell him. I\u2019d killed the man, or rather his body; he deserved to know at least that much. But he had no memory of the wonderful or terrible things that had happened to us\u2014or hadn\u2019t yet done them, now that I\u2019d thrown us all back in time\u2014so he would think me terribly addled, or even perhaps gone mad.</p><p>Unless I offered him evidence to the contrary. \u201cNo one knows about your life before you came to Toriana, do they? You\u2019ve never confided it to anyone. Certainly not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about now, Charmian?\u201d he asked, his voice going soft and lethal.</p> <p>\u201cYou were five when your parents sent you away to school. They didn\u2019t tell you that you would be kept there, that you wouldn\u2019t go home for holiday like the other boys.\u201d I looked round at his things. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had the best that could be provided. They paid for you to have a private room, the finest tutors, the most expensive garments. But there were no letters, Dredmore. No birthday cards. No visits. Nothing. They wouldn\u2019t even permit your nanny or valet to write to you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes took on a dangerous glitter. \u201cWho told you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, or more precisely, you will.\u201d And I proceeded to tell him the rest. I spared him no detail, and when I named the exact sum his mother had offered him to leave England forever, he turned his head and stared into the fireplace.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t anger or wounded pride. He was ashamed of what they had done to him. Perhaps because they had felt no shame in doing it.</p><p>Once I had finished, I picked up the glass of brandy I disliked so intensely and took a large swallow. After another round of coughing, I handed the remainder to him. \u201cIn fourteen days there will be an invasion of Rumsen. Talian Reapers will come here with an army, led by the agents of an Aramanthan warlord called Zarath. They plan to use the dreamstone they\u2019ve hidden all over the city inside phony wardlings to turn our people into puppets.\u201d</p> <p>He drained the rest of the brandy. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out about my boyhood, but dreamstone and time travel are myths. The Tillers would never permit the Reapers to set foot on Toriana soil.\u201d He regarded me carefully. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been trifling with poppy dust, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Reapers have already infiltrated the Tillers,\u201d I assured him. \u201cThey\u2019re controlling Lord Walsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Walsh, the banker?\u201d When I nodded, he made a dismissive gesture. \u201cThe man is nothing but a pompous ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one, does it?\u201d I asked sweetly. Before he could reply, I added, \u201cIn a little over a week, that pompous ass will capture you and me at Feathersound. Yes, I know you own it. To save my life, you\u2019ll swallow a spirit stone, Walsh will kill himself, and your body will be possessed by Zarath. The warlord needs your mind power to remove the final obstacles and set off the dreamstones.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve never in your life believed in magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat reminds me.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYour current suspicions about me are correct. I am a spell-breaker, Lucien. That\u2019s why your magic has no effect on me.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to tell him that his spiritborn gift of enchantment worked extremely well; that little detail could remain between me and the future Dredmore.</p> <p>He came to me and jerked me to my feet. \u201cIf what you say isn\u2019t some bizarre fancy you\u2019ve dreamed up to confound me, and by some impossibly wild chance you have returned from the future, then why didn\u2019t you stop the Reapers while you were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I rested my hand against his chest. \u201cJust before Zarath cast his spell over the city, I drove an iron spike through his heart and killed him.\u201d I looked up at him and let him see everything I felt. \u201cWhich was, coincidentally, your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBefore you surrendered your body to Zarath, you made me promise that I would. I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as I expected. Really a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>His hands fell away. \u201cNow I do believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d I turned my head. \u201cBring the carriage round, Connell.\u201d I saw the surprise on the servant\u2019s face before I said, \u201cYour master and I are going to call on Lord and Lady Walsh.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore said very little as we rode to the Hill. I pulled up the shade so I could see the mansions glittering in the sunlight once again. While I would never care for the ton\u2019s lofty community, seeing it burnt to the ground had not been an improvement.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to expose Walsh in front of his family?\u201d Dredmore asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d As the carriage stopped, I reached up and felt for my pendant. \u201cWe will speak to him privately.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIf he is under Reaper control, he will deny every charge, and then use his influence to destroy my credibility and your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d I reached out and patted the back of his hand. When he seized my wrist, I didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived. Don\u2019t change your mind now.\u201d</p><p>He held on to me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me everything about the future, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, and spoil the surprise?\u201d I smiled as Connell opened the door. \u201cWhere would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>The Walshes\u2019 forbidding old butler came directly to answer the door, doubtless astonished by the prospect of anyone calling at such an unseemly, early hour.</p><p>\u201cLord Dredmore and Miss Kittredge to see Lord Walsh,\u201d I told the old winge before he could open his mouth. \u201cOn quite urgent business.\u201d</p><p>The butler reared back, the skin surrounding his nose drawing up as he ignored me and addressed Dredmore. \u201cThe master is not receiving, milord.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore brushed past him. \u201cHe will see me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terribly private family matter,\u201d I told the outraged butler as I followed suit. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for him in his study.\u201d</p><p>It took Lord Walsh less than three minutes to stalk into the room and slam the doors behind him. There was egg yolk on his chin and he still wore his morning jacket and what looked like fur-lined bed slippers. \u201cLucien. Good God, man, what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife came to see me this morning, Lord Walsh.\u201d I waited for him to lower himself to notice me. \u201cShe believes your deceased first wife has cast a spell on her. But as it turns out, you\u2019re the one who has been bespelled.\u201d</p><p>The first tinge of purple bloomed in his florid cheeks. \u201cHow dare you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith very little trepidation, actually.\u201d I closed the distance between us and lifted my skirts. \u201cBut I do apologize in advance for my actions.\u201d</p><p>I kicked him in the groin with as much force as I could muster, and stepped back as he shrieked and dropped to the carpet. He didn\u2019t vomit, however, which annoyed me. \u201cI see you\u2019re going to be difficult. Lucien, please hold his head for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore came up from behind and clapped his hands over Walsh\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I grabbed the man\u2019s chin and inserted two of my fingers into his mouth, pushing them back as far as I could until he gagged. \u201cWatch your boots.\u201d I sidestepped the spew of Walsh\u2019s breakfast, waiting until he coughed out a gleaming red stone. Using a kerchief to pick it up, I wrapped it carefully before passing it to Dredmore. \u201cDon\u2019t swallow this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no desire to.\u201d He pocketed the bundle.</p><p>Lord Walsh finished vomiting shortly thereafter and, once Lucien had helped him to his feet, began to make his own apologies. \u201cI say. Terribly sorry. Must have eaten something that was . . .\u201d He trailed off as he looked at both of us with visible bewilderment. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad? What the devil?\u201d A bleary-eyed Montrose burst into the room, tottering a little as he rushed to his father\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cYou can come in, too, Miss Walsh,\u201d I told the woman hovering outside the door. \u201cThis concerns you as well.\u201d</p><p>The timid Miranda tiptoed in, her hands worrying at the edges of her lace fichu while she surveyed the messy scene. \u201cIt seems my father is ill,\u201d she said, her voice wavering. \u201cYou should perhaps leave so that we might attend to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Lord Walsh anymore,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI helped him get the spirit stone you shoved down his throat out of his belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will suffer some gaps in his memory,\u201d Dredmore added, \u201cbut they should not be permanent.\u201d</p><p>As Miranda shrank back, I eyed the mess on the floor. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably want to have the carpet cleaned right away. When egg yolk dries it\u2019s as hard to comb out as plaster on cashmere.\u201d Dredmore got to the door before Miranda and closed it. \u201cThank you, Lucien.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the door. \u201cMy pleasure, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>Miranda skittered away from him, going to stand behind a wingbacked chair. \u201cMonty, call for the nobbers. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDredmore is a deathmage, Monty. I wouldn\u2019t twitch an eyelash.\u201d I went to Miranda, and dragged her over to face the still-wheezing Nolan Walsh. \u201cIt\u2019s time to tell your father exactly what you and your husband have been up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband is dead,\u201d she protested, at the same moment Lord Walsh said, \u201cMy daughter is a widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, her husband is still alive and hiding somewhere in the city,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe\u2019s probably too young to be a Lost Timer, but I expect his Talian father was.\u201d</p><p>Miranda gaped at me. \u201cMy dear Lestin died in battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband faked his death to get out of the militia, come to Toriana, and\u2014with your help\u2014begin the groundwork for the Reaper invasion.\u201d I nodded at Nolan Walsh. \u201cWhile he didn\u2019t have any powers for Zarath to use, I imagine your father\u2019s wealth, power, and influence proved quite useful, once the Aramanthan took control of his mind and body.\u201d</p><p>Lord Walsh looked horrified. \u201cMiranda, what have you done?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A transformation not unlike that of an Aramanthan possession came over Walsh\u2019s shy daughter. \u201cYou think money can buy anything, Father? We live every day under Her Majesty\u2019s grinding boot heel. The Reapers are coming to save us. They will muster our forces, crush the Empire, and end the occupation. Toriana will finally be free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what they told you?\u201d Dredmore sounded scathing. \u201cThe Reapers have no motive to fight for our liberation. Their sole interest in Toriana is to occupy it, and use its citizens and resources to ignite another mage war. Had your plan been successful, Miss Walsh, they would have burned their way across our country, and installed their own tyrants as our rulers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll Torians would have been bespelled and turned into mindless, thoughtless slaves,\u201d I put in. \u201cRather like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know nothing about our plans.\u201d She struggled viciously against my hold. \u201cYou think you can stop them? It\u2019s too late. The ships are almost here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still a fortnight from shore,\u201d I corrected her. \u201cBy the time they arrive I expect the coastal fleet will be waiting to greet them.\u201d I glanced at Dredmore. \u201cYou can arrange a proper reception, can\u2019t you, milord?\u201d</p><p>His upper lip curled. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Miranda screamed something wholly unladylike as she hooked her fingers into claws and lunged for my eyes.</p><p>I put an end to that nonsense by slapping her. \u201cYou might have pulled it off, had you left your stepmother alone. But you hated her for taking your mother\u2019s place, and you feared she might discover that Lord Walsh had been possessed. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if she had, you know.\u201d I looked up to see Lady Diana standing in the doorway. \u201cNo one would have believed her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy father should never have married that sniveling bitch.\u201d Hatred contorted Miranda\u2019s half-red face. \u201cAlways pretending to be so kind and sweet and loving. All she was interested in was his fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family was.\u201d Lady Diana joined us. \u201cI married so I wouldn\u2019t end an old maid.\u201d She looked at her husband. \u201cNolan, I expect you have business to attend to in town. If you would send for our physick before you leave, I would greatly appreciate it. Montrose, please escort your sister to her room and sit with her until the whitecart arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put me in hospital,\u201d Miranda shouted.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Diana soothed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely little place called Havenwood, not far from my father\u2019s country estate near Settle. Some of the best families in Rumsen have sent their troubled relations there to recuperate.\u201d</p><p>Miranda grabbed her brother\u2019s jacket. \u201cMonty, you have to help me. Please. They\u2019re going to ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it upstairs.\u201d Montrose guided her out of the room.</p> <p>Lord Walsh gave Dredmore a desperate look. \u201cMy lord, if you would be so kind as to accompany me, and provide some explanation to our mutual friends and associates . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure. Lady Walsh.\u201d Lucien inclined his head that way, and then came to me. \u201cMiss Kittredge.\u201d He raised my hand to his lips and kissed it like a perfect gentleman. Then he nipped one of my knuckles. \u201cI will be calling on you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me down at the docks instead,\u201d I murmured back.</p><p>Once the men left the room, Lady Diana rang for the housekeeper, who summoned maids to remove the carpet and apply citrus oil to the floor to remove any lingering stains and odors. The butler himself delivered a tea cart generously piled with a beautiful cream tea.</p><p>\u201cWith Lord Walsh\u2019s compliments, Miss Kittredge.\u201d He bowed to me as if I were royalty before he addressed Diana. \u201cMilady, when the physick arrives, do you wish to speak with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Diana said. \u201cInform Dr. Elgis that he is to remove Miss Miranda and have her immediately and securely transported to Havenwood for whatever treatment she requires. You might mention that Lord Walsh expects her stay to be of some duration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, milady.\u201d The butler bowed his way out of the study.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the husband in hiding?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cLestin?\u201d Diana picked up the teapot. \u201cWithout Miranda to supply him with his needs, I expect he will show his face here quite soon. We have footmen to deal with that. Sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Such an unusual name, Lestin.\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cAn abbreviated form of Celestino, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it is.\u201d She filled two cups and handed one to me. \u201cYou might have warned me of your intentions this morning, Miss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>I took a sip. \u201cIt is possible I could have convinced you that Miranda was responsible for the attacks on your person,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut the fact that she arranged for her father to be possessed to assist in an invasion of the city?\u201d I set down my cup. \u201cThat you had to hear from her own lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you are right.\u201d She left her own tea untouched. \u201cLord Walsh and I are exceedingly grateful for the discreet manner in which you have acted on our behalf.\u201d</p><p>I gave her the answer to the question she wasn\u2019t asking. \u201cI\u2019ve worked before for other families on the Hill, milady. I know how things are done here.\u201d When she reached for her reticule, I shook my head. \u201cThis morning I refused to provide you with my services, so no payment is necessary.\u201d</p><p>The tight lines round the corners of her mouth smoothed away. \u201cIs there nothing I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times my work requires me to make inquiries. I am always discreet, of course, but as an ordinary cit I am denied access to certain circles.\u201d I sipped my tea before I added, \u201cUnder such circumstances, I would be most appreciative if I could rely upon your counsel and assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere he to discover such an arrangement, my husband would absolutely forbid it.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI will have to see to it that he never does. Would you care for a crumpet?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Lady Diana did not provide me with her carriage when I left her home\u2014that would have overstepped the limits of ton gratitude\u2014but she instructed the butler to summon a cab and have it take me wherever I wished.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, miss?\u201d the driver asked as he helped me inside.</p><p>Somewhere in the city Dredmore and Walsh were no doubt astonishing the Tillers with news of the Reapers\u2019 planned invasion. Even if I could find the secret meeting place of the spiritborn, as a female I would likely not be permitted entrance.</p><p>Not that I cared to be privy to Tiller secrets. I had my own to sort out.</p><p>\u201cDrive to the docks,\u201d I told the man. \u201cBut don\u2019t rush. I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>He touched his cap before he closed the door.</p><p>As the cab headed down from the Hill, I reached up and curled my fingers over my pendant. I felt the movement of the gears inside, assuring me that it still functioned as my parents had intended. The chain snapped as I jerked it from my neck and tossed it onto the back-facing seat.</p><p>My grandfather appeared in the next instant, his white hair neatly slicked back, his old-fashioned suit exquisitely pressed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, lass. In fact, if you\u2019ll give a moment to explain, I may be of some considerable assistance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave the speech, Harry,\u201d I said, cutting him off. \u201cTraveling back through time didn\u2019t rob me of my memories.\u201d</p><p>He hid his dismay by becoming chatty. \u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve time enough to stop the invasion. You should start with Walsh and his daughter, but steer clear of that wretched Dredmore. Perhaps that Inspector Doyle fellow can be recruited to assist you. He seems a clearheaded chap. Why are you scowling like that? I like Arthur\u2019s boy. Young Thomas has great potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know very well that I\u2019ve already been to see Nolan Walsh, and that Miranda has dealt with. You were there with me, old man.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cAs you\u2019ve been with me every day and night since I was a little gel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He sat back and folded his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve watched over you. You\u2019re my granddaughter, Charm. No crime in that, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me again, Harry,\u201d I said with great patience. \u201cYou never had a choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think, Charm.\u201d He lifted the edge of the window shade and pretended to admire the scenery. \u201cI say, are we near that fruit market? I smell peaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHedger gave it away when he called my pendant \u2018a ginny bauble,\u2019 \u201d I said. \u201cCertainly there are ladies among the ton who wear tiny flasks fashioned to look like bracelets and watches and pendants, and I presumed he mistook it for something like those. But I misheard him. It\u2019s his accent; it\u2019s almost as bad as Wrecker\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just now realized, I\u2019ve never seen your office.\u201d Harry gave me an inveigling look. \u201cWe should take a ride over that way. I\u2019ve time enough for a tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHedger didn\u2019t say ginny bauble, did he?\u201d I waited, but my grandfather only stared at the floor of the carriage. \u201cHe said genie bottle.\u201d</p><p>Harry made a halfhearted attempt to continue the ruse. \u201cDon\u2019t be foolish, gel. There is no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents did make the pendant to contain a spirit, but it wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d I watched his face. \u201cThey used it to capture and imprison the spirit of the Aramanthan they feared most. They used it on you, Harry.\u201d</p><p>My grandfather opened his mouth, closed it, and hung his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you knew everything that has happened to me,\u201d I continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging about my neck all this time, unable to escape the nightstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did try, quite often, those first ten years.\u201d He sat back. \u201cI might have overcome your mother\u2019s magic, or your father\u2019s science, but the two together were beyond me. And then there was you and your devilish gift.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEvery time you tried to cast a spell to release yourself, my power broke it.\u201d I moved over and sat beside him. \u201cWhy, Harry? Why would Mum and Da do such a terrible thing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to blame for it, not them.\u201d He shriveled down against the seat. \u201cIt was when I came to live in Toriana. I fear I was a little too eager to see Rachel. I hadn\u2019t, you know, not since she was an infant. Without thinking I called on her, and, well, she took the news that I was her father, an Aramanthan, and a spy for the Crown rather poorly.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDid she reject you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told me to get out and never darken their doorstep again.\u201d He made a face. \u201cThen, when I wouldn\u2019t leave, your father tried to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made several more attempts to speak to your mother. I even sent her the nightstone pendant as proof of my affection, but she still refused to see me.\u201d He rasped a hand over his cheek. \u201cI couldn\u2019t accept the idea that my own daughter would reject me, Charm. I didn\u2019t consider how much a stranger I was to her. And then there was you, my only grandchild.\u201d Harry spread his hands. \u201cSince Rachel wanted nothing to do with me, I began visiting you in your nursery at night. I hardly thought it would upset anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Mum caught you at it,\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cIt terrified her to see me there, standing by your little bed,\u201d he admitted. \u201cShe ordered me from the house and forbid me from having any more contact with her or you. I\u2019m afraid by then I\u2019d grown very fond of you, and I lost my temper with her. I told Rachel that if I wished to see you that I would, any time I wished, and there was nothing she or your father could do to stop me.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a moment. \u201cOh, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher, your father, already hated me because I couldn\u2019t be explained by his science. When Rachel went to him and repeated my threats . . .\u201d He made a helpless gesture. \u201cI\u2019d say that was when they decided to do something about me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand how such a powerful being could be so foolish. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just leave us alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten your mother, so I intended to leave off, but I got into a spot of trouble while I was carrying out my duties for the Crown.\u201d He ran a finger across his neck. \u201cMy host body was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police came to our house that night to give Mum the news,\u201d I recalled. \u201cShe and Da left me with the maid so they could go to the morgue and identify you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was there in spirit, of course, waiting for nightfall so I could move on to another body. As soon as I saw Rachel come into the room with your father, I presumed she had forgiven me.\u201d He heaved a sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much they had meddled with the nightstone until the spell your mother cast dragged me into its confines. Once there, I discovered I had no means of communicating with you, Rachel, or anyone in the outside world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd they knew my power would keep you trapped in it.\u201d I felt more regret than anger now. \u201cThey made me your warden without ever telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought it the right thing to do, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he chided. \u201cRachel had learned a little about the Aramanthan from Arthur Doyle. She must have known that once my host body died I would need another.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo by putting you in the pendant, and having me keep you there all this time, they assured that you would never possess another mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey saw to it that I would never possess you, gel,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThat was your mother\u2019s greatest fear.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cDid you ever want to possess me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake on the body of a young, impulsive female with no money, no connections, and no prospects in a ridiculously primitive, utterly repressed society under empirical occupation?\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI\u2019d sooner inhabit a stray pup. At least I\u2019d eat better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind if I pop you back into the genie bottle?\u201d I asked sweetly as I reached for my pendant.</p><p>He looked hurt. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. Not after all we\u2019ve been through these past two weeks. That haven\u2019t happened yet.\u201d He made a disgusted sound. \u201cThis is why I hate time travel. Everything you say about time is wrong and right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I could be persuaded to allow you your freedom.\u201d I sat back and thought for a moment. \u201cI have three conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a genie,\u201d he reminded me. \u201cI can\u2019t grant you three wishes, turn you into a princess, or any of that nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can give me your word that you will not possess anyone permanently,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, not to worry.\u201d He waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve grown accustomed to living in spirit form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the ceiling of the cab as he pressed his hand over his heart. \u201cOn my honor, I promise not to possess any host body permanently.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cTemporary\u2019s more fun anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond,\u201d I continued, \u201cyou go into business with me as my partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness? Work?\u201d He recoiled. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have nothing better to do,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cIf you get bored, you can teach me everything you know about magic and mind powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never live long enough for that.\u201d He saw my face and sighed. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll be your business partner.\u201d He squinted at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the third condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me your name, Harry.\u201d As he started to reply, I raised a hand. \u201cYour true name, the one you were born to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not believe me.\u201d When I said nothing, he muttered something vile under his breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t used that for ages, Charm. Hundreds of ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen back in the pendant you go.\u201d I saw the panic in his eyes and added, \u201cIf you want me to trust you, Grandfather, then I deserve equal consideration. Tell me your name.\u201d</p><p>And so he did.</p><p>When the cab reached the docks I was alone again. To avoid being trapped again in the nightstone, Harry had to put some distance between us before I touched the pendant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never change, you know,\u201d he said before he left me. \u201cDredmore will always be a cold, selfish, dark-hearted bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I felt an odd quietude settle over me. \u201cI expect he will.\u201d</p><p>I was not surprised to find Lucien Dredmore standing in the exact same spot as I\u2019d left him in the future, at the very end of the pier. It was like George suddenly appearing outside my office building; as if time had rearranged a few things to fill some gaps no one could see.</p><p>I stopped beside him to look out at the cold, dark ocean. The wind brought with it a cutting edge, promising snow. \u201cDid you have any trouble dealing with the Tillers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. They know my reputation.\u201d He took the kerchief-wrapped stone out of his greatcoat and regarded it. \u201cI have some knowledge of the warlord Zarath, and how many armies he commanded during the Aramanthan wars. His power to control had almost no limits. He is one of the greatest mages of all time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d I took the kerchief from him and heaved it into the waves. It sank out of sight. \u201cNow he\u2019s just another rock sitting on the bottom of the bay.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cThat won\u2019t kill him, Charmian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s immortal,\u201d I said, nodding. \u201cNothing can. But no one else saw, so only you and I know he\u2019s there.\u201d I glanced up at his stern face. \u201cI\u2019ve no reason to dive in after a rock, and you can\u2019t swim. Isn\u2019t that nearly as good as dead?\u201d</p><p>A rusty sound came from his throat, and it took a moment before I recognized it as a chuckle. \u201cYes, I believe it is.\u201d He faced me. \u201cAre you ready to tell me about the future?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to enjoy this as much as chucking that Aramanthan jackass in the drink, I thought, wrapping my arms round my waist. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>He took off his greatcoat and draped it over my shoulders. \u201cWhy did I confide the most private details of my personal history to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d I tried not to breathe in the delicious scent he\u2019d left on the wool. \u201cYou weren\u2019t yourself at the time.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore pulled up the collar so it shielded my ears against the wind. \u201cWhat made you stop despising me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met him.\u201d I nodded toward the water. \u201cBy comparison, you are a saint.\u201d</p><p>Dredmore tipped up my chin with his hand so I had to look into his eyes. \u201cWhy did you save my life, Charmian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dead,\u201d I countered. \u201cDo you want me to promise not do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know\u201d\u2014he bent his head and touched his lips to mine\u2014\u201cwhy you\u2019re not slapping me, or threatening to push me off a cliff, stab me in the heart, or lock me in my carriage and set it alight. Why you looked so terrified when I came out of Morehaven this morning, and then in the next moment, so relieved. I want to know what changed things between us, Charmian, and how.\u201d</p><p>I had to tell him something, but the future that we\u2019d shared no longer existed. It didn\u2019t matter what we\u2019d done; all that mattered was what we would do now . . . and then I knew exactly what to say.</p><p>\u201cI had a dream, a few days from now,\u201d I lied. \u201cI was buying peaches at the market, and I stumbled over a curb and twisted my ankle. You helped me up and offered to take me home. After that we became great friends.\u201d I felt him go very still. \u201cThat never happened, of course, but when I woke from the dream, all I could think was how much I wished it had. That you and I had become friends instead of enemies.\u201d I smiled. \u201cIt was all downhill from there.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a long time, and then he nodded slowly. \u201cWe could try to be friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen as a friend I should tell you, that was a terrible lie,\u201d he added. \u201cSomeday I will make you tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my brows. \u201cIs that what friends do?\u201d I saw how he was staring at the spot in the water where I\u2019d thrown the stone. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Lucien. Forget about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could, but Zarath was not the only warlord among the Aramanthan.\u201d Dredmore\u2019s voice grew as icy as the breeze. \u201cThere are many more out there. They are waiting, and watching, and plotting their return to power.\u201d</p><p>Something rose up in me, something that almost felt like icy burning of the spirit stone Zarath had forced me to swallow. \u201cDo you expect me to burst into tears and clutch at you and wail about how powerless we are against them? Because we\u2019re not. I\u2019ve seen how we are, and we are . . . formidable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are mortal,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cOh, very well.\u201d I tossed up my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can cry, but if you like I could swoon. I\u2019m actually getting rather good at faking that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of what\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmong other things, milord, I am a spell-breaker, and a time traveler.\u201d I turned my gaze to the sea. \u201cLet them come.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cDisenchanted &amp; Co.,\u201d the sign painter read out loud from my office window. \u201cThat\u2019s a right strange name for this sort of business.\u201d</p><p>His young apprentice began mixing up some paint in a small can. \u201cSort of a pun, isn\u2019t it, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d I handed the painter the shilling we\u2019d agreed on for the job along with a slip of paper. \u201cThere\u2019s the name of my new partner. Make sure you mind the spelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, miss.\u201d He read the note. \u201cNow this one\u2019s mum must have known he\u2019d go into the magic trade.\u201d</p> <p>As he and his apprentice went to work, I retreated into my office to sort out the mail. On top of the pile I\u2019d taken from the tube lay a thin gray envelope sealed with silver wax that bore the impression of a spike-wielding fist.</p><p>I sat down behind my desk and used my letter dagger to slice off the seal and remove a single sheet of thin silver vellum folded in thirds.</p><p>The paper exuded a faint scent of ripe peaches, which made me smile a little. Who would have guessed the most powerful deathmage in all of Toriana had such an infatuation with fruit?</p><p>Charmian,</p><p>Come to dinner tonight and you may have some.</p><p>Dredmore</p><p>P.S. Please.</p><p>Two of my former clients had sent referrals, one for a haunted carri, and the other to remove some wardlings that had become wedged in a door frame. Rumsen Main must have missed those; upon learning from an anonymous source that nearly all of the talismans in the city were counterfeits containing a very dangerous raw stone, the cops had been very busy confiscating and smashing them.</p> <p>I penned a message to the desk sergeant at Rumsen Main, attached the referral to it, and got up to send it by tube, only to stop as the sign painter\u2019s apprentice opened the door.</p><p>\u201cGent to see you, miss.\u201d He stepped aside as the gent strode in.</p><p>Fair-haired and average-sized, Thomas Doyle wore his plainclothesman\u2019s long trench and low-brim. Past his shoulder I saw a beater in dark blue hovering in the hallway.</p><p>The inspector doffed his hat, revealing the tough, wind-weathered features and sun-faded blue eyes of a former navyman. \u201cForgive the intrusion, madam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s miss, To\u2014ah, sir.\u201d Barely remembering that to him this would be our first meeting, I sat down behind my desk. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspector Thomas Doyle, Rumsen Station. I\u2019m here to speak to Mr. Kittredge,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf he\u2019s stepped out, I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wait for a very long time, then, as there is no Mr. Kittredge. I am the proprietor.\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cMiss Kittredge.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a firm but gentle handshake as he inspected my features. \u201cSurely not Charmian Kittredge of Middleway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d I pretended to study him back. \u201cWould you be related to the Middleway Doyles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I believe we played together as children, at my grandfather Arthur\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI believe we did.\u201d</p><p>He paid closer attention to my face. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in years, not since you were a gel, but still you look . . . familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed all that much. Mostly taller.\u201d I folded my hands in front of me. \u201cNow how can I help the Yard, Inspector?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe received a report of some fake wardlings needing collection, but my men are having some trouble removing them. Our staff warder, Mary Harris, recommended Kittredge of Disenchanted &amp; Co.\u201d He glanced over at the door. \u201cBut I see you\u2019ve a partner now as well.\u201d</p><p>I smiled a little. \u201cYes, he\u2019s just joined the firm. Unfortunately he works nights, so you\u2019ll have to settle for me, if that\u2019s acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He seemed a little embarrassed. \u201cWe\u2019d appreciate any help you can give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get my cloak and keys.\u201d I stood up and went to the rack.</p><p>On our way out, I inspected the sign painter\u2019s progress:</p><p>HARRY MERLI</p><p>\u201cVery nice lettering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have it done before you get back, miss.\u201d He nodded toward the glass. \u201cThen you and Mr. Merlin will be in business.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
