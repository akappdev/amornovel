They silence as she enters and their full attention becomes fixed upon the only human in the room\u2013the blood jewel\u2013as she is led to her seat. It looks much like a royal throne for a king or queen so it gives the illusion that she\u2019s treated with high regard. But I know better.</p> <p>I\u2019m unable to see her face from where I\u2019m standing in the crowd but I have a unobstructed view of the pale skin exposed at the top of her strapless blood red ball gown. Her severe pallor is evidence that Vincent has shown no mercy in draining her for tonight\u2019s blood jewel ceremony and I\u2019m sickened. I think of what that must have been like for her and I want to inflict a long and painful death upon her captor. It would give me great pleasure to watch him scorch during a slow sunrise before meeting his final death.</p><p>I\u2019m enjoying the scene playing out in my head as the bastard lifts his vial and instructs the entire room of vampires to ingest the substance that will transform them into his minions. They are killers\u2013just as I once was\u2013but none of them deserve to have this addiction unknowingly forced upon them. \u201cNow, let us all partake of the precious blood jewel together.\u201d</p><p>I lift the vial to my lips as part of the deception and I\u2019m unable to stop myself from sniffing the blood contained inside before I pretend to consume it. I\u2019m surprised to discover it doesn\u2019t have an essence at all. I\u2019ve never known human blood to lack scent. I suppose it\u2019s a characteristic specific to only a blood jewel so she isn\u2019t so easily revealed among the vampire population. Perhaps it\u2019s a trait given by Anteros to enable her a better chance at survival.</p><p>A fledgling walks through collecting the empty vials on a silver platter\u2013a show of how no expense was spared\u2013and I\u2019m relieved when I\u2019m able to rid myself of the evidence of my deception. I hear the voices around me murmuring about the exceptional taste of Avery\u2019s blood and I begin to worry that this large group of vampires might break into a frenzy to get to Jenn\u2019s sister. There will be nothing Curry or I can do if that happens.</p><p>I listen for the sound of her mundane heart and I\u2019m surprised when I realize it isn\u2019t pounding as one would expect. How strange. It\u2019s calm for a human sitting before one hundred vampires that just consumed her addicting blood. At the very least I would expect a fast, thready beat due to her recent loss of blood volume. But it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s another Anteros given mode of survival.</p> <p>The crowd in front of me shifts and I dart from side to side until I\u2019m able to get a look at Avery Ferrand for the first time. She\u2019s staring blankly into the crowd but turns her head\u2013almost as if I called her name\u2013and makes eye contact with me. I want to look away. But I can\u2019t. She is the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Her heart speeds as our eyes remain locked. I can\u2019t bring myself to blink because I\u2019m too mesmerized by her beauty but then I realize that whatever I\u2019m feeling toward her must be part of the blood jewel attraction. I didn\u2019t consume her blood so what little is left of it must be calling out to me like a siren summoning her victim to his doom.</p><p>I feel a harsh jab into my side so I fight the urge to continue staring at the beauty in front of me. I\u2019m barely a victor over the strange desire I feel but I manage to turn to Curry. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur host is calling you so why don\u2019t you go see what he wants.\u201d Curry\u2019s words are slow and deliberate as he gives me a look I can only interpret as a warning to be careful.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, sure.\u201d My words stumble. I\u2019m embarrassed Curry has seen how easily I\u2019m enraptured by the blood jewel. It\u2019s a sign of weakness\u2013something I don\u2019t care to fall victim to.</p><p>I\u2019m cautious as I approach Vincent where he is sitting on the armrest of Avery\u2019s throne. I want to look at her again\u2013and my eyes beg permission\u2013but I don\u2019t grant it. I fear any attention directed toward this lunatic\u2019s most prized possession could cause an unwelcome riff.</p> <p>An evil grin appears on Vincent\u2019s face as he reaches out to stroke Avery\u2019s cheek and it takes every ounce of strength I have to not rip his arm from its socket. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice your special interest in my sweet, sweet Avery.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He\u2019s already noticed the attention I gave her so I don\u2019t dare make the mistake of looking directly at her again. He drops his hand from her face and watches me. \u201cDid you enjoy her blood?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in a shitload of trouble if he asks for specifics so I rack my brain to remember some of the comments murmured by those around me after they drank her blood.</p><p>Damn! I draw a total blank because I was too preoccupied with seeing her for the first time. \u201cI did. It was mesmerizing just as you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it was everything I promised it would be and more, but what did you think of it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s pressing me. But why? Does he suspect I didn\u2019t drink her blood?</p><p>I look from Vincent to Avery against my better judgement. She peers up at me through her long lashes and I confirm the beautiful color of her eyes for the first time. They\u2019re the most unusual color of golden brown\u2013a shade I can\u2019t recall ever seeing in all of my years\u2013but they\u2019re a perfect pairing with her long blond curls. \u201cShe is perfection like nothing I\u2019ve ever known before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer blood used to be better, if you can believe that.\u201d There\u2019s no misinterpreting the disgust in his voice and I have the urge to defend her against his verbal assault.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine it being better.\u201d Nor can I imagine wanting her more than in this moment so I force my eyes from hers because I\u2019m ashamed. I shouldn\u2019t want her.</p><p>\u201cMy sweet Avery has become desensitized by us. We no longer frighten her so she doesn\u2019t produce the adrenalin high she once did. As you can imagine, I want to get that sensational high back again. I\u2019ve tried everything but I can\u2019t seem to achieve it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jenn told us the tactics he used on her and Avery to achieve a higher saturation of adrenalin in their blood so I\u2019m not at all shocked by his admission. However, I am a little surprised by how much pleasure his dissatisfaction brings me and I struggle to fight the grin threatening to spread across my face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Vincent. I don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhillip.\u201d I\u2019m briefly caught off guard when he uses my alias. \u201cI noticed the way you looked at my Avery.\u201d He places two fingers under her chin, lifts her face upward, and strokes her carotid. \u201cYou noticed too didn\u2019t you my sweet angel?\u201d</p><p>She makes no reply before she lowers her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you smell her fear and hear her fluttering heart, Phillip? It\u2019s been months since this happened. She might as well have been dead to the world until she saw you in the crowd and then her pathetic little human heart began to race. Now, adrenalin is coursing in her blood and seeping from her skin. Isn\u2019t it magnificent?\u201d</p><p>I knew the scent of adrenalin well but that was not the fragrance tickling my sense of smell. It was something entirely new and different. And I liked it a lot more than I should. \u201cShe is a splendid creature and you are very lucky to have such a rare commodity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome closer to her, Phillip.\u201d Why does he continue saying my alias and where is he going with this? It can\u2019t be good wherever it is.</p><p>I\u2019m cautious again as I take a single step toward her and stop. I don\u2019t want to make any aggressive moves that could trigger one\u2013or all\u2013of her guards to charge me. When Vincent sees that I have no intention of coming closer, he motions with his hand. \u201cCloser, I want you to touch her, Phillip.\u201d</p><p>Is he setting me up? Is it his plan to have the guards attack me? Perhaps as an example of what not to do with his property? \u201cOkay, this is getting a little too weird.\u201d</p><p>Vincent rises from the armrest and there\u2019s venom seething in his voice. \u201cI said for you to touch her and you are a guest in my home so please show some respect for your generous host that shared her blood with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Two words. Arrogant. Asshole.</p><p>I\u2019m furious as I move closer to Avery but then I look at her and all of my anger dissipates the moment I press the back of my hand to her face and slowly stroke her soft cheek. Human touch. It\u2019s something I haven\u2019t felt in decades and I bask in the feel of her warm skin against my cool hand. But that isn\u2019t what feels so amazing. It\u2019s the nearly electrical-like current I feel creeping beneath my skin. It\u2019s almost as if the point where I stop and she begins no longer exists.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to imagine us as the only two people in the room\u2013maybe even the earth\u2013but then Vincent ruins the moment when he opens his mouth. \u201cIt is glorious what your touch does to her.\u201d</p><p>He finds pleasure in this girl\u2019s fear. That\u2019s when I decipher what I\u2019m doing to Avery and why he made me touch her. I\u2019m unintentionally terrorizing her because she doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m here to save her and not join in with these sick bastards. \u201cI\u2019m glad you are pleased.\u201d I turn to walk away\u2013attempting to hide my disgust\u2013but he isn\u2019t finished with me.</p><p>\u201cStop, we\u2019re not done here.\u201d I cringe inwardly before I turn back because I don\u2019t know what to expect next from this psychopath. \u201cYou\u2019ve accomplished what no one else could and I need to reward you for your achievement.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know what constitutes his idea of contribution. \u201cI need no reward.\u201d</p><p>Vincent motions again for my return while stretching out his words in a threatening tone. \u201cPhillip ... come ... back.\u201d</p><p>I want no part of this game he\u2019s playing but I don\u2019t have a choice if I wish to maintain my cover so I return to stand before him. \u201cI have just one more request.\u201d It comes out as a whisper and his tone is even more devious when he lowers his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t want to ask what it is he wants from me but I do because I have no choice. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>An evil grin spreads across his face. \u201cBite her.\u201d He watches me while waiting for my reaction. \u201cI see you are questioning my sincerity but I am quite serious.\u201d Vincent reaches for Avery\u2019s carotid and caresses it with his thumb. \u201cBite her now.\u201d</p><p>Every vampire in this place\u2013with the exception of me and Curry\u2013would kill for this opportunity yet he chooses me to drink directly from the blood jewel. What are the odds?</p> <p>My mind races to think of an alternative. I\u2019m desperate to come up with anything but it becomes more and more clear as the moment passes. I have no choice. Our cover will be blown if I don\u2019t do as he commands.</p><p>I bring her wrist to my mouth and I\u2019m sickened by what I\u2019m about to do. I\u2019m going to bite a human and drink directly from the vein for the first time in more than two hundred years. As much as I hate doing this, I find comfort in knowing I\u2019m sacrificing myself\u2013and every part of who I\u2019ve become\u2013so this girl may be saved. If I never accomplish another thing in my existence, her life is worth everything I\u2019m giving up.</p><p>The moment before my incisors pierce her skin, Vincent stops me. \u201cNo, not like that. Stand up, Avery.\u201d</p><p>Vincent takes her hand and leads her to a huge gothic framed mirror hanging on the wall. He stops and places his hands on Avery\u2019s shoulders, turning her to face her reflection. \u201cCome join us, Phillip.\u201d</p><p>What kind of game is this madman playing? Is this all part of the show to heighten this girl\u2019s fear? \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is you want from me.\u201d</p> <p>He moves away from Avery. \u201cStand here behind her.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s eyes never leave mine while I do as he commands. Once I\u2019m standing in my designated spot I await further instructions. \u201cI want her to watch you in the mirror as you drink from her neck.\u201d</p><p>My fate is sealed. There\u2019s no way to avoid drinking from her now.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t appear the least bit fearful\u2013which makes no sense at all. For a reason I can\u2019t explain, I think she wants me to bite her. And I don\u2019t understand why.</p><p>We\u2019re standing close but we don\u2019t have to be for me to smell how much stronger her scent is becoming. Her fragrance is like nothing I\u2019ve ever encountered. I want to be engulfed by it so I move closer than necessary because I want to drown in it.</p><p>I place my hand on the blond curls cascading down her shoulders and push them aside. My incisors lengthen as I watch the pulsation in her neck. A low groan escapes her mouth as I quickly pierce her flesh but it doesn\u2019t feel like a response to pain. It seems more like she\u2019s enjoying what I\u2019m doing to her.</p> <p>I suck gently because I fear she has already lost more blood than her small body can withstand. I\u2019m surprised when her blood hits my tongue. I can\u2019t find the words to describe the flavor in my mouth because I\u2019m far more concerned about the way my lips feel against the skin of her body.</p><p>Doing something so wrong shouldn\u2019t feel this right.</p><p>Vincent grasps my shoulder. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>My incisors retract and I take my mouth from Avery\u2019s skin as Vincent claps his hands with delight. \u201cThat was marvelous. Let the party continue. We have many hours until dawn. Please, enjoy yourselves.\u201d</p><p>I turn Avery so I\u2019m able to inspect the damage on her neck. It\u2019s only oozing lightly but I can\u2019t stop my desire to taste her skin again so I place my tongue against her wound and spread my coagulant. The bleeding stops instantly but I steal another opportunity to touch her when I take her face in my hands. I hold her cheeks against my palms and her eyes alternate between looking at my eyes and mouth.</p><p>I wish I knew what she was thinking\u2013or maybe I don\u2019t\u2013but whatever it is won\u2019t matter for much longer.</p><p>I look deep into her eyes so I may remove this whole event from her memory although I fear it\u2019s one I\u2019ll never get out of mine. \u201cAvery, when you wake in the morning, you will not remember this incident. Your neck will be sore and you will believe it is from sleeping in an uncomfortable position. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She takes one more look at my mouth before she whispers, \u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>I battle the raging urge to grab her and flee this nightmare as I walk away. Turning my back on someone has never felt more wrong but I know the ultimate plan and I must stick to it if I intend on saving her from this madness.</p><p>I return to Curry\u2019s side and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re unable to discuss what just occurred. I have no idea what the hell I\u2019d say but I know one thing ... I can never tell him how it made me feel or how much I liked it.</p><p>I make a valiant effort to avoid looking toward Avery for a while but my eyes grow defiant and don\u2019t obey my brain\u2019s command when they steal a glance in her direction and find her looking at me. This is the painful game we play over the next hour until Vincent orders the guards to escort her away. As she rounds the corner, she turns for one last look in my direction before a guard gives her an unnecessary shove, causing her to stumble. I\u2019m ready to streak in her direction but she rights herself before falling. And then she\u2019s gone.</p><p>Once my attention isn\u2019t focused solely upon her, I notice the peculiar behavior displayed by our hosts and their guests. Their strange drunkenness increases as the minutes stretch into an hour and I\u2019m left with no choice but to wait for Avery\u2019s blood to effect me the same way.</p><p>Another hour passes and although I don\u2019t feel any drunken effects, I definitely think it\u2019s fair to say that something peculiar is happening to me. It\u2019s scary as hell although I\u2019d never admit that to anyone.</p><p>I can\u2019t guess what is about to happen to me but I know it\u2019s not something I want to experience here among these devils. \u201cUgh! These drunken fools are driving me crazy. I feel fine for the time being, but I know it\u2019s only a matter of time before I space out, so it\u2019s probably time I leave. I can\u2019t be positive I\u2019ll be able to control myself once this thing hits and I can\u2019t bear the thought of hurting that girl again. Everything is up to you from this point.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t give Curry a chance to reply before I\u2019m out the front door and streaking toward the road where I know Gia is waiting for me in the car. I dread the million question inquisition I\u2019m about to face. Gia will immediately ask how things went but I damn sure don\u2019t want to talk about it. Having the family know what I did to that innocent girl is going to be humiliating enough but that isn\u2019t the worst part of it. They will all know that her blood is going to make me crazy as hell when it hits.</p><p>I place my hand on the car door\u2019s handle but hesitate before pulling it as I turn back to look at the plantation house where I left my best friend with the task of rescuing Avery. It\u2019s no fault of my own that I can\u2019t walk in sunlight but it doesn\u2019t stop me from feeling useless.</p><p>I hear Gia call out from inside the car. \u201cHey, buffoon. Get in so we can blow this joint. I\u2019m not looking to get my goose cooked tonight.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t look at Gia when I get into the car. She has no idea what I\u2019ve done but the dread of her finding out keeps me from facing her. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>I suspect she\u2019s looking at me because she doesn\u2019t pull the car onto the road. She probably suspects how wrong things have gone. \u201cSomething happened. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not ready to go there. \u201cGia, I need you to do me a favor. For once in our existence together, I need you to cut me some slack and not ask how things went because I\u2019m not in a place where I\u2019m willing to talk about it right now.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t reply or ask again about what happened. She doesn\u2019t even say a word during the drive back to our compound and I\u2019ve never been more grateful for her silence.</p><p>There\u2019s only one thing I want once we\u2019re back at the Savannah compound\u2013to be alone without an interrogation by the females of the house\u2013but I have no such luck because Lairah meets us in the foyer as we enter the house. \u201cFinally! I thought you\u2019d never get back. We\u2019re dying to hear what happened.\u201d</p><p>I walk toward the basement door without looking in her direction. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I hear the astonishment in her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide you\u2019re not talking about what happened tonight while one of us remains there in that house with those crazies.\u201d</p><p>Gia speaks up for the first time since we left Vincent\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where Chansey is or why she isn\u2019t down here for an update but she is Curry\u2019s wife. She\u2019ll be in your face demanding to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>She is right. I\u2019m shocked Chansey isn\u2019t here threatening me within an inch of my life to tell her what happened with her husband. I\u2019m certain she will be at any minute so I need to retreat to the basement before she makes an appearance. I definitely don\u2019t want to be the one to tell her I left Curry with Gloriana. \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sol. You\u2019re staying and telling us what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... I\u2019m ... not!\u201d I growl at the top of my lungs before streaking through the door, slamming it behind me. I lean against it once I\u2019m out of their sight but curse myself. I hate being so harsh with Gia and Lairah but they\u2019d understand once they learned what had gone awry at Vincent\u2019s.</p><p>I descend the stairs and turn a chair to face the wall before sitting. I open my palm and look at Avery\u2019s pendant for the first time since leaving her in my best friend\u2019s hands.</p><p>There\u2019s no doubt about it. She\u2019s in my veins and I can\u2019t get her out. She\u2019s all I taste inside my mouth but it\u2019s not the flavor of her blood remaining on my tongue. It\u2019s simply ... her ... and I don\u2019t understand what is happening because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced in all my years as a vampire.</p><p>I\u2019m bewildered by the way I felt as I walked away from her and even now how I feel in this moment as I know Curry will be the one to save her. Nothing has ever felt more wrong. I want to be the one to protect her. It should be me taking her away from that place. Not Curry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The addictive nature of Avery\u2019s blood is the only rationalization for these urges to protect her but it does nothing to change the way I feel.

James Grady and Anna Grace Brennan\u2013my best friend\u2019s newborn children\u2013are home and making their presence well-known.</p><p>Wait a minute. Who am I kidding? I wasn\u2019t asleep. I spent the day lying awake thinking of Avery just like I\u2019ve done every day since her arrival three months ago. I can\u2019t blame my lack of sleep on crying babies\u2013especially since they just arrived home for the first time.</p><p>The last three days have been the worst. The key to solving the mystery of the blood jewel slipped through my hands. The answers were so close I could taste them but Curry ended it all when he chose to kill Marsala before she could give us an explanation. Without any hesitation at all, he snuffed out my chance at learning what I needed to know so I could keep Avery safe.</p> <p>I\u2019m furious with Curry but I can never let him know. I was a fool to tell him I loved Avery and now I have to do damage control which means I must lie to my best friend again\u2013and soon\u2013because he won\u2019t wait long before he asks me to explain how I could possibly love a human.</p><p>I walk to Curry and Chansey\u2019s bedroom and find the door open. That explains why I was able to hear the crying babies from their soundproof quarters. I tap on their door without a response. I assume neither is able to hear a thing over the shrill screams coming from within so I knock again a little harder. \u201cCome in,\u201d they call out in unison.</p><p>I pass through their bedroom into the nursery and stop in the doorway when I see Avery. I make a show of appearing surprised to see her but it\u2019s a sham. I already knew she was there because there\u2019s never a time I don\u2019t feel her presence.</p><p>She\u2019s so perfectly beautiful. Nothing seems more natural than to see her rocking one of the babies as she strokes his or her face. It\u2019s an instant reminder of everything she\u2019ll have one day when it\u2019s safe for her to leave this compound. They\u2019re things she\u2019ll share with another man\u2013instead of me\u2013and I can\u2019t stand the thought.</p><p>She\u2019s grinning when she looks up. It\u2019s the first smile she\u2019s ever sent in my direction but I know it isn\u2019t for me. It\u2019s a remnant of the happiness she has for the baby she\u2019s holding but I\u2019m not choosy. I\u2019ll take a smile from her any way I can get it. It\u2019s incredibly beautiful and she does it far too little. I wish I had the courage to tell her so.</p><p>Her smile fades and I feel the tension that always arises whenever we are in the same room. It always makes me want to leave\u2013and I usually do\u2013because I don\u2019t want to cause her discomfort. I want nothing but happiness for her and if my absence accomplishes that then I\u2019ll always oblige.</p> <p>I turn to leave but Curry stops me. \u201cSol? What are you doing up so early?\u201d He has a confused looked on his face.</p><p>He\u2019s wrong. His kids must have his brain muddled. \u201cIt\u2019s not early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is noon not early for a vampire?\u201d</p><p>No way it\u2019s the middle of the day. \u201cNoon? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d I look in the direction of the nursery\u2019s curtains but they\u2019re closed.</p><p>Curry walks over to the black and white print drapes and pulls one back an inch to show me he\u2019s right. It\u2019s a hazy day but I can easily see that it\u2019s midday. Hmm ... That\u2019s perplexing.</p><p>I\u2019m now able to see that Chansey is holding Anna Grace since I assume she\u2019d be the one to wear pink-trimmed clothing. She places her daughter on her back on top of her legs and brings her tiny feet up to her mouth for a kiss. \u201cPlease tell me our kids aren\u2019t loud enough to wake sleeping vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are some loud little buggers when they join forces but I wasn\u2019t asleep when I heard them crying. I seriously doubt they have the ability to wake the others.\u201d</p><p>Chansey never takes her eyes from her daughter. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know, isn\u2019t it? We don\u2019t want the other vampires in the house to be grumpy like Uncle Sol, do we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not grumpy.\u201d Am I?</p><p>\u201cTake it easy on him, love.\u201d Curry kisses Chansey\u2019s forehead and then looks at me. \u201cCan I see you in your office for a minute?\u201d</p><p>And here we go. See you in my office for a minute is code for I need to get you alone. He\u2019s wants to know why I was talking out of my head about loving Avery.</p><p>Chansey looks up at her husband so adoringly. Their love for one another is so apparent. And I envy it. \u201cThat\u2019s fine but don\u2019t be too long. You know what\u2019s coming and I need help.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m happy for Curry and Chansey but I\u2019m jealous because it\u2019s what I want for myself with Avery. I\u2019ve accepted that it can never be but it doesn\u2019t keep me from dreaming.</p><p>\u201cAvery, would you mind sitting with Chansey and the babies for a few minutes? It\u2019s almost their feeding time so she\u2019ll probably need some assistance with whoever isn\u2019t eating while she nurses the other.\u201d He always ensures that Chansey is taken care of even in his absence.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Avery brings James Grady up so his cheek brushes hers. \u201cI have no objections to holding one of these precious little angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d That at least sounds reassuring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to get rid of this sweet angel.\u201d Avery strokes her index finger down his forehead and slope of his nose. He closes his eyes when she repeats the motion and he doesn\u2019t open them again. It\u2019s like some kind of newborn magic sleep trick.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but overhear the conversation between Chansey and Avery as we leave. \u201cAnna Grace usually throws a fit to eat about fifteen minutes before James Grady decides he\u2019s ready. I guess she thinks ladies should go first but he always decides he\u2019s starving about halfway through her feeding. I haven\u2019t managed to master nursing them at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Too much information. I didn\u2019t want to think about one\u2013much less two\u2013kids nursing on Chansey at the same time. I\u2019m a vampire. That kind of mundane stuff is more than I want to know.</p><p>We\u2019re walking toward my office and I push the breastfeeding conversation aside as I try to decide how I\u2019ll handle Curry\u2019s questions. I should have already considered this conversation and decided on something to say but I chose to not think about it because I don\u2019t want to answer the tough questions he has for me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Avery is here. It\u2019s good for Chansey to have another woman in the house.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it but Curry doesn\u2019t mean just any woman. He means another human woman. \u201cI know Chansey loves Gia and Lairah but I\u2019m sure it means a lot to her to have a human in her life so she isn\u2019t surrounded by vampires all the time.\u201d</p><p>I take my seat behind my desk and rearrange papers. I try to appear carefree as I shuffle one paper with another but I know why we\u2019ve come to my office. He wants to ask me about what I said in the hospital. \u201cI want to protect Avery for me ... because I love her.\u201d I said those words during a moment of weakness. And it was a screw up on my part. Now I have to fix this problem I created for myself.</p><p>I open my desk drawer and pretend to search for something. \u201cWhen did you get home from the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I should try to keep him talking about his family. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to have them home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the weight that has been lifted from my shoulders in knowing Marsala can never harm my family again.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m happy Chansey and the twins are safe but I\u2019m instantly pissed off again. I struggle to hide my anger because it threatens to blow what I\u2019m working so hard to conceal. \u201cI can only imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sort of why I\u2019m here. I need to ask you about something you said that night. Something about Avery.\u201d</p><p>This is the part where I play dumb and pretend I don\u2019t know what he means. \u201cWhat about Avery?\u201d</p><p>Curry narrows his eyes at me while he wrinkles his brow. I think he\u2019s suspects I\u2019m about to try to deceive him. \u201cYou told me you loved her and I\u2019m confused about what that means.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s being a straight shooter on this so a new action plan is required\u2013play down what I said. \u201cIt means nothing at all.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>He\u2019s no longer relaxed in the chair. He\u2019s sitting on the edge and staring straight into my eyes. \u201cYour face didn\u2019t look like it was nothing to you that night and it damn sure doesn\u2019t look like it means nothing to you now either.\u201d</p><p>He knows me well and I have to do a better job of hiding my emotions from him. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I have become protective of Avery but only because of the time she\u2019s spent here. I\u2019ve come to think of her as a sister the same way I do the other girls. I meant nothing by what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it sounded to me. You\u2019ve never spoke of loving Gia or Lairah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t,\u201d I laugh. \u201cI\u2019d never hear the end of it from that pair of smartass extraordinaires if they ever heard me say I loved them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can tell me if you\u2019re having side effects from drinking Avery\u2019s blood?\u201d It\u2019s a question\u2013not a statement.</p><p>I\u2019ve always been able to tell Curry anything\u2013but not this time. No one can ever know how I feel about Avery. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. You can tell me anything\u2013anything at all\u2013and I won\u2019t judge you or tell the others. Not even Sebastian if it was what you wanted.\u201d We\u2019ve always shared a bond that didn\u2019t include the others and this is Curry reminding me of that.</p><p>It\u2019s tempting to tell him because I feel so alone in this\u2013whatever this is. I want to tell him what\u2019s been going on in my head but I\u2019m terrified. How do I explain the feelings I have for Avery when I don\u2019t understand them myself?</p><p>\u201cChansey and the babies are out of harm\u2019s way now. Their safety was the only thing holding me here.\u201d</p> <p>He interrupts me. \u201cDon\u2019t say you\u2019re leaving Savannah.\u201d He\u2019s picked up on where this conversation is going.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay.\u201d I can predict what he\u2019s going to say but I won\u2019t hear of it. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t have Avery leave this compound. She feels safe here and that\u2019s something she deserves after everything she\u2019s been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? Don\u2019t you deserve to head up the compound you built?\u201d</p><p>This is a repeat of the same conversation we had months ago when I was going to leave and the compound is still the least of my worries. \u201cI don\u2019t care about all of this. I can build another compound if I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop punishing yourself for something you couldn\u2019t control?\u201d</p> <p>Let him think that is what\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s easier that way. \u201cLeaving will be my atonement for what I did. This is me giving her some form of peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re looking to give peace. I think you\u2019re looking to find some.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s a little more receptive than I imagined but I\u2019ll roll with it. \u201cAm I a terrible person for wanting distance from Avery because I don\u2019t want to look at her every day and be reminded of what I did?\u201d</p><p>He looks angry. \u201cI never took you for a coward.\u201d</p><p>I should be the angry one since he\u2019s calling me a coward but I\u2019m not. I sort of fall into the category. \u201cCall me what you like but I\u2019m still leaving. Sebastian and I have discussed it and we decided I\u2019ll make the announcement tonight at dinner because we\u2019ll need a new leader to step up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mistake to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t talk you out of it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>There\u2019s only one person that could talk me out of leaving but it\u2019s never going to happen. \u201cNo. My decision\u2019s been made.\u201d He gets up and walks toward the door. \u201cI still can\u2019t talk you into taking my place?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even turn back to me as he replies on his way out of my office. \u201cNo. My decision has been made as well.\u201d</p><p>I return to my bed after my conversation with Curry but I\u2019m unable to sleep. How can I when I\u2019m only able to think of Avery and how painful it will be when I\u2019m parted from her? I absolutely dread telling her but not because I think she will be sad. She\u2019s going to be thrilled and her joy is going to break my heart.</p><p>I enter the dining room late so the family is already there and waiting. Dining is something I look forward to each night but it has nothing to do with drinking blood. I love it because Avery\u2019s seat is next to mine and it\u2019s the only time I\u2019m able to touch her.</p><p>Sometimes I think she likes the feel of her tiny hand inside mine but then I become certain I\u2019m imagining it because I hear her heart pound with fear. I had hoped she would eventually come to trust me and we\u2019d be able to reside under the same roof without her living in constant fear of me but I gave up on that dream a while ago.</p><p>I\u2019m seated at the head of the table and I take Avery\u2019s hand in mine when it\u2019s time for the sacrament of thanksgiving. I hold it tighter tonight and caress my thumb across the top as I speak. She probably finds that bizarre but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m a selfish bastard tonight and I\u2019m doing it for myself because this is the last time I\u2019ll ever touch her. \u201cWe, the Coven of Landra, give our humblest gratitude in recognition of the Blood Swan, Rebecca, for her selfless gift of sustenance.\u201d As they do every night, the others join me in reciting the rest of the sacrament. \u201cThank you, Rebecca, for your gift of The Life, which sustains our existence and gives us strength to do the needed tasks before us.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t let go of Avery\u2019s hand as I usually do when I finish leading the ritual. And neither does she. I look at our clasped hands for a moment before lifting my green eyes to the golden brown ones staring back at me. I\u2019m certain she\u2019s going to pull away any second so I brush my thumb over her fingers one last time while watching her face. For a moment, it almost feels like we\u2019re friends. Or lovers. But then the moment is gone when too much time passes and we each pull our hands away.</p><p>I grasp the glass of blood in front of me but I have no appetite for it. I haven\u2019t craved it in quite some time now\u2013much longer than what any vampire young or old would consider normal. I try to remember the last time I nourished myself and realize it\u2019s been too long. I should be starving by now. But I\u2019m not.</p><p>Conversations are taking place between my family members around me but my attention is undivided for the beauty to my right although I don\u2019t dare look in her direction. I drown out the idol chatter around me until I\u2019m concentrating solely on the connection I share with her.</p><p>My bond to her hasn\u2019t weakened in the least over the last three months. I think it could be even stronger than it was the night I took her life\u2019s essence into my body as I drank from her.</p><p>I close my eyes and go to that dwelling where it\u2019s only the two of us\u2013like we\u2019re suspended in a mysterious place lost in time. It\u2019s my favorite spot to be because I feel her so closely\u2013as if we are one\u2013and she isn\u2019t afraid of being so near. I\u2019m able to hold her hand in this dream-like place because she isn\u2019t frightened by my touch.</p><p>\u201cSol.\u201d My fantasy is interrupted when I hear Sebastian call my name. I suspect by his tone that he probably said it more than once although I didn\u2019t hear him. I\u2019m suddenly aware that my hand has found Avery\u2019s under the table but I don\u2019t remember how it got there. I\u2019m grasping it tightly\u2013holding on for dear life\u2013and probably hurting her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Everyone\u2019s attention is directed at me as I release the small delicate hand in mine.</p><p>Sebastian prompts me. \u201cYour announcement? Would you like to make it now while everyone is together?\u201d</p><p>Not really. I\u2019m not prepared to see the relief on Avery\u2019s face but I have to tell her\u2013and everyone else\u2013at some point. \u201cOf course.\u201d I cough and then swallow because the words feel like they\u2019re stuck inside my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to return to New Orleans with Sebastian. We\u2019re leaving tomorrow night and I\u2019ll need someone to take my place as leader here.\u201d</p><p>No one utters a word or asks why I\u2019m leaving and it\u2019s all the confirmation I need to draw my own conclusion. They think they know exactly why I\u2019m going away but they\u2019d only be half-right. \u201cPlease don\u2019t all volunteer at once.\u201d</p><p>Lairah finishes off the last of her blood and places her empty glass on the table. \u201cI think we all assumed that asking for volunteers was ceremonial. We were waiting for Curry to step up since it\u2019s only natural that he would be next in line to take charge.\u201d</p><p>My friend needed my support. \u201cThe timing is all wrong for Curry. He can\u2019t take this on right now because Chansey is still recovering. She needs him full-time and this position would take away too much of the time he needs to spend with her and the babies. But if you want to choose a leader based on seniority then the next in line would be Thatcher.\u201d</p><p>Gia and Thatcher look at one another\u2013a clear indication that there is a concealed liaison between them\u2013but it\u2019s Thatcher that speaks up. \u201cCan I have a little time to think it over?\u201d</p><p>Gia and Thatcher\u2019s relationship borders on being ridiculous. I wonder who they think they\u2019re fooling because everyone in this family knows they have something going on. I don\u2019t know when they\u2019re going to figure out that they can have their little fling openly because no one here cares.</p><p>\u201cCertainly but please be mindful that I need a volunteer before we leave tomorrow night. Otherwise, Sebastian will be forced to appoint someone and none of us want that.\u201d</p><p>My hand has abandoned my full glass of blood. It\u2019s resting on the table and Avery\u2019s fingers brush mine as she rises. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not feeling well so I\u2019m going to retire to my room. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s lying. She isn\u2019t ill at all. She\u2019s sad. But it can\u2019t be about me leaving the compound. She\u2019s happy about that\u2013or at least I thought she would be\u2013so why isn\u2019t she jumping up and down with joy?</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in my office with the door closed. It\u2019s the middle of the night when Avery is normally sleeping but I can sense her closing the distance between us with each step she takes in my direction. Even these twelve-inch steel walls surrounding me can\u2019t block the fusion I have with her. I squeeze my eyes tightly, wishing all of it away: The connection. The desire. The love I have for her.</p><p>Avery Ferrand is a torture to my mind, my body and my soul like I\u2019ve never known.</p><p>I silently pray she will pass quickly but she stops at my office door. I listen closely but then laugh to myself because it\u2019s useless. I\u2019m inside a soundproof room that won\u2019t allow me to hear anything but it\u2019s of little consequence. I don\u2019t need to hear Avery to know her every move.</p><p>A moment later she rings the buzzer and I go completely stupid. I\u2019m unsure of what to do so I remain motionless as I stare at the door hoping she\u2019ll go away. Several seconds pass and I hear the sound again before she struggles to open the heavy door. \u201cSol?\u201d</p><p>The door still separates us so I close my eyes a second time as I savor the way my name sounds coming from her lips. I\u2019ve heard her say it so few times and I\u2019m convinced she must be an angel because nothing has ever sounded sweeter. \u201cCome in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushes the door half-open, peers around and takes a look at the stack of papers on the desk in front of me. \u201cYou\u2019re busy. Should I come back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It looks a lot worse than it really is. Please, come in.\u201d I realize my mistake as soon as I ask her to enter my office. I shouldn\u2019t ask her to come into a room alone with me even if I\u2019ve never attempted to drink from her again. There\u2019s not a chance in hell she\u2019ll feel safe unless someone knows she\u2019s with me.</p><p>I rise from my chair and gesture toward the door. \u201cOr I can join you in the living room.\u201d This is my way of offering her an out without it becoming awkward. Truth be told I\u2019m doing it more for me than her. I don\u2019t think I can stand seeing the fear she\u2019ll have by being alone with me.</p> <p>She leans against the door and uses her body weight to close it as I\u2019m walking toward her. \u201cNo. What I have to say doesn\u2019t concern the others so I\u2019d rather stay here. This is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>I almost think I hear the screech of my shoes when I stop dead in my tracks after I comprehend what\u2019s happening. Avery has closed us off from the rest of the family. And the world. No one can hear a sound behind these walls.</p><p>I take a step in retreat and the back of my legs collide with the desk. She smiles and I can only guess that it is sparked by my unusual display of clumsiness. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sol. I\u2019m not afraid of being alone with you.\u201d She steps away from the door and walks around to one of the chairs. \u201cI know you won\u2019t hurt me. I wouldn\u2019t be in here if I thought otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She sits in one of the black and white damask print chairs and places her hand on the arm of its mate. \u201cWill you sit with me? I\u2019d like to talk about us.\u201d She wants me next to her\u2013not on the other side of my desk. And she wants to discuss us?</p><p>I proceed with caution toward the empty chair because it\u2019s been my way with Avery from the beginning. I\u2019m always careful to make slow, deliberate movements in her presence so I don\u2019t startle or frighten her.</p> <p>My mind is racing with wonder about what she could possibly want to discuss. \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s the complete opposite. Something ....\u201d She stops and appears as though she\u2019s choosing her words carefully. \u201cNo. Make that everything is finally right for once.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s painful when I understand what she\u2019s referring to. I feel a dreadful heaviness deep in my chest because I realize everything finally being right for her translates into one thing: she\u2019s thrilled that I\u2019m leaving. And it breaks my heart but I can\u2019t allow her to see that. \u201cIt\u2019ll certainly make life easier for you once I\u2019m gone. You won\u2019t have to look at me every day and remember what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head from side to side slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not happy you\u2019ve decided to leave the Savannah compound. I\u2019m happy because your decision has forced me to realize how badly I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>Confusion immediately sets in. She\u2019s been fearful of me since the night of the blood jewel ceremony. Why would she want me to stay and put her through the torture of living under the same roof? \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re terrified of me. I thought you\u2019d be pleased to hear that I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of you.\u201d She looks down at her hands in her lap. \u201cBut I am terrified by the feelings I have for you and the things I want you to do to me.\u201d She looks up and swallows hard. \u201cI want you to stay. With me.\u201d</p> <p>Is it possible I\u2019ve mistaken her body\u2019s reaction as fear all this time when it was something else all together? Like ... love? No. I won\u2019t get my hopes up because it\u2019s a ridiculous thought to imagine she could possibly have feelings like that for me. She is a blood jewel and I\u2019m a vampire. Ironically, our roles are reversed. She is an unintentional predator and I am her prey. There\u2019s only one relationship that could possibly exist between us and it doesn\u2019t involve love or romance. It is sordid and exists solely for the purpose of addicting me to her blood.</p><p>I look at the pained expression on her face and see that she truly believes the things she\u2019s saying. And that\u2019s why my words are going to hurt her. I get up from the chair and walk to the window. I can\u2019t look at her anymore. She makes me hope for more than what is possible between us. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that it was the right decision after I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>I hear her get up from the chair and approach me from behind. \u201cTurn around and look at me.\u201d</p><p>If I do, it\u2019ll be my undoing. I\u2019m certain of it. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you can.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an internal battle raging inside me but I give in and turn to her because it\u2019s what she asks. And because it\u2019s what I want as well.</p><p>She lifts her hands to touch my face, placing her palms on each side. She looks into my eyes and a smile\u2013a breathtakingly beautiful one\u2013appears. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to touch you like this for so long.\u201d</p><p>Being like this with her is exactly what I have been dreaming of for months. It\u2019s no less wonderful than I imagined but I can\u2019t ignore how wrong it is. And dangerous for both of us. We shouldn\u2019t be this close. And we damn sure shouldn\u2019t be alone in this room. \u201cYou need to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go. And I strongly suspect that although you\u2019re telling me to, you don\u2019t really want me to either.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be more right. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all the more reason you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t need to explain this. \u201cBecause this isn\u2019t right for either of us.\u201d</p><p>She strokes her thumb over my cheek. \u201cNothing has ever felt more right to me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou and I should never be alone behind a closed door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you drank from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I squeeze my eyes shut before making the confession that will scare her enough to make her leave. \u201cBut mostly because I liked doing it entirely too much.\u201d</p><p>She pulls my face toward hers but I can\u2019t open my eyes because I\u2019m too ashamed of what I\u2019ve just confessed. She has to think I\u2019m a monster for enjoying that terrible thing I did to her.</p><p>I feel her breath against my lips as she whispers, \u201cIt felt so different with you. It was the first time I ever liked it. I\u2019ve never wanted anything so much in my life.\u201d I feel her lips lightly brush against mine as she continues talking. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t stopped wanting you to do it again.\u201d</p><p>My eyes pop open at the shock of her admission. \u201cAbsolutely not. I will never hurt you like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me at all.\u201d Her hands slide from my face to my shoulders and the tip of her tongue grazes my mouth as she licks her lips. The moisture there doesn\u2019t have to make contact with my tongue for me to remember the way she tastes\u2013sweet and delicious. \u201cSomething happened between us that night and it was beautiful. Please tell me you felt it too.\u201d</p><p>I encountered something extraordinary but decided I had imagined it because it seemed too good to be true. But even as much as I enjoyed it, I could never put Avery in that kind of danger again. \u201cI felt every moment. I covet every second of what I experienced with you but it can never happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe that you hurt me but you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand the danger. \u201cWho\u2019s to say I wouldn\u2019t the next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. Because I know you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She caresses her cheek against mine. \u201cI felt your gentleness then and I feel it now. I\u2019m certain you\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s wrong. I\u2019d do nothing but hurt her. Or it could possibly be the other way around. Maybe she\u2019d hurt me. \u201cYou\u2019re a blood jewel, Avery. None of us knows what that means except vampires that drink your blood become addicted to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not you. You\u2019re the only one that hasn\u2019t been effected by it.\u201d</p><p>I beg to differ. I\u2019ve been highly impacted but in a much different way\u2013possibly an even more dangerous manner\u2013because my side effects have made me believe I\u2019m in love with this girl. Maybe that\u2019s why the thought of her wanting me simply out of pure curiosity is so painful. \u201cIs that what this is about? You\u2019re mesmerized by my lack of addiction to your blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Her scent suddenly engulfs me as she comes up on her tiptoes so her mouth may connect with mine. I haven\u2019t kissed a human woman since Lisette but time doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s an instinct lingering within me and it takes over as my tongue joins hers in a seductive dance.</p><p>Her hands lock behind my neck while mine find her hips so I can pull her closer. She arches into me and my mouth trails kisses down her neck. She lifts her chin\u2013giving me full access to her neck\u2013and I feel the pulsation beneath my lips. \u201cMake me your blood doll, Sol.\u201d</p><p>My blood doll? Is that what she thinks I want her to be? \u201cDo you even know what a blood doll is?\u201d She can\u2019t possibly understand or she wouldn\u2019t ask to become that.</p><p>\u201cYes. And I want to be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blood whore? That\u2019s what you want to be?\u201d It\u2019s true. I used that term to shock her into realizing what it is she\u2019s asking to be.</p><p>\u201cYou can label it whatever you\u2019d like but I want to be the only one you drink from. I don\u2019t want you to partake of the blood swans anymore.\u201d She lifts her chin again. \u201cMake me your only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d She strokes the vein I drank from previously. \u201cAll you have to do is pierce this and drink.\u201d</p><p>I think she sees the battle raging in my head. I don\u2019t have the desire to drink her blood but I want nothing more than to feel the connection we shared when I did because it was so amazing. And this is what she wants too\u2013as much as me or possibly even more.</p><p>\u201cMake me yours, Sol. Please. It\u2019s what we both want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel myself giving into her. \u201cThe others can\u2019t know. They\u2019d never understand or accept it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth spreads into a smile as she nods in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s a little secret. In fact, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s huge\u2013probably the biggest I\u2019ve ever had\u2013and another one to add to the collection I\u2019m keeping from Curry and the others. The thought of hiding something so important from him floods me with guilt but I\u2019ll do it because this is what she wants and I\u2019ll take her any way I can have her.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cIs there a mirror in here?\u201d</p><p>I gesture toward the closed door. \u201cIn the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>She angles her head to the side and wrinkles her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire with a bathroom in your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a selling point should we ever decide to leave.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs. \u201cMakes sense.\u201d She takes my hand in hers and leads me into the bathroom. Once inside she stands so she is facing the mirror with me behind her. She reaches for her long blond hair and pulls it over one shoulder as she tilts her head to the side. She rests her back against my front and her eyes watch mine in the mirror.</p><p>She\u2019s not wasting any time. \u201cYou want me to do it right now?\u201d</p><p>I watch her reflection as she releases her hair and straightens her neck. \u201cOnly if it\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>To please me. That\u2019s what she desires. And I want to please her as well because this isn\u2019t only about me. \u201cIs it what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... very much.\u201d</p><p>I will do it for her because\u2013the gods help me\u2013I would do anything to make her happy.</p> <p>I brush her hair away from her neck until it cascades down one shoulder. She leans her head over again and stretches her neck until I have full access. She reclines back until her body is completely supported by mine. I hear and feel her heart pounding as her eyes lock with mine in the mirror just the way they did when I drank from her the night we met.</p><p>I feel her body begging\u2013even coaxing me\u2013to do what it is we both want as her blood vessels rise closer to the surface of her skin. It\u2019s a physiological change her body undergoes as a direct result of her desire to be bitten. My body receives it as an invitation and results in the lengthening of my incisors.</p><p>She stretches her arm up and places her hand on the back of my head to pull me closer. \u201cMake me yours, Sol. It\u2019s what I want more than anything.\u201d</p><p>I need no more encouragement so I place my mouth against her sweet tasting skin and pierce it. She twitches as I hear her sharp intake of breath. I suck gently over the two openings my sharp teeth have made and her gasp turns to panting as she rocks against me. That intoxicating scent\u2013which isn\u2019t at all like blood essence\u2013floods my senses and I grasp her hard around the waist until a moan escapes her mouth. I loosen my hold because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m hurting her but she slips her free hand over mine and presses it closer again. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop, Sol. It feels so good.\u201d</p><p>And it does feel amazing. Drinking from Avery is a pleasure like I\u2019ve never known and I feel how euphoric it makes her because we are joined on a higher level\u2013one I\u2019d never experienced while drinking from any human. Ever. Sure, it is possible to bridge with a human\u2019s emotions while drinking directly from them but never like this. And I\u2019d never remained connected to them afterwards because the minute my mouth left their skin, all links were broken\u2013but not with Avery. My bond to her remains even months later.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve taken what she so happily gives, I pull my mouth away from the piercing and stop the bleeding with my coagulant. I trail my tongue over her wounded skin so the healing process will be significantly decreased and I marvel at the delicious taste of her skin\u2013not her blood. I place a kiss against the spot I just licked before I look up to meet her eyes. \u201cYou taste like candy ... and sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy I understand. Sunshine ... not so much.\u201d</p><p>I run my nose down her arm. \u201cYou were in the sun today. I can smell and taste it on your skin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was unseasonably warm today so I enjoyed the weather while doing some reading.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her forearm and allow my tongue to brush it. \u201cIt changes the flavor of your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter or worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. It\u2019s just different.\u201d</p><p>She turns to face me and leans closer to place her cheek against my chest as she slips her arms around my waist. I bring her closer and we stay like that for a while. \u201cYou\u2019re happy?\u201d I feel like I have to ask.</p><p>\u201cYes. But you already know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>How could she know I sensed her feelings ... unless she sensed mine too? \u201cYes. I feel an unusual attachment to you and I\u2019ve never experienced it with any other human. Do you feel it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It began the night we met. I\u2019ve never felt it with any other vampire. You\u2019re the only one.\u201d My mind is reeling because I\u2019ve been mistaken about her all this time. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a blood jewel trait but that can\u2019t be the case since you haven\u2019t meshed with others.\u201d And I\u2019m glad. The thought of her sharing this special bond with another doesn\u2019t make me happy.</p><p>She puts her palms on my chest and slowly slides them up. \u201cHow do you feel when we kiss? Do you like it? Because it seems like you do.\u201d</p><p>Her hands continue up my chest and over my shoulders. I slide my hands around her waist until they\u2019re grasping her back. \u201cI like it very much.\u201d</p><p>I pull her close until her body is pressed firmly against mine. She feels so tiny in my arms\u2013and so breakable. She rises onto her tiptoes like she did earlier and our mouths are as close as they can be without touching. \u201cEnough to do it again?\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t want to kiss her again but I do. \u201cI\u2019d very much like to do it again.\u201d</p><p>And I almost do before someone rings the buzzer. I spin my head in the direction of the sound because I remember the door is unlocked. I hope whoever it is doesn\u2019t open it and walk in on us. \u201cSomeone\u2019s at the door.\u201d That was a stupid thing to say since I\u2019m stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cShould I stay in here out of sight while you answer it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I take her hand and lead her from the bathroom. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any fooling whoever it is. They\u2019ll smell you and become worried when they don\u2019t see you sitting safely in my office.\u201d After she sits, I lean down and briefly kiss her lips. \u201cTry to look calm and act like we didn\u2019t do what we just did.\u201d</p><p>She leans up and nips my lip. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>I find Curry on the other side of the door when I open it. \u201cSorry to bother you since your door was closed but Avery isn\u2019t in her bed and we can\u2019t find her anywhere.\u201d</p><p>His sniffer must be on the fritz since he doesn\u2019t register her scent. I guess it\u2019s the whole vampire morphing into a human thing\u2013which is probably good\u2013or he\u2019d likely smell her on me since she\u2019s freshly on my lips. And in my mouth.</p><p>I swing the door open a little wider so he\u2019s able to see her sitting in my office. She waves from where she\u2019s sitting. \u201cAll is well, Curry. Sol and I are just talking about his decision to leave. I\u2019ve told him he doesn\u2019t have to on my account. I think we\u2019ve worked out our issues so it looks like he\u2019ll be staying after all. Isn\u2019t that great news?\u201d</p><p>He looks back to me. \u201cWorked it out, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Working might be a better choice of words. We weren\u2019t quite finished talking but I think it\u2019s safe to say that you can expect things to be much different between us from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall leave you to finish your peace talks.\u201d Curry looks back at Avery to address her. \u201cI\u2019ll let Jenn know you\u2019ve not gone missing. She was sort of freaking out because she couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly appreciate you putting her mind at rest.\u201d Damn. She\u2019s such a good actress she almost has me fooled.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door and fall into the seat next to Avery. \u201cI hate lying to my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna hate lying to my sister but we agreed it\u2019s what we have to do because they won\u2019t understand or accept what we\u2019re doing.\u201d She places her hand on my leg and strokes it. \u201cThis is our decision. Not theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but we have to be careful. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for us to disappear into my office with me coming out smelling like you. Curry\u2019s losing a lot of his vampires senses but the others aren\u2019t. They\u2019re going to smell you all-over me. I can pass tonight off if I stay in here for a few hours but we need to have a plan for how to handle this in the future.\u201d</p><p>She lifts a strand of her hair and twists it around her finger as she thinks. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed her doing many times. \u201cHow can we be together the way we want if they\u2019re always going to smell me on you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s only one solution. \u201cI think the safest time would be in the mornings after they\u2019re asleep so your scent will have time to fade before they\u2019re awake again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if they\u2019re asleep, you should be too.\u201d</p><p>Sleep isn\u2019t an issue for me. I\u2019ve been doing without it for a while. \u201cLet that be my problem to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to harm yourself by being awake during the day.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she worries about me makes my heart melt. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ve been doing this for a while, you know?\u201d</p><p>She gets up from her chair and sits in my lap. \u201cHow long is a while?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m old as hell and I wonder if it\u2019ll bother her. \u201cI was twenty-five when I was turned so I was born three hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>She looks surprised. I don\u2019t think she had any idea I was that old. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been a vampire for two hundred and seventy-five years?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I place my hand on her lower back and massage. \u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I like older men.\u201d She breaks into a mischievous grin as she leans down to kiss me.</p><p>When we pull away I look into her eyes trying to decide how young I think she is. \u201cWhat is your age?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty.\u201d I think she interprets the look on my face as a direct indicator of the distress I feel because she quickly adds, \u201cBut I\u2019ll be twenty-one next month.\u201d As if one year really makes a difference.</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a good minute before I\u2019m able to respond. \u201cShit, Avery. You\u2019re even younger than Chansey.\u201d I remember the hard time I gave Curry about having a relationship with a young girl. I may have even called her a child but at least she turned out to be his intended. Now I\u2019m doing whatever this is with an even younger girl and she isn\u2019t my mate so I have no excuse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child so don\u2019t go there. I feel much older than twenty after the things I\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I\u2019m so sorry for everything you\u2019ve experienced in your short life. I wish I could take it all away for you.\u201d She leans over and places her head on my shoulder. She\u2019s curled up like a child in my lap so I put my arms around her to hold her close. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Vincent will never get to you again.\u201d</p><p>The mention of her former captor sends her heart racing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that. That monster could find me years from now.\u201d</p> <p>I should tell her about the oath to protect her. Maybe it\u2019ll put her at ease knowing I\u2019ve sworn to always be near her and keep her from being harmed. \u201cWhat do you know about sacred vows\u2013I mean the kind a vampire makes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to look at me when I say this.\u201d She sits upright and twists in my lap so she can see me. \u201cA sacred vow occurs when a vampire makes a pledge. It\u2019s an oath that exists for the lifetime of the vampire so it isn\u2019t taken lightly because it\u2019s unbreakable and can\u2019t be undone. It\u2019s a very old tradition but because there\u2019s no going back, very few vampires practice this.\u201d I take her hand in mine and grasp it tightly. Even if it\u2019s only in the background, I\u2019ll forever be a part of her life and I have no idea what her reaction will be. \u201cI\u2019ve declared only one sacred vow in my two hundred and seventy-five years as a vampire. It is to keep you safe at any cost.\u201d</p><p>I see her drawing a conclusion. \u201cBy any cost, you mean ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI will die protecting you if necessary.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s upset. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want that. I\u2019d never want you to die for me.\u201d</p> <p>Good thing it isn\u2019t her choice to make. \u201cIt\u2019s done and there\u2019s no undoing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morning Curry brought you to the compound. And I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019d do it again if given the choice.\u201d</p><p>She places her palm against my face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that for me.\u201d</p><p>I move her hand to my mouth and kiss it. \u201cI am your protector. Always.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward and places her forehead against mine. I feel her sweet breath against my lips and I can\u2019t resist kissing them. She welcomes my tongue into her mouth and I reel over all the sensations rushing toward me at once. I remember the way I felt when I kissed Lisette but it could never come close to rivaling this.</p><p>Avery rises and turns so she may position a knee on each side of my hips. She lowers herself to straddle me and wraps her arms around my neck. I watch her finger tap against the pulsation in her neck as she tilts her head to invite me closer. \u201cKiss me right here.\u201d</p><p>I know what she\u2019s doing. She wants me to drink from her again. I won\u2019t but I lean forward to place my lips against the throbbing vessel because I want to taste her skin.</p> <p>She places her hand on the back of my head and presses my mouth against her throat. \u201cI want you to drink from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Twice in the same day is nothing to me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I know her body can withstand a large blood loss but that isn\u2019t the point. \u201cFine isn\u2019t good enough for me. I want you healthy and glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would definitely glow if we connected like we did a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Humans aren\u2019t meant to have their blood drained so often. \u201cDrinking from you too soon is hazardous to your health and I think we just covered how committed I am to your safety and well-being.\u201d</p><p>She sucks my lip into her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>We needed boundaries. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I wouldn\u2019t and that\u2019s why I won\u2019t drink from you more than once every three days. Your body needs time to compensate for the blood loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days? I don\u2019t want to go that long without intertwining myself with you.\u201d A sad look comes over her face. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s trying to pull that card on me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hear me tell you how much I want you. You can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I do.\u201d She puts her head on my shoulder and nuzzles against my neck. \u201cWon\u2019t you need blood more often than every few days?\u201d</p><p>Not as of lately. \u201cI can do without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you doing without. You wouldn\u2019t ask me to not eat.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for me. Hell, I didn\u2019t even understand. But things had changed. \u201cI don\u2019t need as much blood as I once did. I can easily go three days between feeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sebastian partakes of the blood swans every day and he\u2019s older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he probably does it mostly for the companionship. He can\u2019t possibly require blood every day if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her face and looks me right in my eyes. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll come to me if you need to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be hard to pretend nothing is going on between us when we\u2019re with the others?\u201d</p><p>I feel like quite the actor. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretending everything was normal between us for months now. I think I\u2019m pretty damn good at it if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poker face is quite good. No one suspects anything so I guess we\u2019ll continue as we were but how are we going to do ... this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait and you\u2019ll come to me on the third morning when the others are sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait that long to be with you again. Can we see each other the mornings you don\u2019t drink from me?\u201d</p><p>Vampires associate with their blood dolls for very few reasons other than the drinking of their blood but that isn\u2019t what was happening here. I couldn\u2019t give a name to what we were doing just yet but it definitely wasn\u2019t that. \u201cI\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Three days. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since I drank from Avery but this morning will put an end to our wait.</p><p>We\u2019ve been thieves stealing every available moment together and taken far more chances than we should. It\u2019s becoming harder each day to not allow myself to look at her for too long. Touching her at dinner is now pure torment because it always ends too soon. I almost blew it last night when I held her hand for too long after the sacrament and I strongly suspect Jenn noticed. I\u2019m almost certain of it.</p><p>It\u2019s dawn and the others are down for the day. Avery should come to me at any moment and I\u2019m impatient to have her in my arms. It has nothing to do with drinking her blood and never has; I don\u2019t need it. I just want to share our special coalesce again.</p><p>And return her most treasured possession.</p><p>The buzzer rings and I streak toward the door to open it. I can\u2019t walk at human speed because I\u2019m too anxious about having her close. I\u2019m enchanted by her\u2013not that I\u2019d want to break free of the spell she\u2019s cast over me.</p><p>I open the door and she gives me that look\u2013the one that tells me she can\u2019t wait to be in my arms with my mouth pressed against her skin.</p><p>I suddenly feel timid about what we\u2019re going to do. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Her hands are behind her back and she\u2019s twisting back and forth as she shrugs her shoulders and tilts her head to the side. She looks so sweet and innocent. It\u2019s a great look on her.</p><p>As if possible, I want her more than ever.</p><p>She brings her hands from where they\u2019re hidden behind her back and I take them so I can pull her into my office. Once she\u2019s inside, I push the door closed. And lock it. I don\u2019t want anyone walking in and interrupting what comes next.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to touch and kiss her so I pull her close. She puts her hands over my shoulders and leans in, pressing her body into mine. Our lips touch and she opens her mouth to invite my tongue inside. She tastes so good\u2013all sweet and minty.</p><p>I feel her mouth spread into a smile. \u201cToday took it\u2019s sweet time getting here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you want to do it this time? The bathroom again? Or would you be willing to try something ... different?\u201d</p><p>All of what she just said sounded naughty. \u201cSounds like you have something in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one that had been thinking about this for days. \u201cI\u2019ll try anything you want.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hands and leads me around to my chair behind the desk. She puts her hands on my chest and pushes. \u201cSit.\u201d I do as she says and she climbs onto my lap\u2013a knee on each side of my hips\u2013so she\u2019s straddling me. I think she likes this position.</p><p>Oh, hell. There it is again\u2013that intoxicating aroma that takes over and controls my brain anytime when we\u2019re close like this.</p><p>She reaches for her hair and pulls it away from her neck so it falls over one shoulder. \u201cI want to try doing it like this if it\u2019s okay with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, yeah. I\u2019m on board.</p><p>She\u2019s amazing, simply amazing. \u201cI\u2019m good with this.\u201d That\u2019s such an understatement. I\u2019m well beyond okay with it.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She leans closer and tilts her head. She\u2019s trembling. I might mistake that for fear if I didn\u2019t feel her emotions but I know better. It\u2019s desire. She wants this as much as I do and it\u2019s the ultimate turn-on.</p> <p>I press my mouth against her neck to kiss it but I don\u2019t pierce the vein just yet. I have other things I want to do first.</p><p>I splay my hands over the small of her back and pull her body close to mine. She grinds her hips against me and I breathe in the surrounding aroma. It pushes me to want\u2013maybe even commands me\u2013to do things I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She grips the back of my head and presses my mouth to her pulsating vein. I go from wanting to kiss her sweetly to being driven toward something entirely different. Something ... more. Something ... human. And I feel myself being taken over by an intense desire to be joined to her but it has nothing to do with the consumption of her blood.</p><p>\u201cNo more waiting.\u201d She leans back and brings me with her, my mouth never breaking contact with her skin. \u201cBite me now, Sol. I don\u2019t want to go another second without feeling you.\u201d</p><p>I want more but I\u2019m confused by the means of how to obtain it. The act of drinking from her is the only method we have for creating the special fusion we covet so much.</p> <p>I want to merge with her just as much as she does\u2013maybe even more\u2013so she doesn\u2019t have to ask again. My incisors are out and ready. They lengthened the moment her intoxicating aroma hit my senses.</p><p>I pierce her vein quickly. She moans and slightly jerks when my sharp teeth enter her tender skin. I didn\u2019t think I liked this\u2013the part where I cause her pain\u2013but it\u2019s the complete opposite. She relishes the pleasure behind the pain so that makes me enjoy doing it. It\u2019s another unexpected surprise.</p><p>I retract my razor sharp teeth from her skin and her blood pulsates into my mouth as I take a part of her body into my own. One swallow\u2013that\u2019s all it takes of Avery\u2019s precious blood for us to be melded in a way I could have never imagined before this moment.</p><p>I\u2019m able to feel Avery inside and out as I drink from her so there\u2019s no room for doubt. This woman loves me. And I love her. Words aren\u2019t required for us to declare this but I\u2019m a vampire and she\u2019s a human. It shouldn\u2019t be possible for either of us to have these affections and desires for one another.</p><p>I slip my hands under Avery\u2019s shirt and allow my fingertips to roam the bare skin of her lower back. I slide my hands upward and run them over her bra. I feel the clasp beneath my fingers and I\u2019m confused by the desire I have to unfasten it.</p><p>I wonder what she\u2019d say? Would she slap my hands away? I feel the crazy desire raging inside her and know she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d like it very much if I touched her that way but I\u2019m terrified. I don\u2019t know how to do things like that.</p> <p>I stop drinking from Avery before I\u2019d like but I end it because I don\u2019t want to harm her by taking too much. She braces the back of my head and attempts to hold me in place as I pull away. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I lick the puncture holes on her neck to cease the bleeding. \u201cI have to, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>She straightens and looks at me. \u201cBaby doll? Where did that come from?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a name for someone precious to you. And that\u2019s what she is\u2013precious to me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call you blood doll. It\u2019s too much like calling you a whore and that\u2019s not what you are to me.\u201d</p><p>She brushes her thumb over my bottom lip. \u201cWhat am I to you?\u201d</p><p>That was the question I couldn\u2019t stop rolling around in my head and I still didn\u2019t have the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know. I\u2019m still trying to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure it out too. But I like it whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>Like didn\u2019t seem to be the right word but I\u2019d roll with it since it\u2019s what she had used. \u201cI do too. I like it a lot.\u201d I kiss the wound I just made on her neck and lick it again to encourage its healing so it would hopefully be mended before the others awakened tonight. They definitely don\u2019t need to see puncture marks on her body or the jig will be up.</p> <p>\u201cWould you ever consider drinking from another part of my body?\u201d</p><p>There were lots of places we could use but I loved her neck because I had great access to her mouth. \u201cDo you have something in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She casts her eyes down. \u201cWould you be willing to try it next time?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s nervous. And it\u2019s adorable. \u201cI will try any place you want. All you have to do is ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I want to experiment next time.\u201d She kisses my mouth and tugs on my bottom lip with her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m taking vitamins because I want you to drink as much as you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy body no longer requires much. I already take more than I need because I\u2019m prolonging the way I feel you when your blood is entering my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ends too quickly.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s pouting. And again, it\u2019s adorable. \u201cLonger isn\u2019t safe for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t feel the loss at all. I\u2019m a blood jewel. I can withstand losing a greater volume of blood than the average human.\u201d</p><p>She could have a point. She tolerated chronic large volume loss when she was with Vincent. \u201cI suppose you could be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to think about amending our agreement.\u201d</p><p>We only had one pact so I knew exactly what she meant. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try two days instead of three.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t into bending rules when it came to her health and safety. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think about it. Please. For me.\u201d</p><p>I swear she can talk me into anything. I wonder if she knows that. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d A huge grin forms on her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will.\u201d</p><p>She seems so sure of herself. \u201cOkay, Miss know-it-all. I have something for you.\u201d This thing I was about to do made me nervous as hell. It could go really well or really bad.</p><p>Her eyes gleam like those of a hopeful child. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous. What is it?\u201d</p><p>I use my feet to roll the chair a bit so I can lean over and reach into the desk drawer to my left. \u201cFirst, you have to close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She does as I ask while nibbling her bottom lip. I think it\u2019s her attempt to stop the smile threatening to spread across her face. Her effort is unsuccessful because she\u2019s grinning despite her best effort.</p><p>I dangle her surprise in front of her. \u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s given up the fight and is beaming when she opens her eyes. \u201cI love sur ...\u201d She stops mid-sentence as she sees the white gold butterfly dangling from my fingers. \u201cMy pendant.\u201d She reaches out to touch it. \u201cI thought it was lost forever. Where did you find it?\u201d</p><p>Here came the tricky part. I didn\u2019t know if she would be angry with me for taking it from her the first night we met. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be mad? You just returned my most cherished treasure to me.\u201d She\u2019s holding it to her chest, close to her heart.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t just find it. I took it from your neck after Vincent made me drink from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted a keepsake so I could remember how you made me feel. I know it was wrong but I had no idea how special it was to you when I slipped it off your neck. I didn\u2019t know it was a gift from your mother. Then Curry told me how you made him go back into Vincent\u2019s to look for it and I knew what a huge mistake I had made. And then it seemed like you hated me after you came home with Curry so there was never a good time to return it to you. Until now.\u201d</p><p>She takes the necklace from her chest and stares at it in her palm. She\u2019s silent and I\u2019m on the verge of asking her if she\u2019s angry when she lifts her face and tears are rolling down each of her cheeks. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d react. I was so afraid you\u2019d be angry at me.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could ever be angry with you.\u201d She passes the necklace back to me and lifts her hair. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I fasten the clasp so the butterfly is returned to its rightful place in the dip of Avery\u2019s throat and I\u2019m reminded of the old saying. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let it go but it still came back so that means it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Two days. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since I drank from Avery. And I don\u2019t want to wait another day. Correction\u2013I can\u2019t wait another day. I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll make it until dawn with the way I\u2019ve had my baby doll on my mind all night. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sneaking into her bedroom at three in the morning instead of waiting a couple of hours for the others to go down for the day.</p><p>She\u2019s sleeping. And dreaming. She\u2019s having a pleasant one and I wonder what it\u2019s about. I hate to wake her from it but I\u2019m greedy this morning. I want her. Now.</p><p>I place my hand over her mouth before I turn on her bedside lamp. Her eyes pop open and I hear her muffled scream beneath my hand. I place a single finger from my free hand over my lips and she understands because she quietens down.</p><p>Her heart is still pounding hard\u2013although she realizes it\u2019s me\u2013because I\u2019ve just scared the shit out of her. I wish I could give her an explanation but I can\u2019t without the others overhearing so I tug on her hands to pull her out of bed. It\u2019s a gesture she understands.</p><p>I grasp her hand as I lead her out of her bedroom and we\u2019re silent as we walk toward my office. I close the door once we\u2019re inside and we\u2019re cut off from the rest of the house. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you but there was no other way to wake you. I had to cover your mouth because I knew you\u2019d scream if I didn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looks at the clock on the wall and I recognize her confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I take her hands in mine and pull her to me. I wrap my arms around her and kiss the side of her neck just below her ear. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait another minute to see you. I miss having you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm ... I miss being in your arms.\u201d She leans into me and my mouth finds hers but this kiss is different from any we\u2019ve shared before. This one is urgent. And needy.</p> <p>I trail my mouth down her neck but remember our conversation about trying a different spot next time I fed. \u201cYou mentioned trying a new place the next time I drank from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo three day wait?\u201d Her voice is breathy. And desperate.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t wait another day. I need to be with you. To feel you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands find mine and she walks backwards toward my desk. She hops up after pushing some papers aside and slides her silk gown up her legs to reveal her thighs. I can\u2019t stop my eyes from following the black silk as it rises. She points to her femoral artery in the bend of her leg. \u201cI thought you might like to try this one.\u201d</p><p>I stand there speechless as I swallow hard. I\u2019ve drunk from the femoral of others many times and it never phased me. Until now. I was definitely feeling excited about the prospect of drinking from Avery\u2019s thigh.</p> <p>She looks sad when I don\u2019t reply. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>I step closer and put my arms around her. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, baby doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is. \u201cI have so many new emotions when I\u2019m with you but I don\u2019t know what any of them mean.\u201d</p><p>She pulls away so she can see my face. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>There it is again. That smell. My mind goes to mush every time it comes around. \u201cNo. Right now I want my mouth on you.\u201d I drop to my knees in front of Avery. I grasp her thighs and pull her across my desk until her bottom is on the edge. She releases her gown and grasps the corner of the desk because she\u2019s afraid of falling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let you fall. Ever.\u201d</p> <p>She relaxes and releases her grip. I\u2019m looking up at her from where I\u2019m kneeling between her knees and she reaches out to run one of her hands through the top of my hair. \u201cI\u2019m falling ... but in a different kind of way.\u201d</p><p>I kiss the top of her knee. \u201cSo I\u2019m not the only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>I move up and kiss the inside of her thigh. \u201cGood. I\u2019m happy to hear that.\u201d She opens her legs to give me full access and I\u2019m taken over by the scent as I kiss her higher on the inside of her opposite leg. I place my lips against the pulsation in the bend of her leg but look up at her face before piercing it. \u201cThis is a big vessel. It bleeds fast and hard once I puncture it so I want you to tell me if you feel woozy at all while I\u2019m drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLean back and rest on your elbows. It\u2019ll be more comfortable if your leg isn\u2019t bent so much.\u201d</p><p>She repositions and I\u2019m wishing we were in her bedroom instead of this office. But that isn\u2019t safe this time of night. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p> <p>I push the edge of her underwear up for better access to her artery and see that her skin is bare and smooth beneath her black satin panties. It\u2019s not at all what I was expecting. That\u2019s when I realize I actually had expectations so I\u2019m forced to admit I have been thinking about her body entirely more than what any vampire would consider normal. And it certainly wasn\u2019t natural to be thinking about her body beneath her panties.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She has a concerned look on her face and I sense her worry but I\u2019m not certain what sparked it. Perhaps it\u2019s the look on my face and she\u2019s afraid I\u2019ve changed my mind.</p><p>\u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d I kiss her groin again. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just a little surprised by this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy what?\u201d She has no idea what I\u2019m referring to.</p><p>I divert my eyes toward her panties. \u201cYou\u2019re smooth there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blushes crimson. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>Why would a man not like it? \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I just wasn\u2019t expecting it. I\u2019m surprised. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>It most definitely could be a problem but not for the reasons she suspects. I like it far more than I should\u2013just like everything else about her. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She leans back again. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want anything distracting you.\u201d</p><p>Was she kidding me? It wasn\u2019t possible to not be distracted by what was a mere two inches to the right of my nose and mouth.</p><p>I shook my head as if to clear its preoccupation and then sank my teeth into the vessel that would bring me and Avery as close as two people could possibly be. It\u2019s like a geyser\u2013both the blood and the link we are sharing. Large gushes of Avery\u2019s blood pulsate into my mouth after I withdraw my teeth so I swallow fast. I knew this artery would be generous but I had forgotten how much so until the force of the first surge hits my tongue.</p><p>The tie occurring between us is different this time. It\u2019s much more powerful than anything we\u2019ve experienced thus far. I\u2019m uncertain if it\u2019s because I\u2019m taking in a larger volume of blood at a faster rate or if it\u2019s ... something else. I\u2019m able to go deeper into her mind than ever before and that\u2019s when I see the depth of her affection for me. She loves me in a way I didn\u2019t know was possible. Unconditionally.</p><p>It\u2019s overwhelming. And it scares the hell out of me. We shouldn\u2019t be doing this.</p><p>I jerk away from Avery and blood gushes from her wound, streaming down her leg to form a puddle on the floor. She sits up on my desk and looks down at the spurt coming from the bend of her leg. Her confusion is unmistakable. I would see it in her expression even if I didn\u2019t know it from the union our minds and hearts share.</p><p>I\u2019ve yanked the rug from beneath her. And I feel terrible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I lower my mouth to her groin to stop the hemorrhage. I\u2019m glad I must use it to close the two bleeding punctures because it gives me an excuse to not explain the way I just freaked out. But it\u2019s only temporary.</p><p>I can\u2019t look at her face when I finish. I don\u2019t want to see the perplexity in her eyes. Nor do I want her to see the shame in mine.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the large puddle of blood on the wood flooring of my office. \u201cI should wipe this up before the others smell it.\u201d</p><p>I step away from her so I can grab a towel from the bathroom but she places her hand on my lower arm and stops me. She isn\u2019t letting me get away without talking this over first. \u201cThat was different. And extremely intense.\u201d</p><p>I find comfort in hearing her admit that it was a powerful experience for her as well but I still feel like I owe her an explanation for my reaction. \u201cYour blood flowed more forcefully than I expected. I didn\u2019t remember how quickly that vessel would bleed out and yours seemed to be gushing.\u201d She knows I\u2019m using that as an excuse for my response but it isn\u2019t the part she wants me to clarify. \u201cIt was startling to be so deep within your mind. I wasn\u2019t prepared for it and then I worried it was happening because I was taking too much blood.\u201d</p><p>She brushes her fingers through my hair as she watches my eyes. \u201cYou have to stop being afraid and enjoy the things we do.\u201d</p><p>I never want her to think I don\u2019t cherish her. \u201cEnjoy doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how much I relish our relationship and the way we come together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Can we agree that what\u2019s happening between us is beautiful\u2013and that it\u2019s a gift\u2013so we should treat it as such and stop feeling guilty about taking pleasure in one another?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. Avery is right. And she is what makes this beautiful. She is the gift. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re starting to see things my way.\u201d She grabs my hands and pulls me closer. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t wait to see what happens when we do this again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to think I could be addicted to Avery.</p><p>We originally agreed I would drink from her every three days. Three quickly became two. That decision lasted no time at all before it progressed to daily. Now, we\u2019re stealing every possible moment behind closed doors.</p><p>And I\u2019m waiting to get caught any day now. It\u2019s only a matter of time.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long night\u2013too damn long\u2013but dawn is finally approaching. The others have gone to bed for the day with the exception of Curry and Chansey. They\u2019re trying to keep the babies on a normal routine sleep schedule. But it doesn\u2019t matter. They have soundproof sleeping quarters and Curry no longer has the ability to hear or smell like he once did.</p><p>Avery and I are safe to do whatever we want with one another this morning\u2013and there\u2019s a whole lot I\u2019d like to do with her. Things are progressively becoming more and more heated each time we\u2019re together. I\u2019m still not sure what\u2019s happening between us but I don\u2019t have to understand what it is for me to be able to enjoy it. I only know I never want it to stop.</p><p>We\u2019ve outgrown my office. There\u2019s only so much we can do in there and I think we\u2019re both ready to explore other avenues of this bizarre relationship we have.</p><p>I slowly open Avery\u2019s bedroom door and see her sit up in her bed as I come inside. I lock the door behind me because we need no interruptions or surprises even if the others are asleep or preoccupied with taking care of babies.</p><p>There\u2019s just enough light spilling into the room that I can see her smile. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never come.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s very alert for someone just waking up. \u201cYou haven\u2019t slept tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried but I couldn\u2019t. All I could do was think about being with you this morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s blushing and we both know why. We\u2019re staying in her bedroom for the first time instead of going to my office. \u201cIt\u2019s been the only thing on my mind all night as well.\u201d</p><p>She scoots toward the center of the bed and tosses the comforter back before she pats the mattress.</p><p>Our meetings had become longer and more frequent but they\u2019d never taken place in a bed. Those kinds of encounters only happen in my imagination and right now I want nothing more than to lie next to her. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>Her heart is hammering inside her chest as she smiles sheepishly and nods. There\u2019s no way I could resist an invitation like that from her.</p><p>I slide into bed next to her and she snuggles against me firmly as I use my arm to pull her closer. Being in bed with a woman is new to me. I have no idea if Avery has ever shared a bed with a man but the thought of her doing so ignites a pang of jealousy. \u201cHave you done this before?\u201d Wow. That sort of sounded like I was climbing into bed with her so we could have sex.</p><p>She snuggles closer. \u201cYou mean lie in bed with a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It comes out as a whisper.</p><p>She giggles. \u201cNo. I realize how unbelievable that sounds in this day and time. I\u2019ve never been in love so I wouldn\u2019t have a reason to be in bed with a man if I didn\u2019t love him.\u201d</p> <p>Thank the gods. \u201cI wasn\u2019t raised during these times so it isn\u2019t unbelievable to me.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her head from my chest. \u201cHave you ever shared a bed with a woman?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s watching my eyes. I think she\u2019s doing it because she wants to make sure I\u2019m being truthful but she\u2019d realize it was unnecessary if she thought about it. I can\u2019t lie to her. She\u2019d feel it through our bond. \u201cWhen I was human, a man didn\u2019t share a bed with a woman unless she was his wife or a whore\u2013neither of which I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>My virginal status makes her grin. \u201cI was going to ask if you had ever been married but I guess the virgin thing rules that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was betrothed to a woman when I was turned by Thatcher. Her name was Lisette.\u201d I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to tell her what happened. I\u2019ve shared the story with so few people but I want to tell her for some reason. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what was happening to me during the change and I revealed myself as a vampire to her. She begged me to change her after the shock wore off\u2013so I tried\u2013 but it didn\u2019t end well for her. I still don\u2019t understand what went wrong. I drained her and she drank my blood. It should have worked but instead of giving her immortality, I killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d Her voice is sad.</p> <p>Here I go. I\u2019m going to tell her how I feel although I suspect she already knows. It could be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. Or the worst. \u201cI thought I did ... until I met you.\u201d</p><p>Her expression becomes very serious as her heart speeds. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I rise from lying on my back and roll so Avery is pinned beneath me. I prop my elbows on each side of her head and cradle her face in my hands. \u201cDammit! I know I\u2019m not supposed to but I can\u2019t help myself. I love you, Avery. With all my heart and soul, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She isn\u2019t shocked so I was right. She knew all along. \u201cI love you too.\u201d Her hands slide through the back of my hair and she pulls my mouth down to hers so she can plant soft kisses but they quickly become fast and urgent, causing my head to spin.</p><p>My mouth leaves hers and I start a path of kisses down her neck. Her hands move from my hair to my shoulders and then down my back. Her breathing turns to panting\u2013much like my own\u2013and I feel her tugging upward on my shirt. I reach over my head with one hand and grab it by the neck. One smooth pull is all it takes to get it off and I toss it out of the way onto the floor.</p><p>She places her palms on my bare chest and rubs her thumbs in circular motions over my nipples. Her touch causes them to become hard and I can\u2019t resist the urge to look down at them. Whoa ... that\u2019s never happened\u2013at least not while I\u2019ve been a vampire.</p><p>I lower myself and return to kissing Avery\u2019s neck when her sweet intoxicating scent floods my senses. \u201cYou smell so good.\u201d I move my mouth lower and push the top of her nightgown down so I can kiss her breasts.</p><p>I hear Avery moan when she arches her back from the bed and she brings her legs up to wrap around my waist. \u201cMmm ... ohh. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>Not a chance of that happening.</p><p>I migrate further south and this time I push the bottom of her gown above her hips so I can place kisses against her flat stomach. She\u2019s squirming hard beneath me so I grasp her hips and dip my tongue into her bellybutton. \u201cOh ... oh ... oh.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m right there hovering above what seems to be the source of her intoxicating scent. I press my nose to the waistband of her panties and draw a deep breath before I lift my face to look at Avery. She knows this is me asking permission without uttering a word so she lifts her bottom from the bed. \u201cTake \u2018em off.\u201d</p><p>I slide my fingers into the skinny bands on each of her hips and pull the two tiny triangles down her legs so they can be added to my shirt on the floor. She sits up and wiggles until she has her gown up and over her head before she reaches for the tie of my linen sleep pants. Once they\u2019re gone, I lower my naked body against hers and I covet the feel of her warmth against me.</p><p>She parts her legs again, this time without a barrier between our bodies. It\u2019s simultaneously the most amazing feeling I\u2019ve ever experienced while being the scariest and most confusing moment of my existence. I remember the mechanics of what happens when a man desires a woman but I\u2019m puzzled by the whys. This hasn\u2019t happened since I was human. And it shouldn\u2019t be happening now.</p><p>She wiggles beneath me until my erection is positioned at her entrance. \u201cDo it. I want you to.\u201d</p><p>This is something I never thought I\u2019d hear a woman say to me. I feel like I have the physical ability but what if I\u2019m wrong? \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can. Vampires aren\u2019t supposed to be able to do this.\u201d</p><p>She rocks her body against mine, testing the water. \u201cI believe you can. Unless you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>How can she think I don\u2019t want this with her? \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not that. I want to. Bad. Don\u2019t think for one second I don\u2019t. And I feel like I can but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m wrong and I don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her hips to coax me. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. We were made for this. I\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way I\u2019m taking the time to ponder why I suddenly have the ability to do something vampires aren\u2019t supposed to be capable of doing. I\u2019m not ruining this moment with her.</p><p>I push against her body and enter slowly. Her eyes are squeezed tightly and her hands are clenched around my biceps as I go deeper. She gasps against my ear and her entire body tenses\u2013a clear indicator of the pain I\u2019m causing\u2013so I become motionless. She kisses the space below my ear before she whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m hurting you,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>She brings her legs up around my waist. \u201cYou\u2019re not. And you never would.\u201d She tightens the grip of her legs and squeezes until I\u2019m fully inside her. \u201cI want you. And I want this.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t deny her if I tried. I\u2019m powerless to stop what is happening between us. It feels as though something else is in control of my body\u2013and while it\u2019s utterly amazing\u2013what\u2019s happening in my head isn\u2019t any less astonishing. \u201cI love you so much, Avery.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m moving above her and she reaches up to touch my face with her fingertips. \u201cI love you too, Sol.\u201d</p><p>I lower myself to kiss this woman but her lips aren\u2019t enough. I want my mouth all over her. I want to taste her skin. And her blood.</p><p>Although I\u2019ve drunk from her regularly the past few weeks, I\u2019ve never wanted her blood before this moment. It was the experience that accompanied drinking from her. But the desire building within me is different.</p><p>I fight the desire I feel to lower my mouth to the throbbing pulsation in her neck. I don\u2019t want to ruin this beautiful thing happening but the hunger for her blood is overpowering. As hard as I try, I can\u2019t ignore the craving.</p><p>I turn and press my face into my inner arm to keep from biting her neck. \u201cSomething is happening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I feel it too.\u201d She hooks her hands around my neck and pulls me closer. She locks her ankles behind my waist while arching her back from the bed and her neck is completely exposed as she turns her head. \u201cI want to feed both of your hungers.\u201d</p><p>Is she telling me to bite her? \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to drink my blood while you make love to me.\u201d</p><p>Another wave of her scent floods me and all self-control is lost as I put my mouth over the pulsation of her jugular. Her lush vein thumps against my lip as my incisors lengthen and then it\u2019s done. I taste her blood in my mouth.</p><p>I greedily drink from this woman I adore. Nothing is comparable to this\u2013what I\u2019m sharing with Avery right now. I\u2019ve never experienced anything so intense. Or loving. Ever.</p><p>I\u2019m experiencing the best of both worlds. My body is in full-blown ecstasy and it\u2019s far better than anything I experienced as a vampire\u2013even my first taste of blood. I thought nothing could top that. But it has. Making love to Avery tops any and everything.</p><p>I have a fast track directly linked to her emotions. I have no doubt about the depth of her feelings for me as we make love. Her affection feels much like a bubble growing until I think it\u2019ll burst. The purity of her love is so unexpected.</p><p>I take a part of her body into my own as I drink from her but I give her a part of mine as well when I empty myself inside her for the first time. She relaxes her legs around my waist and I seal the wound on her neck. I\u2019m too stunned to move so I\u2019m still hovering above her but I can see the astonishment in her eyes. \u201cWowww.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gain some composure and roll off of her to my back. \u201cYeah ... wow.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re lying on our backs but looking at one another. \u201cI thought vampires didn\u2019t make love.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m at a loss. \u201cThey don\u2019t. Ever. Nor do they have the desire to.\u201d</p> <p>Her hand finds mine and she squeezes it. \u201cWell we did and it wasn\u2019t just sex. It was something else as well. Did you feel it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not experienced in the sex department but even I know that wasn\u2019t a normal act of intimacy. \u201cYes. There was definitely more to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d I hear the worry in her voice but I never want her to be frightened to tell me anything.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She breathes in deeply and her lips puff out as she exhales. \u201cI sensed your existence long before the night you came to Vincent\u2019s. I\u2019ve felt your presence for as long as I can remember. I\u2019ve always known someone was missing from my life but I didn\u2019t know who until our eyes met through that crowd of vampires at Vincent\u2019s. I knew you were the one I had been waiting for my entire life.\u201d</p> <p>Am I wrong about why I\u2019m so beguiled by her? It\u2019s not because she\u2019s a blood jewel? \u201cI was drawn to you the second I laid eyes on you. I wanted to rescue and protect you but I had no idea why. It almost killed me to walk out of that house without you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes and smiles. \u201cDo you feel that? What\u2019s happening between us right now?\u201d</p><p>I know exactly what she\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s our special connection\u2013the intense one we feel while I\u2019m drinking directly from her. This is the strongest it\u2019s ever been. \u201cYes. I feel how happy\u2013but confused\u2013you are right now.\u201d</p><p>She opens her eyes and her brow wrinkles in confusion. \u201cAnd I sense the same about you but you don\u2019t seem quite as confused as me. I think you understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d call it hopeful suspicion. \u201cDo you have a birthmark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but what does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p> <p>My hope gains momentum. \u201cI need to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She rises to a sitting position and rolls her left shoulder forward. Her right arm crosses her chest and she reaches around to point at her upper shoulder blade. \u201cRight here. But I must tell you that it\u2019s the most peculiar looking birthmark you\u2019ll ever see. It looks like an albino butterfly.\u201d</p><p>And there it is\u2013a most beloved sight. It\u2019s what I wanted to see more than anything in the world. I think it\u2019s the proof of what I suspect. I can\u2019t stop the happy laughter erupting from my lips as I reach out to touch it. \u201cOh, Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I playfully push her down onto the bed and climb over her. I grasp her face and kiss her hard before looking into her eyes. \u201cThis may sound crazy but I think you\u2019re my ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Curry and Sebastian are looking at me from across my desk as they wait to hear the reason I\u2019ve asked them to join me in my office. How do I do this? I haven\u2019t a clue. How do I dare to explain how I\u2019ve been secretly drinking from Avery for weeks? Or worse\u2013what happened between us in her bedroom this morning?</p><p>Worse is the wrong choice of words. If she\u2019s my ag\u00e1pe then what happened was natural. And inevitable. But what if I\u2019m wrong and she\u2019s not what I think she is?</p> <p>Sitting here in silence is becoming awkward. I don\u2019t know how to start this conversation so I\u2019m glad when Curry finally asks, \u201cIs everything all right with you?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ll see if it is after I get their verdict. \u201cSomething has happened. It\u2019s quite serious and it may or may not cause you both to be extremely angry with me.\u201d</p><p>They glance at one another and a quick look passes between them before they turn back to me. For a moment I\u2019m afraid they already know everything that\u2019s been happening between me and Avery but I decide it\u2019s my guilty conscience causing me to jump to conclusions.</p><p>Curry clears his throat. \u201cYou can tell us anything. We won\u2019t judge.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d see about that. \u201cI love Avery. I have from the first moment I saw her but I didn\u2019t realize it was affection that I was feeling. I assumed her blood was siren-like and was calling out to me because I hadn\u2019t drunk it. But then Curry brought her here and I realized he wasn\u2019t being drawn to her the way I was.\u201d</p><p>This catches Sebastian\u2019s attention because he sits up and appears very interested. \u201cAnd you felt this way about her before you drank her blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I discovered something strange while drinking from her that night. Her blood didn\u2019t appeal to me at all but the act of drinking from her was ... beautiful. We connected on an entirely different level. It was like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. And afterwards\u2013I could still feel her.\u201d I place my hand over my heart. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a moment I haven\u2019t felt her right here since that night.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian is rubbing his chin, as he tends to do when he\u2019s mulling something over in his mind. \u201cHave you and Avery discussed this?\u201d</p><p>And the plot thickens. \u201cNot until a few weeks ago. I\u2019ve spent the last few months believing she was terrified of me. She always seemed so nervous and her heart was always pounding erratically every time we were close. Turns out I was wrong about why. She came to me the night I announced I was leaving and asked me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was several weeks ago and you haven\u2019t said a word about it,\u201d Curry says.</p><p>This was where things could go downhill fast. \u201cWe agreed that something special happened between us when I drank from her but neither of us understood what it was. She wanted to explore it more\u2013and so did I\u2013so she asked me to make her my blood doll.\u201d</p><p>Curry closes his eyes and rubs his lids with his hand. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>It was time to admit what I\u2019d been doing. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make her my blood whore but it\u2019s what she wanted and I find it impossible to deny her the things she asks of me. I must admit it\u2019s what I wanted too so I started drinking from her.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s expression is calm and collected as always. \u201cI guess that explains why you stopped taking blood from the swans at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery wanted to be the only one.\u201d Wanted isn\u2019t the right word. Insisted would be a much better fit.</p><p>\u201cHow often do you drink from her?\u201d Sebastian asks.</p><p>\u201cIt was every three days in the beginning.\u201d</p><p>He lifts a brow and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because he\u2019s reading into the last part of my admission. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice daily.\u201d I feel like I should defend myself. \u201cBut I don\u2019t do it for her blood. We do it for the connection we share while I\u2019m drinking. The blood just happens to be part of it.\u201d I hear my words and realize how much I sound like a junkie in denial.</p><p>Curry looks ready to explode. And then he does. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been doing this for weeks. You\u2019re addicted to her. You knew there was a chance this could happen and you chose to take the risk because you think something special happened. Well something happened all right. You got yourself addicted to a blood jewel and now you\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t have a clue about the relationship Avery and I share. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is exactly like that.\u201d He\u2019s scoffing. And it pisses me off.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I went to Avery in her bedroom this morning and something else happened as well.\u201d They\u2019re both looking at me waiting for the rest of the story. \u201cThings became ... physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical?\u201d Curry asks. \u201cYou mean she tried to fight you off when you were drinking from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was the kind of physical act involving a man and a woman.\u201d They\u2019re obviously not catching on but I shouldn\u2019t expect them to. There\u2019s no reason they would put the pieces together. \u201cWe made love the way a human man and human woman do except I drank from her while it was happening. I don\u2019t know what it is but something even greater transpired. Now we have an even stronger connection. I\u2019m able to feel her emotions almost like I can read her mind.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian nods while wearing a solemn expression. \u201cAnd she can feel your emotions as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as strongly.\u201d I\u2019m about to unveil the final piece of evidence and I pray they will confirm I\u2019m not imagining this. I want Avery as my ag\u00e1pe. I have to have her. There is no alternative. \u201cShe bears the mark of Anteros like Chansey but it\u2019s white instead of brown.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian looks at Curry and then back to me. \u201cElla\u2019s was deep red, the color of port-wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Avery my ag\u00e1pe?\u201d I prepare for the worst but will settle for nothing less than an affirmative.</p><p>Sebastian looks amused. \u201cDo you really have to ask?\u201d</p><p>I believe that\u2019s the confirmation I desperately want but I\u2019m afraid to jump to conclusions. \u201cI made her mine but I need to know if she\u2019s intended for me. If she isn\u2019t, another vampire could try to take her from me but I won\u2019t allow it. I will never be parted from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about ag\u00e1pes but I don\u2019t believe you could have claimed Avery as your own if she wasn\u2019t intended for you byAnteros. You\u2019ve completed the final stage of the bond with her. You couldn\u2019t have done that if she wasn\u2019t yours. You might not have had the typical introduction or early relationship but every event was part of the plan to bring Avery Ferrand into your life. She is your destiny.\u201d</p><p>He confirms my suspicion and it\u2019s a huge relief. \u201cAnd I am hers.\u201d</p><p>I can tell that he\u2019s happy for me. \u201cYes. You\u2019re her protector and will do anything to maintain her safety. You\u2019ll gladly die to keep her from harm.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I am her shield from danger and I already have my first task in mind. \u201cOr kill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Sol, but get it out of your head. Vincent has no idea where Avery is. She\u2019s safe from him so you shouldn\u2019t go looking for trouble.\u201d Curry knows me so well. Sometimes a little too well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going looking for trouble.\u201d I won\u2019t be the one with a problem because I won\u2019t be the one to die. \u201cI\u2019m simply going to introduce that bastard to his true death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop and think about this before acting out irrationally,\u201d Curry says. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thinking of my safety but he above anyone else should understand my reasoning.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give it the same amount of consideration he did when he made the decision to run a stake through Marsala\u2019s chest. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing irrational about wanting to protect my ag\u00e1pe. Didn\u2019t you do the same when you killed Marsala?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsala was an imminent danger to my wife and children.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m immediately pissed. I won\u2019t allow him to play the marriage card and make my relationship with Avery seem less important because he has chosen to observe a mundane tradition. \u201cSo Avery deserves less protection because we aren\u2019t joined in matrimony according to human law?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s holding his hands up defensively. \u201cI would never suggest that Avery deserves less. I\u2019m only pointing out that Marsala was not going to stop until she killed Chansey so she could have me and the babies. My only choice was to kill her.\u201d</p><p>He only had to think about this for one second to understand my predicament. \u201cSo please understand that I have no choice but to kill Vincent because he won\u2019t stop looking for Avery until he has her back in his clutches. You have no idea the torture she suffered by his hand. I know everything she endured and trust me. The world would be a better place without him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we all agree that he needs to die but I tend to side with Curry on the issue. She is safe from Vincent for now so you have to leave it alone. It\u2019s too risky. He and a large number of vampires are desperate to have her back. I don\u2019t dare to imagine what might happen if you found him and things didn\u2019t go well.\u201d I\u2019m a little hurt to hear Sebastian admit he has so little faith in my abilities. \u201cYou have an ag\u00e1pe to consider. You can\u2019t protect her if Vincent kills you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m left with a different feeling when I consider Avery\u2019s fate if things didn\u2019t end well for me.</p><p>Curry\u2019s grinning. \u201cAnd speaking of protection. I\u2019m feeling certain you didn\u2019t use any with Avery this morning when you completed your bond with her.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. The thought of birth control couldn\u2019t have been further from my mind but Curry\u2019s right. His children were the living proof of what was possible between a vampire and his ag\u00e1pe. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly something we talked about or planned so the thought never crossed our minds.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s laughing. \u201cI have two little results of what happens when it doesn\u2019t cross your mind and now you could as well.\u201d</p><p>Our circumstances were different. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an eclipse.\u201d</p> <p>Curry shrugs. \u201cWho says there has to be? We don\u2019t know that for certain. That was only a guess.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m throwing anything out there I can come up with. \u201cChansey conceived because you became more human than vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think you aren\u2019t? What about your days and nights being mixed up? That\u2019s been happening for a while. Have you tried to walk in the sun?\u201d</p><p>Curry\u2019s out of his mind if he thinks I\u2019d be so foolish to attempt that bonehead move again. \u201cNo way. I haven\u2019t had a reason to try that again. I almost fried my hand off in Pascagoula in case you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d I still can\u2019t believe I was foolish enough to think Chansey\u2019s friend Shelby could be my ag\u00e1pe.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have Avery in your life then,\u201d Curry argues.</p><p>His argument isn\u2019t supported by his experience with his ag\u00e1pe. \u201cBut you were able to walk in sunlight from the moment Chansey was born.\u201d</p><p>Curry gestures for Sebastian to take the floor. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to tolerate the sun until Ella became a presence in my life. I think we each have our own circumstances and limitations.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s ag\u00e1pe didn\u2019t become pregnant but they weren\u2019t together long when she died. It\u2019s very possible she could have been expecting when she fell from her horse and broke her neck. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a thought that has plagued Sebastian\u2019s mind more than once since we first learned pregnancy was a possibility.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m anxious and want to know this second\u2013which is impossible. \u201cHow long will it be before Avery and I will know if she\u2019s pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChansey was a couple of months along when we confirmed her pregnancy but I\u2019m certain she would have figured it out sooner had we known it was a possibility. You at least have that luxury.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So we wait and see if her cycle is late. If it is, she takes a pregnancy test and we\u2019ll know.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>I\u2019m walking the hall toward Avery\u2019s bedroom and I can feel each step closing the gap between us. Her scent becomes stronger. Her presence within me is more pronounced. She\u2019s anxious\u2013so much so that it\u2019s almost overwhelming\u2013but I don\u2019t have to guess why. She\u2019s dying to know the verdict\u2013if she\u2019s my ag\u00e1pe or not.</p><p>Before I\u2019m able to knock, she opens her bedroom door. We beam at one another and don\u2019t exchange a single word but she knows the truth simply by feeling my overwhelming happiness.</p><p>She is my ag\u00e1pe and I am her intended.</p><p>She steps closer and places one of her hands against my face. I close my eyes and lean into her palm. I crave her warm touch\u2013because it soothes me\u2013and she strokes her thumb over my cheekbone. I place my hand on top of hers and press it against my cool skin. \u201cHello, my ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p><p>She breathes a sigh of relief with my confirmation. I know that\u2019s what it is because I feel her rapid decline of anxiety. But it\u2019s not completely gone. Can she sense the fear I have about a potential pregnancy? I\u2019m trying to push my angst aside but I don\u2019t have the hang of these shared emotions yet.</p><p>I\u2019m not upset about the possibility of a baby. I\u2019m not even uneasy about the prospect of having one so soon. In fact, I\u2019m quite happy about it but I\u2019m afraid Avery won\u2019t be. She\u2019s young\u2013even by human standards\u2013and I\u2019m not sure a baby is something she wants at this point in her life.</p><p>She takes my hand and pulls me into her room before shutting the door. \u201cI want you to show me all the ways I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>I place my index finger to her lips. \u201cShh.\u201d I point to my ears and then in the direction of the others since she sometimes forgets about them when we\u2019re behind closed doors.</p><p>She nods, understanding my meaning. I lower my mouth and whisper softly in her ear. \u201cMy office.\u201d</p><p>She mouths the word, \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>I nod and she follows me out of her bedroom toward the only soundproof quarters available to us. I know she had something more romantic in mind to celebrate our news but she and I have to discuss our relationship before we can explore the other ways we belong to each other.</p><p>Her heart is pounding when I close the door. She\u2019s terrified. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>I want to put her at ease. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong but we need to talk about something I don\u2019t want the others to overhear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s only one place to start. The beginning. \u201cWe unknowingly completed our ag\u00e1pe bond this morning.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s filled with confusion. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll try to explain it the way I understand it. \u201cI\u2019ll no longer need to drink your blood for us to maintain an unbreakable connection. We\u2019ll feel it all the time but it\u2019ll be at its strongest when we make love.\u201d</p><p>She beams and slinks close to me. \u201cPerfect ... because I think I feel the need for some strong bonding right now.\u201d</p><p>As good as that sounds, I only want to proceed after I have informed consent from her. \u201cI need to explain some other things to you.\u201d She steps back so she can see my face. \u201cMy DNA has been dead since the night I was turned into a vampire but because you\u2019re my ag\u00e1pe, you make me more human. More alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of you as dead.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s good to know since I\u2019m about to drop this bomb on her. \u201cOnly life can bring forth life and you revive my dead cells so they may live again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been very much alive to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m able to see that she doesn\u2019t understand where I\u2019m going with this so I need to back up. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the ag\u00e1pe phenomenon. We don\u2019t understand the process but we know that ag\u00e1pe mates cause changes in vampires. We become more human. More alive. Sebastian and Ella weren\u2019t together long. The changes he underwent weren\u2019t near as radical as the ones Curry has experienced. We suspect that his profound changes are how Chansey was able to conceive. We haven\u2019t tested the waters to know the degree of the change in me yet but we must consider the possibility that you could become pregnant.\u201d</p><p>I almost think I can hear a click in her mind when she comprehends what I\u2019m saying. \u201cThis morning ...\u201d She clears her throat but only a whisper escapes. \u201cI could be pregnant because of this morning?\u201d</p><p>Her emotions are all over the place. What is she thinking? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure it would have mattered if I had. I don\u2019t think I would have been able to stop because it felt as though something else was in control of me when we completed our bond.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry.\u201d She steps closer and slides her arms around my shoulders. \u201cNot even a little. I love you and nothing would make me happier than having your baby.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve never discussed such things. We had no reason to so I couldn\u2019t guess where her head would be but I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by her reaction. \u201cI was scared you might be upset. Or angry. \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She comes up on her tiptoes and presses a kiss against the side of my neck. \u201cAngry? Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>She pushes her fingers through my hair and I almost forget what we\u2019re discussing. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter\u2013not if you\u2019re happy about it.\u201d</p><p>She lowers herself from her tiptoes and presses a second kiss against my collarbone. \u201cI am. But you know what would also make me very happy?\u201d</p> <p>All she has to do is tell me and I\u2019ll get it for her. \u201cYou only have to ask.\u201d</p><p>A mischievous grins spreads across her face. \u201cI want us to have a place we are free to do what we want without the fear of being overheard. I think we need a soundproof bedroom. Because I have a lot of naughty things I want to do to you.\u201d</p><p>I like the way this girl thinks. \u201cDone. I\u2019ll have someone here in the morning and we\u2019ll put a plan into action immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in desperate need of privacy.\u201d She\u2019s rubbing her hands over my chest. \u201cHow long will it be before we know?\u201d</p><p>Longer than I want. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think they can have it ready in about a month. Maybe six weeks if he uses his entire crew.\u201d I\u2019m willing to pay for an army of construction workers to get this done as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cFour to six weeks sounds great on the bedroom but I meant how long will it be until we know if I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cI think Chansey was a little bit over two months when she saw Dr. Knight the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was in the middle of following Jenn\u2019s transition. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t pick up on her missed period because she was preoccupied but I\u2019ll know if I\u2019m a day late. I\u2019m very regular.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been very regular since I\u2019d known her. \u201cYou should start your menstrual cycle in thirteen days.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to see her blush to know I\u2019ve embarrassed her. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>If I couldn\u2019t smell a drop of blood, I\u2019d have known by her irritable mood. \u201cI\u2019ve been living with you for months. You\u2019re a fertile human woman that bleeds every month. I\u2019m a vampire that can smell a single drop of blood from a hundred yards. I think you can put it together.\u201d</p> <p>Her cheeks redden more. \u201cThat\u2019s just humiliating. And gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your body inside and out\u2013even better than you know it yourself.\u201d Now I\u2019m gonna rock her world with the information I tell her next. \u201cI\u2019m even able to sense your ovulation cycle by the way you smell.\u201d</p><p>She steps back and assesses me, the blush still present on her face. Or maybe it\u2019s a flush. \u201cPray tell, Mister Alexander. How do I smell when I\u2019m ovulating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy. And horny.\u201d Now it\u2019s me pressing my lips against the side of her neck. \u201cA lot like you smell right now.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth is next to my ear. \u201cAnd did I smell fertile this morning?\u201d</p><p>Oh, did she ever. \u201cYou smelled especially fertile this morning\u2013much more so than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d she whispers as I move my mouth down her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re like this, your ag\u00e1pe scent is the only smell I can detect. It\u2019s a pheromone that overpowers everything else.\u201d I lift her to sit on my desk and I step between her legs.</p> <p>Her hands are allover me at once. \u201cAnd it makes you want me?\u201d</p><p>Want is an understatement. \u201cLike crazy. You can\u2019t possibly imagine how bad.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s grinning as she nips my bottom lip. \u201cI bet I can.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>We emerge from my office so we can make our formal announcement to the family but the looks on their faces when we enter the living room tell me they already suspect. Or know. I\u2019m sure they can tell that we just had sex. Her scent is all over me and vice versa. No way I\u2019m telling Avery that. She\u2019d die of mortification if she knew they smelled the mix of our body fluids.</p><p>The family is at full attention without our request. I take Avery\u2019s hand in mine and squeeze it. I\u2019m nervous but one stroke of her thumb gives me that little extra boost of confidence. It\u2019s amazing how she\u2019s always able to give me exactly what I need. \u201cAvery and I have an announcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you do.\u201d Thatcher is studying us and paying close attention to the way I\u2019m holding Avery\u2019s hand. \u201cDo tell, brother. I can tell this is gonna be good and I\u2019m dying of suspense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis may come as quite a surprise to everyone.\u201d I stop and look into her golden brown eyes before I finish and I see all the reassurance I need staring back at me. \u201cAvery is my ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p><p>Lairah is the first to react to our news. \u201cBut neither of you can stand to be in the same room.\u201d</p><p>Avery is quick to correct her. \u201cI\u2019m sure it has appeared that way but it\u2019s actually the opposite. We can\u2019t stand to be apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously since we can smell what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d Avery jerks her head around to look at her sister. Jenn\u2019s words are intended to wound and humiliate her but why? Perhaps she\u2019s angry that Avery didn\u2019t confide in her but that\u2019s no way to treat her sister. I\u2019m about to fire back when I feel her squeeze my hand. Her eyes tell me everything her mouth doesn\u2019t. Please don\u2019t. I give her a quick nod letting her know I understand, even if I don\u2019t agree. I\u2019m sure Avery would like to address Jenn in private and I\u2019ll give her that courtesy.</p><p>Lairah is still wearing a confused expression. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve acted like you hate each other for months. It\u2019s been uncomfortable as hell living with the two of you under the same roof and now you\u2019re telling us you\u2019re mates? Are you sure? It doesn\u2019t seem likely.\u201d</p><p>Avery leans into my side. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more certain of anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have known when you met her?\u201d Gia doesn\u2019t seem convinced.</p><p>Curry and Sebastian allow us to answer the family\u2019s questions without interference. \u201cThe circumstances weren\u2019t ideal when we met. She was a blood jewel and I drank from her. I thought everything I was feeling stemmed from the side effects of her blood. I had no idea what was actually happening. I spent months fighting my feelings for her because I thought she hated me. I never imagined the physical responses I sensed from her were really her body\u2019s reaction to her love for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as much a shock to us as it is to all of you.\u201d Avery\u2019s trying to smooth this over with her sister.</p><p>\u201cI somehow doubt that.\u201d Jenn is sitting on the couch, arms crossed. She\u2019s unhappy about our announcement but I don\u2019t understand why unless she doesn\u2019t want Avery mixed up with a vampire.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, Jenn. Really.\u201d Avery\u2019s voice is pleading.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Jenn\u2019s words are saturated with sarcasm before she streaks from the room toward the hallway to her bedroom.</p><p>I shrug and look at Avery for some kind of clue about what\u2019s going on with Jenn. \u201cI\u2019m lost. What was that all about?\u201d</p><p>Avery closes her eyes and sighs. \u201cShe\u2019s going to hate me for this.\u201d</p><p>I wish I could get a reading on the things running through her mind but it\u2019s racing a mile a minute. \u201cHate you for what?\u201d</p><p>She releases my hand and my skin instantly misses her touch. \u201cI need to talk to my sister. I have to try to make her understand.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m left standing dumbfounded\u2013without my ag\u00e1pe\u2013in front of everyone so I grab a seat on the sofa next to Lairah. \u201cDoes anyone have a clue what\u2019s going on with Jenn or why she\u2019s so angry with Avery?\u201d</p><p>Lairah punches me in the arm with her fist. \u201cSeriously? You don\u2019t have any idea? You\u2019re even stupider than I thought.\u201d</p><p>I rub my arm because it was a hard punch. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and huffs. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be a total idiot to not see that Jenn is in love with you. She\u2019s been showing you for months. I think you\u2019re the only one that hasn\u2019t picked up on it.\u201d</p><p>She has to be trying to pull one over on me. \u201cI never saw anything resembling that kind of interest from Jenn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSol had no idea.\u201d Sebastian is defending me. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t notice romantic interest from another woman. It isn\u2019t in his nature for any female to catch his attention because he only has eyes for his ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re all able to overhear the conversation going on down the hall. \u201cJenn\u2019s angry and I don\u2019t like the hurtful things she\u2019s saying to Avery.\u201d I have an intense need to protect her from being hurt\u2013even if it\u2019s only words being used by her sister.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to like anything that hurts your ag\u00e1pe but Avery and Jenn are sisters,\u201d Sebastian reminds me. \u201cYou must let them hash this out on their own just as you and Thatcher do when you have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Thatcher and I are both vampires. The worst we would do is beat the shit out of each other. \u201cJenn is a vampire and Avery isn\u2019t. She could kill her in a fraction of a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying they won\u2019t argue but Jenn\u2019s stable and she loves her sister very much. She\u2019d never harm her physically.\u201d Their argument is quickly escalating so I stalk toward the hallway leading to Jenn\u2019s bedroom. Sebastian calls out, \u201cSisters do this. It\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d agree with Sebastian if Jenn was human. But she\u2019s not and all of her emotions are multiplied ten-fold. \u201cSorry but I\u2019m not chancing it. If Jenn goes after Avery, I can\u2019t protect her if I\u2019m sitting in the living room twiddling my thumbs.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t knock. I burst through Jenn\u2019s bedroom door like I own the place\u2013because I do. This is my compound. Jenn is a guest here\u2013even if she is my agape\u2019s sister\u2013and I won\u2019t tolerate her hurting Avery even if it\u2019s only a verbal assault.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d It comes out as a growl\u2013which isn\u2019t my intention\u2013but I\u2019m in full-blown protection mode. I won\u2019t spare feelings when it comes to my mate. \u201cAvery had no idea she was my ag\u00e1pe. She\u2013nor I\u2013would ever intentionally hurt you. It\u2019s something we couldn\u2019t control. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t pick up on your feelings for me. I would have set you straight had I realized. My relationship with your sister isn\u2019t going away so you need to decide if you can stay here and deal with it or not. If you can\u2019t, you need to leave because I won\u2019t allow you to continue treating her like this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSol!\u201d Avery is angry with me for speaking to Jenn so harshly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Avery. He\u2019s right. I have no business being here. I never did but I don\u2019t plan on sticking around and continuing to be anyone\u2019s problem.\u201d Jenn streaks from the room and out the front door. I immediately feel the pain in Avery\u2019s heart. I want to comfort her but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be welcome.</p><p>Shit. What have I done?</p> <p>I have to try to make this right. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby doll. I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go after her.\u201d Her voice\u2013and mind\u2013is drenched in panic. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to survive outside this compound yet.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand to my forehead and then push it back through my hair as the realization sets in. She\u2019s right. Jenn has been living in a bubble and has no idea how to get along on her own.</p><p>This is nothing but a mess\u2013a gigantic one. And I\u2019m its creator.</p><p>Avery grabs my face and forces me to look at her. \u201cStop it, Sol. I feel your guilt but this isn\u2019t your fault. Jenn is a hothead. She always has been but it\u2019s compounded now that she\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p> <p>The family\u2013minus Chansey and the babies\u2013enter Jenn\u2019s bedroom before I\u2019m able to reply. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll all pitch in to help find her,\u201d Gia says.</p><p>Avery walks toward the door. \u201cI need my jacket.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no. She can\u2019t possibly think I\u2019m letting her out of this compound at night. \u201cYou\u2019re not going out there.\u201d</p><p>I feel her preparing for a showdown. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I come? She\u2019s my family.\u201d</p><p>Avery and I are a team but I\u2019m forced to draw a line on how much say she gets when it comes to her safety. I\u2019m now the overbearing alpha male that will be calling all the shots. And it\u2019s going to piss her off royally. \u201cNo. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s frustrated but not furious as I anticipated. \u201cMy circumstances are never changing. I\u2019ll always be a blood jewel. Does that mean I\u2019m never going to be allowed out of the walls surrounding this compound?\u201d</p> <p>Sounds like a great plan to me. \u201cMaybe not if it keeps you safe.\u201d</p><p>Avery stands with her hands on her hips and her weight shifted to one foot. I\u2019ve seen Chansey in that same stance while angry with Curry and I can only wonder if it\u2019s a coincidence or some kind of ag\u00e1pe characteristic. \u201cI want to help find my sister.\u201d</p><p>I play the card I\u2019m certain will get through to her. \u201cI know you do but you\u2019ll only slow us down. We can find Jenn much faster if you stay here. Isn\u2019t that what you want? For us to find her as soon as possible?\u201d</p><p>I feel her conceding. \u201cI know you\u2019re right but I\u2019ll feel useless if I stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be of no use,\u201d Curry says. \u201cChansey will need your help with the babies while I\u2019m out. I can\u2019t go if you don\u2019t stay with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re needed here.\u201d I\u2019ll need to thank Curry for that later.</p><p>She\u2019s hesitant as she appears to be thinking it over but finally agrees. \u201cOkay. I wouldn\u2019t want Chansey to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Curry tells me over his shoulder as he leaves the room, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you out front after I tell Chansey what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>We leave Jenn\u2019s bedroom and walk toward the foyer since she used the front door when she left. The others gather outside and begin forming the plan as I stop to kiss Avery. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll bring Jenn home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d she groans. \u201cI hate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. But think of this as an opportunity. You\u2019ll have the luxury of being able to speak freely with Chansey about the ag\u00e1pe bond. She can tell you things firsthand that no one else can. The good and the bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>She pulls me in for a tight squeeze before letting me go. \u201cPlease. Please. Please. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, baby doll. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019m almost three hundred years old. I know how to take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but I can\u2019t stop myself from worrying. I realize it\u2019s your duty to protect me so please understand my position when I worry about you. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Hmm. Good point and one I\u2019ve never considered.</p><p>I kiss her hard and place my forehead against hers. Curry walks past us in the foyer to join the others and it\u2019s my cue to leave. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back before you know it. With Jenn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>I\u2019m the last one to join the huddle outside the front door. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian inhales deeply. \u201cShe went northwest judging by the direction of her scent. Since there\u2019s seven of us, we\u2019ll break into three groups.\u201d He points in the direction of each assignment. \u201cGia, Lairah and Thatcher will take the far west corner. Curry and Sol will search the middle while Sully and I scan the far eastern section. Spread an acre apart so that gives us a wide span and we\u2019ll push north. First group to find her sends out a text to notify the others. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>Everyone voices their understanding and we split into our designated groups to begin searching. \u201cI really screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself. This is something Jenn\u2019s gotta accept and find a way to deal with. No way it\u2019s your fault.\u201d He\u2019s being supportive but I wonder if he heard the harsh things I said to her.</p><p>\u201cI told Jenn she needed to leave if she couldn\u2019t accept my relationship with Avery.\u201d</p><p>Curry stops. \u201cI heard everything but you were protecting Avery from Jenn\u2019s verbal attack. That\u2019s what we do for our ag\u00e1pes because we can do no less.\u201d I feel minimally better knowing he understands where I\u2019m coming from but I still have Avery to worry about. I\u2019m not certain she understands.</p><p>\u201cBut what if we don\u2019t find her? Avery may never forgive me if that happens.\u201d It was a possibility I had to consider.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, we will find Jenn. She\u2019s still a fledgling so she has no idea how to thwart seven experienced vampires from tracking her. Secondly, that\u2019s not how it works with your ag\u00e1pe. Avery can\u2019t not forgive you. It isn\u2019t her nature to hold a grudge against her beloved because she loves you too much.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t considered that. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>Our phones vibrate simultaneously. \u201cSee? Someone has already found her.\u201d</p><p>The message is from Sebastian. He wants us to come to his location. \u201cI don\u2019t think this means they found Jenn. He would ask us to meet them at the house if they had recovered her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m instantly worried. \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t mean something has happened to Jenn.\u201d I\u2019m not convinced Avery would forgive me so easily if that were the case.</p><p>We head in Sebastian\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing so don\u2019t jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re the last ones to arrive where the family is gathered in the middle of the compound property. Jenn is nowhere in sight so I\u2019m immediately alarmed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked up on Jenn\u2019s scent and followed it here,\u201d Sebastian says. \u201cSully and I agree that we smell something else. Or rather someone else.\u201d</p><p>Curry and I both inhale deeply and he\u2019s right. \u201cOther vampires have been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us recognize the scents so I don\u2019t believe we have friendly company on our grounds.\u201d</p><p>Curry and I look at one another and say his name at the same time. \u201cVincent.\u201d</p><p>I feel horror rising from my stomach and all thoughts about finding Jenn dissipate. \u201cIf Vincent has breached the walls of the compound then he knows we are the ones that took Avery. There\u2019s no one in the house to stop him from getting to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr my family.\u201d Hysteria floods Curry\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d I yell the moment I pick up on Avery\u2019s sudden onset of intense fear. \u201cHe\u2019s inside the house.\u201d</p><p>The seven of us race toward the compound. I\u2019m the first one inside with Curry on my heels. He rushes past me toward the nursery and I fear what he will find because I don\u2019t suspect Vincent\u2019s one to hesitate in making infants his victims.</p><p>\u201cAvery!\u201d I yell as I fall to my knees. I don\u2019t have to search the house for my beloved. I already know she is no longer here because I feel the cold distance growing between us.</p><p>I put my fists to my eyes and a sound I\u2019ve never heard\u2013or produced\u2013roars from deep within my chest. I rise to stand from where I\u2019m kneeling and do the only thing I can. I pound my fists into the walls over and over until they\u2019re bloody with open wounds. I\u2019m not sure how long I use the walls as a punching bag but I stop after I register Thatcher\u2019s hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou need to go to Curry\u2019s quarters right now.\u201d</p><p>I walk the hall terrified of what I will find at the end when I reach Curry and Chansey\u2019s bedroom. I listen for any clue of what I\u2019m walking into but the only thing I hear is eery silence\u2013and then the rapid beats of two tiny hearts. I sigh with relief in knowing the babies are alive and still here.</p><p>Curry is standing between their cribs looking over his children as they sleep. He doesn\u2019t turn when I enter. \u201cHe took Chansey too. His scent is in our bedroom but not the nursery. She must have shut the door since they were sleeping. He probably never even realized there were two half-ag\u00e1pe babies right in the next room.\u201d Anna Grace stirs in her sleep and Curry lifts her from her crib. He cradles her in his arms and stares at her angelic face. \u201cI can\u2019t even bear to imagine what he\u2019d have done to my children if he\u2019d found them.\u201d Curry kisses the top of his daughter\u2019s head and places her back in the crib.</p><p>The entire family is standing in the nursery. \u201cLairah, can you and Gia take care of the babies while the rest of us work on a plan to get Chansey and Avery back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course we will. You don\u2019t even have to ask but one question: what will we feed them when they wake? They\u2019ll be hungry in the next few hours and their only source of nourishment has come from Chansey.\u201d I\u2019m glad we have someone with some type of motherly instinct to care for the babies because that wouldn\u2019t have crossed my mind until they awakened ready to eat.</p><p>Curry stands with his hands on his hips for a moment before he finally answers. \u201cI guess we don\u2019t have a choice. They\u2019ll have to take formula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re half-vampire,\u201d Lairah says. \u201cWhat if that\u2019s not what their bodies need?\u201d</p> <p>I see the torment on his face. He\u2019s torn between staying to tend to the health of his babies and leaving them to go after their mother. This is where I come in. It\u2019s my job as his best friend to help him through this crisis. \u201cThe best thing for the babies is to find Chansey and bring her home to them. Ask Dr. Knight to come out and examine them. She\u2019s their physician. Let her make the call on what kind of nourishment they need until you can bring Chansey back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting Chansey home as soon as possible solves any issues the twins might have with nutrition so that\u2019s what I must concentrate on.\u201d</p><p>Anna Grace frets in her sleep and Gia places her hand against her back. She rubs it in a circular motion to sooth her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Lairah and I will take wonderful care of your babies and Dr. Knight will figure out what to feed them.\u201d</p><p>I give Curry a reassuring pat on the shoulder. \u201cYour kids will be fine. Leave them with the girls so we can get a plan together.\u201d</p><p>My best friend reaches out and places his finger inside James Grady\u2019s tiny hand. The baby grasps his father\u2019s finger in his sleep and sighs. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring your mother home to you, son. I swear I will.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls his finger gently from James Grady\u2019s grasp and walks toward the door. \u201cAnd after I get my wife back safely from that son of a bitch, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think so. \u201cOnly one problem with that plan, my friend. You\u2019ll have to beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>The five of us\u2013Curry, Sebastian, Sully, Thatcher, and myself\u2013convene in the living room. \u201cI have something to say. I know the two of you aren\u2019t going to like it but I think we should stake Vincent\u2019s place out before we strike. We need to know what we\u2019re going up against.\u201d</p><p>Curry and I reply at the same time. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want your ag\u00e1pes staying a minute longer than necessary but Sebastian is right,\u201d Thatcher says. \u201cIt\u2019s the wisest thing to do. And the safest for your mates. Go in there tonight with guns blazing and you could get them and yourselves killed if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re walking into.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure my brother\u2019s attitude would be much different if he was in my shoes. \u201cYour beloved is here with you\u2013safe and sound. Talk to me about patience when a lunatic like Vincent comes in and takes Gia from you.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t deny my accusation regarding his affection for her. \u201cI suppose I wouldn\u2019t be patient about getting her back but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d have the good sense to make a sound plan without getting myself killed.\u201d</p><p>Sully speaks up to agree with Thatcher. \u201cWe understand your anxiousness but you can\u2019t save Avery and Chansey if you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is going in and getting killed tonight,\u201d Curry tells his brother. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve figured out we have the advantage of walking in daylight so they won\u2019t be expecting it. I think a little past dawn is the best time to strike. As much as I despise the thought, Vincent and whoever is with him will be high as kites by morning after having a blood jewel in their possession again. We\u2019ll go in and take Chansey and Avery while Vincent and his coven are passed out for the day.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s basing his plan on my ability to day walk and I haven\u2019t had time to try since finding out Avery is my ag\u00e1pe. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in sunlight yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept during the day in months. Trust me. You\u2019re a day walker even if you haven\u2019t confirmed it yet.\u201d</p><p>Curry sounds very confident but I guess we would find out in the morning. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing this right after the sun comes up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d He pounds his fist into his open palm. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Chansey there a second longer than I have to. You with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the way.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Curry and I are sitting in a parked car on the side of the road waiting for the sun to make its appearance. We\u2019re armed with wooden stakes but it\u2019s my bare hands I plan to use when I kill Vincent. I have many reasons for needing to be the one to do the honors. I want that monster to pay for all the ways he has hurt my beloved. Stealing her from her family. Killing her parents. Draining her almost to the point of death. Whoring her blood out so anyone addicted to it is a threat to her safety. The list goes on and on. But I couldn\u2019t be sorry for the way things have played out. In a way, Vincent has played a part in bringing me and my ag\u00e1pe together.</p><p>I need to think about something besides all the things Vincent has done or I won\u2019t be able to sit here and patiently wait for the sun to rise. \u201cI spoke with Avery about the potential pregnancy. She was happy about the possibility.\u201d</p><p>Curry reaches over and slaps me on the back. \u201cAh, man. That\u2019s great news. And a relief for you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Relief didn\u2019t quite cover it. \u201cShe said we should know in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s expecting and the pregnancy progresses at the same rate as Chansey\u2019s, you\u2019ll be parents by spring.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. I hadn\u2019t thought of it like that. Avery could potentially give birth to our child\u2013or maybe even children\u2013in a few short months. \u201cWe aren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>Curry laughs. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe in vampires observing marriage vows.\u201d</p><p>I guess I had changed my view on the matter. \u201cI didn\u2019t before I had an ag\u00e1pe and possibly got her pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mate changes how you see everything,\u201d he says.</p><p>Curry was born after me but still in a time period that shared the same beliefs. \u201cI always expected to be married when I had sex the first time. I thought it would be with my wife and I definitely expected to be married to the woman that would give me my first child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to marry Avery?\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound surprised at all.</p><p>\u201cI do. I want to be Avery\u2019s husband. I was wrong when I thought it didn\u2019t matter. I want to be tied to her in every possible way. Marriage will be us telling the world we want to be together forever because it\u2019s what we choose. Not because our match was preordained by Anteros.\u201d I think I remember Curry saying something very similar to this once.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have long to get married if she\u2019s pregnant and you want her to be your wife before the baby comes.\u201d He\u2019s right. A pregnancy will make for a tight schedule.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to as soon as I have her safe and sound in my arms again.\u201d A thought passes through my mind. What if she doesn\u2019t want to marry me? \u201cI hope it\u2019s what she wants too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will be.\u201d I wish I had Curry\u2019s confidence.</p><p>Our time as vampire and ag\u00e1pe has been nearly nonexistent so I\u2019m not certain where her head is on the whole marriage thing. She could think she\u2019s too young to get married. \u201cDid you know Avery\u2019s only twenty?</p><p>He grins and I suspect he\u2019s recalling the way I once rimmed him out over Chansey\u2019s age. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize she was so young. Just a mere child,\u201d he laughs. He thinks he\u2019s funny.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be twenty-one next month.\u201d I was trying to make it sound better by tacking on that extra year\u2013just as Avery had attempted.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-one isn\u2019t that much younger than Chansey. Only a couple of years.\u201d This is his way of trying to make me feel better.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to rob her of the best years of her life.\u201d Or have her look back on the things she missed and hate me for it.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had enough time with her to figure this out but every day gets better and better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even hold on to my ag\u00e1pe a full twenty-four hours.\u201d Avery must now have zero faith in me as her protector. \u201cWhat does that say for the kind of mate I\u2019ll be?\u201d</p><p>Curry stares ahead. \u201cChansey was taken too so you\u2019re not alone in feeling like an inadequate mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never taking my eyes off of her again after I get her back.\u201d I\u2019ll stay so close she\u2019ll think we\u2019re conjoined twins. She\u2019ll be sick of me.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling. After Chansey is back and the dust settles, I want to revisit the subject of turning her. I rather have her as a vampire than live without her.\u201d Turning his mate is his decision but I\u2019ll never attempt that again. I love Avery too much to watch her die like Lisette.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait until they finish nursing.\u201d He already has an answer so that tells me he\u2019s been thinking about this a lot.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019ll want more children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed it. We\u2019ve been so busy with the twins that the thought of having more children hasn\u2019t crossed my mind.\u201d He grins. \u201cI remember her telling me once that she wanted at least three but that was before either of us knew what we were to one another. She might not feel the same now.\u201d</p><p>I sense Avery\u2019s agitation so something must be happening. \u201cCan you feel Chansey right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s terrified.\u201d His hands are in tight fists and I expect him to punch the dashboard any minute. \u201cHer fear is as strong as it was the night Marsala attacked her through black magic and caused the emergency cesarean. I\u2019m trying to calm her so she\u2019ll know we\u2019re coming but I haven\u2019t been successful so far.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t calm her through her connection, it stands to reason that Vincent is probably doing something to heighten her fear. He did that with Jenn and Avery to raise their adrenalin.\u201d I didn\u2019t say the rest of what I was thinking. There was no reason in pointing out that he\u2019d be drinking from one\u2013or both\u2013of them. He\u2019s able to draw his own conclusion.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s doing that then he means to drink from her.\u201d Curry hits the back of his head against the seat several times. \u201cHe\u2019ll figure out that Chansey\u2019s a blood jewel if he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her?\u201d</p> <p>He sighs. \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. I didn\u2019t want her living in fear of something I didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t explain. I had every intention of telling her but I wanted to find out what it meant first.\u201d</p><p>She was going to freak when she found out. \u201cShe\u2019ll inevitably know now.\u201d</p><p>Curry closes his eyes. \u201cYeah and she\u2019s gonna be pissed at me for not telling her when she figures out that I knew.\u201d I didn\u2019t envy Curry that conversation.</p><p>I\u2019m relieved to sense the change in my ag\u00e1pe. \u201cI feel Avery calming down so she\u2019s either meditating to lower her heart rate and adrenaline or the coven is finished with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChansey is naive when it comes to vampires. She saw how Sully was before our reconciliation but it was brief. He played cat and mouse games with her to taunt me.\u201d He\u2019s restless in his seat. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing compared to what Vincent is doing to her right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to not think about it. It\u2019ll consume you and distract your mind from what we need to do but take comfort in knowing that being a blood jewel is what will keep her alive. If for no other reason, Vincent will protect her because of that.\u201d Those are the only reassuring words I have.</p><p>\u201cIronically, that\u2019s the only thing encouraging me at this point.\u201d</p><p>I look at the horizon. \u201cThe sun is coming up. Another three or four minutes tops.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t turn into a crisp french fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. That would suck.\u201d I can\u2019t even consider what would happen to me if my body isn\u2019t ready for the sun. Avery is the only thing I can think about.</p><p>We remain silent for the next few minutes as we wait for the verdict. I stretch my hand outward into the sun\u2019s rays and feel nothing but its warmth. Almost.</p> <p>\u201cNo smoke. That\u2019s encouraging.\u201d Curry watches my hand as I form a fist and then flex it open. \u201cI still feel a little sting when the sun initially hits my skin but it goes away after a minute or two.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s definitely a slight burning sensation. \u201cIt feels like a blistering tingle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Curry puts his hand into the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder of what I really am when I let it slip my mind.\u201d</p><p>He sometimes forgets? \u201cI can\u2019t imagine feeling so human that I don\u2019t remember I\u2019m a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait, buddy. It\u2019ll happen to you too,\u201d he says.</p><p>I\u2019m so lucky to have a best friend that has experienced this. \u201cI\u2019m glad I have you to advise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful I have Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian had no one to guide him. He was left to interpret it all on his own based solely on legends. \u201cCan you imagine the things that must have gone through his mind?\u201d All he knew in the beginning was that he was a vampire and he loved a human. I remember how confused I was when I realized I felt affection for Avery.</p> <p>\u201cHe had to be terrified of the things he was feeling.\u201d Curry taps his temple a few times. \u201cOr think he was losing his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to lose Ella the way he did. Such a senseless death. I don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t go mad.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be strong enough to bear it because I\u2019m about to lose my mind now.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he still feels her\u2013even in death.\u201d</p><p>That would be torture. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems comforted by it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how there would be contentment in that. \u201cI\u2019d rather die than live without Avery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same about Chansey,\u201d Curry agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s thought of ending it all but says he lives for Ella because it\u2019s what she wants for him.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t the kind of thing we should be discussing when we\u2019re about to burst into a nest of crazy vampires to take back our mates. \u201cSun\u2019s up and shining. Time to roll.\u201d</p><p>We get out of the car and quietly approach the house where I saw Avery for the first time. It\u2019s bittersweet memories being in this place again.</p><p>Curry tries the front door and it\u2019s unlocked so we immediately suspect a trap. I motion toward the back of the house and he follows closely on my heels. I push the lever of the handle and the door opens\u2013a definite trap. He points toward the upper level balcony above us and I nod. We climb up and over the railing and land on the second story porch. The french doors are open\u2013another invitation for us to enter.</p><p>I\u2019m growing uneasy as we enter the house but it\u2019s of no consequence. Trap or no trap, we\u2019re going inside.</p><p>Something is noticeably off once we\u2019re within the house. No. Make that everything is off. Curry and I look at one another\u2013disappointment and anger apparent on his face. Avery and Chansey aren\u2019t here. No one is. The house is abandoned.</p><p>\u201cDamn that bastard to hell!\u201d I never considered them being anywhere but this place. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been gone for long. I still smell his putrid odor.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s obvious we\u2019re in Vincent\u2019s quarters because we\u2019re surrounded by grandeur furnishings. \u201cThere\u2019s a clue somewhere in this house so we\u2019ll start here in the king\u2019s quarters.\u201d Curry streaks over to the bed and begins shredding the mattress. \u201cTear everything apart. We\u2019ll strip this house room by room until we find something that will lead us to them.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m fiercely ripping wood from the floor when I hear Curry. \u201cChansey ...\u201d He\u2019s wearing a blank stare.</p><p>I walk to him and snap my fingers in front of his face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe because she\u2019s channeling me.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that means. \u201cShe\u2019s letting me know she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m immediately alarmed because my ag\u00e1pe isn\u2019t channeling me also\u2013not that I would know what it felt like if she did. \u201cI can\u2019t feel Avery doing anything. Does that mean something\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You and Avery haven\u2019t figured out how to control your bond yet. It\u2019ll come with time.\u201d</p><p>I hope I get the chance to learn more about our bond. \u201cI swear he won\u2019t come out of this alive. I won\u2019t stop until he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fixate on him if you want to reach her,\u201d he says. \u201cClose your eyes. Try to revisit that place where only you and Avery reside when your bond is at its strongest. Remember the feel of your connection and feed it with your love. \u201d</p><p>I do as Curry instructs and I get nothing. Not a single thing. And I feel like an epic fail for my ag\u00e1pe.</p><p>\u201cKeep yourself receptive. Think of her while we work to tear this place apart. I\u2019m sure my wife is instructing her on how to do it and if she\u2019s anything like Chansey, she won\u2019t stop until she\u2019s able to connect with you.\u201d</p><p>I return to ripping up the floor. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d be thinking of anything but her.\u201d</p><p>We work for hours tearing the house apart, leaving nothing unturned. The once grand home now resembles a demolition site and it\u2019s a shame. It was so beautiful. \u201cWe\u2019ve shredded every piece of furniture, every floor, every wall covering. I know there\u2019s a clue here somewhere. There has to be. All of this can\u2019t be for naught.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m studying the only untouched piece remaining in the room when I hear Avery\u2019s voice behind me. \u201cYour clue to finding her is in the mantle.\u201d</p><p>I spin around at the startle of her voice and she\u2019s standing across the room. Her face is oddly void of emotion. \u201cThank the gods you escaped from Vincent. Where is Chansey?\u201d</p><p>Curry comes into the parlor where Avery and I are. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</p><p>Is he blind? She\u2019s standing right there in plain sight. \u201cAvery.\u201d I get up to go to her and she disappears. I reach out and pass my hand through the space she just occupied. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>I turn to look at Curry for help with an explanation. \u201cYou saw Avery\u2019s fylgia. It\u2019s weird, right?\u201d</p><p>Weird doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. \u201cYeah. It was bizarre. And disappointing. I thought she had safely escaped and was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing Avery had a twin that died at birth?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I have no idea. It\u2019s in this moment that I realize I know far too little about my ag\u00e1pe. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We never discussed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for learning everything about her.\u201d He\u2019s nonchalant as he digs through the piles of plaster and wood tossed around the room. \u201cWhat did the fylgia say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me my clue to finding Avery is in the mantle.\u201d I walk over to the only intact piece still in the room and begin studying it. \u201cLook.\u201d I point to an inconsistency in the design of the painted wood.</p><p>Curry leaves the heap of debris he\u2019s ciphering through for a better look at the woodwork around the fireplace. \u201cThis is an old house. What do you want to bet there\u2019s a trip for a hidden compartment? Those were pretty common in houses like this. I incorporated one into the mantle at the house I built in Pascagoula.\u201d</p><p>I peck on the mantle hoping to hear a hollow sound but everything seems solid.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try pulling instead of pushing.\u201d</p><p>I slide my finger along the underside of the dentil molding until I feel a slight give. I push upward as I pull and a narrow drawer no wider than two inches slides out. I look at Curry as I remove it from the mantle and then I turn it upside down over my palm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A heavy brass key lands in my hand and I immediately know it\u2019s not for this house. The Sigil identifies it as belonging to another residence\u2013the place where Vincent is holding our ag\u00e1pes captive.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Curry and I reluctantly accept that we won\u2019t be finding Avery and Chansey today so we go back to the compound to begin researching the Sigil. We\u2019re defeated for now but we have the first clue we need in steering us toward their direction. And that\u2019s a hell of a lot more than we had when we started last night.</p> <p>The babies are crying when we enter the house and Curry immediately runs for the nursery with me behind him. The curtains are pulled closed to block the sunlight but I easily see Gia and Lairah sitting on the couch in the nearly black room. Each is holding a baby and rocking fiercely. \u201cThank the gods you are here. These two have not been happy since they woke and found both of their parents gone.\u201d</p><p>Gia and Lairah\u2019s faces fall when they see we are alone. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get them back?\u201d Gia asks as she rises from the couch with James Grady so she may walk the floor and bounce him in an attempt to make him happy.</p><p>Curry takes his daughter from Lairah and sits in the glider before he motions for Gia to bring his son to him. \u201cIt appeared as though we had just missed them.\u201d</p><p>Both babies are immediately soothed by their father. It\u2019s absolutely amazing what his voice, smell, and touch does to calm them. Avery has that same effect on me.</p><p>\u201cDid Dr. Knight come?\u201d Curry asks.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. She had us mix one part infant formula to one part blood. They didn\u2019t like it but they finally gave in and took it because they were hungry. That was only about an hour ago so they had to have gone at least ten hours without eating.\u201d That can\u2019t be good for them.</p><p>\u201cPoor little things. They had to be starving because Chansey nurses them every four hours.\u201d Curry kisses Anna Grace on the forehead and then James Grady. \u201cThey may not be very old but they already have an ironclad bond with her. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re confused because she isn\u2019t here to feed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to get her and Avery back as soon as possible,\u201d Gia says. \u201cIt sounds like they\u2019re still close if they hadn\u2019t been gone long when you got there. They couldn\u2019t have gotten far since the sun was coming up so they must still be in Savannah or the surrounding vicinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are our thoughts exactly.\u201d I take the heavy brass key from my pocket and hold it up for Gia and Lairah to see. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t think Vincent would be hiding this key in a secret compartment if the house it unlocks isn\u2019t nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s a complicated Sigil,\u201d Lairah says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it but what makes you think this is the key to the house where he\u2019s hiding Avery and Chansey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery has a fylgia like Chansey and Ella. Anteros sent her to me. She\u2019s the one that told me where to find the key.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis whole agape-fylgia thing is just freaky. Wouldn\u2019t it have been easier if she would have told you the address instead of giving you clues?\u201d That would have been too simple. Anteros didn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>Lairah reaches for the key and takes it from me. \u201cWouldn\u2019t Vincent need this if it unlocks the place he\u2019s holding Chansey and Avery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might if he hadn\u2019t changed the locks in the last two hundred years.\u201d Even vampires make updates.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re looking for an old house in the Savannah area\u2013at least two hundred years old. That doesn\u2019t help a lot since Savannah is a historical town flooded with mansions fitting that description.\u201d I don\u2019t have time for Gia\u2019s pessimistic attitude.</p><p>\u201cNot all of them bear the sign of this sigil. All we have to do is find a vampire that can identify it.\u201d Or maybe luck would be with us and we\u2019d happen upon it.</p><p>Lairah passes the key to Gia. \u201cMaybe Sebastian will recognize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up. I couldn\u2019t sleep knowing what the two of you were doing today.\u201d Sebastian is standing in the doorway of the nursery. \u201cI heard everything. Let me have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>He takes the key and studies it as he turns it one way and then another. \u201cI don\u2019t recall seeing this symbol before but its design is ornate and baroque so it\u2019s old. My guess is more than two hundred years since the first square in Savannah was constructed in the seventeen thirties. We should begin by looking at vampire archives to see if we can identify any houses built by our kind. The older records won\u2019t be listed in the computer database so I\u2019ll have to travel to the New Orleans compound to retrieve them. I\u2019ll leave tonight and hopefully we\u2019ll find a lead when I return with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I ask a favor?\u201d Curry says.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGia and Lairah would be much more help if they were out searching with us so I\u2019m going to ask Chansey\u2019s grandmother to come take care of the babies. Can she ride back with you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019ll be forced to tell her what\u2019s happened. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to keep the truth from Anna if she comes here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pushed into a corner.\u201d Curry shrugs. \u201cI need her help with the babies. And she\u2019s Chansey\u2019s grandmother so I think she has the right to know what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably best,\u201d Lairah says. \u201cGia and I love these little guys to pieces but we weren\u2019t made for staying up during the day to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I thank you for doing it today. Trust me when I say I know it isn\u2019t easy. I don\u2019t know how Chansey does it. She\u2019s such a natural with them. She\u2019s a wonderful mother and that\u2019s why they need her back as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Lairah places a supportive hand on Curry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo. We know you\u2019re dying to get back out there and look again now that you have a starting place. We can take care of them until Anna arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You don\u2019t know what it means to me and Sol,\u201d Curry tells them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Lairah takes her hand from his shoulder and gives him a hug. \u201cAll we want is the safe return of our sisters.\u201d</p><p>Curry and I park on a side street off of Johnson Square. Built in seventeen thirty-three, it was the first square constructed in Savannah so it\u2019s our starting point. It certainly fits the bill for being more than two hundred years old.</p><p>We take a quick look and Curry says, \u201cThe majority of these places don\u2019t look like residences. Most are businesses.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a good thing and should speed up the process. \u201cThen we should be able to rule them out quickly.\u201d</p><p>We inspect every structure\u2013both business and residential\u2013for the sigil. No detail is left unobserved but our initial search at Johnson Square is unavailing so we move onto the next. The scenario is very much the same during our next quest but then we stumble upon something encouraging at a residence off of the main street.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Curry points at the symbol above us. \u201cIt\u2019s a sigil. Not the one we\u2019re looking for but it supports the theory that we could be looking in the right place. It\u2019s possible they might know Vincent\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s at least four inside. Maybe five so we shouldn\u2019t approach them alone.\u201d Walking into a nest of unknown vampires is a huge risk. They reside in the city where the coven of Landra has built our newest compound yet they remain faceless and nameless to us. That means they don\u2019t share our coven\u2019s opinions and still drink directly from humans\u2013probably willing and unwilling. \u201cWe\u2019ll return tonight with the others and pay them a visit along with any other vampire residences we find.\u201d</p><p>We complete the search through two more squares along with their surrounding streets and bring our total vampire residence discoveries to two. The day has been a total failure unless one of the groups of vampires have information that can lead us to Avery and Chansey.</p><p>On the way back to the compound, I pray to anyone that might hear my plea. Please bring my beloved Avery home to me safely. I willingly give my life in place of hers and the miracle inside her right now. Our child.</p><p>I\u2019m certain there\u2019s a baby growing in Avery and I marvel at how similar he already is to a vampire without considering my contribution of DNA. He resides in darkness with blood as his only nourishment and although I\u2019d never want him to be like me, I pray he\u2019s developing the strength of a vampire. He\u2019ll need that resilience to survive if Vincent drains Avery near depletion like he did the night of the blood ceremony.</p><p>The thought makes me consider everything that could go wrong. Our child might not survive the things Vincent will do to Avery. He needs her rich blood supply to live. His mother\u2019s blood is his only lifeline. It\u2019s the one and only way he receives oxygenation and nourishment to grow so chances are good that this baby won\u2019t make it if I don\u2019t get her back soon.</p><p>It\u2019s a thought that plagues my mind the whole ride back to the compound and that\u2019s when I begin to worry that things may have already gone bad for Avery and the baby. \u201cIt\u2019s been a quiet day with Avery. I haven\u2019t felt much from her today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t either but I\u2019m sure it was a long night for her and Chansey so they\u2019re probably sleeping. I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll feel more than we\u2019d like after Vincent and his nest are awake.\u201d</p><p>The thought is almost enough to make me lose my mind. \u201cMy gut tells me Avery\u2019s pregnant. Did you feel that way before you knew with Chansey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head and laughs. \u201cIt was the complete opposite with us. She was the one with the suspicion while I was in denial.\u201d</p><p>He probably thinks I\u2019m insane. \u201cI have nothing to base it on except a hunch. That\u2019s insane, right? It\u2019s only been a couple of days so maybe I\u2019m just being hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou share a beautiful connection with Avery. A baby solidifies that bond in a way you can\u2019t imagine until it happens. I didn\u2019t feel anything until I accepted the reality of Chansey\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d He\u2019s grinning as he drives. \u201cOnce I did ... it was crazy good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI feel like a frenzy of emotions has taken over. Love. Happiness. Excitement.\u201d But what I was feeling wasn\u2019t all rainbows and butterflies. \u201cFear. Worry. Anxiety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not imagining any of this. It\u2019s real. And trust me ... it\u2019s going to get worse. I was going out of my mind with worry about the next stunt Marsala would pull to get to Chansey. And then the babies came and I had them to worry about as well. Killing her was my only option. Even if it meant never knowing what a blood jewel was.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m able to see why he didn\u2019t hesitate. It didn\u2019t matter what it meant to be a blood jewel if Marsala killed Chansey. \u201cI didn\u2019t let it show but I was very angry with you for a long time. When you killed Marsala, I thought you snuffed out my only lead for finding out what it meant for Avery to be a blood jewel . Now I understand why you had to do it and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t trust your judgement or take Chansey\u2019s safety into account.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarsala had no limits when it came to wanting me and the babies. I didn\u2019t want to kill her but she gave me no choice. She was evil in its purest form. I knew Chansey and the twins would never be safe as long as she lived.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to explain. \u201cIt was the right decision. Just like it\u2019ll be the right choice to kill Vincent and anyone associated with him when we find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>We stand at the door of the first vampire residence and wait for someone to answer. A young human girl not more than a day over sixteen swings it open. The whites of her eyes almost glow in the moonlight from the excessive black kohl smudged around them. Her make-up is overdone, just like the drugstore black hair dye covering her natural blond locks. \u201cWho are you and what do you want?\u201d</p> <p>I feel like I should be asking if her mommy and daddy are home. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see the owner of the house.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms and appears annoyed. \u201cHe\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t have time for games. \u201cMaybe I should rephrase. Take us to the leader of this coven. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow them in Kaiden,\u201d I hear a calm, male voice call out. We follow the young girl to a room at the back of the house where four young male vampires surround a television. All of them are consumed by the video game they\u2019re playing. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>I watch his eyes so I can gage any reaction he might display. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a brother and sister living in the Savannah area. Vincent and Gloriana Godfrey.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNever heard of \u2018em.\u201d I see no reaction so I believe he\u2019s telling the truth.</p> <p>\u201cHas there been any talk in the community about some special kind of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I heard something about that a few months ago. Got invited to some big party where they were sharing but I didn\u2019t go.\u201d He takes his eyes from the television for a brief moment and gestures toward the young girl. \u201cI\u2019ve got my blood doll.\u201d He puckers his lips and makes a kissing sound at the girl. \u201cI don\u2019t need their blood when I have my own personal supply anytime I want it. Ain\u2019t that right, Kaiden?\u201d</p><p>The girl is pleased by this vampire\u2019s show of affection for her. Too bad it\u2019s a fake endearment to make her think he cares about her and not her blood. \u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>He is using her as a meal ticket. Hadn\u2019t I seen this done a thousand times before? But who was I to judge? Hadn\u2019t I done the same thing? We all had at some point. Hell ... I hadn\u2019t realized it at the time but I\u2019d agree to it not so long ago with my own ag\u00e1pe.</p><p>Curry appears annoyed and steps between the vampires and the flat screen. \u201cDo you know of any other vampires living within the Savannah Squares?\u201d</p><p>One of them pauses the game. \u201cThe only ones I know of live in the Victorian District over by Forsyth Park but we don\u2019t hang. They\u2019re not really into the same kind of things we are.\u201d</p><p>Curry laughs but not because he\u2019s amused. \u201cWhich would be teenage girls and video games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, don\u2019t judge me.\u201d He tosses the controller onto the couch. \u201cI was seventeen when I was turned so I\u2019m never going to grow up. This is it for me. I\u2019ve achieved my maximum level of maturity.\u201d He barely looks fifteen. His voice hadn\u2019t even matured yet. Whoever did this to him should rot in hell. Forever.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna leave my number.\u201d I take one of my cards from my wallet to give to him. \u201cPlease call if you hear any word circulating on that special blood again.\u201d</p><p>He tosses it on the coffee table. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>We leave the house of teen vamps and walk toward our next destination. \u201cThat was ... I don\u2019t even know what I think that was.\u201d Weird? Strange? Freaky? All of those words are fitting.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d Curry asks. \u201cShould we do something about that?\u201d</p><p>Kaiden\u2019s presence is consensual. There isn\u2019t anything to be done. \u201cShe is there of her own free will. Those guys are too wrapped up in their video game to stop her from leaving if she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s so young.\u201d Curry has always had a soft place in his heart for any girl that reminded him of his sister. \u201cCan a girl her age possibly have the mental capacity to make that kind of decision?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s likely looking for affection because she doesn\u2019t get any at home. This little creep is probably the first guy to come along and tell her she\u2019s special. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to say. She didn\u2019t appear harmed and they aren\u2019t out of control so it isn\u2019t a Landra issue.\u201d</p><p>We knock on the door of the second residence and wait. I\u2019m afraid but it has nothing to do with the vampires we\u2019re about to become acquainted with. I\u2019m terrified they will know nothing about Vincent or his whereabouts and we\u2019ll be no better off than we were last night if they have no information for us.</p><p>A male vampire answers the door. He\u2019s older than me\u2013at least four hundred\u2013despite his midtwenties appearance and modern clothing. He\u2019s blond with bright blue eyes and a narrow nose. I\u2019d guess he\u2019s Northern European\u2013or at least his ancestors were.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d He still has an accent after four centuries but I can\u2019t quite put my finger on its origin.</p><p>After I introduce myself and the others, the vampire identifies himself as Giermund\u2013definitely a viking name\u2013and invites us inside his home. \u201cThis is my mate, Runa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her appearance is similar to Giermund\u2019s\u2013blond with light eyes and a narrow bridge of her nose. I suspect they are human siblings\u2013quite possibly with the same maker\u2013since that wouldn\u2019t have been an unusual practice several centuries ago.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t take much of your time.\u201d I tell the couple about our search for Vincent. I even confide our reason why, minus the part about the blood jewel. It\u2019s a risk but one I\u2019m willing to take at this point because this pair would be familiar with the ag\u00e1pe legend. And also because I feel my desperation growing. These vampires are mates so I take a chance hoping they will understand our urgent desire to rescue our beloveds from their captor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Vincent Godfrey or his coven but Runa and I don\u2019t agree with the practices of most vampires so we choose to not socialize with them.\u201d</p><p>I give Giermund my card. \u201cThank you for your time and please call if you hear anything you think might aid in finding our mates. Even if seems unimportant.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the card and then back to me. \u201cYou\u2019re with the Coven of Landra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m head of the Savannah compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuna and I have lived by Landra standards for more than a century and we feel we have a calling to help other vampires. Would you mind talking to us about joining once the problem with your mates is resolved?\u201d</p><p>Allowing others into our circle would mean them knowing the truth about Avery and Chansey. I had no basis other than gut instinct alone but it told me an interview with Giermund and Runa was worth exploring. \u201cWe would love to talk with you further. We\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Last night\u2019s search was fruitless. Tonight\u2019s has been as well so Curry will be forced to tell Anna the bad news when she arrives at the compound within the hour. \u201cWhat did you tell Chansey\u2019s grandmother when you called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Chansey was overwhelmed with the twins but too stubborn to ask for her help. I played the part of the dumb vampire husband that didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe part about you being dumb isn\u2019t that far from the truth.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at my wisecrack. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve taken a cheap shot at him and I look forward to getting our ag\u00e1pes home so we can return to normal. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I was ignorant when it came to taking care of babies. But in my defense, I\u2019ve never had a reason to learn. I think I\u2019ve caught on pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>Curry is a pro at being a father to his twins. \u201cYou know I\u2019m joking. You look like you know exactly what you\u2019re doing with your kiddos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do any of it without Chansey. She taught me everything.\u201d He places a hand on my shoulder. \u201cAnd Avery will teach you when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve smiling inside because I\u2019m thinking of happier times\u2013a future that includes me, Avery, and our child. Or children. Twins are a definite possibility.</p><p>My happy thoughts end because I\u2019m unexpectedly engulfed by a sudden wave of weakness from Avery. And then I feel ... abyss. There hasn\u2019t been a time when I felt an emptiness like this from her. Something has definitely gone wrong.</p><p>My expression paints a picture of worry. \u201cWhat is it, Sol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething has happened to Avery. Everything felt fine one minute and then she suddenly weakened. Now I feel nothing from her.\u201d I\u2019m panicking as I imagine the worst\u2013that Vincent has killed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t freak out. Even if you\u2019re not feeling her, Avery isn\u2019t dead. It doesn\u2019t work like that because Sebastian is still able to feel Ella through death. She must be unconscious.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if this should make me feel better or not.</p><p>\u201cThat means he took too much of her blood if she has passed out.\u201d And that\u2019s a danger to our baby.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she fainted because she\u2019s pregnant. A lot of women do that when they\u2019re expecting and it doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2019s wrong with them or the baby.\u201d</p> <p>Side effects this early don\u2019t seem likely. \u201cIf Avery\u2019s pregnant, it\u2019s only a few days. It seems entirely too soon for something like that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChansey\u2019s pregnancy didn\u2019t progress at a normal rate and Avery\u2019s won\u2019t either so who\u2019s to say it\u2019s too soon?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe in Curry\u2019s theory\u2013and I appreciate him trying to encourage me\u2013but my heart was telling me Avery was in trouble. The only solace I could find was in knowing she wasn\u2019t dead. But how long could she last with Vincent if I didn\u2019t find her soon? \u201cI\u2019m going to inflict so much pain on that bastard when I find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to be the one to take him down, your beef with him is much larger than mine so I\u2019ll happily stand aside and watch as you kill him slowly.\u201d</p><p>A wooden stake through the heart was far too compassionate for him. He deserved something much slower and more painful. \u201cHave you ever seen a vampire die in the sun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes and it looks like an excruciating way to go. You hear this sound that can only be compared to food being dropped into frying oil. And the smell ... it\u2019s intolerable. A vampire\u2019s decaying flesh releases a putrid stench as it burns in the sun. The odor is well beyond that of a human\u2019s body as it burns by fire.\u201d</p><p>Good. That sounds like the perfect way for Vincent and Gloriana Godfrey to die.</p><p>A week passes and then another. Two weeks. That\u2019s how long I\u2019ve been separated from my ag\u00e1pe and and I\u2019m losing my mind.</p><p>Avery\u2019s menstrual cycle is due today. It will come or it won\u2019t. If it doesn\u2019t, she\u2019ll know she\u2019s pregnant but I won\u2019t be by her side to share in the joy. I\u2019ll remain in the dark\u2013unknowing if I\u2019m to become a father or not until we find them. And then I remember how quickly Chansey\u2019s pregnancy progressed once the first two months were behind her. What if we don\u2019t find them soon enough and Avery gives birth while she remains with Vincent? That would be a disaster.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in deep thought. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d I turn toward the voice calling upon my attention but I don\u2019t respond because I\u2019m not quite sure what to say. I don\u2019t know Anna well enough to confide my feelings. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re going to get Avery back. And my granddaughter will be returned as well.\u201d She looks down at her great-grandson in her arms and then reaches over to stroke the head of her great-granddaughter lying on the couch next to her. \u201cAnd these two will be reunited with their mother very soon.\u201d</p><p>This woman has led a dynamic life. She was once a blood swan and then later became the grandmother of an ag\u00e1pe because her daughter was one of Anteros\u2019s chosen few. Is it possible for that to be a coincidence? \u201cDo you mind me asking how you became a blood swan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy sister was turned when she was eighteen. I wanted to support her and being a blood swan was the best way for me to do that.\u201d</p><p>I remember she didn\u2019t remain an active blood swan for more than four years. \u201cWhy did you stop after such a short time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met someone\u2013a vampire\u2013and he didn\u2019t want me to share my blood with others. He wanted it only for himself.\u201d</p><p>That could only mean one thing. \u201cYou became his blood doll?\u201d</p><p>She nods, unashamed. \u201cFor almost three years.\u201d</p><p>Who terminated their relationship? \u201cYou ended it because you met your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He called it off because I was in love with him and begged to be turned. I wanted to spend eternity with him so I pleaded constantly but he refused. He said he had come to love me too much to turn me into a monster like him.\u201d</p><p>She must be mistaken. \u201cVampires don\u2019t love humans unless they are ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible but he loved me. I don\u2019t doubt it for a second.\u201d She\u2019s very confident about it.</p><p>\u201cYou never saw him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once in half a century but it isn\u2019t from lack of trying. I searched for a couple of years but gave up when I realized he wouldn\u2019t be found if he didn\u2019t want to be.\u201d The sadness is still in her eyes after all these years. \u201cBeing in Savannah brings back all of those memories.\u201d</p><p>Savannah? \u201cYou were here with your vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. His house was on East Broad Street. It was our home for almost three years.\u201d</p><p>Incredible. I remembered seeing Broad Street on the diagram we were using to map out our search but we hadn\u2019t made it to that side of town yet. \u201cWould you take us there? He could have returned to Savannah. Maybe he has information about Avery and Chansey\u2019s captor and where they\u2019re being held.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d</p><p>Anna might possibly recognize the Sigil since she once lived among Savannah vampires. I take the key from my pocket and hold it out for her. \u201cDo you recognize this symbol?\u201d She takes the key from my hand but says nothing as she stares at it.</p><p>I hear her heart speed as she rubs her thumb over the design of the key. She looks up with tear-filled eyes and then pulls the neck of her blouse over to reveal the black ink hidden just below her hairline\u2013an exact match to the Sigil. \u201cVincent insisted I mark my body with it so every other vampire would know I belonged to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent Godfrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Is that who took the girls?\u201d</p><p>Vincent Godfrey was her vampire? What a small world we live in.</p><p>She\u2019s in shock. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Vincent wasn\u2019t at all like this person you describe. I don\u2019t know what happened to change him but he\u2019s giving us those girls back. Tonight. I\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Curry enters the living room and I\u2019m guessing he heard our conversation by the surprise displayed upon his face. \u201cAnna. You can\u2019t walk into a lair of vampires with us. Chansey would never forgive me for putting you in that kind of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChansey will be pissed off for a little while but at least she\u2019ll be alive so she has the opportunity to be mad.\u201d</p><p>Curry and I look at one another but Anna doesn\u2019t give us the opportunity to argue. \u201cWhat time do we leave?\u201d</p><p>Anna directs us to the house on East Broad Street and there it is\u2013the sigil we\u2019ve scoured to find for two weeks. The elaborate design is incorporated into the front door, the ironwork around the front porch, even the back iron fence surrounding the property. A vampire would have to be blind to not see it.</p><p>Anna stands in front of the place she once called home and takes it all in while my family and I note other things. There are six vampires inside so we\u2019re evenly matched. And two human ag\u00e1pes.</p><p>My instinct is to burst through the door so we have the element of surprise but Anna insists violence won\u2019t be necessary. She believes she can persuade Vincent to give Avery and Chansey over without a fight. We tend to disagree. The Vincent she knew and the one we met a few months ago are two entirely different beings.</p><p>Anna\u2019s heart is racing and I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s a good idea for her to go inside. \u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t hesitate in answering. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She rings the bell and one of Avery\u2019s vampiric guards from the blood ceremony is the one to answer. He eyes Anna without any regard for us. \u201cTell Vin I\u2019m here to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d he whispers. He recognizes her so that means this guy has been with Vincent at least fifty years.</p><p>\u201cYes, Demarcus. I look much different than the last time we saw one another but it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The vampire hugs Chansey\u2019s grandmother and I realize the high regard in which he holds her. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years.\u201d</p><p>Anna\u2019s face is solemn. \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a few years. I need to see him.\u201d</p><p>The vampire steps outside and shuts the door. \u201cI don\u2019t know if seeing him is a good idea. He\u2019s different now\u2013not at all the person you once knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went mad after losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t lose me. He\u2019s the one that left.\u201d Her voice is sad.</p><p>\u201cAnd he never recovered from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was his decision. I didn\u2019t get a say in it.\u201d She points toward the house. \u201cNow he doesn\u2019t get a say about keeping those two girls in there captive. One of them is my granddaughter and we\u2019re coming in whether it\u2019s by invite or by force.\u201d</p><p>The vampire runs his hands through his hair. \u201cSheez, Anna. Your granddaughter is a blood jewel. Do you have any idea what that means?\u201d</p><p>Demarcus would know Avery wasn\u2019t Anna\u2019s granddaughter so there\u2019s our confirmation. Chansey is a blood jewel as well but we still don\u2019t know what it means.</p><p>Anna doesn\u2019t reply as she pushes past him. \u201cMove aside, Demarcus.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand up. \u201cPlease don\u2019t barge in this way. Let me tell him you\u2019re here so he can be prepared to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr so he can prepare to fight? Not happening, pal.\u201d I step around Anna and streak past Demarcus because I\u2019ve had enough of this spare Vincent\u2019s feelings shit. He reaches out to grab me but he\u2019s too slow. I\u2019m through the door by the time his brain makes the command for his arm to lift.</p><p>My family is on my heels as I enter the living room where five vampires are gathered. I scan the room but there\u2019s no sign of Avery or Chansey. Vincent is the first to notice us but doesn\u2019t move an inch. \u201cWell, well. If it isn\u2019t my good friends Michael and Phillip from the Coven of Landra.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello again.\u201d I pay close attention to my connection with Avery as I move across the room and I\u2019m certain she is down the hall to the left. I look at Curry and he cocks his head in that direction to tell me he feels Chansey there as well.</p><p>Vincent stretches his arm out across the back of the couch and begins laughing as he casually crosses his legs. \u201cIt took long enough for you to find me.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t appear frightened or the least bit challenged by our presence. I\u2019m sure he believes we come in peace because of who we are and what we do but he couldn\u2019t be more wrong. We will fight until death for the ones we love. \u201cYou have my mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mate?\u201d he laughs. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean one of my blood jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvery isn\u2019t a blood jewel to me. She\u2019s my ag\u00e1pe so you know that means she is my everything.\u201d</p><p>Curry steps next to me. \u201cAnd Chansey is mine so we\u2019re here to take them home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAg\u00e1pe or not, all of you are out of your minds if you think I\u2019m going to allow that to happen.\u201d His voice is cold.</p><p>\u201cVin.\u201d I hear Anna\u2019s voice behind me.</p> <p>Vincent\u2019s expression changes from arrogance to disbelief. He rises from the couch and his eyes are focused behind us. \u201cAnna.\u201d It comes out as a whisper because he\u2019s clearly effected by her presence.</p><p>Anna crosses the room and he meets her half-way. He cradles her face in his hands and gazes into her eyes the way a lover would. He strokes her cheeks with his thumbs and then takes her in his arms to pull her close. \u201cMy sweet Anna. It\u2019s been so long.\u201d</p><p>Both are silent as they hold one another and I\u2019m overwhelmed by the reality of my future with Avery. This is how she and I will be if she remains a human. We\u2019ll be happy but I\u2019ll watch her age. And then die.</p><p>Anna is the one to let go first. \u201cWhat are you doing, Vin? This isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>He steps back and slides his hands into the pockets of his trousers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is very much me.\u201d</p><p>Anna shakes her head. \u201cYou were never unkind but what you\u2019re doing to these girls is cruel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way for you to imagine the way I felt after we separated,\u201d he says. \u201cI was miserable so I searched the world for anything that might bring me some semblance of happiness. The blood of the jewels is the only thing that can free me of my misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot being able to be with you because I\u2019m one thing and you\u2019re another. That\u2019s what is wrong.\u201d I once believed the same thing about me and Avery so I understand where he\u2019s coming from. \u201cI wanted you to live the dream. To experience everything life had to offer. A husband. A family. Sunlight. Happiness. You could never have had those things with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went on to experience everything you wanted for me. I have a husband and a family I love very much including a granddaughter you\u2019re holding captive.\u201d His eyes widen as he steps back. \u201cShe\u2019s a mother. She has two newborn babies at home\u2013my great-granchildren\u2013and they desperately need her. They\u2019ve not done well since she was taken and I fear for their health and well-being. Please, Vin. They need their mother back.\u201d</p><p>He runs both of his hands through his hair and then laces his fingers across the top of his head as he appears to be thinking. \u201cSilas,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBring the dark-haired girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Anna puts her hand up to stop Silas. \u201cVin, you have two girls to release.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t do it Anna. I have to keep Avery or I won\u2019t survive. I thought I\u2019d die after she was taken a few months ago. I can\u2019t go through that kind of withdrawal again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoven of Landra can help you. It\u2019s what they\u2019re trained to do,\u201d Anna tells him.</p><p>It\u2019s our job to help the unsavable but I\u2019m not sure I could tolerate having Vincent inside my home so close to Avery. I could never bring myself to trust him.</p><p>\u201cThe only time I\u2019m able to forget all the ugliness is when I drink from a blood jewel. And I don\u2019t plan on stopping. The Landra can\u2019t help me if I don\u2019t want it.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to be helped. Suits me. I\u2019m happy to kill him.</p><p>\u201cPlease try. Do it for me.\u201d Anna\u2019s voice is pleading.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Vincent\u2019s face is pained. \u201cI can\u2019t be cured.\u201d</p><p>Anna walks to Vincent and places her hands on his upper arms. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that. Vampires that can\u2019t\u2013or refused to be helped\u2013are destroyed. That can\u2019t happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Silas brings Chansey around the corner and she falls into Curry\u2019s arms as he reaches her. \u201cThank the gods.\u201d He squeezes her tightly and kisses the top of her head. \u201cI love you, Chansey. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. I\u2019ve missed you and the babies.\u201d She lifts her face and Curry showers her face with kisses. \u201cTell me they\u2019re both all right.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes her again. \u201cThey\u2019re fine but anxious to have their mother back.\u201d</p><p>Vincent watches the union. \u201cTake your granddaughter and leave this place. And remember me the way I once was and not as the monster you see before you now.\u201d</p><p>Anna shakes her head. \u201cNo. I know what will happen when I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d Vincent pulls her into his arms\u2013and maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so quick to trust him with her\u2013but my intuition tells me he would never harm her. \u201cI was a fool but I\u2019ve never regretted my love for you. I wish I had been selfish enough to turn you. We could have had a good life together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, it\u2019s time to go. Lairah will take you and Chansey home while we tend to our unfinished business.\u201d She\u2019s hesitant to let go. I\u2019m guessing she suspects what will come next. Vincent will refuse the one last offer of help and that\u2019s when things are going to become violent.</p><p>\u201cChansey, please wait for me in the car with Lairah,\u201d Anna says.</p><p>I see the exhaustion on Chansey\u2019s face. She doesn\u2019t have the strength to debate the issue and she accepts assistance with walking when Lairah offers.</p><p>Anna waits until Chansey is safely out of hearing range. \u201cWhat makes my granddaughter a blood jewel?\u201d He looks to the floor to avoid her eyes but Anna is persistent. \u201cI need to know for her. And her children. If you ever had any feelings for me, you must tell me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s hesitant but finally answers. \u201cAll blood jewels are ag\u00e1pes but not all ag\u00e1pes are blood jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes Chansey and Avery different from other ag\u00e1pes?\u201d Anna asks.</p><p>\u201cIt happens one of two ways.\u201d He lifts his face so he can see her eyes. \u201cTheir human mothers or a maternal descendent shared blood with a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Shared could mean two different things and we need to know the difference. \u201cShared as in gave or shared as in drank?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d He deflects answering with a question.</p><p>How could he think it wouldn\u2019t? \u201cHell yes, it matters. There are countless blood swans all over the world. They have the right to know if they\u2019re putting their future daughters at risk.\u201d</p><p>Vincent hesitates before replying. \u201cThere is no risk for the blood swans. It only happens when the mother or one of her maternal descendants drinks the blood of a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard of this and I can tell Curry hasn\u2019t either by the expression he\u2019s wearing. \u201cWhy would a human drink blood from a vampire if she wasn\u2019t being turned?\u201d</p><p>Vincent looks at Anna. \u201cI won\u2019t have her subjected to any more of these questions.\u201d</p><p>Anna closes her eyes and tears roll down each of her cheeks. \u201cI did this to Chansey. She\u2019ll spend the rest of her life in danger because I tried to make you turn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never hurt her now that I know she is your granddaughter.\u201d He\u2019s telling the truth. I hear it in his voice but that doesn\u2019t protect Avery from him.</p><p>\u201cBut other vampires won\u2019t care,\u201d Anna whispers.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Anna turns one last time before leaving the house and a look passes between her and Vincent. I think it\u2019s her final plea\u2013begging him to give himself up to Landra. But I see rebellion in his eyes and expect no surrender from him. He\u2019s addicted to the blood of my ag\u00e1pe\u2013my heart and soul\u2013so he dies tonight if he doesn\u2019t willingly return her to me.</p><p>There\u2019s no point in being unclear about our intentions. \u201cYou have two choices. You can come with us and allow Landra to help you with your addiction or you can die now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFools,\u201d Vincent laughs. \u201cChansey had a get out of jail free card because she\u2019s Anna\u2019s granddaughter but you can\u2019t possibly think I\u2019d willingly hand over my only other blood jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s exactly what I expect. Avery doesn\u2019t belong to you. She\u2019s my ag\u00e1pe and you know what that means. I\u2019ll fight until the end for her. And it\u2019ll be your demise. Not mine.\u201d He knows this so maybe he has a death wish.</p><p>\u201cYour union is ordained by Anteros. Blah ... blah ... blah. Do you think I give two shits about your bond with her? I only care about her blood so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m handing her over.\u201d He\u2019s persistent. I\u2019ll give him that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you one last chance as a courtesy to Anna.\u201d I offer him one last out because I promised her I would. \u201cLet Avery go or die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t if I wanted to. Something about Avery\u2019s blood has changed. It\u2019s richer now and my addiction to her is nearly insatiable. It\u2019s so bad that I fear my own unquenchable thirst.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s blood is becoming richer to nourish the life growing inside her. And every time he takes blood from her, he\u2019s taking life from our child. I\u2019m certain of it.</p><p>He has admitted he\u2019ll never let Avery go so there\u2019s no debate. It\u2019s time for him to die. And I\u2019m not a bit unhappy about being the one to do it. \u201cYou tortured my ag\u00e1pe for months. You murdered her parents and turned her sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI turned Jennifer at Avery\u2019s request.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a weak argument and I feel the need to correct him. \u201cJenn was dying because you bled her dry. Avery didn\u2019t want to lose the only family member she had left so she threatened to kill herself if you let her sister die.\u201d He doesn\u2019t argue. \u201cYou persistently refuse to release my ag\u00e1pe and you have no desire to reform so I don\u2019t have a choice. You have to die tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched my sister go mad from the withdrawals after you took Avery. She killed herself in the sunlight. It was a gruesome death and it\u2019s only a matter of time before my fate is the same as hers if you take Avery.\u201d He stands before me with his arms spread wide, his signal to invite me to drive a dagger through his chest. \u201cI saw Anna and said goodbye. There\u2019s nothing more I need from this life so I welcome death.\u201d</p> <p>Killing him like this wasn\u2019t going to be any fun. \u201cYou have no fight left in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have fought you to the death if Anna hadn\u2019t come but seeing her changes everything. She is a ray of sunshine in my darkest hour even after all these years.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I feel mercy for this monster but I understand him on some level. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure you want to end it this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be anxious to have your ag\u00e1pe back,\u201d he says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you prefer to kill me quickly rather than fight?\u201d</p><p>Curry addresses Vincent\u2019s coven. \u201cWhat about the rest of you? Do you wish to die or go to the New Orleans compound and be reformed? Know ahead of time that it will be your demise if you choose to fight.\u201d</p> <p>The remaining vampires exchange looks but one speaks up for the group. \u201cWe choose reform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is in agreement?\u201d Curry asks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d they answer in unison.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d I take the dagger from the holster around my waist and walk toward Vincent. He suddenly doesn\u2019t seem the monster I once thought him to be. \u201cOne last time. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing me a kindness I don\u2019t deserve.\u201d He holds his position with his eyes closed as I prepare. I thought I\u2019d feel a sense of justice or revenge but the feeling nagging at me has little in common with either. \u201cDo it already.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m experiencing emotions I haven\u2019t felt since I was human. This ag\u00e1pe bond is messing with my mind because I feel sympathy for this known sadist.</p> <p>Vincent opens his eyes and sees my hesitation. \u201cMy incisors ripped through the skin covering your ag\u00e1pe\u2019s jugular only moments before your arrival. She\u2019s lying across a blood-soaked bed right now fighting to stay alive while you try to decide if you should spare my life or not. Every second you stand here, her heart slows.\u201d</p><p>Not another word is needed for me to make the quick upward motion to send the stake through his heart. I take joy in his gasp of pain but it\u2019s him smiling instead of me. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers as he falls forward into my arms. That\u2019s when I know he was lying. Avery isn\u2019t fighting for her life. She\u2019s safe and her connection to me has never been stronger. \u201cTell her I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I could ask why but it would be a waste of breath. Because I know the answer. And because Vincent Godfrey is dead.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>I streak down the hallway toward Avery and feel my connection to her grow as I narrow the distance between us. I come to the third door on the left but don\u2019t have to call her name. Her presence is stronger than ever before. It engulfs me, wrapping itself all around like a tight-fitting glove.</p><p>The door is locked to imprison her but it\u2019s useless at keeping me out. Nothing\u2013wood, steel, or any physical being\u2013can stop me from getting through the walls and door separating us.</p><p>She beats her hand against the door because she knows I\u2019m on the other side and calls out to me. \u201cSol! I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I place my palm against the door and the sounds of her frantic pounding stop. I don\u2019t have to see her on the other side to know her open hand is pressed against the same spot as mine like a mirror image on the other side. \u201cI\u2019m here for you, baby doll. I have to force my way through the door. Move back so I can come through without hurting you.\u201d</p> <p>I successfully kick through the barrier between us on the first attempt and I can\u2019t recall a time in my life when I\u2019ve felt more relief than I do in this moment. I\u2019m overwhelmed by it when I see her standing safely in the middle of the room and there isn\u2019t a name for the minuscule amount of time it takes to have my ag\u00e1pe in my arms.</p><p>Sebastian once tried to explain the pain a vampire experiences when separated from his ag\u00e1pe. My mind wasn\u2019t able to comprehend the degree of agony nor the instant relief when reunited but I understand now. Avery is my everything and the only thing I need to complete me. She makes me not broken anymore.</p><p>I hold her close but I\u2019m careful to not squeeze too tightly. We\u2019re speechless as we bask in our reunion because neither of us needs to say or hear words. Our connection is more articulate than any words we could say.</p><p>Curry is kind by giving us a brief moment before clearing his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt your reunion but Sebastian is leaving with Vincent\u2019s coven. And I\u2019m anxious to have my own homecoming with my wife.\u201d</p><p>I lift Avery from her feet into a cradle and she slips her arm around my shoulders for support while insisting it\u2019s unnecessary, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Sol. I can walk. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could but you\u2019re not.\u201d She\u2019s been through hell these last two weeks but carrying her out of this place of torment isn\u2019t really about her. It\u2019s about me proving I want to be the protector she needs and deserves.</p><p>I kiss her temple. \u201cThis will never happen again.\u201d Curry opens the car door and I place her in the back seat before she slides over so I may sit next to her. Once inside, I gather her under my arm like a mother hen with her baby chick. I pull her close and press my nose to the top of her head. I smell his scent in her hair. On her skin. It\u2019s permeated in her clothes. \u201cI will keep you safe. I swear this to the gods upon my own life.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are closed and she doesn\u2019t reply but she\u2019s not asleep. I\u2019m not sure if her lack of response is because she\u2019s exhausted or angry. Perhaps she\u2019s simply indifferent because she doesn\u2019t trust me to keep her safe. I can handle fury\u2013and maybe even expect it\u2013but a lack of confidence in my role as her protector would break me.</p><p>We arrive at the compound and Curry is in the house before I open the door of the car\u2019s backseat. I gather Avery into my arms and carry her into the compound to my quarters without stopping in the living room for the others to see her. Sebastian follows us down the hall and stands in the doorway as I place Avery on my bed.</p><p>He isn\u2019t with the vampires from Vincent\u2019s coven so I assume they are secured in the basement. \u201cThere isn\u2019t time to make the ten-hour drive to New Orleans before sunrise so we\u2019ll leave at dusk. They\u2019re secured in the basement so you needn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a possibility.\u201d I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll ever be a time when I\u2019m not consumed with worry about Avery\u2019s safety.</p><p>I move the wingback chair from the corner of the room and place it next to the bed. Avery\u2019s lying so still. Her eyes are closed yet she isn\u2019t sleeping. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a sign she isn\u2019t able to bear looking at me. I\u2019m terrified she won\u2019t forgive me for allowing this to happen to her.</p><p>But that\u2019s not what I feel from our connection. I sense relief. Pride. Love. But also despair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to step out so you can have a minute with Avery before Dr. Knight comes in to examine her.\u201d Sebastian goes into the hallway and moves to close the door. \u201cShe\u2019ll be in as soon as she\u2019s finished with Chansey.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re alone for the first time and I take Avery\u2019s hand in mine as I lean over to press my forehead against it. She lifts her free hand from the bed and strokes her fingers through my hair. Her nails are gently scraping against my scalp and the hairs on my body prickle in response. It\u2019s such a human reaction to her touch. \u201cYou\u2019re placing blame on yourself but I won\u2019t have it. None of this was within your control. Vincent\u2019s dead and the others have chosen to be conformed by Sebastian. This nightmare is over so I refuse to relive it by not letting it go.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a vampire\u2013an undead creature with a tortured soul\u2013so it\u2019s not my nature to let things go without dwelling upon the past. \u201cI think I need to know what happened before I can let go and move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you need to be tortured by hearing the things he did.\u201d She knows me too well.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear everything because I think not knowing is worse than hearing the truth. I\u2019m afraid of becoming fixated on the unknown. I\u2019ll drive myself mad trying to figure it out through our connection.\u201d And in addition to my own punishment, I plan to use the information she tells me as a lesson well learned. It will be forever etched in my mind as a reminder of what happens when I don\u2019t protect my ag\u00e1pe from other vampires.</p><p>I feel her reluctance. I see it in her eyes. But she\u2019ll do this for me because I ask it of her. She\u2019s unable to deny me the things I want just as I\u2019m unable to refuse the things she asks of me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you but I want you here.\u201d She slides over and pats the bed. \u201cI need to feel you against me. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have to ask twice. I slide into bed beside her and she places her head on my chest as she stretches her palm over the left side. \u201cHow long were we gone?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised by her question but I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be. She\u2019s been held captive in a house without access to light. \u201cTwo weeks and two days.\u201d The longest sixteen nights of my existence.</p><p>\u201cTime became a blur for us after the first night. The room where we were kept most of the time had no windows so we couldn\u2019t decipher day from night. It was always cold and smelled damp and musty. The floor was stone and the walls felt rough so we guessed it was some type of cellar.\u201d And probably full of airborne mold spores to make her sick. I pray none of them are toxic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVincent allowed the others to share Chansey but he kept me to himself.\u201d The thought of them passing her around makes me sick. \u201cThe first night wasn\u2019t what I expected. He opened a vein in my wrist to drain what he wanted into a cup and then sealed the wound. He was never so gentle with me before so I was surprised. I expected a ravenous attack.\u201d</p><p>My expectations were the same as hers. \u201cHe was kind to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the first night. He wasn\u2019t in control when he returned.\u201d She\u2019s shaken by a rigor. \u201cThe addiction had taken him over again with a new vengeance. He had no self-restraint and was greedier than ever.\u201d</p> <p>The second night was when I lost my connection to Avery. \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said my blood was different and better than it had been even at my highest adrenaline rush. He drank until I collapsed. Chansey thinks I was out for at least eight hours but there\u2019s no way to know for sure. I guess it must have scared him because he didn\u2019t come back for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine hours and twenty-seven minutes. That\u2019s how long you were unconscious. I felt it the second it happened and I knew the exact moment you woke.\u201d I pull her closer using the arm wrapped around her shoulders. \u201cI thought he had killed you when I lost our connection. It took a lot on Curry\u2019s part to convince me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She laces her fingers through mine. \u201cI had someone trying to convince me everything would be fine as well.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure Curry used his powerful bond with his ag\u00e1pe to keep her strong so in turn she helped Avery remain hopeful. \u201cI\u2019ll need to thank Chansey for keeping your morale high.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Chansey.\u201d I lift my head from the pillow and Avery looks up at me. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t want to belittle her encouragement but it was Eden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEden.\u201d She must be the fylgia that appeared to me.</p><p>\u201cYou and I had so little time together before Vincent took me. I never got to tell you about my twin that died at birth. I know it sounds crazy but I see her sometimes. Chansey says she\u2019s my fylgia\u2013a supernatural being that accompanies me in connection to my fate. She usually appears in my dreams but she acts as my guardian when she materializes.\u201d</p><p>Her arm feels cool so I rub it briskly from her shoulder to her elbow to produce warmth. \u201cShe guides me in protecting you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Avery asks.</p><p>\u201cShe appeared in Vincent\u2019s house while I was tearing it apart looking for any clue to where he had hidden you.\u201d Even now it seems unbelievable. \u201cI thought she was you when I saw her standing there. Even her voice is identical to yours. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou saw Eden?\u201d I hear the amazement in her voice. \u201cI always thought I was crazy because no one else could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the reason I located the secret compartment in the mantle. It\u2019s where I found one of the original keys to the house where Vincent was hiding you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How did the key help you find us?\u201d</p><p>I pull it from my pocket\u2013the place I\u2019ve carried it for over two weeks. \u201cThe sigil identified the house.\u201d She takes the key and holds it closer to the bedside lamp for a better look. \u201cBut Anna was the one to recognize it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door just as I\u2019m preparing to tell her the rest of the story. \u201cThat\u2019ll be Dr. Knight.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of time for explanations but for now I need to hear that Avery is the picture of health. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Michaela Knight eases the door open and is carrying the black leather bag she has every time she has made a medical call. \u201cI hear I have another patient.\u201d She enters the room and sits on the bed by Avery\u2019s feet. She reaches out and strokes her lower leg. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you back.\u201d</p><p>Avery pushes herself up in the bed. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that you and Solomon made quite the discovery just prior to your kidnapping.\u201d</p> <p>Avery beams. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m his ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news.\u201d She pats Avery\u2019s leg and then looks at me. \u201cAre you staying or going while I examine her?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. What does a vampire do when his ag\u00e1pe is being seen by a doctor? \u201cDo you want me to stay or do you prefer I step out?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t mind you staying but I need to speak with Dr. Knight about some female issues so you might be uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>She wants to talk periods. And the lack of hers.</p><p>I don\u2019t pick up on the scent signaling the menstrual cycle she should be having right now. It could be the result of the pregnancy I so strongly suspect or simply related to the stress or blood loss she experienced but I\u2019m certain she wants Dr. Knight to confirm the cause. \u201cOkay. I get it. This is girls only stuff so I\u2019m out of here.\u201d I kiss her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my office and I\u2019ll return as soon as you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>I pass the hallway leading to Curry and Chansey\u2019s quarters as I\u2019m on the way to my office. I want to stop by to check in on Chansey after her visit from Dr. Knight but I don\u2019t. I think knowing she is well would put my mind at rest but I resist because I don\u2019t want to disturb their family time with the babies. Or their ag\u00e1pe reunion.</p><p>I know nothing will stop mine with Avery once I know she\u2019s well.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at my desk in my office staring at the paperwork that has accumulated over the past two weeks. I had a lot of business to catch up on now that Avery was home safely. I should use this time to get some of my work done but I\u2019m useless because I know Dr. Knight is evaluating Avery\u2019s health. And possible pregnancy.</p><p>I cheat because I\u2019m anxious. I close my eyes and reach out to that place where only Avery and I exist. I\u2019m inside for a brief moment before she knows I\u2019m there and she pushes me away. That\u2019s never happened before. How did she do that?</p><p>I hear the chime of the doorbell and I walk over to open the door. It\u2019s Curry.</p><p>\u201cJust checking in on you while Dr. Knight is with Avery. You doing okay?\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m not. \u201cAvery just pushed me out of our connection.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cChansey must have taught her that little trick. It\u2019s annoying as hell, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Right now I don\u2019t find it annoying. It\u2019s ... hurtful. I want to be there with her\u2013even if it\u2019s not physically\u2013when she learns if she\u2019s pregnant or not. \u201cHow did she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou close the invisible gate. It takes concentration and a lot of practice. I bet Chansey has been coaching her for the past two weeks.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy would she want to shut me out? Isn\u2019t that why we are what we are? So we can know everything about one another inside and out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs a little privacy\u2013even from the ag\u00e1pe bond. Trust me. It can cause problems when you know every little emotion. There\u2019ll be times when you don\u2019t want her to know how you feel and you\u2019ll be glad there\u2019s a way to turn it off.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like this. At all. \u201cIt feels like she\u2019s hiding something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly hiding. Ag\u00e1pes don\u2019t have the power to do that because you can\u2019t keep secrets from one another. Think of it as withholding. Or postponing. The truth will always come out unless she never thinks of it again. If that happens then whatever it is must be of very little consequence and doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d</p><p>Is it okay to ask about Chansey\u2019s condition? Do I want to know? I\u2019m guessing it must be good or Curry wouldn\u2019t be here now. \u201cChansey is healthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s well enough to send me for a status on Avery. And maybe keep you occupied while she\u2019s being examined,\u201d he laughs. \u201cMichaela suggested a sedative but she refused because she wants to nurse the babies. I was afraid her body might have stopped producing milk or the twins would be confused after having bottles for two weeks but everything is as if nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Knight seems to be taking much longer with Avery than Chansey. Is that a bad sign? \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would take so long.\u201d I\u2019m growing more and more worried by the minute.</p><p>Curry looks at his watch. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been as long as you think. Your fear and the fact that she\u2019s cut you off makes it feel like longer.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and I hope to see the good doctor on the other side. I\u2019m instantly there with my hand on the knob to open it and I\u2019m pleased when I see Dr. Knight. \u201cI\u2019m finished with Avery\u2019s exam. She\u2019s asking for you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve just learned that my ag\u00e1pe has the ability to hide from me so I can\u2019t resist asking about her condition in case she plans to try to withhold information from me later. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiles and I\u2019m relieved before she says a word. \u201cAvery\u2019s strong and healthy so she\u2019ll make a full recovery. Her body is already working overtime to replace the loss of plasma. It\u2019ll take longer for the red blood cells to regenerate so I want her taking a vitamin every day to help with that process.\u201d She holds out a piece of paper. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want a sedative but I\u2019m leaving a prescription in case she changes her mind. I would be surprised if she didn\u2019t have night terrors after the things she experienced.\u201d</p><p>There were nights when I sensed horror and panic from Avery after she arrived at the compound. At the time, I thought it was related to her fear of me but I see now that wasn\u2019t the case. She was having nightmares about Vincent. I wish I had known. I could have helped her through it.</p><p>\u201cAvery thinks she\u2019s okay but she\u2019s going to need you more than she knows.\u201d</p><p>I was up for the task. \u201cI\u2019ll be by her side every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Michaela moves aside. \u201cGet out of here. Go to your ag\u00e1pe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thank Michaela but waste no time returning to Avery. I enter my quarters and smile when I find her sitting up in bed with several pillows propped behind her. Her skin is pale, which I\u2019m certain will be the case for a few weeks but her hair is glossy. It\u2019s an indication her health hasn\u2019t been damaged to the severity it was when we found her months ago. The golden brown eyes staring at me are sparkling and her face is beaming with a smile that spreads from one side to the other.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a clean nightgown and the evidence of her recent shower still lingers in the air\u2013the fragrance of her favorite fruity, floral body wash and shampoo. I\u2019m guessing a shower\u2013rather than a complication with her health\u2013was the delay. \u201cSomeone looks chipper. And beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I cross the room and kiss the top of her hair. I admit the sweet plum and orchid scent is more preferable to the former one. \u201cYou smell really good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure his scent was all over me. Being close had to be nearly intolerable for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d She scoots over so I\u2019m able to sit on the bed next to her. I cup her hand in mine and bring it to my lips for a kiss. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d She\u2019s no longer blocking me so I feel her happiness and her joy is apparent allover her face. She can\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cDr. Knight tells me you\u2019re strong and healthy. She expects you to make a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says I\u2019m very lucky my heart was strong enough to pump oxygen to my organs after the massive blood loss.\u201d She points to the beside table. \u201cGood thing I can swallow big pills. The vitamins she left for me are enormous.\u201d</p><p>Her heart is pounding faster and gaining speed with every beat. \u201cWhat is it, baby doll?\u201d Her eyes become glassy and I try to sort through her emotions. Happiness. Joy. Fear. They\u2019re all running together and I can\u2019t decipher which is the strongest. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Avery. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in the world is wrong.\u201d She reaches for my hand and places my palm against her lower belly. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of you growing inside me.\u201d She places her hand on top of mine and presses firmly. \u201cOur child is right here beneath your hand.\u201d</p> <p>I had already convinced myself she was pregnant because I wanted it so badly. I\u2019d believed it in my mind for a couple of weeks now\u2013and even gotten used to the idea\u2013but hearing her confirmation is surreal. The words are almost dream-like. \u201cDr. Knight confirmed it?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s smiling as she nods. \u201cShe wants to see us in her office tomorrow so she can start monitoring the growth. I\u2019m much earlier than Chansey was when she first saw her so she told me to not worry if we can\u2019t see anything with the ultrasound yet.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no mystery as to when she became pregnant. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to figure out how far along you are. Two weeks and two days as of midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how Dr. Knight told me they calculate due dates. It\u2019s counted by the day I started my last period so technically I\u2019m considered four weeks pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Already a month? I know it was Marsala\u2019s fault that Chansey delivered the twins early but she wasn\u2019t even three full months pregnant when they were born. They were on the small side but fully developed so they had to be almost full term. \u201cI don\u2019t understand all that so I\u2019m rolling with whatever you and the doc say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe discover we\u2019re soul mates and then get separated for sixteen days. When we reunite, we find out we\u2019re expecting a baby\u2013or maybe even more than one. That\u2019s not the norm on any level. Are you okay with all of this?\u201d</p> <p>She really has no idea. \u201cI\u2019m so much more than okay with this.\u201d</p><p>Avery leans forward and grabs my face, planting a sweet kiss against my lips. Our mouths mold to one another as I move over her, careful to not press too much of my weight against her. I feel her hands pushing at the comforter so I lift my body and together we eliminate the barrier between us.</p><p>Our kiss is gentle\u2013yet urgent\u2013as our bodies press harder to one another. Her hands begin at my shoulders and roam until they make their way down my lower back to find the hem of my shirt. \u201cI want this off of you,\u201d she whispers in my ear before pulling it up and over my head.</p><p>Her soft voice is a reminder. It\u2019s night and the vampires in this house can hear our every word. And movement. And each sound we make. It\u2019s such an invasion of privacy but I won\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t if I tried.</p><p>I\u2019m certain Curry has joined Chansey in their quarters behind closed doors so they are shut off from all sound within the house. Oh, how I envy them that luxury.</p><p>The rest of my family is respectful so they\u2019ve probably already stepped outside or into my office but I\u2019m still asking for privacy just in case anyone within hearing range remains. \u201cGo find something to do and give me one hour of seclusion with my ag\u00e1pe. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d I don\u2019t hear movement in the house so it is as I suspected. We\u2019re already alone.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a mischievous grin. \u201cOnly an hour? What I have on my mind might take the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been distracted for a couple of weeks so I haven\u2019t contacted the contractor about the new construction.\u201d I trail kisses across her jaw and down the side of her neck. \u201cI promise to get on that first thing in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>Her hands are sliding up and down my back. Her gown gathers at her hips as she brings her legs up and around my waist. \u201cGood idea. The sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>We were only able to experience this kind of connection once before we were separated but I know this time will be different. I won\u2019t drink from Avery, yet I\u2019ll experience the best of both the human and vampire worlds.</p><p>I slide my hands from the back of her knees up her thighs. My palms are inside her panties and I squeeze her bottom as I pull her hard against me. She reaches between us and yanks the button of my jeans open before sliding the zipper down. She pushes them with her hands until they\u2019re low enough for her toes to hook around the waist and take them off. \u201cWhoa, baby doll. That takes talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a one hit wonder. I can do the same with these.\u201d She hooks her toes around the waistband of my boxers and repeats the process.</p><p>I\u2019m bare and I love the way her satin clad body feels against my skin but I want her naked so I gather the bottom of her gown and push it up. She rises from the bed so I\u2019m able to lift it over her head. I toss it over my shoulder and push my fingers in the waistband of her panties and pull them down her legs so I can toss them next to their matching companion on the floor.</p><p>She\u2019s lying naked and I have to stop to take in the beauty of my child\u2019s mother. I place my palm on her flat stomach and I\u2019m overwhelmed by the thought of our baby inside her. \u201cI will love this child of ours with all of my heart and I will protect him or her with my life.\u201d I lower my mouth to her abdomen and place a kiss below her belly button.</p><p>Her fingers glide through the top of my hair. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier. My life feels complete for the first time.\u201d</p><p>I kiss my way up from her abdomen until my mouth finds hers again. She relaxes her legs and my body nestles between them. \u201cYou\u2019re sure this is safe for the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor approved. I asked.\u201d</p><p>My elbows are resting on each side of her head and I cradle her face with my hands. \u201cI love you, my ag\u00e1pe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pressed against her warm, welcoming body when she shifts slightly for the perfect position. \u201cAnd I love you as well, my vampire.\u201d</p><p>Her hips lift to meet me as I gently push myself inside her. She smiles as I begin to move and meets every one of my thrusts with one of her own. We find our perfect rhythm together and enter that magical place where only the two of us exist.</p><p>And this time is different\u2013even more beautiful than I imagined. There are feelings and connections happening that we\u2019ve yet to experience. And the deep affection between us is so strong that it deserves a new name because the word love simply can\u2019t do it justice. But all words are unnecessary when we\u2019re like this.</p><p>Avery\u2019s body tenses as she pants through her mouth. I feel her body contract around me\u2013squeezing like a tight glove\u2013and I can\u2019t stop the incomprehensible garble leaving my mouth as I empty myself inside her.</p><p>She goes totally limp beneath me. \u201cI second that.\u201d</p><p>She giggles as I relax against her and every inch of my body from head to toe is euphoric. \u201cI have no idea what I just said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either but it made total sense when I heard it come from your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>It\u2019s almost dawn when I hear the family return to the compound. They showed extreme kindness by leaving for the entire night so Avery and I could have privacy. I\u2019m not sure where they went but I\u2019ll need to find a way to thank them.</p><p>It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock and Avery is still sleeping. She\u2019s quite the sleepyhead this morning but I suppose that\u2019s to be expected after everything she\u2019s experienced these past two weeks. And since she\u2019s pregnant.</p><p>I trail my fingers down her arm and stop when I see a large purple and yellow bruise on the inside of her wrist. I lift her arm\u2013careful to not disturb her sleep\u2013and see bite marks up and down the length of her arm. I shift to inspect the other one and find the same types of crescent shaped contusions.</p><p>No vampire will ever drink from my ag\u00e1pe again. Including myself.</p><p>I lie next to Avery as she sleeps and I remain perfectly still as only a vampire is capable. I\u2019m not educated on the growth and development of a baby. I think it\u2019s too early for a human embryo\u2019s heart to beat but I listen closely for any evidence of our baby\u2019s existence. I hear nothing so I carefully move closer and place my ear against Avery\u2019s lower abdomen.</p><p>The sound is so faint it\u2019s almost nonexistent but I hear it. Lub-dub. Lub-dub. Lub-dub. I\u2019ve never heard anything more astonishing in my entire existence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m startled when I feel Avery\u2019s fingers in my hair. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a little rattled by what I\u2019ve just heard. \u201cI wanted to see if I could hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s amused by my anxiousness. \u201cI think it\u2019s a little early for that. Dr. Knight doesn\u2019t even think we\u2019ll see anything on the ultrasound today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I do. I hear it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow large. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very faint but it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s simultaneously happy and sad. \u201cI wish I could hear it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have listened. It\u2019s not right that I\u2019m able to hear the heartbeat when she can\u2019t, especially when she\u2019s the one carrying our baby inside her body. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That wasn\u2019t fair to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m thrilled to know there\u2019s already a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>My mind is whirling. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a way for you to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. Your hearing is far better than any type of equipment Dr. Knight will have in her office.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not what I had in mind at all. \u201cNo. I wonder if you\u2019d be able to hear it through our connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea if nothing else. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to try so I\u2019m up for it.\u201d</p><p>I place my ear to her lower abdomen. \u201cConcentrate on our place where it\u2019s only us.\u201d She strokes my hair and I close my eyes so I can focus as well. I listen until I\u2019m able to pick up on the sound again and then I centralize all of my thoughts on connecting with Avery.</p> <p>Our connection comes easy and I sense how hard she\u2019s trying to find the sound within my head. It\u2019s a peculiar feeling\u2013one I\u2019ve never experienced\u2013and then I feel her burst of happiness and know she is able to hear our baby\u2019s heart beating.</p><p>She\u2019s silent and perfectly still but the happiness animating from her is unmistakable. \u201cI hear it. It\u2019s hard to wrap my head around it being so tiny and already so amazing.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she can\u2019t believe it but I can. \u201cThis baby is genetically tied to you so it doesn\u2019t have much choice in the amazing department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou contributed half the genes and I happen to think you rank pretty high in the amazing department yourself.\u201d She leans up and kisses the top of my head. \u201cThank you for giving me this baby. And for giving me the gift of hearing it\u2019s beating heart. I\u2019m glad you and I were able to do that together at home instead of in a doctor\u2019s office using cold, foreign instruments.\u201d</p><p>She laces her fingers with mine. \u201cI\u2019m happy I was able to give you that, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m able to give you something as equally special one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d Nothing could top the special gift she was giving me but I had thought of something else I wanted from her. Now wasn\u2019t the right time to bring it up. I needed perfect words\u2013and a beautiful ring\u2013so she would give me the answer I desperately wanted to hear.</p><p>I\u2019m driving Avery in my black Lexus convertible to her first prenatal appointment with Dr. Knight. I bought the car about a month after she came to live with us. I was searching for anything that might bring some distraction from her presence but looking back on that decision, it seems so ridiculous now. What kind of vampire buys a convertible he can never drive in the sun with the top down?</p> <p>Oddly enough, I can now if I\u2019m willing to accept the minor sting that goes along with sun exposure. But this car isn\u2019t baby friendly so I guess I\u2019m trading it for something designed to fit a family.</p><p>Weird. I\u2019m thinking like a human husband and father.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s picked up on my internal conversation with myself. \u201cThis car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is it amusing?\u201d she asks. \u201cI happen to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get rid of it after I\u2019m able to drop the top and drive it in the sun. The irony of it is humorous to me.\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand in hers. \u201cI say keep it and enjoy the sun.\u201d</p><p>Most women wouldn\u2019t want their mate driving around in a car that gets so much attention. \u201cYou\u2019d be okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I be if it brings you joy?\u201d We are mates. She knows I wouldn\u2019t look in another woman\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWe need something for a family. I guess I\u2019ll get rid of one of the other vehicles since the garage won\u2019t hold another.\u201d I have too many anyway. I can only drive one car at a time.</p><p>I have chased pleasure in material things since becoming a vampire but nothing has ever fulfilled the need inside of me until Avery. My fruitless search for happiness is finally over because I have everything I need in her. Except my ring on her finger but I plan to remedy that as soon as possible. We aren\u2019t bound by human standards but it only seems right for her to be my wife before this baby arrives.</p><p>Avery is sitting on the exam table clutching her gown closed when Dr. Knight and a nurse enter the exam room. She takes a seat on a rolling stool. \u201cHow do you feel this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Her voice is cheerful.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Solomon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dr. Knight rolls over to the exam table and positions Avery. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the routine stuff out of the way and then move on to the fun part.\u201d I don\u2019t look after they place a drape over her legs and I hear the sound of metal clanking. I don\u2019t even want to know what\u2019s going on under that sheet.</p><p>No more than two minutes and she\u2019s finished with what she referred to as routine stuff. \u201cYou can slide up the table.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Knight holds the probe for the ultrasound in her hand as the nurse squirts clear jelly on top of Avery\u2019s belly. She places the wand in the goo and slides it back and forth a few times to spread it. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have hiding in here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s watching the screen as she moves the probe one way and then another but I have no idea what it is I\u2019m looking at. \u201cThere it is.\u201d She points toward a white spot. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be able to see it with the abdominal ultrasound but there\u2019s your baby.\u201d</p><p>She said baby so that means she sees one. But then again there was only one on Chansey\u2019s first ultrasound.</p><p>She presses some buttons. \u201cI\u2019m going to do some measurements to see how far along you are.\u201d She enters the data and a date pops up on the screen. \u201cYou\u2019re measuring around six weeks.\u201d Six weeks is still a tiny baby but it\u2019s already two weeks bigger than it should be.</p><p>Dr. Knight talks to us in terms she would use for all of her patients because the nurse is present but we all know the information is to be disregarded. This pregnancy is already showing signs of abnormality\u2013just as Chansey\u2019s did\u2013but at least we have something to compare it to. Curry and Chansey weren\u2019t that lucky.</p><p>Dr. Knight is busy entering charting into the computer. \u201cI\u2019ll just be another minute, Jane. You can set up the room for our next patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The door closes and she looks up from the computer. \u201cWe should scan you once a week to track the growth and watch for the appearance of a second baby. We should expect the unexpected so I want you to call me immediately if anything unusual happens.\u201d</p><p>I need to hear her affirmation because I don\u2019t want to assume anything. \u201cYou think everything looks all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a normal six week pregnancy but we already know how deceiving the first glance can be. We\u2019ll have to wait to see how things progress but I think we should expect rapid development since we know the exact date you conceived and you\u2019re already measuring ahead. I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re looking at approximately three months if this pregnancy follows the same growth curve as Chansey\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Three months. It\u2019s the timeframe I imagined in my head but hearing Dr. Knight say it makes it feel ... real.</p><p>Avery is quiet on the ride back to the compound. She\u2019s full of joy as she stares at the ultrasound picture in her hand\u2013and I am too\u2013but I can\u2019t stop the worry I feel. I try to push it away so she doesn\u2019t pick up on it but I\u2019m unsuccessful since I haven\u2019t had practice. \u201cThis baby and I are going to be fine so please stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your protector but I\u2019m helpless to control the situation. It isn\u2019t a reassuring place for me to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite sure all fathers experience the same uncertainties you\u2019re having right now.\u201d</p><p>Our situation is unique\u2013only known to have occurred one other time. \u201cThere\u2019s only one other father that\u2019s shared the fear I have right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s your best friend and you can talk to him about your worries.\u201d I\u2019m lucky in that regard but so many complications can pop up over the next couple of months. Seeing Avery hold a healthy baby in her arms is the only thing that\u2019ll give me peace of mind.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>My conversations with Curry this week have eased my mind. Minimally. I remain consumed by my fear for Avery\u2019s well-being and the safety of our child has been added to my list of concerns. But it\u2019s a gift. Not a curse.</p><p>I managed to slip away from Avery one day earlier in the week. I scheduled a meeting with Jim Graff about the new construction of our private quarters\u2013per Curry\u2019s advice\u2013so she wouldn\u2019t suspect my true reason for needing to leave the compound.</p><p>Avery\u2019s in the bathroom preparing for bed so I take the white leather box from the drawer where it\u2019s been hidden. I\u2019ve stolen glances at it the last few days at every opportunity but this would be the last. I\u2019d be seeing it on my ag\u00e1pe\u2019s finger from this night forward.</p><p>I return the platinum and diamond ring to the top drawer of the nightstand not a moment too soon as Avery is coming out of the bathroom. She\u2019s dressed for bed in a champagne satin gown and I love the way the color brings out the flaxen highlights in her hair and flecks of gold in her light brown eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulls back the covers and climbs into bed next to me. She reaches for the lamp on her nightstand. \u201cLeave the light on.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you needed light to see.\u201d</p><p>My vision isn\u2019t what it used to be before she came into my life but I\u2019m far from needing the dim light of a single lightbulb to see. \u201cI don\u2019t but you do.\u201d</p> <p>She slides over and runs her hand down my stomach. \u201cAnd just what is it you want me to see?\u201d I take her hand to bring it to my lips for a kiss and it earns me a look of curiosity from her. \u201cYou\u2019re up to something.\u201d</p><p>I certainly am. \u201cYou were gone for sixteen days and I never stopped thinking of you for a second. Not once. It was a lot of time for me to consider our future and I came to a conclusion. We aren\u2019t a mundane couple but we live in a human world. You and I aren\u2019t bound by the practices of mortals but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t follow their traditions.\u201d I take her hand and pull her to sit on the side of the bed before I open the drawer of the nightstand.</p><p>She\u2019s surprised. This isn\u2019t where she thought I was going when I asked her to leave the light on.</p><p>I drop to my knee before I open the ring box. \u201cWe\u2019re bound for eternity by something far stronger than human vows but it doesn\u2019t stop me from wanting you as my wife.\u201d I take the ring from the box and hold it up for her. \u201cThe bond we share is something the world can\u2019t see but this is an outward symbol of our love. I want every pair of eyes looking at you\u2013both human and vampire\u2013to see this so they\u2019ll know you\u2019re mine forever. I love you, Avery Violet Ferrand. Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s beaming. \u201cI love you Solomon Braham Alexander and I\u2019d be very happy to marry you.\u201d I slide the ring on her finger and it\u2019s a perfect fit. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2013exactly what I would have chosen for myself.\u201d</p> <p>I rise from my knees and take her face in my hands before I kiss her. Hard. A moment later she pulls away to catch her breath. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>I press my forehead to hers and hope she\u2019s as eager as I am to make this happen as soon as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s grinning. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s the right thing to do since you\u2019ve knocked me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d I couldn\u2019t think of one good reason to wait. I can\u2019t imagine her wanting a big wedding since Jenn is her only remaining relative. And since her sister still remains MIA after the Vincent incident, we\u2019re her only family now. \u201cWould you do it next weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do it this minute.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t envision us standing in a courthouse before a judge making vows to one another. \u201cHow do you feel about doing it here at the compound since this is where we became us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a more perfect place.\u201d</p><p>Our wedding was small. Jenn returned just in time to be present so only those we consider family were present as witnesses. It was perfect and I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.</p><p>Dr. Knight encouraged us to honeymoon nearby so I rented a house on the beach about thirty miles from the compound. It\u2019s not what I consider an ideal place to spend my wedding night but we aren\u2019t left with much of a choice considering the short notice and limited travel. At least we have the entire place to ourselves.</p><p>The house is modern\u2013which I appreciate\u2013but the entire decor is beach and nautical themed. It\u2019s not my cup of tea. Nor is it very romantic. I would have preferred a honeymoon that included us traveling the world for two or three weeks but I happily sacrifice that for the sake of Avery and her pregnancy. Maybe that can be an anniversary trip one day.</p><p>We enter the master bedroom and I scan it after flipping on the bedroom light. The bedding is off-white. The walls are beige and the ceramic tile floor is a blend of cream and khaki. The furniture resembles driftwood but it\u2019s the decorative pictures of the beach that complete the bland seaside theme.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s charming.\u201d She attempts to hide the disappointment in her voice.</p><p>I laugh aloud, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d It\u2019s a typical beach house for vacationers. There\u2019s nothing alluring or seductive about it at all. That means I\u2019ll have to work hard to make her forget we\u2019re not in a romantic honeymoon suite halfway around the world.</p><p>She walks over to the double french doors and swings them open before stepping onto the balcony overlooking the ocean. Her hair rustles from the breeze blowing off the water. \u201cI love the sound of the waves rushing in. Especially at night.\u201d</p> <p>The beach is a new surrounding for me. None of my vampire days have been spent in the sand and sun but I walked the beach at Pascagoula one night while checking in on Curry. I was quite fond of the way the sand felt on my bare feet so hopefully that is something we could do while here.</p><p>I approach my bride to wrap my arms around her from behind and I place a kiss on the side of her neck. \u201cThen we shall leave these open so you can listen all night if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>She links her fingers through mine and brings my hand up. She kisses the wedding band she placed on my finger only a few hours earlier. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re married with two babies on the way in a couple of months. I don\u2019t think our lives could be happening any quicker if someone hit the fast forward button.\u201d</p><p>Although I knew it was a possibility, I was still in shock about finding another baby on our second visit with Dr. Knight.</p><p>I slide my hands over Avery\u2019s belly. \u201cI hope Jim is able to finish the construction before these two get here.\u201d</p><p>She places her hands on top of mine. \u201cHe will. He wants that bonus you promised for finishing the job in six weeks.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s a good man. He\u2019d work hard to complete the job early even if I hadn\u2019t offered the extra money. \u201cHe did a fantastic job on the compound so I don\u2019t expect less from him now.\u201d Unless the weather didn\u2019t hold and that would be no fault of his.</p><p>She turns and slides her hands up my arms until they\u2019re resting over my shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll do what we have to if we don\u2019t have our own quarters when they get here.\u201d</p><p>I plant a kiss on her mouth. \u201cMy wife, you are amazing.\u201d</p><p>She lowers her hands to my hips and pulls me hard against her. \u201cMy husband, you haven\u2019t seen amazing but you\u2019re about to.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Someone is feeling a bit frisky. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna bring it.\u201d She sucks my bottom lip into her mouth before releasing it. \u201cGive me a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep me waiting long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She disappears into the bathroom and I work quickly to light the candles throughout the room. I place my phone on the nightstand and choose the playlist I had created earlier in the week. A sweet, slow tempo song begins playing and I remember the rose petals Gia and Lairah sent with me. I scramble through the luggage and find them tucked away in the side pocket. I hope they haven\u2019t dried out. Crunching sounds beneath us on the bed isn\u2019t an appealing thought. I take a few out and they\u2019re still soft and moist so I toss them randomly across the bed.</p><p>Shit. I suck at this but it\u2019s too late now because I hear her turn the door knob.</p><p>She opens the bathroom door and is wearing a white lace chemise. It\u2019s sheer so I can see her body beneath, including her string bikini\u2019s tiny triangle that barely covers anything.</p><p>She\u2019s stunning. And all mine. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I think she\u2019s blushing. \u201cI\u2019m no virgin but it didn\u2019t feel right to wear any other color on our wedding night.\u201d It almost sounds like an apology.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d I take her hands after she walks to me and I pull her to stand between my legs. I glide my hands under her chemise over her bottom. \u201cI don\u2019t want a frightened virginal bride tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because you\u2019re getting a wife with a case of raging pregnancy hormones.\u201d</p><p>Hmm ... Raging pregnancy hormones. That sounds like it could go either way. Really bad or really great. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful you mean that in a good way.\u201d She propels herself at me and we tumble back on the bed.</p><p>Oh, yeah. She means it in the best possible way.</p><p>She straddles me and unbuttons my shirt. Her lips are everywhere at once. My mouth. My shoulder. My chest. She\u2019s giving me some raging hormones as well.</p><p>I flip with her so I\u2019m on top and shed my shirt before she brings her legs up and around my waist. I\u2019m exploring my wife\u2019s body with my mouth but I stop to kiss her belly and she runs her fingers through my hair. It\u2019s early in the pregnancy but her body is already changing. I feel a slight protruding firmness that wasn\u2019t there when we made love a few days ago. \u201cI can tell they\u2019ve grown.\u201d I place one last kiss there before slipping my fingers under the strings on each of her hips and pulling downward.</p><p>She lifts her bottom to assist me and then sits up and pulls her chemise over her head. She tosses it to the floor and reaches for the button of my pants so she can help to rid me of them and my underwear.</p><p>This is it. I\u2019ve made love to my ag\u00e1pe many times but now I\u2019m going to make love to my wife.</p><p>I lower myself and claim her mouth again. Mmm ... her kisses are sweeter than honey. And I feel like I\u2019m able to enjoy Avery for the first time. I mean truly take pleasure in the joining of our bodies since I\u2019m always inclined to fear someone in the house will overhear the sounds of our intimacy\u2013intentional or not. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been alone under the same roof. Ever.\u201d Everyone questioned my control with Avery in the beginning and it was a while before anyone would even consider leaving us alone together.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time we were in the same room without anyone else around. We were in your office.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to remind me. I could recall the moment perfectly. \u201cI was sitting in your chair and you were leaning over my shoulder as we searched through the vampire archives.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t concentrate on those stupid records because I was imagining what your reaction would be if I kissed the bare skin on your shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so distracted by your warm breath next to my ear. I wanted to turn my head so my face could brush yours.\u201d She mimics the motion. \u201cI had almost built up the courage and then Curry showed up and freaked out.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to take advantage of this alone time. I usually allowed our connection to speak for me since I always feared being heard but I wouldn\u2019t be silent while we were here. I had a lot of things I wanted to say to my wife.</p> <p>I glide my hand down and cup one of her breasts as I take the other into my mouth. I\u2019m gentle because I suspect they\u2019re tender from the pregnancy. I roll my tongue over her nipple and it instantly hardens. \u201cI\u2019ve never told you how perfectly beautiful these are or how much I love them.\u201d</p><p>She pushes her fingers into my hair and arches her back from the bed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never told you how good it feels when you do that. I love it.\u201d</p><p>I hear her breath increasing. \u201cI love to hear the change in your breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too. It means you\u2019re doing something really right.\u201d</p><p>I move lower, back to her stomach. \u201cI love your body and the changes I\u2019m seeing happen right before my eyes.\u201d I kiss her belly again. \u201cYou have no idea how much I love knowing there\u2019s a part of me growing inside you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget there\u2019s two little parts of you in there.\u201d Like Chansey, Avery doesn\u2019t acknowledge the fylgia possibility. To do so would be admitting we would lose a child and that isn\u2019t a consideration in Avery\u2019s book.</p><p>Her ag\u00e1pe scent is overpowering my control and I climb her body. \u201cI need to be inside you. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly where I want you.\u201d She lifts her hips and matches my thrust as I enter her. It\u2019s different because we\u2019re letting go for the first time\u2013giving in to what comes naturally instead of exercising restraint.</p><p>\u201cAah,\u201d I hiss through my teeth. \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she moans while meeting me thrust for thrust. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>It isn\u2019t easy to let go of my self-restraint. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you or the babies.\u201d</p> <p>She grabs my face. \u201cI won\u2019t break and the babies are tucked safely in their little cocoons.\u201d</p><p>She wants more so I don\u2019t hold back. I\u2019m persistent until her internal body contracts around me. \u201cAah. Aah. Right there. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d She\u2019s squeezing me almost painfully as I tense and empty my body inside of hers.</p><p>She goes limp beneath me and I roll to lie beside her. I reach for her hand and lace our fingers before bringing it to my lips for a kiss. \u201cI love you, my wife. My ag\u00e1pe. And mother of my children.\u201d</p><p>She in turn kisses my hand. \u201cAnd I love you, husband. My vampire. And father of my children.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>It\u2019s only a few days until Avery\u2019s pregnancy hits the three month mark. She\u2019s already been pregnant two weeks longer than Chansey. She\u2019s disappointed we don\u2019t have babies yet but no one knows the expected gestation for ag\u00e1pe-vampire babies so it\u2019s a waiting game. However, we\u2019ve figured out the standard for misery. And the bar is high.</p><p>It isn\u2019t easy for her\u2013it\u2019s actually terrible\u2013but she doesn\u2019t complain. I try everything I can think of to make her more comfortable but there\u2019s little I can do.</p><p>The ultrasound she had three days ago predicts each baby is around seven pounds so she has two full term infants pressing her internal organs in multiple directions. There\u2019s only one cure for what ails her and I have no control over it. I feel helpless.</p> <p>\u201cWant me to rub your feet, baby doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. They\u2019re too swollen. It feels like pins and needles poking when you touch them.\u201d That means anything including a massage is out of the question. \u201cBut I\u2019d love for you to read to me. Your voice is soothing.\u201d</p><p>She loves hearing me read. She always chooses a classic because she says I become so lost in the words that my speech takes on a different voice\u2013one from a different era. I hear some of the vocalization she refers to and I agree. I sound the way I did when I was a human living in the seventeen hundreds. \u201cOf course I will. I\u2019d stand on my head if it made you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Our reading time ritual began before I knew Avery was my ag\u00e1pe but it\u2019s something we continued to do because we enjoy the peaceful time together. We once snuck behind closed doors to do it and the vast majority of those stolen moments were spent with her lying next to me as I read from her favorite classic books.</p><p>I already know which one she wants me to read from without asking. The Scarlet Letter. \u201cWhich chapter would you like to hear?\u201d</p><p>She knows it well and loves it dearly because we were once so similar to Arthur Dimmesdale and Hester Prynne in how we hid our love from the others out of shame, fear, and ridicule. \u201cChapter six. I want to hear about Pearl and what a beauty she is.\u201d Pearl\u2013the beautiful child that came at the highest price costing Hester Prynne everything she had. And in turn, she became her mother\u2019s only treasure.</p><p>Avery turns onto her side and wedges a pillow beneath her swollen pregnant abdomen for support so we can assume the position we always use for reading time. I scoot close to her back until our bodies are molded into one and open the original unrestored first edition I purchased for her as a wedding gift.</p><p>I begin reading Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s words about Pearl\u2013a lovely and immortal flower without a single physical defect. I couldn\u2019t guess how many times I had repeated these lines about how the child is perfect and worthy of being brought forth in Eden.</p><p>I speak softly, much like I would if telling a child her bedtime story. I feel Avery\u2019s body relax and she falls asleep within a matter of minutes. I\u2019m glad because the exhaustion she\u2019s experiencing from insomnia isn\u2019t good for her and restful sleep doesn\u2019t find her near enough these days.</p><p>I place the book on the bed and drape my arm over her waist to place my hand on her swollen abdomen. There\u2019s a lot of vigorous activity happening between these two tonight. I have no idea how she\u2019s sleeping with the karate showdown happening inside her right now. Hopefully they\u2019re trying to fight their way out.</p><p>I eventually fall asleep next to Avery but I wake when I hear moaning and heavy breathing. \u201cOhhh.\u201d I lift my head to peek over her shoulder because I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s groaning in her sleep or is awake and in pain. She rolls toward me when she feels the bed shift. \u201cI\u2019m hurting\u2013but in a good kind of way. I think I\u2019m going into labor.\u201d</p><p>I shoot up from where I\u2019m lying. \u201cIs this the first pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They were irregular when they started but now they\u2019re every four or five minutes.\u201d</p><p>How long has this been going on if they\u2019re that often? \u201cWhen did they start?\u201d</p><p>She rubs her belly. \u201cA couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re exhausted too. You were sleeping like the dead so I thought you needed your rest.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s being considerate but I wish she had woken me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been lying here having contractions for two hours while I slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m gonna need you to be well-rested so you can help me later. Consider it a conspiracy to weasel work out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad, baby doll.\u201d I rub her hip. \u201cWhere are you hurting?\u201d</p><p>She shows me using her hands. \u201cIt starts in my back and radiates around to my lower abdomen.\u201d</p><p>I know pain is part of the normal laboring process but I want to take it away from her. \u201cCan I do anything to make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I just want to get up and walk to see if that feels better.\u201d</p><p>I slide from the bed and help her to her feet. \u201cShould I take you to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>Avery leans over and uses the dresser for support. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to be seen by the staff any more than necessary. I sure don\u2019t want to be sent home so let me make sure the pains aren\u2019t gonna stop. If I\u2019m still having them in an hour then we\u2019ll give Dr. Knight a call and see what she wants us to do.\u201d</p><p>An hour passes and the contractions are coming every three to four minutes and progressively getting stronger. \u201cYou\u2019re breathing louder and moaning more often. I think it\u2019s time to call Dr. Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue with you. I\u2019m hurting pretty bad so I think this is it. If it\u2019s not, I better be worrying.\u201d</p><p>I phone Dr. Knight and she\u2019s easily convinced by my description that Avery is most likely going into labor. \u201cOkay. She\u2019s gonna meet us at the hospital.\u201d Avery is leaning over the bed rubbing her lower back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m just trying to relieve the pressure. It feels like they\u2019re gonna drop out any moment.\u201d Oh shit. I hope we didn\u2019t wait around too long.</p><p>I scoop her from the floor and carry her toward the car. \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous. I can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can but it\u2019s not fast enough to suit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d I say those two simple words as I cross the living room with Avery in my arms and the room becomes chaotic.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Lairah asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to stand around answering their questions so I continue walking as I call out over my shoulder, \u201cContractions every three to four minutes so we\u2019re meeting Dr. Knight at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Her suitcase. I forgot to grab it. \u201cLairah. Can you get the bag Avery packed for the hospital? It\u2019s in the chair next to our bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d she says.</p><p>I stop to catch a breath before starting the ignition after Lairah places Avery\u2019s bag in the backseat of our new sports utility vehicle. \u201cDo we need someone to ride with us just in case?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wrinkles her brow the way she does when she\u2019s confused. \u201cIn case of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. In case a baby starts coming out.\u201d She glares at me like I\u2019m nuts. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s been known to happen. And there\u2019s two in there. The second one could shove the first one out.\u201d</p><p>She has a worried look on her face\u2013almost one of panic\u2013so she rolls her window down and calls out, \u201cWill someone ride with us? Just in case.\u201d</p> <p>I lean over and add, \u201cOne of the girls.\u201d</p><p>Even if something happens on the way, I\u2019m not letting one of these guys see what only belongs to me. \u201cI won\u2019t have to kill Lairah or Gia if they see you naked.\u201d</p><p>Lairah volunteers and climbs into the backseat. \u201cYou know it\u2019s only like a fifteen minute drive to the hospital, right?\u201d She\u2019s nonchalant as if nothing could happen in that amount of time.</p><p>I put the vehicle into drive and pull away from the house. \u201cAvery\u2019s feeling pressure.\u201d</p><p>I see her gaping reflection when I look up into the rearview mirror. \u201cWhoa. You didn\u2019t say that part when you asked for volunteers.\u201d</p> <p>I pull onto the road before she has time to consider getting out of the car. \u201cThat was for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d She scoots to the middle of the backseat and leans forward. She peers over and sees Avery holding her abdomen. \u201cStep on it, buffoon. No way your wife is hatching in this car on the way to the hospital if I\u2019m in here.\u201d</p><p>I take Lairah\u2019s advice for the first time in my existence and drive much faster than I should. I breathe a sigh of relief when I pull up at the admissions entrance and see a staff member waiting with a wheelchair. \u201cYou must be Mrs. Alexander. Dr. Knight called ahead and instructed us to be waiting for you at the entrance.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s put to bed and fetal monitors are applied to record the heartbeats of our babies. A labor and delivery nurse begins a health questionnaire and Dr. Knight enters just as she is finishing up. The good doc makes her usual opening joke\u2013to put Avery at ease about what\u2019s going to happen next\u2013but then she gets down to the real reason we\u2019re here when she puts on an exam glove. She lowers the head of Avery\u2019s bed and then her hand disappears under the covers between her legs. I might be a little weirded out about it if I hadn\u2019t already seen her do it in the office. \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely changed from the last time I checked you. How much were you dilated last time I checked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo to three centimeters and seventy-five percent effaced.\u201d</p><p>She smiles as she nods. \u201cI\u2019d call you five and ninety so you\u2019re definitely in labor. Number one is still head down so I\u2019m comfortable with proceeding with a vaginal delivery if you\u2019re still on board with that.\u201d</p> <p>We had already made the decision to attempt a vaginal birth since it is safer than a major abdominal surgery. It was worth a shot. If she had to go to surgery at some point, she would be no worse off unless she delivered number one naturally and then had to go to the OR to get the second. \u201cThat\u2019s still the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Dr. Knight says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the operating room ready in the event we need it. I\u2019m satisfied to let nature continue its course since you\u2019re changing your cervix. I know you had thought of doing this without an epidural but I really prefer you have one placed. If the first baby delivers and I need to give the second one some help on getting out quicker, you won\u2019t appreciate the pain associated with the things I\u2019ll need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will happily take something for this pain.\u201d That was a different tune than the one she had been singing about wanting to give birth naturally without pain meds.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the nurse says. \u201cI just need to do a few things and then I\u2019ll let anesthesia know we\u2019re ready to get started.\u201d</p><p>She waits until the nurse is gone and then looks in my direction. \u201cAre you disappointed in me for getting an epidural?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t possibly be let down by her decision. \u201cI never wanted you to have these babies without something for pain. You came up with that on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to have something. The pain is so much worse than I expected and now I\u2019m worried about Dr. Knight needing to reach inside to help the second baby. I think that\u2019ll be really painful without the epidural.\u201d</p><p>Ugh! I didn\u2019t need that visual in my head. \u201cGet the epidural so you can rest and be ready when it\u2019s time for the babies to come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll need my strength when it\u2019s time for the delivery.\u201d</p><p>The next half hour is spent starting an IV and giving her fluids. I\u2019m allowed to stay while the epidural is placed but I take a seat in the chair across the room where I don\u2019t take so much as a peek at what they are doing to my wife.</p><p>The placement is quick and easy and Avery is dozing before it\u2019s fully effective. Her body doesn\u2019t require the full dose to kick in for her to fall asleep because she\u2019s so exhausted. The pregnancy had taken its toll on her body and I would never forget how she tolerated it with a smile on her face.</p><p>The nurse doesn\u2019t wait long before she\u2019s back and ready to examine Avery. I had hoped she would be able to get a little sleep. \u201cWow. I think you were made for birthing babies. You\u2019re already complete and number one\u2019s head is pretty low.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m terrified. \u201cThat means it\u2019s time to deliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means it\u2019s time to push,\u201d she laughs. \u201cPushing and delivering are two different things.\u201d I think I entertain her because I know so little about this process. \u201cThe pushing part can be over with quickly or it can take a while depending on how numb she is from the epidural.\u201d</p><p>Avery wiggles her feet. \u201cI\u2019m not all that numb. I feel my legs and I\u2019m able to move them but I\u2019m not hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the perfect epidural when you have muscle control but you\u2019re not in pain. It\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019ll be able to push well.\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s body must be perfect for birthing because it doesn\u2019t take long for her to have the first baby ready for delivery. Dr. Knight enters the room and a frenzy of blue scrubs rush in behind her. \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed. We always have the neonatal intensive care unit present for twin deliveries.\u201d</p><p>Avery smiles at me and I hold her hand while Dr. Knight is gowning up for delivery. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we are about to meet our babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd find out what they are.\u201d Huge tears form in her eyes and I lean forward to press my face into her hair as she whispers, \u201cAm I a terrible mother for praying they aren\u2019t both girls?\u201d</p><p>I had never had the guts to say it aloud but I had prayed the same prayer. \u201cNo,\u201d I keep my voice low. \u201cYou are a wonderful mother looking out for the well-being of our children.\u201d</p><p>She pulls me closer and becomes the one pressing her face into my hair. \u201cIt makes me feel guilty to pray for such a thing if there are two healthy little girls in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have faith that both of these babies are healthy no matter their gender. Don\u2019t freak out if the first one is a girl because it doesn\u2019t mean the next is a guaranteed fylgia. It could be a boy or another healthy girl.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Knight pats Avery on the leg. \u201cI want you to push really hard with your next contraction.\u201d</p><p>Avery nods her understanding and less than a minute passes before she has another contraction. \u201cI think it\u2019s starting because I feel the pressure building.\u201d</p><p>The nurse counts and instructs Avery on pushing as Dr. Knight reaches for instruments on the table by her side. I hear a snip and I don\u2019t even want to know what she just cut. \u201cOkay. Here comes the first one.\u201d</p><p>I peer over the blue drape just in time to see a bright pink little person come out of my wife and I hold my breath as Dr. Knight places the crying baby on top of Avery\u2019s abdomen. \u201cYou have a daughter with a headful of dark hair just like her daddy.\u201d</p><p>Avery strokes her head while Dr. Knight clamps and cuts the umbilical cord. \u201cLook at her, Sol. She\u2019s beautiful. And perfect. And healthy.\u201d</p><p>And her arrival makes it impossible for me to not dwell upon the safety of the other child as I look at her.</p><p>She\u2019s screaming her head off when the staff takes her from Avery to the warmer so we can work on getting the next baby delivered. The nurse adjusts the fetal monitor for the second baby and I see the strange look on her face. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re running in the sixties.\u201d I can only assume that isn\u2019t good based on the nurse\u2019s worried expression. \u201cNow the fifties.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Knight is watching the fetal monitor and looks at the nurse. \u201cGive her some O2 by face mask.\u201d She continues watching the heart beat. \u201cAvery, the heart rate is down. I\u2019m going to give it a minute to recover. If it does then I\u2019ll let nature take its course and allow the uterus to do the work of pushing him or her into your pelvis on its own. If there isn\u2019t an increase soon I\u2019ll try to help this one come down so we can deliver vaginally.\u201d</p><p>The next sixty seconds is one of the most important moments of our lives. \u201cThere\u2019s no improvement so I\u2019m going to see if I can help this little one out of there.\u201d I watch Dr. Knight\u2019s hand\u2013and then arm\u2013disappear inside my wife. I turn away because it\u2019s more than I\u2019m able to stand seeing. \u201cThis one isn\u2019t coming on its own anytime soon and it\u2019s too high for me to safely assist. We\u2019re going to the OR if the heart rate doesn\u2019t recover within the next minute.\u201d</p><p>We already know that the fylgia is born second and dies after the safe delivery of the first infant\u2013the agape. That could very likely be what is happening now but my heart isn\u2019t ready to give up on this child. \u201cDo whatever it takes to save this baby.\u201d</p><p>Another minute passes and it feels like an eternity as we wait for the verdict. When it comes, it isn\u2019t good. \u201cThere\u2019s no improvement in the heart rate despite the oxygen. We can\u2019t wait any longer. We have to go to the OR to get this baby out now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room erupts into chaos as the staff scrambles to get Avery out of the delivery stirrups and back onto the bed so they can transport her to the OR. The staff is shouting back and forth and I\u2019m lost as to what my role just became. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Knight removes her gown and gloves and pulls me aside as the staff preps Avery. \u201cWe can\u2019t use her epidural for the cesarean because it isn\u2019t dosed with enough medicine for surgery. She\u2019ll have to go to sleep so you can\u2019t go back with her but if anything strange happens during the delivery, I\u2019ll need you to wipe it from their minds so they can\u2019t remember or document it.\u201d</p><p>A full whirlwind later, Avery is whisked from the room. I catch up and run beside her bed. I stretch upward and she rolls toward me as I kiss her forehead. \u201cI love you and everything is going to be okay.\u201d</p> <p>I just lied to my ag\u00e1pe. I have no idea if everything is going to be okay. And we both know it.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she calls out as I watch her disappear down a sterile hallway leading to the OR where I once again have no control over her safety.</p><p>\u201cYou can wait in your wife\u2019s room, Mr. Alexander.\u201d I feel numb as I return to the place where it looks like a tornado just blew through leaving empty medical supply packaging in its path.</p><p>My daughter was taken to the nursery during the chaos so I\u2019m alone behind the closed door and I drop to my knees to pray to anyone willing to hear my plea. \u201cPlease keep Avery and our child safe by placing your arms of safety around them both.\u201d I don\u2019t ask but it\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Please be a boy so we don\u2019t have to worry about losing this child.</p><p>It seems an eternity when there\u2019s finally a knock at the door. I recognize some of the staff from earlier but there\u2019s a new face in the crowd this time. And it\u2019s wrapped in a blue and pink beanie hat and soft flannel blanket. \u201cHere\u2019s your little trouble maker. I think you owe her a spanking for what she just pulled.\u201d</p> <p>My heart stumbles. She? \u201cAnother girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem surprised. Were you expecting a boy?\u201d she says as she passes the baby girl to me.</p><p>I hesitate in answering because I\u2019m too stunned as I look at my second daughter. \u201cNo. We didn\u2019t know the gender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you went the whole pregnancy without finding out what these babies were.\u201d I\u2019m so glad we didn\u2019t. We\u2019d have expected the worst if we had known they were both girls. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of pink around your place.\u201d</p><p>I immediately rack my brain to remember every detail I can recall about fylgias but all three have one thing in common. They died the moment they were born. And this child isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s very much alive and looking at me.</p><p>I pull back her beanie to look at her hair and it\u2019s different from our other daughter\u2019s. This baby is blond like Avery. They are total opposites so it isn\u2019t possible for them to be an agape and fylgia.</p> <p>I\u2019m able to relax for the first time in months knowing I have two healthy daughters. One is like me, the other like Avery. And all is right in my world.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>I\u2019m waiting in Avery\u2019s postpartum room when she\u2019s brought in from recovery. It\u2019s been more than two hours since she was rushed toward the operating room for an emergency cesarean and I\u2019m anxious to see that she\u2019s unharmed. Our connection was severed when the general anesthesia hit her vein but it\u2019s slowly wearing off because I\u2019m beginning to pick up bits and pieces of emotion from her.</p><p>I\u2019m excited to tell her about our two healthy daughters but disappointed I\u2019ll have to wait since she\u2019s still sleeping. \u201cI thought she\u2019d be awake after she left the recovery room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was hurting when she woke after surgery so we had to give her some extra pain medicine. She\u2019ll be groggy for a little while.\u201d The nurse is leaving when she turns back. \u201cShe did wake up long enough to ask about the babies.\u201d</p><p>I immediately panic. \u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. She dozed off before we could tell her she had another daughter.\u201d</p><p>Good. Avery would have lost it if she had learned the second baby was a girl. I need to be the one to tell her so I can immediately reassure her both babies are fine.</p> <p>Avery is assessed by the nurse and then left to rest until time for vital signs again. She looks so young lying in bed with her blond curls fanned out on the pillow beneath her head. The beautiful sight reminds me of what a sleeping angel might look like.</p><p>It\u2019s still night but the others have gone home. They felt it was important we have this time to bond with our new babies so I\u2019m alone with a sedated Avery when the nursery staff member brings them to the room for their first visit. Avery sleeps through the nurse\u2019s teaching about the care of our babies and I\u2019m left peering over at them in their cribs once the nurse is gone. And I\u2019m scared shitless.</p><p>They\u2019re so tiny. And fragile. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll break them so I\u2019m content to gaze at my newborn children from where I stand hovering over them. All is well for a while until one of them becomes fretful and her crying escalates into a screaming fit.</p><p>It\u2019s the dark haired one making all the fuss. I can\u2019t even call my daughter by her name because she doesn\u2019t have one. Neither of them do. We discussed a couple of options but never agreed on anything. Avery was determined one was a boy so we certainly didn\u2019t choose names for two girls.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s wrong with her but I pick my elder daughter up and hold her for the first time. She continues screaming and I rock her gently without any improvement in her mood. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want, little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSol,\u201d Avery says in the softest voice. She\u2019s finally awake so I walk to her bedside with our screaming daughter and lean over so she may see her face. \u201cThat\u2019s a welcomed sound.\u201d</p><p>She presses the button on the bed to lift the head and I feel her joy when she notices there are two cribs. \u201cI want to hold my babies.\u201d</p><p>I pass our daughter to her once she\u2019s sitting up and comfortable. \u201cThis is the firstborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My sweet, dark haired girl.\u201d She strokes her cheek. \u201cEverything\u2019s a little fuzzy but I remember you, my lovely.\u201d</p><p>I collect our sleeping daughter from her crib and return to Avery\u2019s bedside. I pass the second baby to her and give her a moment to register the wellbeing of our second daughter before I tell her we have two girls. \u201cBoth are safe and healthy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s beaming. \u201cYes they are. I can clearly see that.\u201d She leans forward and presses a kiss to each of their heads.</p><p>\u201cAnd both are girls.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and her fear is almost overwhelming. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of them are fine, Avery. One is dark like me, the other is blond like you. They\u2019re complete opposites so it isn\u2019t possible for them to be an ag\u00e1pe and fylgia.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s panicking and it\u2019s my job to soothe her through our connection and reassuring words. \u201cThey\u2019re more than two hours old. The second baby wouldn\u2019t have survived if she was a fylgia. But she did and she\u2019s fine. Look at her, Avery. She\u2019s alive and healthy. Watch her chest rise and fall as she breathes. Place your hand over her heart and feel it beat.\u201d</p><p>A single tear rolls down her face. \u201cWe have two daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Two very nameless little girls. We\u2019re going to need to rectify that soon. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to spend their lives being identified by the color of their hair or being known as the first or second born.\u201d We debated girl names for a couple of weeks but never decided on anything. Choosing names for girls felt like we were admitting we were going to lose one so neither of us would commit to anything.</p><p>\u201cYou really liked Sophie,\u201d Avery says.</p><p>\u201cAnd you really liked Sadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we use both and we each get our preference.\u201d She looks down at our dark haired beauty. \u201cI pictured a little girl with dark brown hair and green eyes like yours while I was pregnant. I think Sadie fits this one perfectly but she needs a middle name.\u201d</p><p>My dark hair and green eyes came from my mother and I\u2019m reminded of her when I look at this child. \u201cI\u2019d really like to use Caroline after my mother.\u201d</p><p>Avery caresses the top of her head. \u201cSadie Caroline Alexander.\u201d She looks up at me. \u201cI adore the way it sounds but I love it more because she\u2019s named after your mother.\u201d She moves her hand to the top of our other daughter\u2019s head. \u201cNow what about a middle name for Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re using my mother\u2019s name. Would you like to use your mom\u2019s as well?\u201d</p><p>Avery\u2019s eyes glaze. \u201cSophie Elise Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like it was meant to go together.\u201d My wife admires our daughters. \u201cSadie Caroline and Sophie Elise. Both are lovely and immortal flowers without a single physical defect. They are perfect and worthy of being brought forth in Eden.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quoting The Scarlet Letter and she couldn\u2019t be more right. These babies are perfect. I suppose every parent feels that way about their children but they can\u2019t all be correct. At least we aren\u2019t plagued with the unfortunate circumstance of being wrong about our children\u2019s perfection.</p><p>It\u2019s been three days since we welcomed our twin daughters into the world and today we are bringing them home to the Savannah compound. It\u2019s almost noon so the family is asleep\u2013except for the Brennan crew\u2013and we find them waiting for us in the living room.</p><p>Chansey swiftly rises from the sofa to greet us. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re home. I\u2019m beyond ready to meet these little ladies.\u201d Both babies are in their carriers and I place them on the couch side by side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to make it to the hospital to see you but I couldn\u2019t leave my sick babies.\u201d</p><p>I guess being half vampire wasn\u2019t going to keep our children from catching the common cold. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We totally understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre they feeling better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on the mend but they scared me to death the night after these two were born. Both of them were making this weird sound when they were breathing. I called Dr. Knight and she rushed over. Turns out it was just croup. We took them outside in the cool air and it cleared right up.\u201d Chansey shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Curry so scared.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to imagine his alarm because the worry I experienced over Sadie and Sophie\u2019s delivery was still fresh on my mind.</p> <p>Chansey stands over our new editions. \u201cThey seem so tiny. I can\u2019t believe mine were this small only a few months ago.\u201d She touches Sadie\u2019s cheek and then Sophie\u2019s. \u201cMy goodness. Curry told me they didn\u2019t look a thing alike.\u201d She looks up at us. \u201cI thought he was exaggerating but I see now he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods they aren\u2019t anything alike.</p><p>Curry takes another look at the babies. \u201cThey\u2019ll never mix these two up. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who is who?\u201d Chansey asks.</p><p>Sadie stirs in her carrier and cries as if on cue to be the first one introduced. So far, she has insisted on doing everything first. \u201cThis little darling is Sadie.\u201d Avery unbuckles our crying daughter and lifts her. \u201cShe\u2019s the one with the robust appetite but I\u2019ve learned I have about thirty minutes before Sophie will start in wanting to eat too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine do me the same way but it\u2019s better to keep them on a close schedule. James Grady got mixed up once and I felt like I was constantly feeding one of them. It took two days to get him back to his normal routine. It was exhausting.\u201d</p><p>We definitely didn\u2019t need that because it already seemed like Avery spent half of her time nursing. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to remember that and please feel free to pass along any other tips you may have.\u201d</p><p>I look at my watch and note that it\u2019ll be two more hours until their feeding time. \u201cWant me to take them for a little while so you can catch a quick nap before time to nurse?\u201d Avery\u2019s body has been through a lot recently. I offer to care for the babies often because I want her to have as much rest as possible. Although I\u2019ve become incredibly human over the last few months, I\u2019m still able to tolerate lack of sleep much better than her. Plus, I love the bonding time I get with my daughters.</p><p>Her eyes dance. \u201cOh, that would be lovely. Thank you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Avery manages to get two hours of rest before feeding time. She\u2019s already awake and smiles as she rises to a sitting position when I enter our newly finished quarters with the babies. \u201cMy body is on their schedule as well. It knows it\u2019s time to nurse because I feel like I could burst.\u201d She scoots until her back is against the headboard and gets into position before I pass Sadie to her. \u201cChansey\u2019s going to help me learn how to nurse them at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would save so much time.\u201d I watch my wife nurse our daughter and I\u2019m still amazed by this new experience. I can\u2019t believe this is my life. It\u2019s too good to be true.</p> <p>Evening comes and the occupants of the house rise from their slumber. Everyone is present in the living room to see our babies and I realize for the first time how much our family has grown over the last year. Eight new members have been added to our previous count of six but there\u2019s a new face standing in the crowd and it\u2019s one I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>He\u2019s a tall man with broad shoulders and flaxen hair. His eyes are golden\u2013and captivating. I\u2019ve never seen irises that color. I make the connection and realize why. He isn\u2019t human.</p><p>\u201cI have someone I\u2019d like to introduce,\u201d Sebastian says. \u201cThis is Anteros.\u201d</p><p>The room is hushed but he breaks the silence. \u201cGood evening.\u201d His voice is soft, yet authoritative. The way it commands attention leaves no room for doubt. It\u2019s reminiscent of a different time\u2013and place\u2013but I can\u2019t identify either. \u201cI\u2019m sure my presence at your compound is a surprise but I\u2019ve come because I wish to meet my daughters and their mates and children.\u201d</p><p>Ag\u00e1pes are called daughters of Anteros because he is their creator but I wonder if his words imply something more.</p><p>He walks toward Chansey and hugs her. \u201cChansey. You are my daughter because I\u2019m your creator.\u201d He releases her from his embrace but continues holding her attention. \u201cI chose your family because of your grandmother\u2019s history as a blood swan. I knew you\u2019d be raised in a loving environment that would nourish and prepare you to love and accept Curry as your mate. And I couldn\u2019t be happier with the way you have embraced your life as an ag\u00e1pe. You are a wonderful wife and mother and you make me a proud maker.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s mesmerized by him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Curry appears lost but extends his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>He spends a little time speaking with Chansey and Curry while looking at the babies and then moves on to us. \u201cAvery. I\u2019ve watched you from afar for so long, my child. It\u2019s so delightful to finally meet you.\u201d He takes her into a tight embrace. \u201cAnd hold you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>His response to Avery is different than the one he had for Chansey. Again, I\u2019m struck by the notion that this means more.</p><p>\u201cAvery. You are my daughter because of the relationship I shared with your mother. You are the living, physical proof of our love.\u201d</p><p>Avery is bewildered by his words. \u201cAre you saying my dad wasn\u2019t my biological father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t. I am.\u201d Anteros takes Avery\u2019s hands. \u201cThe blood of a god courses through your veins and there are those that would harm you for that reason. That\u2019s why I chose Solomon as your protector. He\u2019s strong. Valiant. He\u2019ll protect you and he\u2019ll keep your children safe but there\u2019s something you should know about them.\u201d</p><p>I feel Avery\u2019s growing fear and it causes mine to multiply. It\u2019s terrifying to hear there\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about our newborn daughters.</p><p>\u201cThis involves all four infants.\u201d Anteros moves to stand between us and the Brennans. \u201cThere\u2019s a prophesy. A great battle will ensue among the vampire race. There will be a false leader to rise and she will attempt to lay claim as sovereign but there will be a group of six to lead a revolt against this diabolical fiend. Your four children are destined to save the entire vampire race from believing her deceit.\u201d</p><p>Our hearts sink because no parent wants to hear that his children\u2013especially daughters\u2013are destined to go to battle. This isn\u2019t what I would choose for them.</p><p>\u201cThey have the best of three worlds. Human blood gives them compassion. Some immortals consider this a weakness but it\u2019s the complete opposite. Empathy is powerful. Their bodies are half vampire so this makes them fast and resilient which they\u2019ll need for battle. But it\u2019s the blood of a god that will make them more powerful than any enemy rising against them.\u201d</p><p>The numbers don\u2019t add up. Is he including future children in the count? \u201cYou said a group of six would lead the revolt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour children and two other male babes\u2013also twins\u2013are the only ones on earth with that genetic make up.\u201d I\u2019m surprised to hear that there are two more agape/vampire children out there. Three sets of twins. Three males. Three females. I\u2019m a father of daughters so I don\u2019t like the direction this conversation is going.</p><p>Anteros addresses Chansey and Curry, \u201cYour son will take one of Avery and Solomon\u2019s daughters as a mate and your daughter will pair off with one of the males born outside of this coven.\u201d He turns to us and I can predict what he is about to say. \u201cYour other daughter will be a mate to the other male twin.\u201d</p><p>Anteros motions toward the entry from the foyer and a couple enters the living room, each holding an infant. \u201cThis is Abel and Jenna Bennett. And these are their sons, Judd and York. They are joining Landra and will be living with you at the compound. The children must be raised together so they can train side by side to become invincible if they are to conquer Marsala Delphine.\u201d</p><p>Curry\u2019s entire body jerks in a rigor when he hears her name. \u201cMarsala is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She used black magic to make you believe she is dead but she\u2019s biding her time.\u201d Curry rubs his chin with his hand as he always does when he\u2019s stressed. \u201cSomething happened to Marsala when you thought you were running that stake through her heart. Her once obsession turned to something different. Something darker.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s clearly shaken by the news that Marsala is still alive. \u201cDarker? I didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. She\u2019s gone mad and wants to rule the vampire species so she may eradicate all ag\u00e1pes.\u201d He\u2019s speaking to all of us now. \u201cShe wants Curry to suffer the pain of losing Chansey and his children if she can\u2019t have him. Marsala is powerful and determined. That\u2019s two very dangerous characteristics so she\u2019s the reason the three of you can\u2019t remain ag\u00e1pes. You must be able to protect yourselves in case she gets through your mates. Once the babies are old enough, you will all need to be changed.\u201d</p><p>Curry isn\u2019t disturbed by this the way I am. He was planning to turn Chansey anyway but this isn\u2019t what I want for Avery. \u201cNo. I refuse to do it.\u201d Do I have the right to refuse Anteros?</p><p>\u201cSolomon, I know what happened with your betrothed but it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>How was it not my fault? I\u2019d love to believe I wasn\u2019t the cause of Lisette\u2019s wrongful death. \u201cI tried to turn her and she died. I killed her.\u201d End of story.</p><p>\u201cAvery wasn\u2019t born during that time but once you were changed into a vampire, she was destined to become your intended. That means there could never be another for you. That\u2019s why Lisette didn\u2019t survive. Your blood couldn\u2019t supply her body with the things she needed to transition so it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>I feel numb. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last two hundred and seventy-five years believing she died because I made a stupid mistake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere was no wrong done on your part. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d I wish I had known because neither of us would have chosen that fate for her. She loved life and deserved to live.</p><p>Sebastian steps forward. \u201cThere\u2019s one last bit of news.\u201d He appears happy\u2013probably the happiest I\u2019ve seen him. \u201cAnteros has the ability to reunite me with Ella in a parallel world\u2013much like the one where you join your ag\u00e1pe when you share your special connection. It\u2019s what I want but joining her means leaving all of you behind and I\u2019ll never return again.\u201d</p><p>Ella is Sebastian\u2019s heart so he deserves nothing less than our full support. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great run, my friend. You\u2019ve taught us well and your work will continue to be done here but it\u2019s time for you to be reunited with your beloved.\u201d I hug my teacher. My confidant. My friend. \u201cYou will be missed greatly.\u201d</p> <p>We say our goodbyes but I\u2019m not sad about Sebastian\u2019s departure. I\u2019m happy for him because the vampire mate within me understands. He must go to his ag\u00e1pe.</p><p>And in the blink of an eye, he is no longer with us. Vanished\u2013gone to be reunited with his beloved.</p><p>But Anteros remains. \u201cCurry and Solomon, you will train Abel in the ways of the Landra. The fighting techniques you use to apprehend and tame out of control vampires will become vital if you are to defeat Marsala and the army she is building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our ag\u00e1pes?\u201d Curry asks.</p><p>\u201cThey will be turned and trained after your children are weaned.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m frightened for Avery. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s cut out for vampirism and battles.</p><p>\u201cI can do this, Sol.\u201d She senses my fear.</p><p>Anteros hears the exchange of words between us. \u201cNone of you should waste time worrying about your ag\u00e1pe\u2019s transition. They will adjust quickly and become exceptionally powerful because of what they already are. Their strength will double yours and triple that of any young vampire they meet on the battlefield.\u201d That was a plus. If Marsala was building an army then they would all be fledglings.</p><p>I want Avery to be strong if she\u2019s to fight but I\u2019m not sure how I feel about her having the ability to overpower me.</p><p>She laughs because she\u2019s so good at deciphering my thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t be that way, Sol. You might like being subdued. It could be really hot but let\u2019s face it. I\u2019ve never needed physical strength to have my way with you.\u201d</p><p>So this is my fate. A beautiful ag\u00e1pe wife. Two lovely, healthy daughters and more happiness than I deserve. Not bad if I do say so myself.</p> <p>I entered Vincent Godfrey\u2019s house months ago believing I was part of the plan to rescue Avery\u2013a mysterious blood jewel\u2013yet she was the one to rescue me. I couldn\u2019t have envisioned her in my sweetest fantasy but Avery Violet Ferrand Alexander isn\u2019t imaginary. She is real. And my dream come true. For eternity.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
