Brooke \u201cLittle Firecracker\u201d Dumas.</p><p>I promised her a church wedding. And a church wedding is what she\u2019ll get.</p><p>\u201cI swear if you frown any harder at the door, it\u2019s going to collapse under your stare,\u201d my PA, Pete, calls from the couch.</p><p>I swing around to where he and Riley have been watching me pace around the living room of Brooke\u2019s old Seattle apartment. Apparently those two are amused as fuck by me. Dipshits. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s so amusing. Turning back to the bedroom door, I continue pacing.</p><p>For the life of me, I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s taking her so long. It\u2019s been exactly fifty-eight minutes since she locked herself up in our bedroom to get ready, when Brooke\u2014my fucking Brooke\u2014usually gets dressed in five.</p> <p>\u201cDude, it\u2019s her wedding day. Chicks take a lot of time to get prepped.\u201d Riley thrusts his arms out in the air in a gesture that implies That\u2019s life!</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re an expert now,\u201d Pete jabs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dress!\u201d Melanie, Brooke\u2019s best friend, says, exploding out of the master bedroom with a trail of white stuff that looks like a veil. \u201cIt has all these buttons . . . and what are you three doing here anyway? Remington, I talked to Brooke about it. You guys should leave and we\u2019ll meet you at the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucking ridiculous,\u201d I say, laughing. But when Melanie keeps staring at the three of us, and especially me, with an expression someone might use on a couple of dogs they want to scat, I scowl and head to the bedroom door.</p><p>I curl my fingers around the doorknob and speak through the closure slit. \u201cBrooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy, please don\u2019t come in here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome to the door, then.\u201d</p><p>When I hear shuffling, I press closer to the edge and drop my voice so the dipshits on the living room couch don\u2019t hear. \u201cWhy the fuck can\u2019t I see you right now, baby?\u201d</p><p>All this entering and exiting the room by Melanie, with me separated by a locked door from my soon-to-be wife? I don\u2019t like it. And separated despite the fact that she\u2019s supposed to be getting dressed for me.</p><p>\u201cI guess because I want you to see me walk up to you,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>God, that voice, right there. Makes me want to throw the door down and kiss the hell out of her, then do stuff to her under that dress she\u2019s trying to put on\u2014the things that husbands do to their fucking wives. \u201cI will see you walk up to me, baby, I just want to see you now too. Open the door and I\u2019ll do your buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can undo them later and then do me.\u201d The cheeky statement is followed by a soft \u201cGaaah,\u201d like someone\u2014a very little someone\u2014is amused about something on the other side of this door.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Riptide,\u201d Melanie says as she returns, and waves me away from the door. \u201cYou boys should head out to church. We\u2019ll see you there in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I scowl when she slides inside the bedroom like a goddamn worm through a tiny slit, preventing me from so much as glimpsing Brooke. Using much the same method, the much-larger Josephine steps out with something squirming against her chest. My son looks at me from the crook of her arm and falls still; his lips are curled in such a way that he almost wears the same amused expression Pete and Riley do.</p> <p>He takes the hand he\u2019s got stuck inside his mouth and slaps it flat and wet to my jaw. \u201cGah!\u201d he says, then squirms and flings himself to me.</p><p>Catching him, I nuzzle his stomach and growl, which elicits another \u201cGaaaaaah!\u201d</p><p>When I lift my head to look into his eyes, he\u2019s fucking delighted. And so am I, but I growl again like I\u2019m not and grumble at him, \u201cYou think I\u2019m funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaaah!\u201d</p><p>His eyes are all mischief. His head is smaller than my palm as I cup it and buzz the fuzz on the top of his head. My four-month-old, Racer, the son Brooke gave me? He\u2019s the most perfect thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.</p><p>I never thought I\u2019d have something like him. Now my life revolves around this dimpled squirrel, who pukes on all my fucking T-shirts, and my Brooke. And, god, where do I start with her?</p><p>Pete slaps my back with a loud thunk. \u201cAll right, dude, you heard them. And watch it\u2014he\u2019s going to get all that baby stuff on your suit!\u201d</p><p>Clamping my jaw, I pat Racer\u2019s head and he grins at me. He has one dimple, not two. Brooke says it\u2019s because he\u2019s only half mine. I contest he\u2019s all mine, and so is she.</p><p>Smiling back at him, I return him to Josephine, who assures me, \u201cGo peacefully, Mr. Tate, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s supposed to be a bodyguard, but I don\u2019t know what the hell she is now. She strolls outside with Racer and does some nanny work too. He sticks his fingers into her hair and pulls and she even seems to like it.</p><p>After a glance at the kitchen clock, I level my gaze at her. \u201cI want her there in fifteen minutes,\u201d I say, and she nods.</p><p>A limo is waiting for my bride, but Riley\u2019s got the keys to Melanie\u2019s convertible, parked just outside without the top down. We all leap inside. I drop down on the front passenger seat and then stare up at the window of our temporary apartment. I can\u2019t understand what the big fuss is about wedding-dress buttons. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I should ride, in the car, with my wife, to the fucking church, where we marry. Period.</p><p>\u201cRem. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to leave you standing at the altar, man,\u201d Riley says, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I whisper, turning back around. But sometimes I just don\u2019t know. Sometimes all my chest feels knotted and I think about waking one morning to find Brooke and my son gone, and dying is too easy to describe what I want to do.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight minutes, she\u2019ll be walking up to the altar in white, just for you,\u201d Pete says.</p><p>I stare out in silence.</p><p>Brooke has been excited about this all month. Wondering if this, if that, if a cake, if not a cake. I\u2019d say yes to anything that made her voice more excited, and she\u2019d kiss me like I like. So now she seems in control, getting dressed, ready for her day, and I feel like a mess because she\u2019d said she didn\u2019t mind us driving together to the church. And then her best friend put stupid-girl ideas in her head. I ride alone. To a church I never go to. To marry my wife. She\u2019s right behind us, but I\u2019m not good. I\u2019m fucking anxious and this is an anxiety that would have been appeased if she\u2019d opened the door and just looked at me with those gold eyes\u2014my mind would have gone still and all the roiling in my chest would have gone quiet.</p><p>But it\u2019s not happening.</p><p>Now I have twenty-seven infernal minutes to go . . . and my mind is playing tricks on me like it does when it starts swinging like a pendulum, and the only way I can seem to stop it is with her.</p><p>Tapping my foot, I stroke the ring in my hand. Then I pull it off and it helps to see her name on its inscription: TO MY REAL, YOUR BROOKE DUMAS.</p><p>PAST</p><p>THE DAY I SAW HER</p><p>The Seattle crowd roars as I come trotting out onto the Underground walkway.</p><p>Far at the end and directly in my line of vision, the ring awaits. Twenty-three feet by twenty-three feet, four ropes parallel on each side, four fucking posts, and that\u2019s about it.</p><p>That ring is a home to me. When I\u2019m not on it, I miss it. When I train, I think about it.</p><p>Every step I take in its direction pumps me up and gets me going. My veins dilate, my heartbeat works to feed my muscles. My mind sharpens and clears. Every inch of me readies to attack, defend, and survive\u2014and give these people the thrill they\u2019re all yelling for.</p><p>\u201cRemy! I love you, Remy!\u201d I hear them yell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll suck your cock for you, Remy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cREMY, POUND ME, REMY!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington, I want your Riptide!\u201d</p><p>Stretching out my fingers, I grab the top rope and jump over it into the ring, taking a look at the people surrounding me. The lights are shining. My name is on everyone\u2019s lips. And all their excitement and anticipation spins around me in a fun little whirlwind. They\u2019re yelling and waving pink shit at me. They want me up here. Right here. Just me, some asshole opponent, and our fists.</p><p>I whip off my robe and hand it to Riley, my friend and Coach\u2019s second, while people rise to their feet and scream louder as I turn to acknowledge the crowd. They\u2019re all standing. All looking at me like I\u2019m their God of War and tonight is the night I will give them vengeance.</p><p>I fucking love it.</p><p>I fucking love those yells, the women screaming about the kind of shit they want me to do to them.</p><p>\u201cRemy! Remy!\u201d a crazy-sounding female shouts at the top of her lungs. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot, Remy!\u201d</p><p>I turn in amusement, and my gaze runs down the crowded aisle and snags on her. The one with long mahogany hair, and amber eyes, and pink, plump lips that immediately part in shock. I feel stupefied.</p><p>My instincts kick in, and I take in the stranger with one quick sweep. She\u2019s young, athletic, and dressed demurely, but there\u2019s nothing demure about the way she runs her wide, disbelieving eyes all over me.</p><p>Holy god, I feel like she\u2019s just run her tongue all over my cock.</p><p>When her eyes lock on mine, I raise a brow in a question, silently asking her, Did you just shout at me or not?</p><p>Her cheeks flood a nice shade of pink, and I realize it was her friend who yelled, her friend who pales compared to her. This one doesn\u2019t strike me as the kind to be courting the attentions of someone like me. But she\u2019s got all my hunter buttons engaged, and now I want her and I\u2019m going to have her.</p><p>I wink at her, but I can instantly tell she\u2019s not feeling playful. She looks appalled.</p><p>\u201cKirk Dirkwood, the Hammer, here for all of you tonight!\u201d the guy with the microphone yells.</p><p>My lips curl as I turn to watch Dirkwood hop into the ring and remove his cover, and I flex my arms and curl my fingers until my knuckles pop out. My body feels good\u2014every muscle is warm and ready to contract. I know I\u2019m good as fuck, but I want this girl to know it. I\u2019m feeling very, very possessive, and I don\u2019t want her to look at anyone but me. I want her to see I\u2019m the strongest, the fastest. Hell, as far as I know, I want her to think I\u2019m the only man in the whole damn world.</p><p>Kirk is big and slow as a snail. He throws the first punch, but I can see it coming from the moment he even starts thinking about moving. I duck and come back with a punch that knocks him to the side and rocks his balance. She\u2019s watching me, I know it. The heat in her gaze makes me fight harder and faster. Hell, I own this ring. I love everything about it. I know its dimensions, the feel of the canvas under my feet, the heat of the lights on me. I have never lost a single Underground fight. People know that no matter how badly I get beat up, I always get back up and finish the battle on my terms.</p><p>But tonight? I feel immortal.</p><p>The crowd starts chanting my name.</p><p>\u201cREMY . . . REMY . . . REMY.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my ring. My crowd. My fight. My fucking night.</p><p>Then I hear that voice again. Not her, but the woman she came with. \u201cOhmigod, hit him, Remy! Just knock him dead, you sexy beast!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I oblige and knock Kirk down on the canvas with a hard thump. Yells erupt all over.</p><p>The ringmaster grabs and lifts my arm, and I swing my head to look at her, curious to see the look on her face. I\u2019m panting and possibly bleeding, but none of that matters. All that matters to me is checking her the fuck out. Did she fucking see how I knocked him out? Is she even impressed, or not?</p><p>She returns my stare, and my gut twists all around. God, she\u2019s making me hard. She wears these nice clothes, and I swear she\u2019s the classiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in a place like this. Still, whatever she\u2019s wearing, it\u2019s too much and needs to come off.</p><p>\u201cREMY! REMY! REMY! REMY!\u201d people yell.</p> <p>Their chants grow in intensity while her startled golden eyes devour me like I\u2019m devouring her.</p><p>\u201cYou want more Remy?\u201d the announcer happily asks the crowd. \u201cAll right then, people! Let\u2019s bring out a worthier opponent for Remington Riptide Tate tonight!\u201d</p><p>Hell, they can bring out anything they want, man or monster.</p><p>I\u2019m so primed, I could take a couple at once.</p><p>In my peripherals, I\u2019ve got her pinned down, nice and tight. In that frilly shirt. Those body-hugging pants. I\u2019ve already cataloged her at about 120 pounds and five feet seven, at least a head shorter than me. In my head, I\u2019m already measuring her breasts in my hands and tasting her skin with my tongue. Suddenly, I notice she whispers something to her friend, rises to her feet, and takes off down the aisle.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now, to challenge our reigning champion, ladies and gentlemen, is Parker \u2018the Terror\u2019 Drake!\u201d</p><p>I stare in disbelief as she walks off, and a knot coils tight around my gut as the rest of my body tightens in preparation to chase.</p><p>The crowd comes alive as Parker takes the ring, and all I can do is watch her leave my arena while every molecule in my body screams at me to go get her.</p><p>The bell rings, and I don\u2019t play the little feinting and waiting game that me and my opponents always do. I stare into Parker\u2019s face and give him a look that says, Sorry, dude, and go straight for the slam and knock him down.</p><p>He falls splat and doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>The crowd is stunned into silence. The announcer takes a moment to speak as I wait, frustrated as fuck, my heart pounding in anticipation as I wait for Parker to stay down and the counting to begin.</p> <p>It begins.</p><p>Come on, motherfuckers . . .</p><p>I\u2019m fucking winning the championship this year and I won\u2019t be disqualified . . .</p><p>Just call it a knockout and let her hear . . .</p><p>TEN!</p><p>\u201cHoly cow, that was fast! We have a KO! Yes, ladies and gentlemen! A KO! And in record time, our victor once again, I give you, Riptide! Riptide, who\u2019s now jumping off the ring and\u2014where the hell are you going?\u201d</p><p>The crowd goes crazy as I land on my feet on the aisle and their screams follow me all the way to the lobby. They are screaming for me while my body is screaming for me to catch her. \u201cRiptide! Riptide!\u201d</p><p>My heart pumps like crazy. She\u2019s walking fast, but I\u2019m fucking running. Every one of my senses demands I chase, capture, and have this girl. I grab her wrist and spin her around.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d she gasps, her eyes wide in shock.</p><p>She\u2019s so beautiful my lungs freeze. Smooth forehead, long lashes with spiky tips\u2014those gold eyes, that dainty nose, and those marshmallow lips. I need to taste that like yesterday. My mouth waters as a wild, primitive hunger opens up inside me.</p><p>\u201cYour name,\u201d I growl. Her wrist is tiny in my hand, fragile, but I\u2019m not about to let go. Oh, no.</p><p>\u201cUh, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke what?\u201d I snap, tightening my hold.</p><p>Her scent works me into a lather. I need to find the source of that scent. The back of her ears? Her hair? Her neck?</p><p>She tries to pry her hand free but I tighten my hold because she\u2019s not going anywhere but my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brooke Dumas,\u201d a voice behind me says, and then the crazy friend who was with her throws off a number, which my idiot brain doesn\u2019t grasp, for I\u2019m still hung up on her name.</p><p>Brooke Dumas.</p><p>My lips curl as I meet that pretty gold gaze. \u201cBrooke Dumas,\u201d I say gruffly out loud, slow and deep, my tongue twisting around the name as I savor it. Such a strong, classy fucking name.</p><p>Her eyes widen in shock\u2014and she gives me a hungry, doe-eyed look that lets me see she\u2019s a little excited but a little afraid.</p><p>It makes me crazed. I need to touch, smell, taste, claim. I burn with the need to tell her she should be afraid of me, and at the same time, all I want is to pet my hand down her long hair and promise her I\u2019ll be her protector.</p><p>Yielding to the impulse, I slide my fingers into the nape of her neck, fighting to be gentle so that she won\u2019t run, while only one thought remains in my head: Take. Her.</p><p>My gaze never leaving hers, I set a dry kiss on her lips, slowly, trying not to scare her, but just so she knows who I am, and who I will be for her.</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d I say against her soft lips, then I draw back with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Remington.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes meet mine, and they\u2019re metallic gold and liquid with something I recognize as wanting. My smile fades as I look down at her mouth again. It\u2019s so pink and soft I bend my head to take it even more deeply. My blood rushes through my veins as her scent drowns me. I want this woman. I can\u2019t wait one more second without tasting her, taking her.</p><p>One second she\u2019s warm and trembling in my arms, quietly tipping her head back for more, and the next, the crowd engulfs us and some fucking lunatic is screaming in my ear.</p><p>\u201cRemy! I FUCKING LOVE YOU! Remy!\u201d</p><p>Brooke Dumas seems to snap into motion and quickly squirms free.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I reach out to snatch up a piece of her white shirt. But she and her friend wind through the throng like wiggly little bunnies, and I\u2019m in the crowd stuck with two fans who\u2014</p><p>\u201cRiptide, my god, please let me touch your cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiptide, you can take us both together!\u201d</p><p>As they rub their hands down my abs, I think, FUCK! and pry their arms away, then I charge after her. When I reach the elevator, the gate is shut and I hear her noisily ascending up to street level.</p><p>\u201cRemy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington!\u201d</p><p>Growling in anger, I slam my palm to the closed door, then dodge an incoming group of fans and bulldoze my way back into the locker room.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m angry, frustrated, or . . . I don\u2019t know. Where the fuck is she going? She was looking up at me like she wanted me to eat her; I don\u2019t even understand fucking females and never fucking will. Scowling as I charge to get my stuff, I slam my fist into a locker.</p><p>\u201cTake care of your knuckles, Tate!\u201d Coach snaps as he gathers all my things into a red duffel.</p><p>I loathe being told what to do. So I slam my other fist into another locker and dent it like I did the first, then I glare at the old man and grab my headset, my iPod, and a sports drink. Following my crew out to our Escalade, I\u2019m pissed as fuck at myself for letting her go. I try saving her number on my phone, at least the few digits I remember.</p><p>\u201cThat KO was unbelievable, dude, you knocked him down within three seconds!\u201d Riley says, laughing.</p><p>I stare out the window at the lights of Seattle and tap my fingers on my knee.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so what was that all about? Are we going to discuss the elephant in the car?\u201d asks Pete from up front. \u201cThe one with the long hair? You seemed hell-bent on chasing, Rem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her watching my next fight.\u201d The car falls silent when they realize I\u2019m fiercely hung up on her.</p><p>Pete sighs. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll see what I can do. We also got you a couple of girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good assortment,\u201d Riley adds. \u201cA blonde, a brunette, and a redhead.\u201d</p><p>And as soon as we get up to the suite, there they are. They\u2019re waiting for me. Three girls with different-colored hair, waiting in next-to-nothing clothes, ready to fuck the Riptide.</p><p>Their eyes light up when they see me.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of them,\u201d I flatly say, then shut myself off in the master bedroom.</p><p>Showering in record speed, I then pull out my laptop and look up Seattle, Brooke Dumas for the rest of her number.</p><p>Grabbing my headset, I cover my ears with my Dr. Dre headphones and play loud music while I search, search, search, and then\u2014</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>Scrolling down, I scan several articles about Brooke Dumas. One claims she\u2019s a sports rehab specialist who interned at a Seattle academy. Prior ones mention her being a track athlete. A sprinter. Odd things happen in my chest. I reread that part, and, yeah. A sprinter.</p><p>Now I understand why she\u2019s so lean, athletic, and fast. But she has some curves, the kind of curves I\u2019ve never seen on a sprinter before. I curl my fingers into my palm as I replay how her small, perky breasts rose and fell as she looked up at me. My mouth waters as I remember the way she smelled. Fuck me. On YouTube, I find a video of her during some sort of tryouts. My heart starts whacking hard again when I pull off my headphones and click Play. She wears little shorts. Her hair in a ponytail. And I see her long, lean, muscled legs. My cock swells, and I shift uncomfortably and bend to get a closer inspection as she gets into position. The group shoots off. She starts fast\u2014</p><p>Then one of her legs buckles. And she falls. She lays there, on the ground, and starts sobbing as she struggles to stand.</p><p>My chest does something weird.</p><p>Shit, she\u2019s crying so much her body shakes with it.</p><p>Forming fists, I watch her try to hop out of the track on her own, while the asshole spectator who recorded the video just keeps repeating, \u201cMan, her life is over,\u201d again and again.</p><p>Camera zooms in on her tear-filled face, and I quickly pause the screen and stare at her. Brooke Dumas. She looks just like she did today, but a little younger, and a whole lot more vulnerable. There\u2019s a little dimple in her chin from her expression, and those gold eyes are so drowned in tears, I can barely see their pretty whiskey color. I start to read the comments beneath the clip, of which there are quite a few.</p><p>Iwlormw: Rumors have it she\u2019d been doing cross fit against the advice of her coach and had already tweaked that knee!</p><p>Trrwoods: That\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t prepare properly!</p><p>Runningexpert: She was good, but not that great. Lamaske would\u2019ve still kicked the shit out of her in the Olympics.</p><p>My stomach boils.</p><p>I watch the video again, and my stomach boils even more.</p><p>With an angry growl, I toss my sports drink across the room and hear it slam against the wall. I want to destroy everyone making fun of her.</p><p>She\u2019d stood there tonight in my arena, trying to raise her walls up to me, and she\u2019d looked proud as a warrioress, like she hadn\u2019t already endured the world watching her fall once already. My chest twists so hard, I can\u2019t breathe right again, and I growl and slam my laptop shut.</p><p>Pete raps his knuckles on my door and pushes it open a little. \u201cRem, you sure you don\u2019t want to partake?\u201d</p><p>He widens the gap and gestures at the trio of women behind him, their expectant eyes peering into my bedroom. They collectively sigh and one murmurs, \u201cPlease, Riptide . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once?\u201d says the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI said get rid of them, Pete.\u201d I crack my knuckles, then my neck. The door closes and a sudden quiet settles in the suite, until Pete comes back and pries the door open again.</p><p>\u201cAll right, dude. But I really think you should\u2019ve gone for them. . . . Anyhow, Diane wants to know if you want dinner in here.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I carry my iPad to the dining room and settle down to wolf down the contents of my plate on autopilot while Pete makes some phone calls confirming our hotel reservations in Atlanta next week.</p><p>While I\u2019m eating, all I see are gold eyes, and parted lips, and the way Brooke Dumas looked at me, like a doe who\u2019s just realized there\u2019s one predator after her that won\u2019t give up until she\u2019s caught.</p> <p>I want to make her mine.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>I want to smell the fuck out of her \u2019cause it gets me all cranked up and nothing has ever cranked me up like her scent just did. I want the joy of looking at her and touching her and I want. To make. Her. Mine.</p><p>Grabbing my iPad, I look her up on the Internet again as I chow, stopping on a picture from her sprinting days. She\u2019s like a gazelle, and I\u2019m going to be the lion that catches her.</p><p>\u201cPete, you think I need a sports rehab specialist?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Rem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, dude. You hardly let the masseuses massage you for more than twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need one now.\u201d Pushing my iPad over to him, I tap the screen and signal to the name below her image. \u201cI need that one.\u201d</p><p>Pete lifts an interested eyebrow. \u201cYou do. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a sports rehab specialist on my payroll. I want her to tend to me every day. In whatever ways they do.\u201d</p> <p>He smirks. \u201cThey don\u2019t do blow jobs, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted a blow job, I could have had three just now. What I want . . .\u201d Once again, my finger taps over her name. \u201cIs this sports rehab specialist.\u201d</p><p>Pete\u2019s eyebrows fly up to his hairline, and he leans back and crosses his arms. \u201cWhat exactly do you want her for?\u201d</p><p>I chomp down the rest of my food, then take a long gulp of water so I can speak. \u201cI want her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRem . . .\u201d he says in warning.</p><p>\u201cOffer her a salary she can\u2019t decline.\u201d</p><p>Pete answers me with a puzzled silence. He seems taken aback and is trying to make sense of me. He\u2019s looking into my eyes, and I can tell he\u2019s observing whether they are black or blue.</p><p>I\u2019m not black. So I wait quietly. He sighs, slowly jots down her name, and speaks cautiously. \u201cAll right, Remington, but let me say, this has Bad Idea written all over it.\u201d</p> <p>Shoving my plate aside, I lean back and cross my arms.</p><p>My head betrays me half the time. One day, it tells me I am god. The other, it tells me that I not only rule hell, but I invented it. Does Pete think I give one fuck about what his own head thinks about my idea? I don\u2019t listen to my head anymore. I listen only to my gut.</p><p>\u201cI want her watching me fight Saturday,\u201d I remind him as I get up and shove my chair back under the table. \u201cGet her the best seats in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it, Pete,\u201d I say as I cross the living room back to the master.</p><p>\u201cI already have the tickets ready to go, dude, but it\u2019s hard enough keeping Diane from knowing of your . . . er, issues. It\u2019s going to be even harder to keep it from someone like this sports rehab specialist.\u201d</p><p>I prop my shoulder at the threshold of my bedroom and think about that. I lower my voice. \u201cMake her sign a contract, so I have guaranteed time with her. And stabilize me the instant I start losing my shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington, just let me get some other girls\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Pete. No other girls.\u201d</p><p>I shut myself in my room and grab my headphones, then just lie there with my iPod in my hand, staring at it.</p><p>What will it be like if I make her mine?</p><p>I don\u2019t delude myself into thinking that she will accept me, but what if she does? What if she can understand me? The way I am? The two parts of me? No. Not two parts. Every. Single. Fucking. Part. Of me.</p><p>My gut tightens as I remember the way her eyes shone when she looked at me. The way they softened after I kissed her and she looked into my eyes, wanting more of me.</p><p>I have never seen a look quite like that before. I have been wanted by thousands of women. Nobody has ever looked at me with such open, frightened longing as her.</p><p>She was not frightened of me. She was frightened of \u201cit.\u201d This same thing clenching my gut that has me all tangled up. Every cell in my body is buzzing with awareness. Every inch of my skin is awake. My muscles feel primed like they do when I\u2019m ready to fight. Except I\u2019m not ready to fight now. I\u2019m ready to go get my mate.</p><p>God help her.</p><p>THE SEATTLE CROWD is wild tonight. Backstage, the noise reverberates between the walls, bounces off the metal lockers in the room where I prepare with some of the other fighters. I watch Coach bandage the fingers of one hand, and all I can think of is how Brooke Dumas is out there among the spectators, sitting in one of the seats I bought for her.</p><p>I\u2019m so jacked up I feel like I\u2019m plugged into a fucking electrical outlet. Blood pumps heady through my veins. My muscles are loose and warm and ready to contract and strike anything in my path. I\u2019m ready to put on a fucking show and there\u2019s one girl, one lovely girl, that\u2019s got me tied up in knots, that I want to see me fight.</p><p>I hand Coach my other hand and stare at my bare knuckles as he shoots off the same instructions he always says.</p><p>My guard . . . patience . . . balance . . .</p><p>I zone out, letting his words slip through me and into my subconscious, where they belong. Right before a fight, I find a calm. I can hear all the noise but listen to nothing. A clarity comes with fighting. Every detail sharpening in your mind.</p><p>This sharpness and awareness makes me lift my head to the doorway. She stands there like out of some childhood dream, looking at nobody but me.</p><p>She wears a pair of white jeans and a pink top that makes her skin look even tanner than it is and so damn lickable my tongue hurts inside my mouth. Neither of us so much as twitches as we stare.</p><p>Hammer steps into my peripherals, and when I see him head straight for her, my anger ignites.</p><p>With deadly calm, I grab the tape from Coach and throw it aside as I stalk over to her. Then, I position myself directly behind her and to her right, taking my spot in a way that lets the dipshit Hammer know I was born to be here. Beside, behind, and by her.</p><p>\u201cJust walk off,\u201d I warn him, my voice low but lethal.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem inclined to listen, instead narrows his eyes in contest. \u201cShe yours?\u201d he asks with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Nodding, I narrow my eyes and let my gaze burn into him. \u201cI can guarantee you, she\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>The asshole leaves, and I notice Brooke doesn\u2019t move for a long second, as if she doesn\u2019t want to step away from me in the same way I don\u2019t want her to go anywhere. Holy god, she smells good.</p><p>I drag her scent to my lungs like a junkie, and suddenly every inch of my body wants to cup her hips and draw her into me so I can scent her more. She turns her head to mine and softly murmurs, \u201cThank you,\u201d but quickly leaves. I duck my head and haul in as much as I can before she walks away.</p><p>I remain standing there, feeling dizzy, my shorts ridiculously tented.</p><p>\u201cRiptide! Hammer! You\u2019re up next!\u201d</p><p>Exhaling as I hear my name, I glance narrowly at Hammer across the room, who seems amused as fuck that I am clearly in deep shit with this girl.</p><p>He\u2019s in even deeper shit with me.</p><p>\u201cRemington . . . are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>I whip around to Coach, who\u2019s fixing that last bandage he couldn\u2019t secure. I keep glaring at Hammer as Riley extends my satin robe, and as I ram my arms into the sleeves, I decide Hammer better be prepared to vacation in a coma for a while.</p><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t let that bastard get to your head.\u201d Coach knocks his knuckles to my temples. \u201cAnd that girl neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl\u2019s been in his head since the first fight here,\u201d Riley tells him with a smirk. \u201cHell, he wants to carry that girl around with him like an accessory on tour. Pete is drafting the contract as we speak.\u201d</p><p>Coach pokes a finger into my chest and I feel it almost bending. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019re planning to do tonight with the girl. You keep your head in the fight going on right now. You got that?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, but obviously I get it. I don\u2019t need to be told these things. Half a fight is in your head. But Coach likes feeling useful, so I just roll with it and trot out. I\u2019ve fought all my life to stay sane. To keep focused, driven, and centered. But tonight, I fight to show one woman my worth.</p><p>I climb onstage and go to my corner, and I can hear the crowd going wild. Makes me smile.</p><p>At my corner, I yank off my robe and hand it to Riley, and the public goes even wilder when my muscles are on display.</p><p>They shout my name and I let them know I fucking love it, chuckling with them as I stretch out my arms and let them know I\u2019m soaking it in. Every second it takes for me to do my turn, my heart pumps, and pumps, and pumps in exhilaration, because I feel gold eyes on my back, almost burning through me, making me want more. More than what I get here, from this wild crowd. More than what I\u2019ve ever been given in my life.</p><p>Dragging in a breath, I keep turning in her direction, my gut already tight with the sheer anticipation of looking into her eyes. I want her to be looking at me when I turn. I know it\u2019s going to give me a rush. Her attention gives me a rush. The way she smelled in the locker rooms\u2014so fresh and clean\u2014still heats the blood in my veins. I don\u2019t know what it is about this woman but all I\u2019ve been able to think of since the first moment I spotted her is hunt. Chase. Claim. Take.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, I give you, the Hammer!\u201d</p><p>I smile as Hammer is announced, and finally, I slide my gaze to where it wants to go and there she is. Jesus. There she is. And she\u2019s just like I wanted her, looking at me.</p><p>She sits there, tense and lovely, with her hair down her shoulders and her eyes wide and expectant. I know she was waiting for me to turn. I can almost see her pulse quicken\u2014mine does. I don\u2019t know what this is. If it\u2019s fake. If it\u2019s real. If she\u2019s real. But I know I\u2019m leaving this city soon, and I won\u2019t be leaving without her.</p><p>Hammer comes into the ring\u2014my ring, where I\u2019ve never let any other motherfucker finish standing\u2014and I jab a finger in the air toward him . . . and then I point at her.</p><p>This one\u2019s for you, Brooke Dumas.</p><p>Her eyes flash in disbelief, and I want to laugh when the blonde friend beside her starts screaming. The bell sounds, and my muscle memory takes charge as I position my guard, bounce on my toes, and do my thing.</p><p>We go toe-to-toe. I feint and Hammer swings, opening his side. So I jab his ribs, feel the satisfying punch race up my arm, and we bounce apart. Hammer is stupid in the head. He falls for all my feints and never covers right. I ram him hard enough to make him bounce on the ropes and drop to his knees. He shakes his head and hops to his feet after a moment. I love this. My heart pumps slowly. My every muscle knows where to move, what to do, where to send my power\u2014right from my center, up my chest, shoulder, down the length of my arms, to the tips of my fucking knuckles that hit with the force of a charging bull. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take him down, and then I do the same with the next foe. And the next.</p><p>A powerful energy takes over me as I fight, and I fight knowing that Brooke Dumas watches me. If there\u2019s anything in my head other than winning, it\u2019s that I want her to think inside that lovely round head of hers that she has never, ever, seen a man like me.</p><p>By the time the tenth guy falls, sweat coats my chest, and as the ringmaster raises my arm, I\u2019m anxious to see the look in her eyes. I want to see that she liked it, that she\u2014like everyone else in this room\u2014thinks I\u2019m the shit. Our eyes lock, my gut goes hard and twisted and wild with desire, and I smile at her as I try to catch my breath.</p><p>When the ringmaster releases my arm, I cross the ring, jump over the cord, and land in the aisle, watching her part her lips in shock as I come over.</p> <p>People go crazy when I go outside the ring, and they\u2019re losing their shit right now.</p><p>The whole room screams with their applause and cheers. And I know they all can see where my gaze rests and where I\u2019m headed.</p><p>\u201cKiss his heart out, woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve him, you bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go, girl!\u201d</p> <p>I smile down at this woman who has stolen my thoughts, and as I wonder if she wants me to, she looks pleadingly up at me, almost begging me not to kiss her here. My blood simmers as I remember her lips on mine, but it won\u2019t be happening again.</p><p>Not until you\u2019re ready, Brooke Dumas.</p><p>I bend to her and scent her hair, whispering at her temple, \u201cSit tight. I\u2019ll send someone over for you.\u201d</p><p>I back off before I lose it, and climbing up into the ring, I steal one last look at her. My chest does all kinds of strange things when our eyes lock.</p><p>\u201cRiptide, people!\u201d the announcer screams.</p><p>The yells feed me. I suck them in with a smile, full of pride and satisfaction. I can see in every one of these people\u2019s eyes that I\u2019m the man. But I want to see it in her eyes. That. I\u2019m. The Man.</p> <p>The man who wants to be Hers.</p><p>THERE\u2019S NO TIME to wait for Coach to rehash what I did. I pummeled ten dudes to the ground and I\u2019m fucking tired. But\u2014at the same time\u2014I\u2019m wired as hell.</p><p>\u201cWell done, boy. I\u2019m gonna send a pair of masseuses to work on you,\u201d he says once we\u2019re in the locker room, and slaps my back.</p><p>In silence, I grab a pair of Gatorades to replenish my minerals and head out to the car with my duffel, knowing Pete and Riley will bring her to me soon. I want her.</p><p>At the hotel suite, my cock is hard and fully standing when I shower and I have to turn the knob to cold\u2014ice-cold\u2014as the water runs down my body. Dragging in a breath, I close my eyes and plant my hands on the wall as the water calms me.</p><p>But, god, the way she looks at me, the way she smells . . . Come tomorrow, when she works for me, I can smell her anytime, if I want to. And I want to.</p><p>When I come out of the shower in a towel, a pair of massage therapists have been let in by Diane.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s hot now, Remy,\u201d she calls from the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cNot now.\u201d I grab an ice pack from the fridge and several more Gatorade bottles and then settle down at the foot of the bed, my muscles worn. My face hurts and I slap the ice pack on the sore as the women start working me. They massaged me last time and immediately get to work on my arms and shoulders while I intently wait for a certain signal from out in the living room.</p><p>And then I hear it.</p><p>Anticipation curls around my gut and I train my eyes on the bedroom door. Pete strolls inside in his best PA mode, and something tangles in my chest when I see her following him.</p><p>Brooke Dumas.</p><p>God, she scrambles my head.</p><p>Her legs look lean and endless in those tight jeans she must use butter to slide into, and the soft-pink top she wears is the same exact shade of her lips.</p><p>I like the shade of her hair, dark and seductive and sun-lightened with just a hint of copper, and I like the small earrings on her ears. She\u2019s wearing hardly anything fake. No watch. No bracelets. Just the small earrings, and her lips are shiny with something. The rest of her is fresh and natural as a flower, but not even flowers smell as fucking good as her.</p><p>She\u2019s checking out my bare chest, and I concentrate on not blinking in order not to miss the way her cheeks heat up and her eyes fill with lust. My body tightens with need. I haven\u2019t had anyone in days, and I\u2019m not used to any sort of abstinence. It\u2019s simple to me: if I want it, I indulge. Hungry? Eat, asshole.</p><p>But all I want to eat now is her. I wish her hands were the ones on my shoulders. . . . No. I want my hands on her small shoulders. But I want them most on her clothes, ripping them away so I can see her.</p><p>When Brooke stares at me, and then the therapists, in slight confusion, I slap the ice pack down, finish my Gatorade, and toss it aside.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the fight?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She startles slightly at my voice, which is gruff with dehydration and exhaustion, and my lips curl into a smile.</p><p>I want to run my fingers over her skin. She was a runner, and that flesh has seen the sun. It looks as warm as her eyes and the faint light streaks in her beautiful dark hair.</p><p>She\u2019s silent as she contemplates the question. Like it has an answer other than the one I\u2019ve always received, which obviously is yes.</p><p>Isn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYou make it interesting,\u201d she finally answers.</p><p>I\u2019m slightly thrown. So, she\u2019s not a fan of mine? \u201cIs that all?\u201d I prod.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The hands on my back and shoulders become annoying, and I roll my shoulders to jerk them off. \u201cLeave me,\u201d I command the women.</p><p>The women head out\u2014and she\u2019s alone with me. In my suite. My bedroom. Inches from my bed. Inches from me.</p><p>Once again, I\u2019m hard as stone. I remember she\u2019d been sitting with two women and a man who seemed protective of her. Yeah, thanks for protecting her, dude, but I\u2019m taking it from here.</p><p>\u201cThe man you\u2019re with . . . Is he your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Amusement sparks in her eyes and I think I see a slight curl to the corners of her lips. \u201cNo, he\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo husband?\u201d I keep prodding. Possessively, I study her ring finger and see how slim and delicate her hands look.</p><p>\u201cNo husband, not at all.\u201d</p><p>The air is static. My entire body is ready to fuck her. Just being near her feels sexual. \u201cYou interned at a private school rehabbing their young athletes?\u201d</p><p>She looks surprised, her eyes sparking with curiosity and disbelief. \u201cYou looked me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we did.\u201d Pete and Riley come into the room, and her attention swings away from me. But mine doesn\u2019t shift. I know what they\u2019re going to say already. I told them what, exactly, they would propose today.</p><p>Miss Dumas . . . I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019re here, so we\u2019ll just cut to it. We\u2019re leaving town in two days and I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no time to do things differently. Mr. Tate wants to hire you. . . .</p><p>She looks so surprised that I smile inside, even as my insides go tense. I don\u2019t want her to say no. She surprised me today, denying she liked my fight. If she says no to this too, I\u2019m not going to take it so well.</p><p>The tension escalates when she frowns after Pete\u2019s explanation that I want her to travel with me from site to site. I don\u2019t like the way her eyes darken.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, exactly, that you think I do? I\u2019m not an escort,\u201d she says.</p><p>Okay, so she doesn\u2019t look as excited about the job as I\u2019d thought she would be. Wary, I settle back down on the bench seat and watch her, torn between amusement and frustration at the way things are developing. Both Pete and Riley burst out laughing at her comment; I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re onto us, Miss Dumas. Yes, I admit when we\u2019re traveling, we find it convenient to keep one or several special friends of Mr. Tate\u2019s to, shall we say, accommodate his needs either before or after a fight,\u201d Pete laughingly explains.</p><p>Her left eyebrow shoots up and now I want to laugh at how these idiots paint me. But, hell, if she thinks my being friendly with the ladies is something bad, then wait until she hears about the worst part of me.</p><p>Suddenly, this whole scene is just not amusing at all. If I go manic before I can ever get close to her, I\u2019ll be completely fucked. But I also can\u2019t just take her to bed and let her go; I don\u2019t want to let this one go.</p><p>\u201cA man like Remington has very particular requirements, as you might guess, Miss Dumas,\u201d Riley tells her. \u201cBut he\u2019s been very specific in the fact that he\u2019s no longer interested in the friends we had secured for him during our trip. He wants to focus on what\u2019s important, and instead, he wants you to come work for him.\u201d</p><p>She glances at Riley, then Pete, and then at me, and she looks puzzled, which is cute.</p><p>Pete flips through the folders. \u201cYou interned at the Military Academy of Seattle in sports rehab for their middle graders, and we see you\u2019ve graduated only two weeks ago. We\u2019re prepared to hire your services, which will cover the duration of our eight cities we have left to tour, and Mr. Tate\u2019s continued conditioning for future competitions. We will be very generous with your salary. It\u2019s very prestigious to tend to such a followed athlete and should be impressive in any r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It might even allow you to be a free agent if in the future you decide to leave.\u201d</p><p>She blinks and seems completely disconcerted. \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it. I\u2019m not really looking for something away from Seattle long term.\u201d</p><p>She glances at me, somehow hesitantly and even confused. \u201cNow if that\u2019s all you wanted to say to me, I\u2019d better get home. I\u2019ll leave my card on your bar.\u201d She swings around and heads for the door.</p><p>For a moment, I stare at her retreating back, disappointed as fuck.</p><p>I\u2019ve been planning this for days. I\u2019ve been wondering what it would be like to have her with me every day. I\u2019ve been stone-hard to the point of pain imagining what her hands on me will feel like. . . .</p><p>\u201cAnswer me now,\u201d I say, my voice harsher than I anticipated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She pivots around in surprise, and I pin her down with my eyes and silently will her to fucking understand that I\u2019m trying to do a good thing here, to get to know someone\u2014to get to know her\u2014and I don\u2019t want her pissing on it like it\u2019s nothing. Like I\u2019m used to doing this sort of shit for anyone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve offered you a job, and I want an answer.\u201d</p><p>A leaden silence descends.</p><p>She stares at me, and I stare back just as fiercely, the air charged around us.</p><p>I\u2019ve wanted nothing but to kiss her since the first night I saw her. I only gave her a peck, just so she knew I was going to have her. Now I wish I\u2019d stuck my tongue inside so I could have appeased this wild craving to know what she tastes like. I want to know all of her, every scarred little piece of her knee, to the perfect contours of her face, to the way she thinks. And whether she wants to or not, I want her to know me.</p><p>She seems to drag a breath for courage before she starts nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll work with you for the three months you have left to tour, if you include room and board and my transportation, guarantee me references for my next job application, and let me promote the fact that I\u2019ve worked with you with my future clients.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her answer takes me aback, and when she swings around to leave, I quickly stop her by saying, \u201cAll right.\u201d When she turns, I glance at the guys. \u201cBut I want it on paper she\u2019s not leaving until the tour is over.\u201d</p><p>I get up and head over to her.</p><p>She watches me approach with those alarmed doe eyes again; they are soft as a deer\u2019s, but far prettier. Her breasts rise and fall, and I like that she knows. She knows something is going on here. She\u2019s confused that I didn\u2019t pursue her like she\u2019d thought, but that is all right. Because my pursuit will be slower now, and deeper, so that in the end I can take her, fast and hard, like I\u2019m used to taking everything in my life by force. But she\u2019s so special, I want to reach the very core of her being before she\u2019s mine. And when I\u2019m there, and she\u2019s soft and yielding to me, I\u2019m not going to let her go.</p><p>Holding her gold gaze, I squeeze her hand gently, whispering, \u201cWe have a deal, Brooke.\u201d</p> <p>PAST</p><p>TO ATLANTA</p><p>There\u2019s an image in my head of Pete and Riley arriving at the airport without Brooke Dumas, and I don\u2019t like it. Pacing the length of my jet, up and down, I ram my hands into my jeans and peer out the window, but there\u2019s still no Pete or Riley or Brooke Dumas.</p><p>I pull my hands out and crack my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cSave it for the ring, boy,\u201d Coach grumbles, flipping through a sports magazine, and I flex my fingers and inhale deeply. I need to train. I\u2019ve needed to train longer, harder lately. I\u2019m horny as fuck and just thinking about her gives me a hard-on.</p> <p>From the bar, I grab a bottle of water, down it slow and cold, trying to relax. Then I go take a seat on the bench and put on my headphones. I scan my songs and look for something fast and hard, select it, and let it blast in my ears\u2014then I see movement up in the front of the plane.</p><p>All my insides go still.</p><p>Nothing does that to me but looking at her.</p><p>And, yep, I\u2019m looking.</p><p>My eyes feel out of control as they run up and down her body while Pete introduces her to Coach and Diane. My heart starts pumping blood to the south of my body, and the music blasting into my ears is forgotten. She doesn\u2019t see me yet, but I see her. Every inch of my rapidly swelling cock is aware that she\u2019s near.</p><p>Her round butt is encased in a knee-length skirt. My eyes run down her lean, toned calves and her pretty ankles to her feet in plain ballet-type shoes. An image of those ankles locked at the small of my back as I thrust into her body flashes through me. I fist my hands at my sides and force myself to exhale, but my blood is still prepping me to mate with her.</p> <p>I watch as Pete finally directs her in my direction, and every primal instinct inside me stirs as she starts down the aisle toward me. A blush reddens her pretty tan skin. It colors her face and spreads down her throat and dips into her cleavage, and I want to pull open the buttons of her top and see if she\u2019s blushing all the way to the tips of her pretty little tits. God, I want to hold those little tits and take them in my mouth, and most of all, I want to see the expression on her face while I do so.</p><p>Pushing the thought aside, I pull off my headphones, turn off my iPod, and stare at her face. She\u2019s not only beautiful as fuck, but she\u2019s excited, her eyes shining into me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met the rest of the staff?\u201d I ask her, my voice gruff with arousal.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiles, a genuine smile that goes all the way to her eyes as she takes her seat and neatly straps on her seat belt. Her soft, smoky voice has a strange, calming effect on me. But my dick is still pressing hard against my zipper, and I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do with it for the next couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cDid you hire me for a particular sports injury or more as prevention?\u201d she asks.</p><p>More so I could claim you. \u201cPrevention,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She chews on the inside of her cheek as she surveys me, and she has no idea that as she measures the breadth of my chest, my arms, and my torso, I\u2019m struggling hard not to lean down and kiss her lips.</p><p>\u201cHow are your shoulders?\u201d she asks, looking quite the professional little thing. \u201cYour elbows? Do you want me to work on anything for Atlanta? Pete tells me it\u2019s a several-hour flight.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, it will be, and I\u2019ll probably have blue balls by the end, but what the hell. I want her to touch me bad enough that I stretch out my arm and offer her my hand.</p><p>She seems slightly surprised but takes it in both of hers; I don\u2019t expect the way my gut tangles at the contact. Her body warmth blends with mine when she opens my huge hand with her little fingers and starts rubbing my palm, searching for knots. Her fingers are strong, but soft, and her touch is torture to my libido but too close to heaven to stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to such big hands. My students\u2019 hands are usually easier to rub down,\u201d she tells me animatedly.</p><p>Soft fingers scrape across the calluses in my palms as we talk about her students, and how I condition eight hours a day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to stretch you when you\u2019re done training. Is that what your specialists also do for you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I nod, and my mind instantly goes to the YouTube video I\u2019ve been watching nonstop. I really fucking wish I\u2019d been there so I could crush the asshole woman\u2019s video camera with my hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Who pats your injury down?\u201d I ask as I signal to the knee brace that peeks from under her skirt.</p><p>\u201cNo one anymore. I\u2019m done with rehab.\u201d She raises a brow and looks alarmed. \u201cYou googled me too? Or did your guys tell you?\u201d</p><p>I googled you, and I wanted to punch my fist through a wall, then go get you and carry you off that track and lick your tears dry.</p><p>Pulling free of her hand, I realize I\u2019m the one who wants to do the touching here, so I signal at the knee. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem delighted about the attention, but ends up lifting her knee anyway. I seize it with one hand and rip open the Velcro, instantly spotting the scar cutting across the joint.</p><p>I hold her knee in my hand, and I stroke my thumb across, noticing her slim, muscled thighs, the tightness of her quad muscle. She\u2019s strong and lean, but lithe, like a cheetah. I want her. Refusing to stop touching her, I explore her marred skin and she bites her lip and exhales.</p><p>\u201cIt still hurts?\u201d I gently ask.</p><p>She nods and explains that it\u2019s a double injury. She tore her ACL first six years ago, and then again two years ago.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts not to compete anymore?\u201d I prod.</p><p>Her expression softens when she holds my gaze, and something, something invisible, tugs me to her even as I watch her lean the slightest fraction closer to me. \u201cYes. It does. You\u2019d understand, right?\u201d</p><p>Slowly I lower her leg, and instead of nodding, I stroke my thumb across her knee, so she knows that I do understand. More than she knows. We both watch me caress her, and, god, it feels so right I want to drag my finger up the inside of her thigh and under her skirt, so before I follow the impulse, I pull back and stretch out my free hand, gruffly telling her, \u201cDo this one.\u201d</p><p>Testing the territory, I slide my arm along the seat behind her as she takes my hand and starts working it. My nostrils twitch at our closeness; she doesn\u2019t pull away. She smells . . . of soap and some sort of berry shampoo, plus her own female scent is sweet and warm in my nose. She probes and searches and I open my eyes and watch her face, soft and yet concentrating. My heart pounds faster.</p><p>She moves to my wrist, and she twirls and then probes into my forearm, and when she closes her eyes with a look of utter concentration and pleasure, I want to groan and tease and laugh at her and kiss her all at the same time. She looks young and innocent, and my hunter-gatherer instincts are in full force. I\u2019ve hunted her and now I want to gather her to me. . . .</p><p>I decide to touch her. Tease her. I want to make her smile. Hell, I want to see her smile at me.</p><p>I cup the nape of her neck and I lean in. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She opens those gold eyes, lowers my hand, and smiles in bemusement. Fuck me standing, but she was getting worked up with me and every inch of my body knows it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I smile, but I\u2019m hot and bothered and delighted, all at once. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed. You\u2019re very thorough, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>She grins almost innocently. \u201cI am. And wait until I get to your shoulders and back. I might have to stand on you.\u201d</p><p>She amuses me. So much I poke her biceps with my fingers. Then her triceps, and I say, \u201cHmm,\u201d and when I place her hand around my biceps, her eyes flare wide. I love it. I know she likes how big and hard it is, but she pretends otherwise and playfully responds, \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>We laugh. We\u2019re laughing when she seems to realize Pete and company have fallen quiet and are watching us.</p><p>She pulls something out from her bag, and I glare at Pete, silently telling him, Back off, bozo!</p><p>She clears her throat and sets an iPod and headphones on her lap. Curious, I snatch up her iPod and connect my headphones and start going through her music, handing her mine in return. She has tons of recent songs and some earlier older ones I recognize. She drops her headphones and grabs her iPod back, returning mine.</p><p>\u201cWho can relax to that?\u201d she protests.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to relax?\u201d I taunt.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I give her back my iPod. \u201cI\u2019ve got to have some easy listening for you. Listen to one of mine and I will listen to one of yours.\u201d</p><p>I scan my iPod, sure of the song I want. I don\u2019t regularly listen to it, but the times it comes on shuffle, I hear every fucking word, and now the need to play it to her is becoming more intense by the second.</p><p>A song plays for me from her library, and it\u2019s sassy, but I\u2019m mostly watching her listen to the one I picked for her.</p><p>She ducks her head to cover her profile with her hair. Her hand trembles on the iPod.</p><p>I can\u2019t take it and lean forward to catch her expression.</p><p>I keep listening to the song she played me. How she won\u2019t write me a love song. That\u2019s okay. She\u2019s still playing me one, really.</p><p>My lips twitch and I chuckle, but she ducks her head to her lap as she listens to the rest of the song.</p><p>My smile fades, my body tight. Fuck, I want her. I want her to get it. I want her to get me.</p><p>She listens quietly to \u201cIris\u201d from the Goo Goo Dolls, then she slowly removes her headphones and returns my iPod. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed you had slow songs in there,\u201d she murmurs, talking to my iPod as she returns it.</p><p>I keep my voice low so that only she hears. \u201cI have twenty thousand songs\u2014everything is in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she automatically protests, then checks my iPod and notices it\u2019s true. God, she\u2019s adorable.</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d I quietly ask her.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>Her cheeks are flushed, and it takes all my effort not to kiss her. Instead I search for another song on my iPod and pass it over to her, playing \u201cLove Bites\u201d to her so she hopefully gets an idea of how very much I want her.</p><p>PRESENT</p><p>SEATTLE</p><p>It\u2019s not really fun to ride in a convertible when you\u2019re stuck in traffic,\u201d Pete muses as we hit some traffic and sit there like mannequins in a storefront. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The people inside the cars around us are staring. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking a couple hearts just sitting there, Rem,\u201d Riley chuckles from the back and angles his thumb over at a car filled with coeds.</p><p>They start squeaking when I look at them, and my guys laugh.</p><p>Turning straight ahead, I curl my fingers into my fist and slip my ring back on, then I survey my knuckles. I\u2019m so ready for the season. Brooke is already packing for Racer. Seems like the plane luggage is going to be full of baby stuff, strollers, and everything Racer has invaded us with since he was born. I\u2019m fucking anxious to have Brooke just for me for a night where she doesn\u2019t need to hurry out of my arms and tend to him.</p><p>\u201cHotel suite ready?\u201d I ask Pete as the traffic finally starts easing.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy iPod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Took it this morning, and headphones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery detail to the T as discussed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Pete says.</p> <p>I raise a brow at him, but he starts to drive forward, leaving me musing on the word everything.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to take her in my arms.</p><p>I can\u2019t. Fucking. Wait. To marry her again.</p><p>The first time I married her, it was in City Hall, now we\u2019ll be in a real church.</p><p>I wanted to ask her to marry me with a song after last season\u2019s final, but Racer decided to drop by early, and I ended up proposing with Brooke in the beginning of labor in my arms, breathing in short, panting breaths of pain. \u201cThe song was supposed to ask you to marry me, but you\u2019ll have to settle on me doing the asking,\u201d I\u2019d whispered, looking intently into her eyes. \u201cMind. Body. Soul. All of you for me. All of you mine . . . Marry me, Brooke Dumas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYES!\u201d she\u2019d cried, laughing, and crying. \u201cYes yes yes,\u201d she\u2019d repeated, and I\u2019m so fucking glad she kept saying yes because I couldn\u2019t hear it enough. I\u2019d wanted to win the championship for her. I wanted to feel worthy of her. Right then and there, with that one word, she made me feel like I was.</p> <p>And hours later I was half mad with pain watching her give birth, and I barely thought I could take it when I heard the first cry of our\u2014our\u2014baby. I wanted a girl as perfect as Brooke, and instead, she gave me something I never knew I wanted: something perfect that looks like me.</p><p>PAST</p><p>ATLANTA</p><p>The heavy bag swings. Slam. Wham. It swings, side to side, as I drive my fist into the center and follow with my left, then my right. Slam. Wham. Thunk. Slam.</p><p>Coach tells me I\u2019m showing off, and I\u2019m not going to waste my words and explain to him the ways I intend to keep showing off my moves in front of her.</p><p>I picture Scorpion, my mortal nemesis\u2019s face, in the center of my bag and wham. Bam. Thunk.</p><p>When I boxed with professionals, everyone wanted my ass. I was younger, faster, and stronger\u2014you\u2019re not taught this shit. You have a good fist, or you don\u2019t, and fists were all I had. But when I look at Brooke, I\u2019m aware of another use for my hands, how their palms and the tips of my fingers want to trace every inch of her slim, lean, little body.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Remington having for breakfast?\u201d she asked Diane this morning as she walked into the suite.</p> <p>I perked up at the table, and when Brooke noticed, she smiled and said, \u201cGood morning, Remington.\u201d</p><p>The way she says my name feels like a lick across my body.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Brooke,\u201d I rumbled.</p><p>Pete and Diane observed us in noticeable amusement.</p><p>Once Brooke had brought her plate over to the table and sat on the opposite side of where I was, I watched her slide the fork into her mouth and suddenly became so thirsty that I jammed a carrot into my mouth. She licked the corner of her lips, and I wanted to go over there and haul her down with me, on my lap, lick up the flavors from her mouth.</p><p>I leaned back as Pete told me something, and I wanted to toss all the plates aside and spread her on this table, get her ass in my hands, lick my tongue across her spine and up to her neck while my fingers worked all the soft and wet spots of her. I grunted at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pete says.</p><p>She looked up at me.</p><p>I scowled at Pete. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said.</p><p>He shook his head and stood while Diane asked Brooke something about how she dealt with all these men. When she laughed at that, my body tightened and I stared. Her throat curved back, her ponytail falling. I wanted to pull it down as I tipped her head back and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d Riley asked from the door. You done ogling her? I could see him think.</p><p>Scowling, I grabbed my stuff as we headed off.</p><p>Now I\u2019ve been pounding the bags\u2014all of them\u2014as fast and hard as I can, and I still can\u2019t get rid of all this extra energy. Pausing for a moment, I look at her on the sidelines, hot as fuck in her tight exercise gear and ready to put her hands on me. I want them so badly, tonight I want to keep her for hours in my room, working on my body.</p><p>On me.</p><p>Hours later, I\u2019m prepped and primed by the time I\u2019m in the Underground locker room.</p><p>My body engages when the announcer calls, \u201cRemington Tate, Riiiiiptide!\u201d</p><p>Screams burst across the arena, rushing through me. I trot outside, and I know exactly what to do when I hit the ring. I draw it out for the crowd tonight, and I take my time tossing my robe aside and making my turn, amused by the screams, the kisses flying at me, the banners.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, the famed and acclaimed Owen Wilkes, the \u2018Irish Grasshopper\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Grasshopper heads for the ring, and while the crowd takes him in, I look at Brooke. She sits with her dark hair down while the corners of her sweet, little mouth are curled upward for me, and for as long as I\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve never seen something so pretty from up here.</p><p>The bell snaps me back to attention.</p><p>I head to center. Grasshopper is in my peripherals, jumping side to side like a fucking springboard. He\u2019ll wear out soon. I wait and watch him. I see my opening on his side. I swing, slamming my fist into his gut, knocking him out.</p><p>\u201cRemyyyyyyy!\u201d people scream.</p><p>The line of opponents keeps building as I fight my way to the Butcher. He\u2019s twice my weight and three times as wide, but nobody cares about that. He draws blood, and so do I.</p><p>He takes the ring with the agility of a meatball. Then he looks at me. I look at him.</p><p>The bell rings: Ting.</p><p>We take positions and eye each other over our knuckles. Butcher is known to wait boxers out, but I\u2019m impatient to get things going. My knuckles knock into his jaw several times; I start with easy, quick hits, then I edge back and Butcher comes at me with a solid punch to the side that rocks me back a step. It takes me a moment to get back in position. I inhale through my nose, then my arms shoot out and I bury my fists, one after the other, into Butcher\u2019s flabby stomach. I back off and watch him swing, and instead of covering, I take the hit. He slams me again.</p><p>\u201cBoo! Boohooo!\u201d the crowd shouts. I see his fist coming at me again, and I catch it with my face. My head swings and blood flies from my mouth. That\u2019s better.</p><p>Straightening, I lick up the metal taste in my mouth.</p><p>He slams me down to one knee.</p><p>The screams intensify, and I know the entire arena must be looking at me, but I\u2019m only aware of her eyes on me. I jump back to my feet and wipe my bleeding lips. Endorphins kill the pain. I glance at her, but the look on her face gives me pause. She\u2019s white as paper. Hell, she looks ready to bolt. I\u2019m so damned puzzled by the worry in her face, I take another punch. This one rocks my balance and before I know it, I\u2019m bouncing against the ropes, something I never do.</p><p>\u201cREMY . . . REMY . . . REMY!\u201d the crowd starts chanting.</p><p>I\u2019m caked with sweat and my mouth is still bleeding when I straighten and notice Brooke is not even watching me fight anymore. She\u2019s dropped her head and stares at her lap.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s the way to impress her, you fucking dickhead.</p><p>Clamping my jaw, I straighten and glance into Butcher\u2019s keen brown eyes. \u201cPlaytime\u2019s over,\u201d I growl, and I swing out one of my most powerful punches, feeling the crack of his ribs under my knuckles. He crashes like a dead weight on the mat, and the crowd comes alive with a roar. \u201cYeah!\u201d I hear the collective yell, then the chant, \u201cREMY! REMY! REMY!\u201d</p><p>I stand by as the counting begins, and a knot of frustration and disappointment tightens in my chest when Brooke still doesn\u2019t look at me. Finally, the announcer\u2019s voice bursts through the speaker as the ringmaster comes to raise my arm. \u201cOur victor, ladies and gentlemen! Riptide! Ripppppptiiiiiide! Yes, you hungry ladies out there, scream your hearts out for the baddest bad boy this ring has ever seen! Rippppppptiiiiiide!\u201d</p><p>The crowd starts shrieking my name, and I quickly jump off the ring and grab a Gatorade from the bucket at Coach\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cRemington,\u201d he snarls.</p><p>I shake my head and stalk down the walkway. I could tell by his tone that he wanted to have words, and I\u2019m not in the mood to get my head chewed off in front of Brooke.</p><p>Back at the hotel, back in my room, I drop down on the bench at the foot of my bed and wait, sipping my Gatorade, replaying the pretty smile she gave me before the fight.</p><p>By the time she walks into my room, I\u2019m so impatient, it feels like I\u2019ve waited for this girl all my life. Our eyes lock, and the hunter in me goes wild. Her cheeks are flushed, and her legs long and endless in those jeans she wears. I want those legs and those arms around me, that mouth under mine, whispering my name. Fuck me, when can I have her? I loathe thinking I\u2019m going to make her mine and the day my dark side catches up with me, she\u2019ll be gone, her walls will be up and she won\u2019t let me in, and I will be forever every woman\u2019s adventure. A sex god and a plaything. Nobody\u2019s real. Nobody\u2019s choice. Nobody\u2019s anything.</p><p>\u201cLike the fight?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cYou broke the last one\u2019s ribs,\u201d she tells me, breathless.</p><p>I drain my Gatorade and send the bottle spinning across the floor as I force the knots in my chest to loosen. \u201cAre you worried about him, or me?\u201d I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m fucking jealous of the Butcher.</p><p>Her lips pull at the corners. \u201cHim, because he\u2019s the one who won\u2019t be able to stand tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Then\u2014finally!\u2014she comes and does what I secretly wanted her to do. She kneels between my thighs and starts to smear a thick, shiny paste over the cut on my lower lip. I get instantly hard. Her sweet scent teases my nostrils, and I force my body not to move a single muscle so she doesn\u2019t stop what she\u2019s doing.</p><p>God, she smells like a fucking angel.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I hear her suddenly admit to me, her voice a soft whisper. \u201cI worry about you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the top of her head and want to bury my nose in all that dark hair and sniff her until the world ends. She covers up the salve tin and remains on her knees and seems to consider what to do next. I want her hands all over me, so I wrack my brain to find the source of my biggest discomfort, other than my dick.</p><p>\u201cI messed up my right shoulder, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>A spark of concern flashes in her gaze, and when she notices my smile, she rolls her eyes at me and sighs. \u201cWith a bulldozer like you, I knew it was too much to hope you\u2019d survive this night with just a cut lip.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you going to come fix it?\u201d</p><p>She pushes to her feet but huffs as if she doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cOf course. Someone has to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m amused by her, how she acts tough and sassy with me. I like it.</p><p>She heads to the back of the bed and grabs my shoulders in her hands. She prods expertly into my tissue, and when she hits the spot, an annoying pain starts to awaken. I zone out of there and focus on the feel of her cool, little fingers.</p> <p>\u201cThat ugly bastard landed a pretty hard one here. He landed a lot of hard ones. Does it hurt?\u201d she whispers. She eases on her investigations for a second, then she pushes even deeper.</p><p>She\u2019s pushing so hard, a fractionally amused part of me wonders if she wants to make me sound like a pussy and say, Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rub you down with arnica, and we\u2019ll do cold therapy.\u201d</p><p>She sounds businesslike as she works some nice-smelling oil into my skin. I hear the slick sounds as her touch slides over my skin, and I imagine turning around, lowering her down on my bed, and being the one who drags his hands all over her. Being the one who finds a slick spot that makes noise when I rub my fingers across.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say no, but I can tell this time it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other parts of me that are hurting more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d The door of the suite slams shut, and Pete storms into the master bedroom squealing like a freaking banshee. \u201cWhat? The hell?\u201d Pete demands.</p><p>A couple of seconds later, Riley joins the party. \u201cCoach\u2019s in a snit!\u201d he rants. \u201cWhat we all want to know is, why the fuck are you letting your ass get kicked?\u201d</p><p>Brooke\u2019s hands stop massaging my shoulders, and I swear to god, I want to pound their faces in for taking those hands away from me.</p> <p>\u201cYes or no: You let him get in on purpose?\u201d Riley demands.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>But the look I\u2019m sending in their direction is so clear, only a wall would not understand my fucking meaning\u2014to piss off!</p><p>\u201cDo you need to get laid?\u201d Pete asks, glaring as he signals down at my lap and the painful, pulsing erection she just gave me. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Brooke mumbles something under her breath, and the moment she leaves, Pete fixes his attention on me. \u201cDude, you can\u2019t let them do this to you just so you get her hands all over you. Look, we can arrange some girls. Whatever it is you\u2019re doing, you can\u2019t play these damned games like a normal person. You\u2019re just torturing yourself, Rem. This is a dangerous thing you\u2019re doing with her.\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding in anger and frustration. She. Is. Mine. Mine to take. Goddamn them for making me feel like I\u2019m not worthy of her.</p><p>God.</p><p>Damn.</p> <p>Them.</p><p>\u201cYou bet all your money on yourself this year, remember that episode?\u201d Pete asks me, like I\u2019m a fucking moron and don\u2019t remember the million other times he\u2019s told me this in a panic. \u201cNow you need to defeat Scorpion at the final no matter what. And this includes her, dude.\u201d</p><p>Teeth clenched, I keep my voice low as I fight to keep my temper in check, but my god, I want to punch them. Scorpion is a walking corpse. Nothing on this earth or on this planet will keep me from busting his face open and taking the title that belongs to me. He ruined my life once and that\u2019s fucking enough for me.</p><p>\u201cScorpion\u2019s a fucking dead man, so just back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pay us to prevent this shit, Remy,\u201d Pete counters, jerking on his tie as he paces around.</p><p>I rise to my feet and look at Riley, then wait for Pete to stop pacing and look at me. They\u2019re my guys. My brothers. I pay them a lot of money to keep me from doing shit, and to keep me from screwing up. But I\u2019m not screwing up with Brooke. Jesus, I haven\u2019t set a fucking finger on her even when the thought of her under me is taking chunks out of my brain. I softly growl, \u201cI\u2019ve got. It. Under. Control.\u201d</p><p>Shoving past them, I go grab my sweatpants and a T-shirt, then slam into my bathroom to change. I find Brooke in the kitchen, talking to Diane, and the mere sight of her round butt is a friendly greeting to my dick. Under control my ass. I\u2019m a walking tornado of lust and it\u2019s all because of her.</p><p>Stepping close behind her, I seize her wrist and tug her around to look at me. \u201cDo you want to run with me?\u201d</p><p>I want to be with her. Alone.</p><p>If I can\u2019t fuck her yet, I want her close. I want her in my space, so deep that soon I want her space and mine to be the same\u2014to be buried to the hilt in her, and she\u2019s wrapped, hot and wet, all around me, and we\u2019re just Brooke and Remington.</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s alarmed by the tumultuous energy around me, and I can\u2019t help but notice how cautiously she inspects my bruised chest.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat, Remy,\u201d Diane chides from the corner.</p><p>Smirking at her, I grab a gallon of organic milk from the counter and down it, then wipe my mouth with the back of my arm.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dinner,\u201d I say, then I glance at Brooke, lift one eyebrow, and wait for her to answer.</p><p>The lady takes her sweet time.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d I prod.</p><p>Scowling thoughtfully, she keeps glancing at my chest. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asks, studying me with a keen, doctorly look I used to get at the Institute.</p><p>\u201cI feel like running.\u201d I peer into her gaze and dare her to deny that she wants to be alone with me too. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>I count up to eight heartbeats, and she still hesitates, driving me insane, until she finally nods. \u201cLet me grab my sneakers and put on my brace.\u201d</p><p>I nod, and my mouth waters as she walks out of the kitchen to go change. God, this girl is going to be the death of me.</p><p>We run along a well-lit dirt trail that\u2019s scattered with trees. As soon as we start, I pull my hood over my head to keep it warm and pump my fists in the air to keep the blood in my muscles rather than where it goes to when she\u2019s around. The air is cool. She wears running shorts and a top that hugs her curves, and in my peripherals I see her breasts bouncing, her butt firm as her long legs take those sprinter strides.</p><p>Drives me fucking crazy.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to Pete and Riley?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cOut looking for whores.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows go up as I keep punching into the air. \u201cFor you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Who cares.\u201d</p><p>Her ponytail bounces and swishes side to side, and I like it. I like the way she measures her stride to mine, how our feet hit the dirt at the same time.</p><p>We pass a couple of other runners on the trail, but we keep going. Brooke is fit and fast. I\u2019ve never had a training buddy, but I swear I could get used to this. To running with her.</p><p>We covered four fast miles easily before she stops and sets her hands on her knees and waves me forward. \u201cGo on, I\u2019m just gonna catch my breath, I\u2019m getting a cramp.\u201d</p><p>I search into my hoodie\u2019s front pocket and pass her an electrolyte pack, then I bounce in place to stay warm and thrust my fists alternately in the air as her marshmallow lips part and she slides the pack over her tongue.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Me.</p><p>Standing.</p><p>All my blood rushes to my groin.</p><p>I\u2019ve seemed to stop bouncing.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m even breathing.</p><p>Fuck me, she\u2019s tonguing that packet right in front of me, and I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t just stand here and watch like a dickhead. \u201cAny left?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She hands it over. I can\u2019t help but notice she watches me as intently as I just did her as I push it into my mouth. This is what I want to do to you, I think as I look at her. This is what I want to do to your tongue, Brooke.</p><p>Sucking the remaining gel out of the packet, my body tightens when her taste slides through me. The packet has never before tasted like this. Sweet, but sweeter. It\u2019s so fucking warm, and I\u2019m so turned on, I suck every last drop as I look at her. Her lashes are lighter at the tips, and they sweep upward as she forces her gaze from my lips, to my eyes. Eyes that I\u2019m fucking swallowing her with.</p><p>God, I want you. I want you now. I want you tomorrow. I want you the instant you\u2019re fucking ready for me.</p><p>\u201cAre they right? What Pete said? Are you doing it on purpose?\u201d</p><p>She holds my stare with curious intent, and I\u2019m trying to get my head straight, still rubbing my tongue on the packet. I\u2019ve never waited so long to claim something I want, and I\u2019ve never wanted anything like this. It\u2019s driving me insane and crazy. Her breasts look perfect in her running gear. Her ass. Her legs. She\u2019s delicious and I\u2019m hungry. I am so fucking hungry for her.</p><p>\u201cRemy, sometimes you break something and you never get it back. You never get it back.\u201d Her voice falters, and she glances at the street and passing cars for a moment.</p><p>And just like that the lightness of tasting her is gone and my chest feels heavy. The YouTube video plays in my head and the instinct to protect her from everything they said and everything they called her only frustrates me because I can\u2019t do shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your knee.\u201d I\u2019m not good with words, but as I slam-dunk the packet into the nearest trash can, I wish I were. I wish I could tell her how I feel thinking about her crying and helpless. I\u2019m going to fucking protect her from now on if it\u2019s the last thing I do on this planet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about my knee,\u201d she counters. \u201cIt\u2019s about you not taking your body for granted. Don\u2019t ever let anyone hurt you, don\u2019t ever allow it, Remy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head to appease her but scowl when I think of not ever getting hit again. She will never understand how much I crave her to touch me. Not only sexually. Her touch does crazy shit to me. I\u2019m sick for it. I\u2019m . . . sick.</p><p>Fuck me. She\u2019s so beautiful and I\u2019m so broken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, Brooke,\u201d I gruffly tell her. \u201cI just let them get close enough I can fuck them over. Little sacrifices in search of the win. It gives them confidence to get a couple of punches in, then it starts getting to their head, that I\u2019m easy\u2014that I\u2019m not like they\u2019ve heard I am\u2014and when they get drunk on how easy they\u2019re pounding Remington Tate, I go in.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes brighten beautifully. \u201cAll right. I like that so much better.\u201d</p><p>We keep running, our feet hitting the dirt, our breathing equal. Right here and right now, I\u2019m just a guy running with a girl and, holy mother, how I want her.</p><p>\u201cI think I quit. I\u2019m going to be so sore tomorrow, I\u2019d rather hit the sack now than require you to carry me to the hotel later,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>In the hotel elevator, several other people board with us, and instinctively I pull my hoodie lower over my head.</p><p>\u201cHold the elevator!\u201d a couple shouts, and Brooke presses the button until they hop in. I grip her hips and pull her close to me once they board. Then I drop my head, close my eyes, and smell her. My body heats instantly, and I get so worked up, I imagine peeling off her top and scraping my palms over her skin until I\u2019ve got her breasts nestled in my hands. . . .</p><p>\u201cYou feel any better?\u201d she asks, her voice somehow different from usual. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I duck my head even closer, and I want to kiss the back of her ear. Edging closer, willing her not to pull away, I put my mouth a hairbreadth away from her skin. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>The scent she wears right now makes my mouth water. Sweat is the best fucking accessory on her. She\u2019s sweaty and delicious and I want my tongue on her neck. My hand clenches on her hip, and I have to force myself to release her as we stop at our floor and step off the elevator. She steps into her room, then I head to mine, and soon I stand under my showerhead, making the water as cold as it can get and opening my mouth so the water hits my tongue, which still fucking tingles after tasting the electrolyte packet she did. I curl my hand around myself and close my eyes. Fuck, I want her. I want this in her. In her and on her.</p><p>I squeeze my length and then angle back so that the cold water runs over my body and cools me down. It doesn\u2019t. So I have to think of my parents. The final. Scorpion. And finally I\u2019m cool enough to soap up myself.</p><p>When I step out to dry, I hear female voices outside. Easing into a T-shirt and sweatpants, I head down the hall to the kitchen. \u201cHey, Rem, look what we got for you,\u201d Pete says from the living room, and he spreads his arms out.</p> <p>Two girls stand there.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d the blonde gasps.</p><p>\u201cRiptide,\u201d the redhead says.</p><p>Clamping my jaw, I shake my head and go grab my headphones from where I\u2019d left them this morning on the dining table. \u201cCome on, dude, they\u2019re putting up a show just for you.\u201d Riley follows me to the kitchen, where I pull out a coconut water from the small fridge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the fucking mood tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. You crave something else. That\u2019s okay. Just chill out with us, man.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I drop down and sip my drink as the girls start some sort of dance. One sits on my lap. The other dances on top of the coffee table. She\u2019s got all the right things, and she\u2019s readily displaying them for me. But what I want to see is Brooke in her exercise clothes, with her brace, her little boobs jumping up and down as she runs. No. What I want to see is Brooke bare-butt naked for me. I want her eyes to shine with desire. I want to know the size, shape, texture, and taste of her nipples, and I want to goddamn sink every part of myself, my cock, my tongue, my fucking fingers, inside her pussy and I want it to be wet.</p><p>Fuck me, I want it to be so wet, I want to hear it.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d the girl on my lap pouts. \u201cA little birdie told us you wanted to play with us, Remy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Riley asks to whoever is on the other side of the door.</p> <p>I stiffen when I hear a muffled voice, and my cock shoots up like steel when I realize it\u2019s Brooke.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I ask as Riley shuts the door. I shove the chick off my lap and stalk over.</p><p>\u201cBrooke seemed to lose something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she lose?\u201d I\u2019m sure as fuck she must have seen the dancer, and I\u2019m sure as fuck I don\u2019t want her thinking I\u2019m putting my hands on anyone but her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude! She made a mistake!\u201d he cries.</p><p>I charge to the door, and when there\u2019s no sign of her outside, I start down the hall to her room. I reach the doorknob and engulf it in my palm, and I swear it\u2019s still warm. I lean my forehead against the door and my heart pounds as I strain to hear something inside, but there\u2019s no noise.</p><p>I stand there like a fool. Thinking about her breath as she ran with me. The way her ponytail bounced when her shoes hit the dirt. The sight of those pink lips around the electrolyte packet in the way I want them around me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I stand there, but I\u2019m there when an old couple walk past and stare at me in pity, like I\u2019m some poor fuck kicked out of his own room. Hell, I wish that was my room. I head back to the suite, rescue my headphones from the blonde\u2019s butt, then I head to my room. The guys keep partying outside. They\u2019re disappointed, and I know, but I don\u2019t care. I slip on my headphones and stare up at the ceiling as the music starts. I got banged up today. I put my body under immense strain; I don\u2019t feel it. All I feel is this fucking ache inside me that I somehow want her to magically fill. I\u2019m hard and throbbing and wondering if she wants me, if she gets wet when she thinks about me.</p> <p>The guys think I\u2019m obsessed with her, that I\u2019m going to get manic any second now and once again fuck up my entire life like I always do.</p><p>They\u2019re so right, I don\u2019t even laugh anymore when they warn me.</p><p>I HAD A wet dream.</p><p>I woke up in the middle of the night, thrusting the mattress, growling her name. I didn\u2019t let myself come. I snapped awake, punched the pillow, roared in frustration, and filled the tub with cold water, then sank myself in and stayed there until the sun rose.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been a merry dandelion in the morning, but today my bad mood and my sexual frustrations hang over me like a cloud with fucking thunderbolts in my head.</p><p>My sparring partners? These guys have tits and a vagina. They can\u2019t take a good sparring session, and Coach? He\u2019s in a snit when I knock them both down.</p><p>\u201cThese are sparring partners, Tate! If you\u2019d only stop knocking them down and just have fun and work on your moves, you\u2019d still have someone to train with today. . . . Now we\u2019ve run out and you have no one to practice against anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop giving me little pussies, Coach,\u201d I angrily spit. \u201cSend Riley up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Not even if he were suicidal. I need him conscious tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Rem, I\u2019ve got a little something for you,\u201d the man in question suddenly calls, clapping on the side. \u201cI know for sure he\u2019s not going to knock this one out, Coach,\u201d Riley says, and then he signals happily at Brooke.</p><p>I notice Brooke\u2014Brooke Dumas, of all people\u2014is climbing into the ring with me. I want to laugh. It\u2019s like matching a kitten to a lion, but I don\u2019t laugh because she\u2019s wearing a black Lycra sort of outfit that molds to her every fucking curve. My eyes sweep over her and my entire body seizes. She starts to approach, swinging her hips and looking fierce, like she plans to inflict some damage on me.</p><p>I like her so much, my fucking chest hurts looking at her.</p><p>I like her eyes, her mouth, her smile, the things she says. I like her white, little teeth, her slim, small, strong hands. Her lean runner\u2019s legs. The shade of her skin, sun-kissed and lovely. I like the ways she wears her hair. I\u2019m attracted to every inch of this woman and every day is a challenge to keep my hands to myself when my gut screams at me to Take. Her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t smile like that. I can knock you down with my feet,\u201d she warns me.</p><p>She\u2019s so cute, I can\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s not kickboxing. Or are you going to bite too?\u201d</p><p>She swings her leg out and I deflect it easily with one arm, lifting one eyebrow. Well, well, well, now. She\u2019s pissed at me?</p><p>She kicks again, and I deflect, then watch her circle me and jump up and down as she warms up. Clearly, she\u2019s attempting to weave, and she\u2019s not only pretty good\u2014she looks so damned good doing it. I want to stand here all day and let her weave around me and even punch me if she wants. She tries a test punch. I\u2019m too well trained. My body moves on automatic. My arm flies out to catch her full fist in my palm.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I softly admonish, and curl my fingers over hers and tell her how to make a good fist. She tries, and I nod. \u201cNow use your other arm to guard.\u201d</p><p>Pretty soon she\u2019s playfully attacking, flushed and excited, her eyes sparkling. Brooke can attack all she wants\u2014and in the meantime, I\u2019m watching her perky little breasts bounce up and down. She wants me to show her a new move? All right then. I do, taking advantage to touch her as much as possible. She\u2019s a fast learner, but something dark and bloodthirsty is in her eyes. They glitter murder as she looks at me. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s in a twist about, but I know that if she were mine already, I\u2019d kiss her so hard she\u2019d forget about everything but the way I fuck my tongue into her mouth.</p><p>She smashes her fist into my abs, and I\u2019m so taken aback by her speed, I blink. \u201cI\u2019m so good,\u201d she taunts.</p><p>Fuck, that\u2019s about the hottest thing a woman\u2019s done to me. She\u2019s fucking punching me. I\u2019m too distracted now. Here she is. In my ring. The first woman to ever get up here with me, and I\u2019m sure god made her just this ballsy so she could stand up to me. I\u2019m selfish like that. I think everything about her was made for me. I feel proprietary. Territorial. I want to make a claim. I want to take her down and strip her down and pin her under me.</p><p>She swings out with her foot and yelps when her foot strikes my sneakers. Instantly, I catch her by the arms, frowning in confusion. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>She scowls furiously. \u201cYou were supposed to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve toppled men much heavier than you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fucking tree topples sooner than Remy, Brooke,\u201d Riley shouts.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can see that,\u201d she grumbles, then cups her mouth and yells, \u201cThanks for the heads-up, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so annoyed she hurt herself with me, I lead her, as she hops on one foot, to the corner, where I drop down on the chair and haul her on top of me so I can prod her ankle. \u201cYou fucked your ankle, didn\u2019t you?\u201d And she says I\u2019m reckless? That I hurt my body deliberately? Did she think she was better than my ring opponents, or what\u2014the\u2014hell?</p><p>\u201cI just seemed to wrongly send all my weight to my ankle,\u201d she admits.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you hit me? Are you pissed at me?\u201d I demand.</p><p>She scowls. \u201cWhy would I be?\u201d</p><p>Fuck me, I know she\u2019s angry\u2014I\u2019m no idiot\u2014and I want to know what the hell I fucking did. If she doesn\u2019t like me right now, then I don\u2019t stand a chance when I get manic. Worse. When I get depressed like some loser asshole. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She ducks her head as she catches her breath, a sheen of perspiration on her neck.</p><p>\u201cHey, can we get some water over here?\u201d I call.</p><p>Riley brings over a Gatorade and a plain bottle of water and sets them by my feet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re wrapping up,\u201d he informs us, then he peers around to have a good look at her. \u201cYou all right, B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDandy. Call me tomorrow, please. I can\u2019t wait to get back in the ring with this dude.\u201d</p><p>As Riley laughs his head off, I test her ankle with my fingers, prodding into the tissue. \u201cThat hurt, Brooke?\u201d I ask as gently as possible, and then her fingers join mine around her ankle.</p><p>\u201cYou weigh a ton,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIf you weighed a little less, I\u2019d have toppled you. I even toppled my instructor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d I peer, confused, into her face, wishing to know what she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry? For my pride\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, annoyed that she try such a stunt with me\u2014me. Bending, she grabs the Gatorade and unscrews it as she straightens, and the blood suddenly boils in my veins as she sips. Her neck, the way the sleek, long tendons work as she swallows, fuck me now. My cock thickens painfully under her bottom, and with a voice thickened with arousal, I can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cCan I get some?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I set my lips on the rim, it\u2019s wet from hers, and the way she watches me drink makes my balls hurt. I want to toss this shit aside and drink directly from her mouth. Instead, I return the Gatorade and make sure I brush my fingers over hers at the exchange, because I\u2019m a devil and I need the contact. My eyes stay locked on hers as I steal that touch that shoots like a bolt up my arm, and neither of us is laughing.</p><p>She tries standing, and I instantly take the bottle and set it down, then I wrap my arm around her waist. \u201cI\u2019ll help you up so you can ice that.\u201d</p><p>She leans on me as I lower her from the ring and help her out of the gym, her arm coming around my waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she keeps on telling me.</p> <p>\u201cStop arguing,\u201d I softly command.</p><p>She keeps her arm around me as we board the hotel elevator, then I lock her at my side as we ride upstairs. In profile, her nose is exquisitely dainty, and that smooth, pink mouth is perennially curved in a way that tempts me to kiss it. Her scent tickles my nostrils, and as if with a mind of its own, my nose drops as I try to find the source of that delicious smell. Holy god, I want to lick up all that sexy sweat from her neck.</p><p>One of her firm, high-perched tits softly presses into my rib cage, and I can\u2019t pull my brain out of there. I\u2019m painfully aware of the way that sweet little tit brushes against my side as we exit the elevator.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, ready for the fight?\u201d a hotel staff member asks from across the hall, and I offer him a thumbs-up as we reach her room.</p><p>\u201cKey,\u201d I whisper to her.</p> <p>She fumbles, then quietly I take it from her hand, slide it into the slot, and help her inside. The first bed has a ton of family pictures facing the nightstand. I set her down on the second one and I grab the leather bucket. \u201cI\u2019ll get you ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, Remy, I\u2019ll do it later,\u201d she protests.</p><p>I pull the lock out to stop the door and go into the hallway to fill the bucket up half with ice. When I return to the room, I add some water.</p><p>Her face is pink in embarrassment when I kneel at her feet and set the bucket on the carpet, and the black of her catsuit only heightens the peach hue of her skin. I remove her tennis shoe and her sock, then I curl my hand around her calf muscle and guide her foot into the cold.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get this fixed, I\u2019m going to show you how to knock me down,\u201d I whisper, flicking my eyes up to hers, and, god, I could eat her. Eat. Her. She\u2019s biting down on her lower lip, her eyes wide and almost vulnerable as she lets me guide her foot into what has to equal the freezing waters of Antarctica.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>She sounds like her lungs are closing. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I sink her foot deeper, and she tenses completely, all the animation gone from her face. I\u2019m torn between the urge to stop torturing her, and fixing her ankle. \u201cMore water?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and then surprises me when she shoves her foot all the way under the water. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d she gasps. And I know I should hold her foot in no matter what, but my instinct to protect her is so fierce I yank her foot out, flattening her skin against my abs to suck the cold out from it with my body heat. My muscles clench in shock, and her wide, surprised gold eyes lock on my face in startlement. Every one of her tiny, cold toes burns into my flesh, and I\u2019ve been so successful in teaching my body to embrace pain, I want them closer. I curve my hand around her instep and hold her flat against me.</p><p>She looks breathless. From the cold. Or from me? She also sounds breathless. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you gave pedicures, Remy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fetish of mine.\u201d</p><p>I smile a lazy smile, then I pull out an ice cube and stroke it gently across her ankle. I make sure that her skin doesn\u2019t burn as I circle around her, and I\u2019m moving slowly enough that I can hear her breathing rhythm quicken. I shift my hold on her foot and rub my thumb along the arch while still caressing her with the ice cube.</p><p>Her voice trembles through me, like a feather stroking my insides. \u201cDo you do manicures too?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at her, on the bed, looking at me like a woman does when she wants to give herself away, and the hunter in me is so ready I let her know with my tone of voice what I\u2019m thinking, what I truly want, when I say, \u201cLet me do your feet first, then I\u2019ll do the rest of you.\u201d</p> <p>I keep going with the ice, and when the slide of her foot across my abs feels like a caress, shocks of electricity course through me.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d I ask gruffly, and my head is screaming at me to kiss her. She looks like she wants it. Her pink mouth is parted. Her eyes shine with heat as she looks down on me. Her feet are on my stomach, caressing the squares of my abs\u2014and not by accident. My hands are cupping her foot, and I crave to bend my head and lick her toes, the arch up her foot, up her leg. I want to peel that catsuit off her body, feel her skin with my lips, my fingers, my knuckles, my palms. I\u2019m drawn to her strength and her sweetness, her bravado that makes me want to push and tease her, that draws me out of my own cave, my own walls, if only just to chase her and bring her back to my cave with me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know the name of this, or maybe I do.</p><p>It\u2019s the one thing in my life I don\u2019t plan on fighting.</p><p>For the first time in my life I\u2019m thinking of things other than fucking and fighting. I want to take care of this girl. I\u2019m thinking about how I want to fuck her hard and kiss her softly, hold her tight and suck her gently, when she abruptly tells me, \u201cIt feels perfect now. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>We engage in a slight tug-of-war for her foot as she tries to pull free, and I\u2019m not too happy to let her, and then the door swings open and Diane appears. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she tells me with a big grin. \u201cI must feed you now so you can recharge for tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>I stare at Brooke, confused as hell, and the way she stares at me as if I\u2019d imagined the connection puzzles the shit out of me. What the hell? Right now, I could\u2019ve bet my life that she\u2019d wanted me as much as I\u2019d wanted her. I toss the ice into the bucket and lower her foot. \u201cI am sorry, about your ankle,\u201d I tell her. She wanted my apology, and now she has it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t make it to the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she hurries to say.</p><p>I\u2019m still confused as I push to my feet. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Pete to get you some crutches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Serves me right for messing with trees,\u201d she calls out as I head for the door.</p><p>I stop and look at her, trying to read her, and for a moment she stares back at me, looking just as confused as I feel.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Remy,\u201d she says.</p><p>Pummeled by a shitload of frustration, I consider charging across the room and slamming my mouth on hers, giving her a kiss so fucking wet and deep, there will be no doubt in her mind that she is mine. Instead, I shove my fingers through my hair and leave, then charge straight into the suite, where I know I\u2019ll find Pete either on his laptop or on the phone.</p><p>\u201cGet someone to look at Brooke\u2019s sprain. Get her some fucking crutches. And get two of your own cars after the fight tomorrow, I want Brooke alone.\u201d I cross the living room in search of food.</p><p>Pete dials to concierge. \u201cDo you want the Escalade or would you like someone to drive you?\u201d His yell reaches me in the kitchen as I scour for the food Diane prepared.</p><p>\u201cGet me a driver, I want my hands free.\u201d</p><p>PAST</p><p>SHE FIGHTS</p><p>I\u2019m in the zone.</p><p>Standing so I can stretch my legs and bounce in place, I curl my fingers and twist my neck to one side, then the other. Riley lifts three fingers, and I\u2019m up in three. After a couple more jumps, I pry off my headphones, slip into my robe, and then wait until I hear it: \u201cAnd noooow, ladies and gentlemen, say helloww to the one, the only, Remington Tate, RIPPPPPTIIIIIIDE!\u201d</p><p>Taking off down the walkway, I follow my name, then I leap into the ring, strip off my robe, and hand it over to the guys at the corner. The noise heightens as I open my arms and turn around, taking a good look at my crowd. Hundreds of heads are turned in my direction, waving banners and shit in the air as the name Riptide shudders upward and across the ceiling rafters.</p><p>My arms still out, I keep turning, scanning the crowd until my eyes lock on her. Brooke Dumas. Sitting right where I want her. She\u2019s framed by the groupies Pete and Riley brought up to my room, and they have nothing on her. She wears her hair down, and her smile, fuck, her smile is just for me. I smile back at her, thinking, this is for you.</p><p>Then I focus on my opponent, wait for the bell, and take him down. Working up a sweat, I take out a second fighter, a third. On my fourth and fifth, I keep jabbing, hooking, shooting out double punches, straight power punches, countering, attacking, and defending.</p><p>On my eighth, I block a power punch from his left arm, then I bury my hook in his ribs and finish him with an uppercut to the jaw that knocks him out completely with a thunk. He tries to rise, but slumps back down.</p><p>The public roars as my name takes over the entire room.</p><p>\u201cRRRRRRIIIIIIPTIIIIIIIDE!\u201d The ringmaster lifts my arm, and I\u2019m catching my breath as the announcer yells, \u201cOur victor, ladies and gentlemen. Riptiiiide!\u201d</p><p>The screams are almost deafening, and I turn around and look at her, the smile on her lips so perfect, I can\u2019t fucking wait to kiss it.</p><p>It takes me five minutes to shower and change at the hotel, then I cross the lobby to where Brooke waits in the back of a black Lincoln.</p><p>I slide in and shut the door behind me, and when I settle in my seat, the back of my hand rests against the back of hers. I carefully watch her for any signs of her wanting to pull away.</p><p>We head into traffic.</p><p>Brooke still hasn\u2019t protested.</p><p>So I run the pad of my thumb over the back of hers, watching her reaction.</p><p>She inhales a quick breath, and the way her tits push up against her glittery top makes me hard. I think about running my thumb up her bare arm, her slender neck, then trailing it over that plump, pink mouth I want to feel all over me.</p><p>\u201cDid you like the fight?\u201d My voice is low and gruff.</p><p>She stares out at the window, her thoughtful profile making me want to fucking beg for it.</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t like it,\u201d she admits as her eyes finally come to mine. \u201cYou were amazing! I loved it!\u201d</p><p>The words hit me with such joy, I laugh, and I grab her hand, lift it to my mouth, and scrape my lips across the small rises of her knuckles, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I murmur, staring deep into her eyes. It takes all my effort to let go of her. But I want her to get used to me first. I want her to smell me, feel me right here. I want her to feel my body heat and get accustomed to me. My presence. Everything about me. When I sit next to her, this is the last time I want her shoulders to go tense and tight.</p><p>Soon, we reach the club. I help her out of the car, and when she slides her small hand deeper into mine, I feel so fucking possessive, I don\u2019t let go of her. I want every man looking in her direction to know this one\u2019s fucking mine. In silence, I lead her past the bouncers and to a private room in the back.</p><p>\u201cPete is getting a lap dance,\u201d Riley tells me at the door of the private room, and I\u2019m disappointed when Brooke quietly pulls her hand free from mine. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind treating him to one as a birthday present?\u201d he asks me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We all watch as a woman in a glittering silver bikini heads for Pete, who looks goggle-eyed. Brooke squirms at my side, and Riley turns his attention to her, his eyebrows flying high. \u201cYou shy about this, Brooke?\u201d he asks in amusement.</p><p>A soft-pink hue stains Brooke\u2019s cheeks, and a rush of possessiveness charges through me. I engulf her hand in mine again, quietly asking her, \u201cDo you want to watch?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, and I quietly tug and lead her outside, noticing how she flattens her palm against mine, her soft fingers interlaced with my bigger ones. God, she\u2019s so perfect. All my instincts are raring for me to claim her.</p><p>She lets me lead her through the throng like she knows she\u2019s mine, or like she wants to be. There\u2019s noise and a crazed crowd of dancers, and as an Usher track reverberates through the room, Brooke leaps in excitement.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I love this song!\u201d she tells me, squeezing my hand in a way that makes my chest hurt.</p><p>The blonde groupie spots Brooke from within the dance floor, and before I know it, she\u2019s pulling her away.</p><p>\u201cRemy!\u201d The redhead who\u2019d been dancing on the table of my suite grabs me and hauls me in by their side, and I can\u2019t take my eyes off Brooke. Dark haired and sexy, she moves as gracefully as a cat as she dances. Hips swaying side to side. Long golden legs. Debbie pulls Brooke closer by the hips and they\u2019re dancing as one, the undulating movements of Brooke\u2019s small waist and narrow hips heating me up to the point of madness. She laughs and turns around, arms waving in the air, as the chorus of \u201cScream\u201d begins.</p><p>She spots me. I\u2019m not moving, even though everyone else around me is. Only my heart thunders inside me. Mine mine mine.</p><p>There are things you\u2019re certain about. That you\u2019d bet your life on. Things that you just know. You know the heat of a fire will burn you. Water will quench your thirst. She is one of those things; the most unerring certainty of my life.</p> <p>She looks into my face, the look in her eyes soft and giving, and every inch of me wants to take what she\u2019ll give me. I reach out, spin her around, and crush her body against mine. I dive hungrily to her lovely neck, brushing her hair to the side, and pressing into her spine, inhaling her like a madman. Her scent curls around me and I part my mouth, hungrily grazing her skin with my teeth before my tongue flashes out for a taste of her.</p><p>She moans as she reaches up behind her, locking my head to her neck as the crowd dances around us. I grab her hips and pull her harder against my cock and, holy God, I want her.</p><p>Heart pounding, I spin her once. Then, her gold eyes lock to mine, I see they\u2019re liquid with wanting. I\u2019m shaking with need as I grab her chin in one open hand and gently nuzzle her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re asking for?\u201d My voice is husky with arousal. \u201cDo you, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t reply, so I grab her ass and haul her closer, my mouth almost on hers. I want to have her now. Tonight. I want to wrap my hands in her hair while I pound inside her, I want to smell her desire all over me and drown my tongue in her taste. She slides her fingers up my chest, into my hair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d As she pushes up on her toes, she pulls me down by the head, and suddenly her body slams into mine. My arms fly out to steady her.</p> <p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t Riptide and his new pussy,\u201d some dipshit sneers behind her.</p><p>Over her dark head, I see the motherfucker.</p><p>Scorpion.</p><p>A human-size insect, wearing his usual shit-eating smirk, while his three goons flock his side.</p><p>The thing about fighting is you never know when to stop. They just shoved Brooke, and I want to shove each of them back to the ground, then break their arms in half. I fucking can\u2019t\u2014and even if I could, right this moment I\u2019d rather take her away from these motherfuckers than stay here and punch their faces in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s name? Whose name does she call out when you fuck her, huh?\u201d</p><p>Gathering a piece of her top in my fist, I use it to guide her out of the dance floor, then I turn her to me and block Scorpion\u2019s view of her with my body. \u201cGo back with Riley and ask him to take you to the hotel,\u201d I quietly tell her.</p><p>She meets my gaze. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in a fight, Remy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking to you, douche-nozzle,\u201d I hear from over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI heard you, asshole, I just don\u2019t give a fuck what you have to say,\u201d I shoot back.</p><p>I sense him move and swing around in time to see his fist coming and duck, then I shove him hard enough to slam his ass to the floor. Grabbing the other one by the shirt, I push him back a couple of steps. \u201cTake a hike or I\u2019ll cut your fucking balls off and then feed them to your mother!\u201d I growl as I grab the other two and shove them back, and when the first one stands and approaches me from behind, I let my elbow swing back, high.</p><p>His nose cracks under my bone, and he howls.</p><p>\u201cSorry, dude, my bad,\u201d I say.</p><p>Scorpion is grinning. I find myself bloodthirsty enough to grin back. You happy I\u2019m about to break your skull in two, motherfucker?</p><p>Then, suddenly, Brooke materializes from out of nowhere with two bottles, and she\u2019s whipping them up in the air and crashes them over the two bastard\u2019s heads. Glass explodes and rains down on the floor, then she runs back to the bar so fucking fast she\u2019s like a little bullet.</p><p>I would be highly amused if every single protective instinct inside me hadn\u2019t shot off the charts, and if she hadn\u2019t run back with a third bottle\u2014a third fucking bottle!</p><p>I grab it from her hand before she can do anything and nudge her back toward the bar, where I slam it down hard. Then I toss her over my shoulder and charge back to the private rooms. I swear if I don\u2019t get her out of here right now, I\u2019m going to end up killing someone.</p><p>Brooke squirms and tries to pry herself free, slamming her fists into my back, complaining, \u201cRemington!\u201d</p><p>I tighten my hold on her ass to still her and see Pete chatting with a group of women. \u201cScorpion\u2019s out there with his fucking goons\u2014I\u2019m out,\u201d I growl at him, then charge outside and shove her into the back of the car.</p><p>Our driver jumps behind the wheel and quickly pulls into the traffic. I\u2019m struggling with myself in the backseat while Brooke tries to catch her breath, and holy god, I\u2019m trying to erase the image in my head of watching her recklessly charge two fully grown, bloodthirsty men. \u201cWhat in the hell did you think you were doing?\u201d I explode, shaking with rage.</p><p>For her part, Brooke doesn\u2019t look one bit concerned\u2014she looks fucking delighted. \u201cI just saved your ass and it felt amazing,\u201d she says breathlessly, looking like a goddamn vision in that gold little top.</p><p>God! I want to fucking shake some sense into her, and at the same time I want to push her skirt up to her hips, bend over between her legs, and sink my tongue in her until she moans my name and makes me forget everything that just happened.</p><p>I don\u2019t fucking like Scorpion looking at her.</p><p>I don\u2019t like him talking about her.</p><p>I fucking don\u2019t like him pushing her.</p><p>And I can\u2019t even put into words how I feel about her smashing the brains off his minions with a couple of fucking bottles. Jesus.</p><p>I scrape my hands down my face and then rub the back of my neck, all my limbs shaking. \u201cFor the love of fucking god, don\u2019t ever, ever, do that again. Ever. If one of them sets a hand on you, I\u2019ll fucking kill them and I won\u2019t give a rat\u2019s fuck who sees me!\u201d</p><p>When she only stares at me with a defiant little gleam in her eyes, I catch her wrist and squeeze so she understands she can\u2019t fucking take on men like them, releasing her when she gasps. \u201cI mean it. Don\u2019t fucking ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will do it again. I won\u2019t let you get into trouble,\u201d she counters.</p><p>I can only stare at her, a thousand things I\u2019ve never felt in my life hitting me all at once. \u201cJesus, are you for real?\u201d My chest feels like a knot as I drag a hand along my face and stare outside, trembling when I think of all the years nobody has given a shit whether I get in trouble or not. \u201cYou\u2019re a stick of dynamite, do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flush a deeper red as she nods. She looks as beautiful as a fucking rainbow. I want to stop with this arguing, take her up to my room, and make love.</p><p>Going up the elevator, I stay away. I want to finish what we started at the dance floor. I want to grab her, kiss her, hold her. I want her to promise me to never do that again. Never risk herself for me, or anyone, again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says, touching my shoulder, and all I can think is, God, Brooke. You\u2019re so sweet and so innocent. Are you going to do this when I\u2019m black?</p><p>I\u2019m all knotted up inside as I see her fingers on me, and in my mind, I bend my head and lick my tongue up her fingers, all the way up her arm, her shoulders, her neck, to latch onto her mouth. Before I can, she steps back to her corner and stares at me, her eyes wide and confused.</p><p>I flex my hands and try calming down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to see those assholes,\u201d I say, pulling on my hair for a second. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking break all Scorpion\u2019s bones and pull his goddamned eyes out when I get a chance.\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I\u2019m calmed somewhat, but even then I\u2019m fighting the urge to put my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cCan I come to your room until the guys get back?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I hesitate, then the thought of her leaving her scent all over my room makes me nod like a true masochist, and she follows me. In my suite, she settles down on the living-room couch and I flick the TV on as a distraction. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cI never drink the day before flying or I\u2019ll get doubly dehydrated.\u201d</p><p>I bring two water bottles from the bar and sit next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get in trouble when you were pro?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cA fight like the one you just prevented,\u201d I answer in a thick, textured voice. Then I stare off into the screen, jaw clenched as I remember. I\u2019d awoken to find the TV ablaze with news about me. I\u2019d been manic. I\u2019d been provoked. I\u2019d acted\u2014like I always do. My life was over, just like Brooke\u2019s when she tore her ACL.</p><p>Yet she sits here, next to me, my female.</p><p>My strong, beautiful female who defended her male tonight.</p><p>The need to pull her in my arms eats me. No woman has ever made me want to cuddle and nuzzle her to me, but if I cuddle her to me, I\u2019ll kiss her pretty mouth, and if I kiss her pretty mouth, I\u2019m not going to stop there.</p><p>I\u2019m still jacked up, my testosterone flooding my veins, my body tight with weeks of pent-up wanting. But I need to get closer, and I find myself slowly stretching my arm out over the back of the couch. So fucking close, I feel her soft hair against my forearm.</p><p>She watches me through her lashes like she wants me to get even closer, and I realize some sort of heavy kissing is on the TV, annoying me enough to make me turn it off. I want it quiet enough that I can hear the sound of her breath, hear it quickening just for me. My hand goes to her nape, and I gently caress the soft skin at the back of her neck with my thumb. She trembles.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that for me?\u201d I ask her, my voice husky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>She holds my gaze, her amber eyes so alive and mesmerizing, there\u2019s a fire at the pit of my gut as I squeeze her nape, insisting, \u201cWhy? Somebody tell you I can\u2019t take care of myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth is more tempting to me than anything I\u2019ve ever wanted and had to live without. I close my eyes and drop my forehead to hers. I\u2019m hungry for her scent, I can\u2019t stop breathing her in. I hear her breathing me in too when a light touch of a fingertip brushes across my lips. My chest knots up with hunger and my tongue darts out. I\u2019m anxious for a taste. For her. She shudders. Undone, I groan and suck her finger deeper into my mouth, my eyes shutting as I savor her.</p> <p>\u201cRemington . . .\u201d My name on her lips makes me hot enough to blow.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d A slamming door and Pete\u2019s sarcastic voice stuns us. \u201cJust wanted to make sure you guys got here okay. Scorpion sure seems to have a hard-on to get your ass back in jail.\u201d</p><p>The lights flare on, and the knowledge of what I\u2019m doing slams into me like a sledgehammer. I drop her finger and stalk to the window, breathing hard as I struggle for control. What the hell am I doing? She has no idea about me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go,\u201d she says.</p><p>Pete watches her leave, then he looks at me as I stand here, feeling tortured like it\u2019s my last day. \u201cI\u2019ll just wait for you here, Rem,\u201d Pete says calmly.</p> <p>Burning inside my skin, I clamp my jaw in frustration, curl my fingers into my palms, and follow her to her room, so wound up I\u2019m ready to burst through my jeans.</p><p>I want her so much I\u2019m not even thinking of anything except the way she looks, the way she smells, the way she just fucking stuck her finger into my mouth.</p><p>As she slides the key into the slot, I let myself fantasize that this is our room. Or at least that it\u2019s just hers. And she\u2019d open up the door, and I\u2019d follow her inside. I\u2019d kiss her slowly. Set her down on the bed. I\u2019d kiss her all over.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just her room. I\u2019ve been booking her with Diane, so I\u2019d stay away. But maybe I don\u2019t feel like staying the fuck away anymore!</p><p>She waits a moment and then finally turns.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she whispers, and looks up at me.</p> <p>Before I can pull myself back, I grab her face and kiss her lips. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d My thumb runs with desperation along her jaw. I tilt her chin and kiss her\u2014softly, drily, quickly before I lose it. \u201cSo damn beautiful I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off you all evening.\u201d</p><p>PRESENT</p><p>SEATTLE</p><p>Will You Marry Me\u201d comes up on Pandora through the car\u2019s speakers. Pete and Riley start to hoot like a couple of dipshits.</p><p>\u201cCoincidence or what? Or what, man?\u201d Pete punches my arm and I punch back with the same force. \u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe a little more force than he used. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fucking pussy.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>We pull into the church\u2019s parking lot, where we spot the team\u2019s rented Escalade parked already in a spot.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this about Melanie having some fucking boyfriend,\u201d Riley says as he jumps off, lifting a box of chocolates from the back of the car and showing them to us. \u201cThe name of these is even fancier than Godiva.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe told us the boyfriend\u2019s name\u2019s Greyson, remember? And this doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d Pete grabs the box of chocolates and puts them in the back of the car, then waits behind the wheel as the top closes.</p><p>\u201cSounds like some asshole. Nobody gives anybody chocolates these days\u2014especially not someone you\u2019re dating. Melanie\u2019s ass is fine without those, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d</p><p>I punch Riley\u2019s arm so he goes quiet when we walk into the church. People are finishing the touches on the floral arrangements. White. White for my bride.</p><p>Brooke.</p><p>\u201cStill, I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s some sort of posh\u2014\u201d</p><p>I punch Riley lightly again. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d He looks affronted.</p><p>\u201cThen stop complaining and let her be happy with this dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Pete says.</p><p>I pull out my phone to check the time as Riley and Pete continue discussing the love life of Brooke\u2019s best friend.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my boy!\u201d Coach slaps my back. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born ready.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cSeason starts in two weeks, and we\u2019re going to be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>Right now, I\u2019m just ready to get fucking married to my wife.</p><p>PAST</p><p>TO MIAMI</p><p>We\u2019re in the back of the plane the next day, our iPods in hand, my eyes devouring her and her eyes brazenly devouring me back.</p><p>\u201cPut a song on for me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Last night was a revelation. Maybe she\u2019s more ready for me than I\u2019d previously thought. Fuck, I can\u2019t even think that without my hormones shooting crazy in me. As she ducks her head to choose my song, I want to brush her hair back and take her mouth, to tell her with that kiss she will be mine.</p><p>I\u2019m playing her Survivor\u2019s \u201cHigh on You\u201d and I\u2019m fiercely impatient to find out what she plays me now. Another girl song? One that teases me with hints that she\u2019s all right without a man?</p><p>I hand her my iPod and take hers in my hand, then I slip on my headphones and listen to her selection: Journey\u2019s \u201cAny Way You Want It.\u201d</p><p>My lips curve in an amused smile, but holy hell, the lyrics work me up. I lift my eyes to hers, then I examine her pink marshmallow mouth. She\u2019s telling me I can get anything I want?</p><p>Including that beautiful fucking mouth?</p><p>What about those gorgeous tits? Those legs around me?</p><p>She licks her lips anxiously as she watches me listen, and the lust hits me so bad, my cock fills up and throbs until it feels like lead.</p><p>She says something, then laughs, but the music plays in my ears and I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about, or to who. I dip my head closer. I\u2019m not used to subtlety. And I need to know if this means what I think it means. What I want it to. My willpower is shredded into pieces so tiny that I can\u2019t even believe I can sit here without dragging her into my lap, plunging my fingers in her hair, and working my tongue across hers. But what this song is saying to me just gets my lion roaring and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I can hold him back.</p><p>\u201cPlay me another one,\u201d I command.</p><p>She hesitates, her face flushed and her eyes liquid, and I have never been more aware of my hands, the palms of my hands, my fingers, and where I want them to be. She then plays me a song by a woman who\u2019s begging to be made love to.</p><p>As the song plays to me, I make love to Brooke in my head. I move over her, inside her, in my head. She grips me with her arms, and I grip her hips and sit her down on me, and she moves with me, opening her mouth when I lick her lips, her tongue.</p><p>Now, I lean closer and dip my head to her own, and she leans back on the seat as if alarmed, her pulse fluttering in her throat. No, little firecracker, get back here with me. Don\u2019t fizzle out now.</p><p>Sliding my hand around her small waist, I bring her closer, then I press my lips into her ear. My cock pulses in my jeans. My heart kicks into my rib cage and it is feeding my groin. I lean back and play \u201cIris\u201d to her, then I pull off both our headphones and come closer to kiss her ear again.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d I ask her, my voice guttural with need.</p><p>She nods against me, and my control snaps. I clench my hands on her hips and keep her against me. God, she wants me. I knew she did. I knew it. Something in my brain snaps, and I inhale the scent at her neck, where it\u2019s always so powerfully sweet. I\u2019m going to make her mine tonight. Suddenly, there\u2019s nothing stopping me. Nothing.</p><p>Fuck me being black.</p><p>Fuck everything but Brooke.</p><p>My hunger is a raging monster as I tug her earlobe with my teeth and lick the shell of her ear, delighting in making love to that little ear with my tongue. The blood rushes through me, hot and heady. I can\u2019t stop tasting and nuzzling her. She\u2019s fallen still in the seat, against, and almost beneath, me, and I can feel her every shudder as I work my lips on her skin. All I can think of is the songs she played me . . . how they spoke to me . . . I can get anything I want, any way I want it, and she wants me to make love to her. She\u2019s mine. I am meant to provide and to take what she gives. I won\u2019t deny her any longer. I won\u2019t deny myself.</p><p>We arrive at the hotel and I book her into the two-bedroom Presidential Suite.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Pete asks.</p><p>I nod and glance at Brooke, her eyes slightly widening when I hand her a keycard from my set.</p><p>My thumb brushes her, and her eyes clasp mine, questioning. I look back and hope she reads me, willing her to know what I want tonight. If she\u2019s not ready, I hope to hell she\u2019ll say something now.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t. She takes the keycard and smiles, her smile radiant and shy, and she brushes back my thumb with hers. That, right there, was no fucking accident. Not the way she smiles, or touches me, or looks at me with a kind of bring it look that sets me on fire.</p><p>My brain starts running a mile a minute as we go upstairs to wait for our suitcases.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pretty view,\u201d she says when we enter the living room. The door shuts behind me. We\u2019re alone. I\u2019m suddenly doing her on the couch. The dining table. The floor. I\u2019m tearing off her clothes. I\u2019m sinking my cock in her and my teeth in her skin . . . my lips are on her neck and all I smell is her.</p><p>But, no, there she stands, looking outside.</p><p>Brooke Dumas.</p><p>The only woman I want.</p><p>I\u2019m bursting the zipper of my jeans. I\u2019ve had groupies in my rooms, naked, sliding their hands up my abs and my chest. Nothing hits me like seeing Brooke in my room, in her bouncy ponytail, looking excited and . . . happy.</p><p>She\u2019s happy because she\u2019s with you.</p><p>My heart kicks. I curl my hands into my palms and watch her peer nervously out the window, her teeth digging into her lower lip.</p><p>I have a fight tonight.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait for her to watch me win.</p><p>Then . . . watch me make love to her.</p><p>Heart pounding hard inside me, I walk to her, tip her head and angle it, so her ear is titled to my mouth. I lean and lick it, earlobe up to the shell, then I dip my tongue into the crevice and tell her, \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for me. I sure as hell am ready for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOME HERE, MR. Fucking Miami!\u201d A few guys swing me up on their shoulders and carry me into the Presidential Suite after the fight, and my restless eyes scan the room for my dark-haired goddess.</p><p>\u201cRemy! Remyyyy!\u201d they yell as they launch and catch me.</p><p>Some days, my fists just have their own will.</p><p>Today is one of those days.</p><p>Miami fucking loves me for kicking the shit out of every poor motherfucker put in my way.</p><p>Lightning courses through my veins.</p><p>Hell, if I lifted my hands and pushed out the heel of my palms, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be shooting our spiderwebs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, who\u2019s the man?\u201d I shout, slamming my fists to my chest. I got Brooke, I\u2019m the fucking champion! People crowd the suite, and when I finally spot my woman, my eyes lock to her. She stands there watching me, her breasts rising and falling, making me drool. Her eyes shine and her smile lights up her entire face, and the hunger rips through me like talons. Holy god, I want her. \u201cBrooke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hop down and call her over with the slow crook of one finger, and she starts over. My heart pounds with each of her steps and I swear she can\u2019t reach me soon enough, so I meet her halfway, and the moment she\u2019s close enough to touch, I lift her in my arms, spin her around, and crush her lips under mine.</p><p>My blood sizzles as her small body melts into my bigger one, her mouth soft and as hungry as mine.</p><p>\u201cGo fuck that pussy!\u201d I hear some dipshit yell. I pull free, immediately pissed off. I don\u2019t like anyone talking about her like that. I don\u2019t like anyone even near her. I pull her closer and into her ear whisper, \u201cYou\u2019re mine tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her moan makes me close my eyes, and I cup her face and take her mouth again. I can\u2019t resist her anymore, she\u2019s got my willpower in shreds. I take it slowly, knowing we\u2019re being watched, but telling her the same thing over and over: \u201cTonight you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p> <p>I want her now. I want everyone to leave us.</p><p>\u201cRemy, I want you, take me!\u201d someone shouts.</p><p>Brooke\u2019s eyes widen, and I want to tell her the only woman I\u2019m taking from now on is her. Instead I stroke her face with my thumbs and kiss her again. I can\u2019t stop. She gets me high and I\u2019ve been buzzed all day since I signed her into the room with me. She\u2019s warm and presses into me, her mouth hungry, killing me.</p><p>\u201cTake her to your room, Tate!\u201d</p><p>I hold her closer and tuck a strand of loose hair behind her, then I kiss the bare curve between her neck and collarbone, nuzzling near her ear, hearing myself murmur, \u201cMine. Tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d With a tenderness no one ever uses on me, Brooke cups my jaw and holds my gaze, and then I\u2019m grabbed from behind and swung in the air.</p><p>\u201cRemy, Remy . . .\u201d the guys chant.</p><p>When they drop me, I head to the bar to pour some tequila shots, and a woman signals for me to come get a shot glass from between her tits. I go over, but instead of complying I grab the nearest man there and ram his face into her boobs. Then burst out laughing and return to my Brooke.</p><p>Our eyes lock. I\u2019m going crazy and hard and I\u2019m feeling a little \u201cspeedy\u201d\u2014hell, I tell myself it\u2019s the buzz. I\u2019ve been waiting for this, wanting this, since I saw her at the first Seattle fight, looking at me like I was some sort of god and devil at the same time.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I whisper, and set the glass and limes down. I suck one lime edge between my lips and bend my head to pass it to her. She opens her mouth and sucks, then I draw it away and stick out my tongue. I groan with her as we linger, but eventually hand her the forgotten shot glass.</p><p>She tosses back the liquid and I hand her the lime. When she sticks it in her mouth, I duck my head to suck the juice. She moans when I tug the lime away and replace it between her lips with my tongue.</p> <p>Desire roars through me.</p><p>The empty shot glasses crash to the ground as I grab her lovely ass, lift her up, sit her down on the console, wedge between her pretty thighs, and thrust my tongue into her mouth with vengeance.</p><p>She pulls me closer as I push closer, burning inside. \u201cYou smell so good. . . .\u201d My erection aches so bad I grind it heatedly against her so she knows what she does to me, what I\u2019m going to give her tonight. \u201cI want you now. I can\u2019t wait to get rid of these people. How do you like it, Brooke? Hard? Fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny way you want it.\u201d Shit\u2014I remember the song she played me on the plane, teasing me, delighting and torturing me, and my underwear is near bursting.</p><p>\u201cWait here, little firecracker,\u201d I say, going for more shots.</p><p>We take more shots, and I can tell she likes it. She\u2019s smiling at me, looking at me, at my mouth, as we kiss each other between rounds. Once again they grab me and shoot me up, and I laugh as they shout, \u201cWho\u2019s the man? Who\u2019s the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet your asses it\u2019s me, motherfuckers!\u201d</p><p>Dropping me down by the bar, they push an enormous glass of beer toward me, then yell and thump their fists on the bar top as they chant, \u201cRem-ing-ton! Rem-ing-ton! Rem-ing-ton!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool down, guys,\u201d Pete says as he approaches us.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is this nerd?\u201d one dipshit says, but I grab the dude and slam him up against the wall, scowling.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my bro, you toad. Show some fucking respect,\u201d I snarl.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, dude, I was only asking!\u201d</p><p>Forcing my fingers to let go, I drop him to the ground and go back to the tequila, starting to get annoyed. Brooke waits for me, and these fucking people keep stopping me. By the time I head back around to where I left her, she\u2019s gone.</p><p>My stomach sinks as I scan the crowd and no dark-haired goddess is waiting for me to devour her mouth again. Glowering, I stalk to where Pete stands. \u201cWhere the fuck is Brooke?\u201d</p><p>Puzzlement crosses his face. \u201cWhat do you mean? She was just here.\u201d</p><p>Shoving the shots into his hands, I stalk down the hall and start pushing doors open. A couple is fucking on the bed of the spare bedroom. The master bedroom is empty. She\u2019s not among the crowd. I check by the elevators and then angrily push back through the entire crowd, and Brooke. Is. Gone.</p><p>I see red. A mix of pure anger shoots through me and I grab a pillow from one of the couches and tear it open. Cotton balls explode from the tear, and I do the same with the next, and the next. Because of course she\u2019s fucking gone! Fucking gone fucking gone fucking gone gone gone GONE GONE GONE GONE!</p><p>Soon people are screaming in panic as I grab whatever object is near me and send it crashing to the ground. \u201cRem! Rem!\u201d Pete\u2019s voice pleads through the screams, but I don\u2019t listen. I want to kill something. I want to break something. I want to break my own fucking head against the wall!</p><p>I grab Pete by the jacket and he wiggles out of his sleeves to escape me, then he pulls off his tie and tosses it aside as if he thinks I\u2019ll choke him next. He slowly reapproaches me, hunching like he\u2019s approaching a rabid animal, and I hear him speaking things, but I don\u2019t hear anything except the roaring in my ears and my own yells. \u201cWhat the fuck did you tell her about me? Where the shitfuck is she?\u201d</p><p>I grab the closest glass bottle I can find and send it crashing into the wall. More screams. Nervous laughter.</p><p>Riley is busy ushering people out of the open suite doors when a familiar voice joins from the direction of the hall.</p><p>\u201cOut, out, out!\u201d</p><p>I swing around. Brooke. There she is, cheeks flushed and looking concerned. Heat and relief flash through my body and I realize I have something in my hands. I toss it behind me and hear a shattering sound, then clench my fingers as I start for her. Holy god, my Brooke. I need my hands on her, I need my body in hers, my tongue on hers.</p><p>Pete grabs my arm and pulls me back with wild, pained eyes. \u201cSee, dude? She signed a contract, remember? You don\u2019t need to destroy the hotel, man.\u201d</p><p>My knees feel weak from the sheer insane relief I feel.</p><p>My Brooke my Brooke my Brooke is here.</p><p>As I charge for her, Pete sticks me in the neck and I feel a prick and a burn of liquid pushed into my skin. The roiling energy inside me halts and dies, my feet slow, and my vision fogs and tunnels on her. Fuck! Fuck no! No no NO!</p><p>My brain sputters one last stream of panic that she, Brooke Dumas, who looks at me like I\u2019m a god, is watching this. My head hangs and it\u2019s all black. Black like me. And now she will know. She will know. And she. Will. Leave.</p><p>The despair hits me so hard, I want to die right here, right now. I try to lift myself but can\u2019t, and Pete, with his diminutive power, is struggling to prop me up against the nearest wall. The frustration I feel, and the pain that comes when all my hopes shatter over Brooke and me, is indescribable. If this whole building sat on top of me it wouldn\u2019t even compare.</p><p>Pete maneuvers one of my arms around him, and Riley comes to drape my other arm around the back of his neck. My feet drag, and I\u2019m burning with the shame and humiliation of not being able to pull free and stand upright on my own. Me. I\u2019ve fought like a madman to show her I\u2019m strong and there could be no better protector for her than me. Now I\u2019m a pitiful mass of muscles and bones, slumping into the guys, but the last of my adrenaline, coupled with all the panic in me, still forces me to speak.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t, Rem.\u201d</p><p>I want to lift my head to try to make sure that what she\u2019s seeing is hopefully not me, but I can\u2019t move. It takes the energy it would take me to move a mountain just to strain out the rest of what I need to. \u201cJust don\u2019t let her see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man, got it,\u201d Pete assures.</p><p>They drag me into the room and start mumbling about me maybe getting strangled in my clothes and they strip me and plop me on the bed. My mind is already tormenting me. If she saw, she\u2019s going to leave. She will fucking leave. She\u2019s mine, but I can\u2019t have her. She\u2019s fucking mine and I can\u2019t tell her that she is, I can\u2019t take what I want, I can\u2019t do anything but lie here and try to stay awake, so that if she leaves, I can stop her.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, big man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her see,\u201d I groan.</p><p>Pete grunts and so does Riley as they try centering me on the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s all right, she won\u2019t see anything, Rem. Hang tight, we\u2019ll get someone to come and make you feel good,\u201d Riley tells me.</p><p>I bury my face in my arm and know it\u2019s not possible. I\u2019ll never feel good.</p><p>Brooke saw me. I saw her face for a moment. I saw her wide, scared eyes, fuck me.</p><p>I hear the door close quietly after them as the blackness claims me. It\u2019s a familiar place I\u2019ve been in a thousand times. Sometimes I sink to it willingly, but today I ache in all the places inside me that Brooke Dumas touches with her smiles, and all I can think of is clawing my way out of here to stop her from leaving me.</p><p>THE SOUND OF clapping wakes me. The sheets rustle at my side, and this is something I don\u2019t understand because I sure as hell am not moving. \u201cGet your lazy asses out of bed, guys, and let\u2019s try hitting the gym,\u201d Riley says from the threshold.</p><p>Gym, I tell myself, even when today is one of the days when I don\u2019t give a shit. My body feels about as flexible as a building, but I make the effort to push up on my arms\u2014</p><p>And stop short, squinting when I spot Brooke lying next to me.</p><p>She jumps to a sit when she sees me, and all the cobwebs in my mind clear in a fucking second as I take her in.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting like a fantasy in my bed. No. More than a fantasy. She\u2019s fucking unreal. Gut-wrenching, ball-twisting, chest-punching beautiful. Her dark hair tumbling down her shoulders, her lips pink, her eyelids heavy and sleepy. She\u2019s breathing fast as if she\u2019s got on her fight-or-flight from the mere sight of me, and she wears a Disneyland T-shirt that looks so fucking old it\u2019s screaming at me to tear it off her. The sun touches her skin and reveals a trio of freckles on her temple that I\u2019d never seen before, and if I weren\u2019t so sedated, I\u2019d be tracing them with my fingers while I latched my fucking mouth onto hers.</p><p>Struggling within myself, I watch as she takes a deep breath and eases off the bed like she can\u2019t get out of here fast enough. My heart gives a wild, helpless kick as I watch her cross the room and close the door behind her. Fuck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I stand to go after her, a wave of dizziness hits me, and I plop back down on the bed with a groan. A wave of grief hits me and I roll flat to my stomach. I slide back into bed and curl my hands into fists like I always do when I can\u2019t assimilate what I\u2019m feeling. My muscles feel leaden and I can barely move from where I dropped. That fucking sedative Pete gives me is meant for a damn rhino and I still can\u2019t unwind my hands. I want them in her hair, at her hips, splayed over her juicy, little bottom.</p><p>I groan again. I\u2019m naked. Hard as marble. I don\u2019t even have the energy to jack off, and my balls are in fucking misery.</p><p>Sometime later Pete comes in. \u201cHow are you doing, Rem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was Brooke in my fucking bed?\u201d I demand into the crook of my arm.</p> <p>\u201cHe talks,\u201d Pete croons laughingly at me. \u201cOur boy is doing well then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d I growl, twisting my head with a glare.</p><p>\u201cI let her take the day off and relax some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let her see me like this, dipshit,\u201d I growl, smashing my palm as hard as I can manage into his shoulder, which still jerks him aside.</p><p>\u201cOuch! Watch that, you\u2019re still you, you know! And the entire fucking city saw you like this.\u201d He sighs as he paces to the window. \u201cShe signed a contract, dude. She\u2019s not leaving you if she sees you like this or not.\u201d He spins around and levels me a somber stare. \u201cLook, I promise you I won\u2019t let her leave until her term is over and you guys have sorted whatever it is you want to sort out between you.\u201d</p> <p>The thought of her leaving fills me with anxiety. \u201cWhat did she see last night?\u201d I push up on my arms.</p><p>\u201cShe saw you in your famous Destructor mode.\u201d</p><p>God, I hate myself. Groaning, I bury my face in the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWe hired some girls for you last night, Rem,\u201d Pete tells me, like I give a shit.</p><p>I roll over to my back with a grunt, cross my arm over my face, and fold it over my eyes. The sun bothers me. Pete bothers me. My fucking life bothers me.</p><p>\u201cBut Brooke wouldn\u2019t let those hookers in,\u201d Pete adds.</p> <p>It takes my sedated brain like a whole fucking minute to process what he\u2019s telling me. Then it takes another minute for me to tame the urge to chase after her.</p><p>\u201cEx-plain,\u201d I enunciate.</p><p>\u201cAll right. She\u2019s into you, Tate. She was pissed last night because I sedated you and she got all protective.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Brooke getting protective over me makes me feel doubly as protective of her, and half-crazed with the urge to claim her. But it has to mean something. It has to mean enough to her so that when she finds out I\u2019m not . . . right . . . she\u2019ll still be with me.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Rem, recover. Text me if you need me. I\u2019ll go ahead and hang the DO NOT DISTURB, ALREADY DISTURBED HUMAN BEING INSIDE sign out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble, and roll to my stomach.</p><p>Don\u2019t want to eat.</p><p>Don\u2019t want to move.</p> <p>Don\u2019t want to fucking live.</p><p>Then I notice the pillow smells of her. I sniff all of Brooke Dumas on the fabric, and my dick jerks in excitement, so I exchange my pillow for hers and fall asleep.</p><p>HOURS LATER, I hear movements out the door. Brooke! my brain screams. My cock jumps to attention. I groan in misery once more.</p><p>I force myself to take a shower and come back to bed. The sun is setting in the horizon, but I can\u2019t sleep. Setting my headphones on my head, I click SHUFFLE on my iPod. Song after song plays in my ears, but I don\u2019t listen. I don\u2019t feel them for shit.</p><p>I spend exactly two hours lying in bed, replaying the image of her in that Disneyland T-shirt. She was in bed with me like she belonged here, like a part of her already belongs to me.</p><p>I spend another hour on Scorpion, and how I can\u2019t lie here like a loser for long. I\u2019m not letting him take what I want from me again, am I? He provoked me and made sure I couldn\u2019t box again\u2014but now he\u2019s got me in his territory, and I\u2019m marking it as mine every single season. Points-wise, I\u2019m on top, as usual, but I can\u2019t allow myself to miss more than a couple of fights, even when the last thing I want to do is fight right now.</p><p>I. Want. Her.</p><p>Pushing to my feet, I ram myself into a pair of pajama bottoms, then stalk across the suite and open the door to her room. My eyes almost bug out of my head as they run over her silhouette on the bed. With a rustle of bedsheets she sits up and her startled gaze finds me at the door, watching her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Her voice is whisper soft, and for the first time in my life I realize a woman is worried about me. Something twists hard inside my chest.</p><p>My voice comes out rougher than I intend, gruff and slightly drugged. \u201cI want to sleep with you. Just sleep.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, nothing happens. Brooke just sits there . . . as if waiting. My pupils are adjusted to the dark, and I see every inch of her on that bed. And I want everything I see. I want it so much my frame is tight with barely checked need. Inhaling slowly, I walk over, scoop her up in my arms, and carry her to the master bedroom and to my unmade bed.</p><p>She clings to me like I was made to carry her somewhere. She weighs next to nothing, her little muscles tight and tiny compared to mine. I set her down and join her under the covers, pressing her face to my chest and my nose against the top of her head.</p><p>We stay like this; she holds me and I hold her. The drug is still in me. If she runs, I couldn\u2019t catch her. My strength is there, but not my speed. But instead of leaving, she nestles closer to me, her body instinctively seeking my heat.</p><p>\u201cJust sleep, okay?\u201d she then whispers, her voice thick.</p><p>\u201cJust sleep,\u201d I murmur. \u201cAnd this.\u201d</p><p>Curling my hand around her jaw, I start kissing her. Nobody ever told me I needed more than food, air, and water to live. But I do. Holy god, I do. I need this sweet mouth now, just as much. A soft moan escapes her as she sifts her fingers through my hair and arches, and I feel the push of her firm, little tits against my chest. My testosterone shoots through the roof. I want to pull off her T-shirt and tear off whatever she wears underneath until all I can see are her gold eyes, her pink nipples, and her sweet pussy. I want to suck her clit into my mouth and slide my fingers into her sex, one, then two, then three, until she\u2019s soaked and stretched and my little firecracker is coming for me.</p><p>I\u2019m swollen to the max and I\u2019m so fucking ready to make her mine I can\u2019t breathe right, but I\u2019m greedy when it comes to her, and making her come is not all I want. It\u2019s only a part of it.</p><p>So I brush my tongue to hers and feel her small body tremble. When I take you, baby, I\u2019m taking it all. I\u2019m taking every fucking breath, every inch of your skin. Every. Beat. Of your heart.</p><p>Her taste drugs me all over again\u2014her wetness, her heat, the way our mouths move. It\u2019s not enough. Soon I\u2019m fucking her mouth and sucking and tasting her harder. She\u2019s so hot and hungry. She runs her hands over me, like she wants all of me. Those sounds she makes deep in the back of her throat, the ones that almost sound as if I\u2019m hurting her, send all my instincts into a frenzy, first the mating ones and then the protective ones. I want to fuck her and make her yell louder and I want to cradle her against me and protect her from everything\u2014especially from me.</p><p>She eases back to look at me, and her lips are stained with my blood. Moaning softly when she realizes the cut of my lip opened, she comes and licks me, making me groan as I grab her closer. I want every bit of her skin on mine. She\u2019s burning and I know she\u2019s strong as fuck, but I\u2019ve never wanted to hold something so gently. We kiss some more, deep and hungry, I push her face back to my neck and nestle her to me, my chest heaving as fast as hers. I think I fall asleep, but when she squirms against me in the middle of the night, I stir awake to the strange sensation of sleeping with something warm and soft against me.</p><p>She awakes too and peers up at me in the dark as if she\u2019s never awakened with someone in bed before either. I never sleep with the women I fuck. I like my space, but I like it when Brooke is in it. I know men laugh about this. About being pussy-whipped. About panting like a dog after a girl. About wanting a woman more than you want to want her. I don\u2019t fucking care. They can keep their sarcasm. I\u2019ll take the girl.</p><p>Holding her curious gaze in the dark, I duck my head and I lick her mouth so she knows I want her sleeping here, then I cuddle her close and lock my arms so she won\u2019t leave me.</p><p>PAST</p><p>DENVER</p><p>I\u2019m not happy with the way the guys are looking at Brooke.</p><p>I\u2019m not happy, period.</p><p>I\u2019ve told them to back off helping her with her luggage, and she gave me this amused little smile. As if I\u2019m some sort of jealous dickhead.</p><p>Maybe I am.</p><p>But I\u2019m still not letting Riley carry her goddamned luggage.</p><p>Now she\u2019s in the front of the plane, talking to them on our flight to Denver, and I\u2019ve got the perfect view of her ass.</p><p>The ass that has been sleeping with me. In my bed. I think of her mouth. I\u2019ve kissed her for four days. I won\u2019t do anything else until she\u2019s ready for me to. God, sometimes I think she\u2019s already there. I think of how her little tongue comes to play with mine. It\u2019s wet and playful and also anxious. Her hands rub my shoulders as she rubs it to me. She undulates her body against mine. Her legs part beneath me. I try to ignore all the green lights, the delicious press of her tits against me, and instead I focus on her mouth. I slide my hand up her throat and stroke my thumb along her jaw. She breathes as fast as me. She moans. She responds to me so hard, I have to stop and take cold showers when I\u2019m a second away from exploding on her.</p><p>She waits for me in bed, her eyes on the door.</p><p>The instant I\u2019m back she\u2019s spreading out her arms and opening her mouth to me. The scent of her arousal hits me as I tell her she\u2019s so fucking pretty and smells so good. She moans softly and tells me my name, in both ways. Remington . . . Remy . . .</p><p>She jacks me up and I taste her throat, her collarbone, keeping my hands where my mouth is\u2014if I touch her breasts, I\u2019m going to lose it. Even the feel of her legs parted under me and the way she shifts to nestle my erection drives me crazy.</p><p>I taste her ear. I fuck it. I pretend every part of her body can feel my tongue. She shivers and the sounds drive me crazy as an animal. She lets me work her up so much her teeth chatter until I cover our bodies with the sheet and use my body heat to heat her up.</p><p>When her breaths are jerking out of her and she sounds too worked up, I ease back and play her some music. She likes it when I play her songs. And when I turn on the TV to help cool myself down, she leans her head against my shoulder and watches it, the gesture making me tip her head up to me and take her mouth once more until we can\u2019t stand it.</p><p>My cock is in constant strain. The instant she looks at me, I\u2019m hard. She looks at my mouth, smiles at me . . . everything she does runs straight to my dick.</p><p>She turns to me now, and I smile at her as she comes straight back to sit at my side, her legs and ass in those tight, pink jeans that beg to be peeled off her. I pull off my headphones and lean over to place my ear in her mouth, so she tells me what all the fuss is about with the team. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe or my money?\u201d I quietly ask. Another day I might not ask this. But I know they\u2019re worried about my stupid bet. One black fucking night, I bet all my cash and savings on my win this year. Pete and Riley are worrying about it, especially Pete, who\u2019s in charge of the finances.</p><p>\u201cYou. And your money.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to win. I always do.\u201d</p><p>Her lips form a small smile too, and my mouth is drawn to that mouth of hers that tastes like peaches dipped in sugar. My blood heats when I notice how swollen and red her lips are from all our kissing, and the need to take that mouth in mine runs through me when she shudders.</p><p>So, she knows what I\u2019m thinking about?</p><p>I swear I don\u2019t even want to be here today. Only because of her did I manage to get out of my suite today and into this plane. But I don\u2019t feel like doing anything except her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to run today? To get ready for tomorrow?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shake my head no.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired?\u201d she prods.</p><p>Nodding, I whisper, \u201cSo fucking tired I could barely pull myself out of bed.\u201d</p><p>When she nods that dark, little head of hers in understanding, all the heaviness in my chest lifts for a moment, and she\u2019s like a little sun in all my gray.</p><p>She leans back on the seat, her shoulder up against mine, and she looks so badly slept because of me, I slide myself lower on the seat so my shoulder is close to where her head is. And she can rest it on me.</p><p>She does.</p><p>Quietly, I pass her my iPod so she can hear Norah Jones\u2019s \u201cCome Away with Me.\u201d</p><p>She listens while lazily leaning her head on me, and I duck my head to try to listen with her.</p><p>Jerking as if she\u2019s just thought of something, she grabs her iPod, finds a song, and passes it to me. Then the Gym Class Heroes\u2019 song \u201cThe Fighter\u201d begins.</p><p>Her eyes are glued to my profile as I listen, and if I\u2019ve kissed her for four fucking days straight and she\u2019s playing me a song about fighting, I\u2019m fucking not doing something right. \u201cYou play me a song about a fighter?\u201d I ask her in disbelief and annoyance at myself.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I toss her iPod aside with a scowl and then grab her by the hips and lift her onto my lap, hearing her breath catch when my erection bites into her juicy, little bottom. Bending my head down, I place my lips close to her ear. \u201cGive me another one,\u201d I demand.</p><p>She shudders, and suddenly she starts shaking her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing what we\u2019re doing, Remy. You need your sleep.\u201d</p><p>I whisper. \u201cGive me another song, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>My heart kicks when she obeys me and reaches for her iPod, and I feel like I\u2019m finally getting a bone today. Taking it from her, I click PLAY and listen intently when the familiar song of \u201cIris\u201d begins.</p> <p>God, this woman kills me.</p><p>I lift my head to meet her gaze while my heart beats fast and hard in my lap and in my chest. \u201cDitto,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>The team up in the seating area is quiet, but they\u2019re not looking at her and me. I slide my fingers in her hair and draw her head down so I can hungrily drag my lips along the seam of her lips. \u201cTo every lyric.\u201d</p><p>She pulls back from me with a shudder that clearly tells me she doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cRemy . . . I\u2019ve never had an affair before. I just won\u2019t share you. You can\u2019t be with anyone else while you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>God, I\u2019m so wild about her, I can\u2019t even think of anything else anymore. Dragging my thumb along the lower lip I just licked, I look into those golden eyes that seem both pleading and demanding of me and tell her, \u201cWe won\u2019t be having an affair.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t react for a moment.</p><p>I\u2019m so hungry for more of our kissing sessions that I crush her against me and trace my nose with the shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhen I take you, you\u2019ll be mine,\u201d I promise her, trailing my thumb along her jaw as I gently kiss her earlobe. \u201cYou need to be certain.\u201d Her gaze latches onto mine as I warn her, \u201cI want you to know me first, and then, I want you to let me know if you still want me to take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I already know I want you,\u201d she protests.</p><p>I watch her mouth as it moves, telling me she wants me, and the thought of her not knowing what she\u2019s talking about feels like a wrench in my chest. Slowly, I stroke my hand down her bare arm, my voice thick and tormented. \u201cBrooke, I need you to know who I am. What I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had tons of women without this requisite,\u201d she says pleadingly.</p><p>I engulf her ass in my hands and drag her deeper into my lap, memorizing the way she looks right now as I look into her eyes and will her to understand me.</p><p>\u201cThis is my requisite with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darken with pain, and she leans close to me and whispers, \u201cWe still can\u2019t keep this up, Remy. Not when your championship is on the line. So you either come get me tonight to make love to me, or you leave me alone so we can both rest.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m not sure I heard right.</p><p>She\u2019s telling me I can\u2019t kiss my mouth . . . my woman . . .</p><p>She\u2019s telling me I either fuck her and take her all, or I take nothing.</p><p>If she were any other woman in the world, I\u2019d have fucked her the night I met her. Maybe I\u2019d have fucked her another time. Then I\u2019d have forgotten her. But she is Brooke Dumas and I am not messing it up with her if it kills me.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, smiling like I don\u2019t feel as if I\u2019d just swallowed down my own cock.</p><p>Suddenly, I can\u2019t have her on my lap. Her bottom lush and juicy and mine\u2014but unavailable. Fuck me. Setting her aside, I reach for my iPod and look for something. Metallica. Marilyn Manson. Something crazy that will shut the fuck up all the protests sputtering in my head and the sensation in my chest of having lost some unknown battle before I even fought it.</p><p>PAST</p><p>LOS ANGELES</p><p>I booked a suite for Brooke and Diane, and one of the ladies doesn\u2019t like it.</p><p>My lady, to be exact.</p><p>I was caked with sweat and still panting from my workout when she massaged the back of my neck, leaning close enough to whisper in my ear, \u201cMind telling me why Diane and I are together in a suite, Remy?\u201d</p><p>She turned my neck to one side, then the other, her fingers light on my jaw, but I still refused to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this, Remington.\u201d</p><p>Biting back a laugh, I turned and touched two fingers to her lips, holding her gaze for a long heartbeat. \u201cStop me. I dare you,\u201d I told her, then I grabbed my towel and walked away to my suite to drown all my frustrations in a cold shower.</p><p>Now I\u2019m in the LA Underground locker rooms, sitting on a bench at the end while Coach wraps my hands, some song in my ears, when I see Pete in my peripherals wave someone over.</p><p>I see Brooke heading over to me, at Pete\u2019s insistence, and I immediately hook my finger on my headphone cord and pull them down.</p><p>Brooke holds my gaze as she quietly leans over and pauses my iPod, then she walks behind me to seize my shoulders and starts working on my knots.</p><p>The instant I feel her fingers on my bare flesh, I groan and feel my body both tense with arousal and relax from the knowledge she\u2019s with me.</p><p>I haven\u2019t kissed her in what feels like a year.</p><p>I miss her in my bed.</p><p>I miss the way she moans and the way her soft, silky mouth swells under mine.</p><p>I miss her touch; I want it badly.</p><p>\u201cDeeper,\u201d I command her, and she goes in deeper with her fingers, using her thumb to roll over one of the larger knots. Relaxing my neck, I let my head hang and drag in a deep breath as she presses down until the knot disintegrates, and I groan from the pleasure of feeling the heat spread into my tissue.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d she whispers into my ear before she draws back, and my skin feels taut as a drum cover.</p><p>I stand and look at her, and I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s so determined to make me fuck her that she keeps her kisses away from me until I do, but I\u2019m going to make her cave in to me before I cave in to her.</p><p>I\u2019m not fucking her yet, no matter how ready I am to kill for it.</p><p>I\u2019m not touching that sweet pussy until it\u2019s ready to be taken home\u2014permanently.</p><p>Behind me, Riley comes with my robe, and I spread out my arms and ram them into the sleeves while I keep my eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cRiptide!\u201d I hear the call, and I bounce in place for a second, then trot out into the arena.</p><p>I take my ring like I always do, but tonight\u2019s not a normal one. Tonight, I fight\u2014</p><p>\u201cBenny, the Black Scoooooorpion!\u201d</p><p>I see him charge out of the walkway on the other side. That ugly black tat on his face, he storms out to the general booing of the crowd, but grins nevertheless.</p><p>Remembering the club incident, where he dared speak of my girl\u2019s pussy, I remind myself I owe him a beating. The moment he takes the ring, he comes up to center, and so do I, fixing my gaze on his yellow eyes.</p><p>His rage and my rage combine to create a powerful effect on the air.</p><p>\u201cFucking pussy needs a woman to defend him now?\u201d he says, spitting on the mat.</p><p>I laugh softly. \u201cThe bad news is, not even a woman can defend you from me now.\u201d</p><p>We tap knuckles, and the fighting bell rings.</p><p>We wait it out, both of us inspecting the other, and I want my little firecracker to see this.</p><p>I want her to see me beat the living daylights out of this dipshit.</p><p>Flicking my eyes to the side, I notice Brooke\u2019s chair is empty.</p><p>Scowling, I scan the arena and duck when Scorpion swings, then I come back and punch him, fast and hard, on the jaw.</p><p>Then I see her.</p><p>She\u2019s calling out to a girl heading to the exit with one of Scorpion\u2019s minions, while another of those motherfuckers holds her\u2014Brooke\u2014by the arms.</p><p>My blood runs cold, then hot in fury. I slam my fist into Scorpion\u2019s jaw, shove him aside, grab the nearest rope and leap out of the ring onto the cement floor, leaving Scorpion spitting blood on the mat. The arena erupts with shouts and screams and the announcer yells through the speakers, \u201cThe victor, Scorpion! Scooooooorpiooooooon! Remington Tate has been disqualified from this round! Dis-qualified!\u201d</p><p>I reach Brooke as she struggles to break free, and she looks tiny and feisty in that motherfucker\u2019s grip, making me livid. I grab the hands on her arms and thrust them back, delivering him a look that promises he will die because of me, then I yank her into my arms and forget about everything but that she\u2019s safely nestled against me.</p><p>Still, she fights me.</p><p>\u201cNo. No! Remy, let me go, I need to follow her.\u201d She twists in my grip and lightly hits my pecs, her expression twisting in pain. \u201cLet go, Remy, let go, please.\u201d</p><p>I clench her tighter against me and walk her to the exit, because I don\u2019t think she realizes what\u2019s going on. \u201cNot now, Little Firecracker,\u201d I softly warn her. She stops squirming and peeks over my arm at the angry faces of some of Riptide\u2019s fans, and I use my shoulders to shove through the crowd as they start getting vicious.</p><p>\u201cBitch. It\u2019s your fault, you stupid bitch!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen in horror as the crowd starts clawing angrily into the air, then she curls into me and lets me guide her out to the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFucking shit!\u201d Coach thunders as the limo pulls into traffic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re down to third.

You were training so fucking well you would have had his ass on a stick, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Coach, just relax.\u201d I shove into my casual clothes as quickly as I can, then I reach out and pin Brooke to my side, my blood still pumping hot as lava.</p> <p>Rubbing my hand down her arm, I notice she won\u2019t take her eyes off the window as if searching for that woman.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the worst placement you\u2019ve been in years, man, your concentration is shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, I\u2019ve fucking got it\u2014I\u2019m not screwing this up,\u201d I assure him, rubbing Brooke\u2019s arm faster so she knows it will be all right.</p><p>\u201cI think Brooke should stay in the hotel next fight,\u201d Riley mutters.</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cBrooke comes with me,\u201d I snap, shaking my head in disbelief at them.</p> <p>\u201cRem . . .\u201d Pete tries to reason.</p><p>I clench my jaw and shoot him a warning glare, not in the mood for this bullshit. We ride the elevator in tense silence, and I\u2019m getting worked up by Brooke\u2019s unease. The need to protect her from whatever it is that\u2019s made her this uneasy is eating at my gut.</p><p>The doors roll open on her floor, and she gets out like a whirlwind I\u2019m determined to calm the fuck down. The guys yell back at me and demand we have some words, making me snap, \u201cPete, we\u2019re talking about this later, just cool your nuts, all three of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back here, Rem, we need to talk to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to the wall!\u201d</p><p>The door to her room is about to slam shut when I reach it and push it open to follow her inside. \u201cYou all right?\u201d I demand.</p> <p>The door shuts behind me, and she faces me with bewildered gold eyes and the face of my fucking dreams, and suddenly I feel as impotent and useful as a damn table, standing here while whatever it is tears my woman apart.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to fucking let it.</p><p>Life can throw the curveballs at me, but not at her. I\u2019ll catch them for her and I\u2019ll throw them back. She\u2019ll be untouchable if I can help it. She\u2019ll be untouchable to everything and everyone but me.</p><p>She has to stop fucking risking herself!</p><p>As she eyes me, I hear her sharp inhale as she signals at the door behind me. \u201cGo talk to them, Remy.\u201d</p><p>My voice is rougher than usual, even to me. \u201cI want to talk to you first.\u201d</p><p>I start pacing for a moment, dragging my hand through my hair all the way down to the back of my neck. Then I drop my arm with a sigh because I\u2019m at a loss for words here. \u201cBrooke, I can\u2019t fight and keep an eye out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy, I had it covered,\u201d she cries.</p> <p>\u201cMy fucking ass, you had it covered!\u201d</p><p>She jerks in surprise, and my fingers curl into fists as the need to drive my hands into that dark hair and crush her against me starts to slowly and painfully consume me. Suddenly, her eyes flash in fury. \u201cWhy is everyone looking at me like it\u2019s my fault? You\u2019re supposed to be fighting Scorpion!\u201d</p><p>A dark scowl settles on my face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be in your goddamned seat on the front fucking row to my left!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make? You\u2019ve been fighting for years without having me in the audience! What does it even matter where I\u2019m at?\u201d She glares at me and dares me to tell her all the shit I feel for her, and the lack of words in me only frustrates the hell out of me. \u201cI\u2019m not even a fling, Remington! I\u2019m your employee. And in less than two months, I won\u2019t even be that, I\u2019ll be nothing to you. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>God, is that what she thinks?</p><p>Does she think I haven\u2019t taken her because . . . what? She\u2019s a toy to me? I\u2019m fucked-up and imperfect, but I\u2019m human and I want things. And what I. Want. Is. Her.</p><p>I want her too much to fuck it up.</p><p>I exhale through my nose and ask, \u201cWho was that girl you were chasing?\u201d</p><p>She drops her voice to a whisper. \u201cMy sister.\u201d</p><p>A silence stretches between us as I register that her sister apparently is friends with Scorpion\u2019s crew. \u201cWhat\u2019s your sister doing with Scorpion\u2019s goonie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s wondering the same about me,\u201d she says with a bitter laugh.</p><p>I laugh right along with her, my laugh a thousand times more bitter than hers. \u201cDon\u2019t mistake me for a fuckup like him. I may be fucked-up but that guy eats virgins and spits them out like vomit.\u201d</p><p>Brooke starts pacing, her face scrunched up in worry for a moment, then she closes her eyes sadly. \u201cOh, god. She looked awful. Awful,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>That\u2019s it.</p><p>That\u2019s fucking it.</p><p>Brooke won\u2019t be suffering like this over anyone.</p><p>Not in front of me.</p><p>I\u2019m not a person who can stand and talk about stuff when there\u2019s something to be done.</p><p>Quietly, I open the door, but before I leave, I look at her pretty face, all its color lost, and I have to say something. I\u2019m no good at this, but I make an effort and gruffly tell her, \u201cYou\u2019re not nothing. To me.\u201d</p><p>Shutting the door behind me, I head straight for the elevator.</p><p>It\u2019s not difficult to find a man who tattoos a fucking insect on his face.</p><p>Plus the fighters always stay in one of the hotels close to the Underground location.</p><p>Feeling bloodthirsty, I curl my hands into fists as I cross the lobby and head out into the night. A huge crowd litters the hotel driveway.</p><p>\u201cRiptide!\u201d they scream.</p><p>Camera flashes explode all over the place.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod!\u201d A woman starts crying while members of the hotel staff struggle to keep the crowd at bay.</p><p>I\u2019ve successfully shoved through one side of the crowd while a good dozen hands rub my ass and my chest muscles when I hear, \u201cThat\u2019s her. Her fault he was disqualified tonight!\u201d</p><p>Turning in confusion, I see something white flying in the air and smashing straight on Brooke.</p><p>Another white ball follows the first.</p><p>Simmering with rage, I clamp my jaw and stomp my way back to her as the fucking crazy people keep throwing shit at her.</p><p>Brooke has ducked and run to one of the parking valets, who sees me come up and says something to her.</p><p>Another egg crashes into her shoulder as I reach her, and I swear I feel like the fucking Hulk. I\u2019m so damn mad, I feel fucking green!</p><p>\u201cWhore!\u201d they shout. \u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>Using my back as a shield, I catch an egg on my trapezius as I lift her up in my arms and swing around to face these fucking lunatics.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of this woman I\u2019m still fighting!\u201d I shout at them, feeling angry, feeling betrayed by them.</p><p>A sudden silence falls across the crowd, and I\u2019m not done yet\u2014motherfuckers!</p><p>\u201cNext time I\u2019m in the ring, I\u2019m going to fucking win for her, and I want all of you who hurt her tonight to bring her a red rose as an apology and tell her it\u2019s from me!\u201d I demand.</p><p>After a second, they get it.</p><p>They fucking get it. . . .</p><p>And they start screaming and clapping as I take her back inside.</p><p>Breathing through my nose, I\u2019m trying to calm down when Brooke starts laughing in my arms, her eyes shining in disbelief as she looks up at me.</p><p>I frown in confusion and press the elevator button a dozen consecutive times.</p><p>\u201cAnd they say Justin Bieber\u2019s fans are crazy,\u201d she gasps.</p><p>My voice is raspy and rough as I brush off some eggshells from her shoulder. \u201cI apologize on their behalf. I disappointed them today.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter fades, and she links her fingers at the back of my neck and stares up at me as I carry her into the elevator. A couple decided not to join us and remained outside the doors.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d I snap as I cradle her against me.</p><p>They both step back and say, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>So we ride upstairs alone, and Brooke presses the tip of her pretty little nose into my neck. \u201cThank you,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>I tighten my hold. She feels so right and perfect in my arms, I never want to let her go. I don\u2019t care if we smell like sulfur; I\u2019ve been hungry to have my arms around her and her arms around me, and right now I can\u2019t think of anything else that I\u2019d rather be doing or anywhere else I\u2019d rather be than here.</p><p>After sliding the key into the slot of my suite, I carry Brooke inside. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on, Rem?\u201d Pete demands as he and Riley charge over.</p><p>\u201cJust get the hell out, guys.\u201d I hold the door open for them with one arm and cradle Brooke to my chest with the other. They stare at Brooke as if she can solve some unnamed mystery for them, so I snap at them, \u201cI do what I want, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>That reminds them I\u2019m here\u2014glaring\u2014and they turn their attention to me. \u201cWe hear you, Rem,\u201d Riley answers as he follows Pete out to the hall.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t fucking forget it.\u201d I slam the door shut and bolt it so no dipshit can come here to interrupt my time with her, then I take us into the bath of the master bedroom. She tightens her hold when I pull open the shower door, and I\u2019m so fucking happy that she wants to stay with me, I keep her in my arm as I turn on the shower.</p><p>The water falls, and I quickly kick off my shoes, take off hers, and then step into the shower stall with her in my arms.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this shit off you.\u201d She slides down to her feet as I run my hands over her wet hair, the water falling on her face as I pull her dress over her head. I toss it aside and soap up my hands, then watch her face as I run them up her body.</p><p>She bites her lower lip as I touch her, spreading her arms up and sliding soap into her armpits, down her abdomen, between her legs, up her neck. My T-shirt is plastered wet to my chest, and I grab it in one hand and jerk it off me, quickly running the soap over me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your groupies called me a whore,\u201d she says as she watches me.</p><p>Quickly, I lather my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re going to survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do.\u201d</p><p>Then I lather Brooke\u2019s hair, my fingers digging down to her scalp. \u201cThey hate me,\u201d she tells me miserably. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to go to your fights now without fear of getting lynched.\u201d</p><p>Taking the showerhead, I turn it so the water slides over Brooke\u2019s head, and her eyes drift shut as the soap slides down her body.</p><p>Holy god. Holy god.</p><p>Her nipples poke into her bra, soft peach and puckered. And the cotton of her white panties clings to her pussy lips. Fucking bare as the rest of her. My eyes jerk up to hers before her eyelashes flutter open, and she looks at me. Her oval face, pink lips, dark, wet hair, those eyelashes glistening wet, and those gold eyes, looking at me like they do. Like there is nothing on this earth she would rather see but me. My throat feels thick as I brush a strand of damp hair behind her forehead, my heart beating as fast as it has ever beaten for anything in my life.</p><p>She\u2019s so beautiful and so perfect, my lungs hurt. Lifting my arms, I frame her face as gently as I can in my palms and stare at her, then I use one finger to touch her mouth. She\u2019s kept this mouth from me, and I want it back. I want it back because it\u2019s mine. It\u2019s fucking mine and she\u2019s killing me right now, looking at me with those eyes, her body wet and shivering against me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d I tell her gruffly, because I\u2019d have to be dead first before anyone harmed her, fans or otherwise.</p><p>The sleek tendons of her throat work as she swallows. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have . . . said that about me, Remy. They\u2019re going to think you and I . . . that you and I . . .\u201d She shakes her head, and looks at me, out of breath.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re mine?\u201d I prod softly.</p><p>She blinks for a moment, then laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>I shove open the glass shower door, then I wrap a towel around my hips and get rid of my sweatpants. She\u2019s still laughing as I come back to get her, engulfing her with a towel as I scoop her up and carry her to the bed.</p><p>I set her down on the center, and I\u2019m not sure if her laughter amuses me or not. \u201cIs the thought of being mine funny?\u201d I tease her.</p><p>Reaching under the towel, I tug off her panties and pry off her bra, then I rub the towel over her body and hair with brisk, sure moves.</p><p>\u201cIs the idea of being mine funny?\u201d I insist, running the towel over her bare little tits as I watch her. \u201cIs it funny, Brooke?\u201d I repeat, looking deep into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she gasps, her laughter completely gone as she tilts her hips to help me dry her. I dry her legs, and when I reach her knee with the small scar, my movements slow down as I survey it. I\u2019ve never wanted to kiss anything other than lips and pussy, but I\u2019m fighting the urge to kiss her bad knee.</p><p>A small hand trembles against my hair, and I hear her whisper, \u201cHave you ever been anyone\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flick up to hers, her pupils dark as night as she watches me. A consuming jealousy rips through me as I think of someone else having her before me. Feeling a roiling in my chest, I cup her cheek in my palm and look at her. \u201cNo. And you?\u201d</p><p>She tucks her cheek into my hand and whispers, \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I.\u201d</p><p>We stare, and the air crackles between us. She needs me. And I fucking need her.</p><p>I trace her jaw with my thumb, searching for words to tell her. \u201cUntil I saw this lovely girl in Seattle, with big gold eyes, and pink, full lips . . . and I wondered if she could understand me . . .\u201d</p><p>Her chest heaves, and I bend closer and scent her, pulling the towel up to cover her body before I break down and take this little body of my dreams, and fuck this woman of my life, and let her shatter me when she realizes who I am, what I am, and what is completely fucked-up about me.</p><p>My voice roughens at the thought. \u201cI want to say so many things, Brooke, and I just can\u2019t find the words to tell them to you.\u201d</p><p>Resting my forehead on hers, I inhale deeply as I run my nose along the length of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou tie me up in knots.\u201d My lips find hers for a moment, briefly kissing before I withdraw and look into her eyes. \u201cI want to play you a thousand different songs so you get a clue of what . . . I feel inside me. . . .\u201d</p><p>A shiver runs through her as I caress my index finger along the bow of her top lip, then her bottom one. She whimpers softly, and I hold her face between my hands and set my mouth on hers, pulling her tongue into my mouth so I can suck her.</p><p>She moans and sinks her nails into my shoulders, gasping, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you take me, Remington?\u201d</p><p>Groaning at that, I pull her closer to me. \u201cBecause I want you too much.\u201d</p> <p>Pushing my tongue harder against hers, I lean over her and feel her body pressing into mine, her tits, her abs, her legs tangling between my thighs.</p><p>She gasps when I pull her closer and keep devouring her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut I want you so much, and I\u2019m protected,\u201d she pleads to me. \u201cI know you\u2019re clean. You get tested all the time and I . . .\u201d</p><p>The tips of her nipples brush against my ribs, and she shudders and tilts her hips upward, silently begging me to slide in there and take what I want. What I fucking crave. Fuck me.</p><p>\u201cI want you in my bed again. I want to kiss you, hold you,\u201d I tell her roughly.</p><p>She grips my shoulders harder and whispers against my lips, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore, please just make love with me. . . .\u201d</p><p>I silence her with my mouth and fuck my tongue into her as I shift my frame, which makes my cock hit her hip bone . . . and my thigh feels her pussy.</p><p>She\u2019s wet.</p><p>Wet as fuck.</p><p>I\u2019m so hot for her, I can\u2019t stop nibbling her lips, biting softly, fisting my hands in her wet hair as she rakes her hands down my arms and rubs herself against my thigh. She whimpers softly, and my gut coils with need as she rocks her hips against me and kisses me back.</p><p>Two . . . three rocks . . . and she starts shuddering uncontrollably against me.</p><p>I stop kissing her for a moment\u2014then I realize what\u2019s happening. My cock starts dripping semen as I feel her come, and I spread my hand on her back and push up my leg, forcing her to ride me harder, making sure her clit gets a nice little rub as I take her mouth with mine and force her to take my tongue as she comes for me.</p><p>The noises she makes . . . the way her body goes slack against mine . . .</p><p>My chest feels heavy with tenderness as I brush her hair back and look down at her flushed face and glazed eyes. \u201cDid that feel even half as good as it looked?\u201d I ask, trailing my finger along her cheek.</p><p>She pulls the towel around her and angrily avoids looking at me. \u201cI assure you that\u2019s not happening again,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>God, I love her. I love her sass and her spunk, and I love how she gets shy with me. Amused by her shyness when she just came for me in a way no other woman has ever come before, I bend closer to kiss her ear, my voice husky. \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure that it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it. If I wanted to have an orgasm all alone, I could have taken care of myself without giving anyone a show.\u201d She keeps the towel to her chest as she sits up and asks, \u201cCan I borrow a damn shirt?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so cute angry, I smile as I head over to the closet and grab one of my usual black T\u2019s.</p><p>Her dark scowl is still in place when I come back. \u201cThis okay?\u201d I ask, feeling possessive as fuck when she takes it and slips it on.</p><p>She still looks shy and embarrassed about it all, which I don\u2019t want her to be.</p><p>\u201cCome eat something with me,\u201d I say, and I\u2019m happy when she slides off the bed and follows me to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what Diane left you,\u201d she mumbles as she pulls out the contents from a hot drawer and uncovers a plate, her smile mischievous. \u201cEggs. They must\u2019ve been on sale tonight.\u201d</p><p>My smile flashes, and I look at her lips, and I want them more than the eggs and more than anything in this kitchen. Watching her so she doesn\u2019t leave, I pull out two forks from a drawer and approach her. \u201cCome share.\u201d Because I want to fucking feed her.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she quickly says, palms up in the air. \u201cNo more eggs for me tonight. You enjoy.\u201d</p><p>I set the fork down and follow her to the door, catching her wrist before she leaves and telling her, \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>She holds her breath and her eyes fly up to mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d she firmly whispers, \u201cwhen you make love to me.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me and I stare back, battling within myself. I want her. Fuck, I want her more than anything. She has to know that. I can\u2019t fuck it up because I\u2019m hornier than a goddamned devil.</p><p>I won\u2019t fuck it up because of my cock.</p><p>Sighing drearily, I hold the door open for her and place myself so that she has to brush past me to leave. Every muscle in my body contracts as she brushes past . . . and I watch her as she heads down the hall, a vision in my fucking T-shirt, giving me the bluest balls of my life.</p><p>After dinner I have to take another shower, this one cold, and when I set up our clothes to dry, I find myself sniffing her wet dress, her wet bra, and her wet, fucking, cute white panties.</p><p>For hours, I imagine charging into her room and forcing her back here with me.</p><p>I imagine stripping her, fucking her, then kissing and petting her all night until the sun appears.</p><p>And then I imagine the look on her face when I tell her I\u2019m bipolar.</p><p>PAST</p><p>AUSTIN</p><p>I feel like murdering something today.</p><p>Something curly haired and brown eyed. In a black fucking suit I paid for. In a tie I paid for. Wearing a fucking smile he is going to pay for.</p><p>Pete and Riley are my brothers.</p><p>I\u2019d kill for them.</p><p>But Brooke is holding back from me, and I can\u2019t stand watching her smile at them the way I want her to smile at me.</p><p>I hear them joke around. Laugh during breakfast, lunch. Dinner.</p><p>Now I slam the speedball, straight in the belly, while my gut hardens with anger as Pete walks with Brooke out of the house\u2014out of my house\u2014and they come toward me. Austin is a test to my stability. I can feel every moment of my life here choking around me, setting the wheels in my head spinning with memories that are too vague to recall clearly, but too painful to forget. This house I bought to get close to the same parents who abandoned me as a youngster. They wanted nothing of me, but like some hungry dog, it took me a while to get it in my head that they weren\u2019t going to throw me a bone. And I kept coming and coming, somehow expecting I was going to get it.</p><p>I feel just as starved for a bone as I see Brooke coming my way with Pete.</p><p>No. I feel more starved. I feel rabid with pent-up longing for her, and my temper is in shreds. So when Pete grabs her elbows and whispers something to her, and she whispers something back, my gut roils as my jealousy corrodes me.</p><p>Oh, yeah, I feel like murdering something.</p><p>\u201cHey, B, you might try stretching him, his form\u2019s not ideal. Coach thinks it\u2019s a lower-back knot,\u201d Riley calls out from the door of the barn.</p><p>She starts heading over, and I scowl and pound the speed bag as fast as I can. Whackwhackwhack . . .</p><p>\u201cCoach isn\u2019t happy with your form and Riley thinks I can help,\u201d she tells me, watching me hit.</p><p>And I keep hitting because I\u2019m fucking mad at her.</p><p>She belongs with me.</p><p>I want to make out with her and make her as addicted to me as anyone can be addicted to anything, and maybe when she knows the truth about me, she won\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cRemy?\u201d she prods.</p><p>I shift my body so she doesn\u2019t keep distracting me and keep my eyes on the ball, making it fly as I hit it madly.</p><p>\u201cWill you let me stretch you?\u201d</p><p>Shifting even more, I keep slamming both my fists into the belly of the bag and notice she drops an elastic band to the ground before she reaches out to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to answer me, Remy?\u201d</p><p>Her hand makes contact with my back, and a jolt runs through me. Stiffening, I drop my head and angrily wonder if Pete feels a jolt when she touches him too, then I whip around and toss my boxing gloves to the ground.</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d I demand.</p><p>She just looks at me blankly, so I reach out and put my taped hand on the exact spot Pete touched on her arm. \u201cDo you like it when he touches you?\u201d</p><p>Please say no to me.</p><p>Please say no.</p><p>There\u2019s no word for the way she\u2019s tormenting me. I\u2019m trying to protect her from me. I\u2019m trying to protect myself . . . from what could be the biggest disaster of my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have no right to me,\u201d she says in breathless anger.</p><p>My hold tightens on her, and I growl under my breath, \u201cYou gave me rights when you came on my thigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not yours,\u201d she shoots back at me, her cheeks red. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re afraid I\u2019m too much of a woman for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, and I want an answer. Do you fucking like it when other men touch you?\u201d I demand, my temper rising.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you jerkwad, I like it when you touch me!\u201d she cries.</p><p>This appeases me.</p><p>It appeases me so much, the ice in my gut immediately morphs into lava. Dipping my thumb into the crease of her elbow, I gruffly ask, \u201cHow much do you like my touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I want to.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s furious, but I know why she is.</p> <p>Because we\u2019re fucking killing each other being apart, and I want to end it. \u201cDo you like it enough to let me feel you in bed tonight?\u201d I prod.</p><p>\u201cI like it enough to let you make love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not make love.\u201d Fuck, she not only makes my cock hard, she makes life hard, period. \u201cJust touching. In bed. Tonight. You and me. I want to make you come again.\u201d</p><p>She surveys me in silence, and for a moment I feel her consider my proposal.</p><p>I have never before in my life seen a woman come like she comes for me.</p><p>Because she\u2019s mine\u2014and she\u2019s as stubborn as they come. Fuck!</p> <p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re waiting for, but I won\u2019t be your plaything,\u201d she says as she starts to pull herself free of me.</p><p>Grabbing her close, my voice is thick with frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re not a game. But I need to do this my way. My way.\u201d Before I can help myself, I bury my nose in her neck and scent her, my tongue sliding out to lick a wet path to her ear. A low groan rumbles up my chest before I seize her chin and force her to meet my gaze, silently willing her to understand. \u201cI\u2019m taking it slow for you. Not me.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as if she doesn\u2019t believe me. \u201cThis is growing old. Let\u2019s just stretch you.\u201d She walks to my back, and right now all her touch does is remind me what I want and she won\u2019t fucking give me.</p><p>I jerk free and glower. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking bother. Go stretch Pete.\u201d I wipe the sweat off my chest with a nearby towel, then ignore my boxing gloves and take up hitting the speed bag with my knuckles.</p><p>Whack, whack, whack.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me,\u201d I hear her tell Riley as she stomps away.</p><p>I clamp my jaw and hit the bag harder.</p><p>THE AUSTIN CROWD loves me a thousand times more than my parents ever did. It\u2019s my city. Where I should\u2019ve been raised. Where I hear people yelling my name, telling me they love me.</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t feel real. It doesn\u2019t feel like home. Not even the ring feels like home anymore. I feel fucking homeless lately. I walk around with a hole in my chest, and no matter how hard I punch, how much I train, it won\u2019t go away.</p><p>Banners wave all over the arena. Women scream my name. Yet all I want is for Brooke Dumas to scream it. But she never does.</p><p>I take down my last opponent with a solid KO, and the screaming that follows is deafening.</p><p>\u201cOur victor of the night, Remingtoooooooon Tate, your RIPTIDE!\u201d the announcer yells.</p><p>Sweat drips down my chest, my body hot with exertion. My arm raised in victory, I glance at her to see if she\u2019s watching. She is.</p><p>My lips curl into a smile as I point a finger at her, and I watch as a line of people start heading in her direction. Holding her gaze with an even wider smile, I point at a girl coming toward her with my red rose. Brooke\u2019s gold eyes widen in disbelief, and my chest swells with happiness as she\u2019s soon crowded by my fans, handing her roses.</p><p>She looks stunned, grasping each rose with an expression of consternation.</p><p>On our way back to the house, she\u2019s trembling in her seat. I\u2019m wound up too. There\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019ll be able to deny my kisses tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou were awesome, Rem!\u201d Pete bursts out inside the car. \u201cMan, what a great night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat fight, son,\u201d Coach adds, his voice deep with pride. \u201cNever broke form. Never dropped guard. Even Brooke felt the love tonight, huh, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Brooke is completely silent, not looking at me, her lap filled with roses. My roses. And yet she won\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cYou totally killed it,\u201d Riley continues.</p><p>I\u2019ve stopped listening to the guys. The only thing I hear now is the silence coming from where Brooke sits, tense across the seat from me, with an armful of roses and completely fucking ignoring me. Frustration eats at me. Don\u2019t all women like roses? She\u2019s clenching her jaw and won\u2019t even look at me, and I\u2019m so fucking confused I want to pull my hair out.</p><p>My blood boils in my veins as I stalk into my room and step into the shower, open the cold water, and stand there, closing my eyes and reliving the way she stood there, watching the roses come at her. She\u2019d looked surprised. But had she looked excited? Had she looked happy? This just isn\u2019t playing out the way I\u2019d planned. I\u2019d planned to have her in my fucking bed tonight. Where I wanted to watch her look at me the way she does while I rammed into her panties and made her come a couple of times and gasp, Remington . . .</p><p>I\u2019m still simmering in frustration and have just stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel when I hear the door of my bedroom slam shut.</p><p>Suddenly my senses heighten. Every pore in my body buzzes with the knowledge she\u2019s near.</p><p>And there she is. Brooke fucking Dumas.</p><p>I drop the towel.</p><p>She\u2019s standing inside my bedroom and looking straight at me\u2014even after the cold shower, my cock jumps to attention.</p><p>Her gaze drops, and her face flushes red as she stomps forward with gold eyes that flash with anger and hurt. She strikes my chest repeatedly, and the pain in her voice reaches into even deeper, more vulnerable places inside me.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you touched me? Why don\u2019t you fucking take me? Am I too fat? Too plain? Do you just delight in fucking torturing me senseless or are you just plain damn mean? For your information, I\u2019ve wanted to have sex with you since the day I went into your stupid hotel room and got hired instead!\u201d</p><p>I react instinctively and yank her up against me while pinning her arms down. \u201cWhy\u2019d you want to have sex with me?\u201d I angrily demand. \u201cTo have a fucking adventure? What was I supposed to be? Your one-night fucking stand? I\u2019m every woman\u2019s adventure, damn you, and I don\u2019t want to be yours. I want to be your fucking real. You get that? If I fuck you, I want you to belong to me. To be mine. I want you to give yourself to me\u2014not fucking Riptide!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever be yours if you don\u2019t take me,\u201d she shoots back at me. \u201cTake me! You son of a bitch, can\u2019t you see how much I want you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me. You don\u2019t know the first thing about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me! You think I\u2019ll leave if you tell me whatever it is you don\u2019t want me to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it, I know it.\u201d I grab her face, my insides roiling painfully as I look into her hungry, frustrated gold eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll leave me the second it gets too steep, and you\u2019ll leave me with nothing\u2014when I want you like I\u2019ve never wanted anything in my life. You\u2019re all I think about, dream about. I get high and low and it\u2019s all about you now, it\u2019s not even about me anymore. I can\u2019t sleep, can\u2019t think, can\u2019t concentrate worth shit anymore, and it\u2019s all because I want to be the fucking \u2018one\u2019 for you, and as soon as you realize what I am, all I\u2019ll be is a fucking mistake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be a mistake? Have you seen you? Have you seen what you do to me? You had me at hello, you fucking asshole! You make me want you until it hurts and then you won\u2019t do shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m fucking bipolar! Manic. Violent. Depressive. I\u2019m a fucking, ticking time bomb, and if one of my staff messes up when I get another episode, the next person I hurt can be you. I was trying to break this to you as slowly as possible so I could at least stand a chance with you. This shit has taken everything from me. Everything. My career. My family. My fucking friends. If it takes this chance with you, I don\u2019t fucking even know what I\u2019m going to do, but the depression will hit me so deep, I\u2019ll probably end up killing myself!\u201d</p><p>When I notice the shock on her face, I force myself to release her.</p><p>Holy god, why\u2019d I just do that? Why\u2019d I say it like that? I sound like a fuckup. I thought she would one day stomp away and slam the door? Hell, all I have to do now is count the seconds. My nerves are run ragged like wires. I haven\u2019t slept, and everything I\u2019ve told her is not even half of the truth. My chest is a mass of tangles as I go grab a pair of pajama bottoms, then I grab a T-shirt from the closet.</p><p>I can see her struggling with the word. Bipolar.</p><p>Manic-depressive.</p><p>Crazy fucking loon.</p><p>I give her time to process and clench my hands, the T-shirt still at my side, and I feel like a grenade is about to explode inside my chest as I watch her struggle. I\u2019ve just shot my plan of taking it slow and proving myself to her all to fucking hell. I\u2019d been postponing. Biding my time. Maybe I didn\u2019t want her to know. I wanted to pretend she\u2019d never have to know. And I could be just this normal guy with her. I\u2019ve tried all my life not to let it define me, even when for years that was the only thing I was.</p><p>Nobody told me I was a fighter, or that I could be a friend, a son, or a companion. All the medics told me was I was bipolar.</p><p>And now she knows. She knows this is me\u2014and I\u2019ve lost her. Before I had her.</p><p>I\u2019m still adjusting to the fact that she will want nothing to do with me when, one by one, she slowly flicks open the top buttons of her top. At first I\u2019m sure my brain is fucking with me. One button pops open, then the next, revealing sweet, tanned skin, more and more skin. My pulse jumps and my throat starts closing from the force of my need. Somewhere in the room, someone speaks, and it\u2019s probably me. I\u2019m in denial. I can\u2019t believe it. I won\u2019t believe it and she better get out of here before I do. \u201cI\u2019m take as-is,\u201d I warn her. \u201cI\u2019m not medicating. It makes me feel dead and I intend to live my life alive.\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I clench inside, right there, where my fucking heart is, as her fingers keep moving over her buttons.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off, Remy.\u201d</p><p>She flicks open her last button and parts her shirt through the middle, and my fingers spasm so hard at my side that the T-shirt I hold falls to the floor.</p><p>She\u2019s so beautiful my eyes devour the parting of her shirt and the smooth skin she just revealed, and I still can\u2019t believe something so beautiful and perfect would want to be with me. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re asking for,\u201d I rasp, and I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m angry with. I\u2019m just angry that I\u2019m bipolar, and right now nothing can convince me that I\u2019ll ever be good enough for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking for you,\u201d she counters.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you fucking leave me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She holds my gaze steadily, and my heart pounds so fast in my temples, I can barely hear her. \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>My heart whams hard in hope, and I feel like it\u2019s about to break all the ribs around it. \u201cGive me a goddamned guarantee. I won\u2019t let you fucking leave me, and you\u2019re going to want to try. I\u2019m going to be difficult and I\u2019m going to be an ass, and sooner or later, you\u2019re going to have fucking enough of me.\u201d</p><p>She tosses her shirt to the floor and then pushes her skirt down her hips. She stands in a cotton bra and panties, her chest heaving, her eyes so deep and endless I feel sucked down to the pit of me. \u201cI\u2019ll never have enough of you, never,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>I swear, in my life, nothing can come close to this. To the way I need her. Want her. Fucking love her. I\u2019m being devoured on the inside with my feelings, tons of stuff I\u2019ve never felt in my life, and a low, hungry sound rips unbidden up my throat.</p><p>She stops breathing, while I\u2019m breathing so hard I can hear myself in the room, and I need to grab her to me so bad, I curl my fingers into fists at my sides as I speak roughly to her. \u201cCome here then.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me helplessly, and I wait, my heart crashing into my rib cage as I take her in, in that underwear. She\u2019s the sexiest, hottest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, every little muscle in her body sleek and compact, while her hips are curved like a soda bottle, her little nipples poking into her bra. When she takes the first step forward, my entire body tightens. Her pulse flutters, and my mouth waters with the need to taste her, suck her.</p><p>She stops a foot away, and I reach out and instantly tangle my hands in her hair and yank her head back, burying my nose into her neck. Her feminine scent makes me growl, and as she shudders and scents me back, I lick a wet path up her neck and engulf her in my arms. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes, Remington, yes.\u201d She fists her hands in my hair and I inhale her like a madman, then I grab her face and drag my tongue up her neck, her jaw, and lick the entry of her lips.</p><p>Hungrily, I part her open and nibble the soft flesh, making her whimper as I thrust inside. Our tongues tangle, and holy god, I swear I can feel her melt for me while I burn for her. I burn so fiercely my nerves crackle like fireworks inside me as I strip off my bottoms and her bra. I fill my hand with the flesh of one full breast and lift a puckered nipple to my mouth. I wet it with my tongue while I sift my fingers under her panties . . . and then she\u2019s in my hand. Hot and slick. Mine.</p><p>\u201cTell me this is for me,\u201d I gutturally command, teasing the tip of a finger inside her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she gasps, then she kisses my temple and jaw as I tear off her panties with one quick yank.</p><p>Her eyes widen in pure female excitement as I lift her and swing around, slamming her back against the wall, her legs coming around me. I settle the length of my cock at her entrance and yank her arms up above her head.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d I demand, sliding a hand between us and easing my middle finger inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>The words ripple through me as I scrape my middle finger deep inside her channel. \u201cDo you want me inside you?\u201d I huskily demand.</p><p>Her eyes are glazed with desire, her lips reddened and wet by me. \u201cI want you everywhere. All over me. Inside me.\u201d</p><p>I struggle to stay in control when I start penetrating her, slow and easy. Slow enough not to hurt her. Only to pleasure her. She whimpers as I stretch her, and as I start to pull out, she holds on to me and drops herself lower\u2014taking all of me inside. Pleasure rips through me as her heat envelops me.</p><p>Crazed with desire, I grab her breasts and push my tongue inside her mouth, and she sucks me, drinks me. I feast on her jaw, her chin, her tasty little neck, then I duck my head and suckle one of her pretty nipples into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d she moans, and tightens her arms around my neck. Her strong, lithe, little thighs clench around my hips, and a bolt of pleasure shoots through my body, making me tremble as I hold still.</p><p>\u201cRemy . . .\u201d she pleads, rocking her hips. \u201cPlease, please . . . move.\u201d</p><p>I groan and try not to think about how good she feels so that I can make it last, but she wants it . . . fuck, I want it more than I want to live. Slowly, I withdraw from all that wet, delicious heat, then thrust back in. A sound of pleasure tears from both of us. Her pussy ripples around me, and my cock is so ready to jet off, it takes everything in me to pull out of her snug warmth and thrust back in, and when I do, I growl and drop my forehead to hers, kissing her without control. I rasp her own name into her mouth and clench her hips as I pull out and ram back in, deep enough that every part of my cock is embedded inside her. I\u2019m so worked up with this new rhythm, I go off violently inside her. She comes with me, and we shake and clutch each other. She twirls her little tongue up my throat as our bodies contract and unwind as we press together, and when I finally relax, I growl softly.</p><p>I\u2019m still hard as rock and she\u2019s still wet as fuck, so I grab her ass and keep her legs around me, carrying her to the bed. Still inside her, I set her down gently, prop a pillow under her head, and I start moving again.</p><p>Testing her first, doing it slowly, I\u2019m wordlessly asking, You want more?</p> <p>She responds with a sexy little mew as she rakes her nails down my back, and she\u2019s stunning beneath me. A fucking wet dream looking up at me. Swollen lips. Glazed gold eyes. Flushed cheeks. Dark hair. She pants for air as I bend to force my tongue into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me,\u201d I rasp, and, god, I can see that she does as she stops gasping to suck on my tongue. \u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>I claim her harder this time, plowing her so that every cell in her body is jarred by my fucking thrusts and so she knows I\u2019m her fucking man now. She takes it so well and looks so hot as she comes, I pull out and rub my wet cock over her thighs, her abdomen, squeezing her lovely breasts in my hands and tasting her neck as I get her all sticky and wet with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to touch you for so long, Little Firecracker.\u201d</p><p>I love how she likes when I play with her nipples. I love how hard and tiny they are, and how pink and responsive. Tweaking them until they look red and happy from my pinching, I grab her hips and take her again. Deep. Hard. My fingers dig into her hips, and she\u2019s so hungry and tight, she moans my name, \u201cRemington.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m claiming her\u2014and she\u2019s giving it up to me with no protest. She wants to be claimed. She wants to be mine.</p><p>She is. Mine. Now.</p><p>She gasps . . . \u201cPlease, oh, god, you\u2019re so hard, you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>And I tell her she\u2019s \u201cso sweet and wet\u201d as she grabs my buttocks and pulls me closer as she twists underneath me, and I can\u2019t resist the way her pussy starts milking me. Her orgasm tears out a soft cry from her lips, and I release a low, ragged moan, my body clenching and releasing with her.</p><p>We collapse on the bed, and she draws my arm around her body and cuddles closer, kissing my nipple. I shift her so I lie on my back and she lies straight over me, her tight tummy against mine.</p><p>I feel like a goddamn king. I\u2019ll never get enough of you, never. . . .</p><p>She\u2019s the first woman I\u2019ve ever come inside of. She fucking let me. To me, that\u2019s code for You\u2019re definitely my man.</p><p>Yeah, I feel fucking fantastic and I still want to bathe her in me so every inch of her beautiful skin smells of Remington Fucking Tate tonight, her man.</p><p>Shifting her, I spread her small, loose body over mine, stomach to stomach, and nuzzle her ear as I run my hands down her sweet curves. \u201cYou smell of me.\u201d I fucking like it so much, I start sniffing her neck.</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u201d comes her lazy answer.</p><p>My nose brushes against her temple as I clench her juicy ass. She sounds sleepy, but I\u2019m too wired now to rest. \u201cWhat does hmmm mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it first,\u201d she saucily counters, and I can hear the smile in her voice.</p><p>My gaze trails down the curve of her jaw in the darkness as I gently tell her, \u201cIt means I want to eat you. Your little biceps. Your little triceps.\u201d I nudge her nose with mine so she tips her head back, then I kiss her sweet mouth. \u201cNow you.\u201d</p><p>Easing sideways, she takes my hand and spreads it over her abdomen, where I left a damp trail on her skin. \u201cIt means I\u2019m going French this week and not showering so I can smell you on me.\u201d</p><p>God, I swear only my woman would say that. Groaning, I shift us sideways so that we face each other, then I reach between her legs and slide my semen up the inside of her thigh, into her pussy. \u201cSticky?\u201d I croon as I bend my head and tongue her shoulder, meanwhile penetrating my wet finger back inside her. \u201cDo you want to wash me off you?\u201d I gently prod.</p><p>Brooke wiggles almost unnoticeably, but not so unnoticeably that I don\u2019t see she wants to get closer to me, my lips, my body, and my fingers. I fucking love it. \u201cNo,\u201d she breathes, parting her legs just a little bit for me. \u201cI want you to give me more.\u201d</p><p>What I want is for her to taste us, so I rub my wet finger across her lips and push it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you since the first night I saw you,\u201d I gruffly murmur to her, watching her suck on it.</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>Her admission tangles all over my gut, and I shove a second damp finger into her mouth, watching her soft, gold eyes drift shut as she licks up our taste like it\u2019s a banquet. When she moans, I\u2019m swelling back up again.</p><p>\u201cDo you like my taste?\u201d I prod.</p><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s all I want from now on.\u201d She lightly bites my fingertips, and my cock jumps to full length as her teeth sink into my flesh. \u201cI\u2019ll always want my Remy fix after dinner,\u201d she continues. I\u2019m getting painfully hard and the teasing glimmer in her eyes is driving me insane with lust. \u201cAnd maybe before breakfast. And after lunch. And at teatime.\u201d</p><p>I groan, I can\u2019t take it. A man with a purpose, I slide down her parted legs and my tongue lashes out to taste her sex. She archs up in offering, and I grab her buttocks to lift her higher to my mouth, her taste intoxicating. Sweet, with a little kick that lands straight in my fucking balls. I\u2019m so fucking horny and thirsty for her, I can only speak in between licks. \u201cI . . . want to . . . come . . . on every part of your body.\u201d I suck her taste in, pinching my eyes shut as I savor, then I rise to stroke my erection along her entry once more.</p><p>She grabs my head and rocks in a silent plea as she takes my lips with hers. \u201cCome wherever you want, inside me, outside me, in my hand, in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curl around my cock, and the touch is so unexpected, so sweet and so bold as she gently strokes me, my cock jerks and I start coming, splashing semen all over her arm, her wrist. She rolls me onto my back and jumps on me, impaling herself on my shaft, and I bark out in pleasure and thrust my head back as I grip her hips and pull her up, then ram her back down, still jetting off inside her.</p><p>Later, she shudders with a soft scream, tossing her head back as she explodes with me, then she falls, limp and unresponsive, on my chest. I spread her over me and leave my cock inside her, panting, sliding my hands down her back, tracing her ass, the dents of her spine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We lay for hours, petting. She\u2019s weak, but I\u2019m still hyped up from being with her. I can\u2019t stop stroking my hands down her curves. I touch her knee, her bottom, her hair. \u201cThe night they sedated you . . .\u201d she asks me groggily, hours later, \u201cthat was an episode?\u201d</p><p>She caresses my abs, but not even her touch keeps me from tensing up at the topic.</p><p>\u201cCan we even talk about it?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I close my eyes as she continues caressing. I haven\u2019t been given caresses that aren\u2019t foreplay before. I don\u2019t allow these when we\u2019re done, I\u2019m done. Like a fight. But she\u2019s touching me and I like it so much, I press her down to my neck so she doesn\u2019t put any distance from me. \u201cYou can talk to Pete about it,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to me about it, Remington?\u201d</p><p>Ah, fuck. I sit up and twist my feet off the bed, then drag my hands down my face. \u201cBecause a lot of episodes I don\u2019t remember what I do.\u201d</p><p>I start pacing. I hate talking about it. The topic distresses me. It\u2019s something I can\u2019t remember and usually have no clear control over. What does she want me to say? I do shit, and then I\u2019m not sure I did it? I seem to lose control, and when I come to my senses, I usually find out from someone else what a major dick I seem to have been?</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll talk to Pete about it, but come back to bed,\u201d she blurts out, but she ceded too easily. I\u2019m no moron and I know she wants to know. Hell, she deserves to know.</p><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d I tell her, just to be clear about that. \u201cIn my last episode. The tequila shots. The way you looked. The little top you were wearing. The nights you slept in my bed.\u201d</p> <p>She seems to absorb that for a moment and then whispers, her voice holding the most tenderness I\u2019ve ever heard anyone address me with, \u201cI wanted us to happen so bad.\u201d</p><p>My chest tangles with emotion, and I swing around. The depth of her eyes is endless. The way they stare right into me. I feel seen. Without reproach, disgust. I feel hungered for. Wanted in a way I have never, ever, been wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t?\u201d I whisper in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted us to happen since . . .\u201d Heading back to bed, I can\u2019t resist kissing her. \u201cEvery second I want us to happen.\u201d</p><p>Three fingers touch my jaw, her gaze curious on my face. \u201cHave you ever hurt someone?\u201d</p><p>God damn I hate having to tell her this. I want to tell her I\u2019m strong, fast, the strongest and the fastest. I don\u2019t want to tell her I\u2019m a fuckup. Dangerous. Volatile. Yeah, I\u2019m a mess. But I\u2019ve never been a liar. \u201cI hurt everything I touch. I destroy things! That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m good at. I\u2019ve found whores in my bed I can\u2019t remember bringing back with me and I\u2019ve tossed them naked out of my hotel room, pissed like hell because I don\u2019t remember what I did. I\u2019ve stolen shit, vandalized shit, woken up in places I don\u2019t even remember getting there. . . .\u201d I drag a breath, then sigh. \u201cLook, since Pete and Riley alternate days off, there\u2019s always someone to knock me out for a day or two when I get out of hand. I hit a low, and then I\u2019m back. Nobody gets hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you. Nobody gets hurt but you.\u201d With a worried crease in her forehead, she takes my hand in hers, and I can\u2019t believe how something smaller than you can give you such a great sense of well-being. \u201cRemy, do they have to knock you out like that?\u201d She laces her fingers through mine, and I glance down and stare at her. At that crease on her forehead. Those gold, gold eyes, worried for me in a way that\u2019s so new to me, it\u2019s almost amusing. But it\u2019s not. I want her to know I\u2019ve got this. She\u2019s holding my hand, and I grip her tighter so that I\u2019m the one holding her. I will always hold us both.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say emphatically. I don\u2019t care what Pete has to do, but I need to be kept in line, now more than ever. \u201cEspecially if I want . . . this . . .\u201d Using my hand, I signal to her, then at myself. \u201cI want this. Very badly.\u201d Then I nuzzle her. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to fuck it up, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>I kiss the back of her hand. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>BROOKE WAS MISSING her friend, so I decided to bring her up from Seattle. With some reluctance, I agreed she could go with Pete to pick up Melanie at the airport.</p><p>\u201cRemy, you\u2019re so good,\u201d Brooke said, sloppy kisses all over my jaw, making me laugh. Yesterday I caught her and her best friend laughing, and Brooke made love to me all night. I\u2019ve never been so connected to anyone in my life.</p><p>When I handed her one of the sedatives Pete and Riley use\u2014because I want her to know how to put me down if she needs to\u2014she wouldn\u2019t so much as look at it.</p><p>\u201cNo, Remy, don\u2019t ask this of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just to make sure I don\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>I get hot just thinking about the ways she keeps on trying to protect me. I\u2019m fucking sure she knows I\u2019m her mate. If we were in other times, and I couldn\u2019t hunt for a day, I know damn well she could hunt for both of us.</p><p>Coach yells from the corner, \u201cToo slow, Riptide, too damn slow. Hit it!\u201d</p><p>I glance at the hard bag and punch. Whack. Whack. Concentrating on hitting. It comes from your core, and as long as you direct it properly, there\u2019s no fucking way there won\u2019t be power in that punch. I work my core more than anything. Everything I do works it, even jump rope.</p><p>I spend all day at the gym, and when I get to my sparring partner, I see Brooke and Melanie at the door. My chest swells with happiness and proprietariness. She signals that they\u2019re leaving, and I pull off my headgear and smile.</p><p>I get a rush making her happy. I turn back to my partner and focus. My life had never felt so right. So good. I\u2019ve never felt so accepted or so fucking understood.</p><p>That night, Pete summons me to discuss my finances. Brooke is having dinner with Melanie. I glance at my phone but get no text from her.</p><p>We\u2019re at the hotel bar.</p><p>A woman walks up. \u201cYou have amazing eyes.\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and turn back to Pete, drilling him: \u201cAt what time did she say she\u2019d be back? . . . You sure Riley\u2019s getting her? . . . Why the fuck are they taking so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley texted they\u2019re on their way back,\u201d Pete tells me after like the tenth question, and he sends me up to my room.</p><p>I\u2019m withdrawing into myself. I\u2019m restless. My gut feels tight and I don\u2019t trust when I feel this. I grab my headphones and sit down, tapping my foot. I listen to Chevelle\u2019s \u201cThe Red.\u201d</p><p>When she finally comes in, my chest tightens. Her cheeks are pale, but her eyes well with emotion when she sees me. I don\u2019t know why my gut tightens.</p><p>She jumps on my lap, pries off my headphones, and slips them over her head. She frowns at the song. Yeah, she hates those rock songs, and I need to kiss away that frown. I kiss her nose, cradle her jaw, and rub her lips with my thumb. She jumps, drops the headphones onto the desk, and runs to the bedroom.</p><p>My gut tightens again, and I sit there, turning off my headphones, restless. I can feel the darkness teasing into me. I\u2019m trying to calm myself. She\u2019s here. She\u2019s back. She\u2019s all right.</p><p>I watch her return. Something in her eyes that I can\u2019t pinpoint is feeding my monster ten times over.</p><p>\u201cRemy, would you hold me for a bit?\u201d</p><p>I study her, confused about what I feel. Then I realize she looks anxious and in need. \u201cCome here.\u201d I shove my chair back and extend my arm, and she wiggles against me as I engulf her. I chuckle softly, instantly calmed in a way that only happens when I touch her.</p><p>\u201cYou missed me?\u201d I cup her smooth cheeks and tip her head to me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasps.</p><p>I gather her to me and set my smile to hers. We stop smiling as the heat crashes through me.</p><p>My fingers outline her breasts, my mouth on her jaw, then I\u2019m at the back of her ear, inhaling her, growling softly when her scent fills me. Winding me up and relaxing me. \u201cRemy . . .\u201d I hear the need in my name as she pushes my T-shirt up my shoulders.</p><p>I grab it in my fist and toss it aside, then strip her down to her skin, then yank her down to me again, my covered erection grinding in between her thighs. She strokes my chest and kisses every part she can.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d she says, running her lips over my jaw, grabbing my hair as she presses close to me.</p><p>I engulf her in my arms and stroke her back, then seize her face. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d I set a kiss on her sweet lips, and her nose, and her forehead.</p><p>She trembles, pressing so close. I want to open up and let her in any way I can. \u201cBut I missed your voice. Your hands. Your mouth . . . being with you . . . watching you . . . touching you . . . smelling you . . .\u201d She takes my lips more desperately.</p><p>I try to slow down, but her mouth tastes amazing, and I need to remind myself that she is mine, mine, so I unbutton her and strip her bare as quickly as I can.</p><p>I draw her back to my lap when she\u2019s naked.</p><p>My whole body clenches when I feel her pussy nestling my erection. She seems undone.</p><p>She slides between my thighs and I yank my sweatpants partway down my hips until my hardness pops free, and her fingers are all over me, rubbing, squeezing, caressing.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you here. . . .\u201d Brooke\u2019s voice shakes with desire as she looks into my lust-tightened face, into eyes that I can barely keep open from the want. \u201cI want to drown in you, Remington. I want your taste . . . in me. . . .\u201d</p><p>She takes me in her mouth. Ecstasy burns through me as a sound rumbles up my throat. I need this so bad I rock my hips, slowly, up to her mouth, giving her what she wants and taking what I need. Her tongue runs all over me and her eyes are halfway down as she watches me, and I watch her back, amazed, undone . . . losing myself in her, praying she can rescue me from the dark already starting within me, the high of being manic.</p><p>I FEEL LIKE a million fucking bucks.</p><p>Who the hell wants to sleep? I feel like climbing a mountain with Brooke on my back, taking her to the top, then flying down on a damn fucking parachute.</p><p>I prowl the kitchen and peer into the cupboards. I not only feel like a million bucks, my body feels like a million bucks. My fucking cock feels like a million fucking bucks and I want to give them all to Brooke Dumas.</p><p>I stick a granola into my mouth, orange juice, a spoonful of peanut butter. I pound in some more so Brooke can rest, but I am so fucking wired and so fucking hard just knowing she\u2019s in my bed. . . .</p><p>I want to feed her and then fuck her and then feed her and then fuck her again and make her feel like a million bucks too, all in that order.</p><p>I start with the food and bring a huge bowl of cherries and granola to our room.</p><p>She\u2019s there, lying in bed with the sheets at her waist, her tits pressed into the mattress. Fuck I want those tits squished against me.</p><p>Setting the food aside, I jump on the bed, and as I run my hands all over her satin skin, I growl, \u201cYou look especially good, Brooke Dumas. Good, and warm, and wet, and I wouldn\u2019t mind having you on my breakfast platter.\u201d</p><p>Nudging my face in between the mattress and her chest, I drag my tongue up between her breasts, then lick her collarbone, and her sweet taste seeps into me and drives me wild. \u201cAll that\u2019s missing is a cherry on top, but I\u2019m sure we have some.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grab a cherry and rub it against her clit.</p><p>Groaning with a half smile, she rolls to her back, her legs spread open, her pussy all wet and mine, her eyes all melted for me.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your man?\u201d I kiss her, rubbing the cherry around her clit. \u201cWho\u2019s your man, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she moans.</p><p>\u201cWho do you love?\u201d I prod as I roll her clit under the pad of my thumb and ease my middle finger into her pussy. She stares up at me with half-mast gold eyes, liquid with wanting.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me crazy, Remy,\u201d she whispers as she wraps her fingers around my cock and pulls me closer.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s a lie, I\u2019m going to make it true,\u201d I think it fair to warn her.</p><p>I grab her hips and shove myself in between her thighs to rub my cock against her sex. I bend down the length of her body because I want to eat her. Lick up from her tiny toes, up the arch of her foot, her delicious calf, her precious knee\u2014where I will linger and give it some love\u2014then up her lean, toned thigh, up to her sweet pussy\u2014which I hope will be soaked like a raining heaven by the time I get there.</p><p>Getting down to business, I go forward and nibble my way up the inside of her thigh. She starts laughing and kicks me on the shoulder, but I catch her leg to still it.</p><p>\u201cRemy! That tickles.\u201d She\u2019s laughing, trying to pry her leg off my grip.</p><p>I cock a brow and run my finger up the arch of her foot, then up the inside of her leg. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and kicks again, twisting to get free.</p><p>So I swiftly change plans, grasping her wrists and pinning them above her head as I spread my big body over hers. I know she loves it when I hold her down. She can\u2019t move unless I let her, and her eyes are darkening and she\u2019s panting softly beneath me.</p><p>\u201cRemy . . .\u201d she says, sobering, her gold eyes both playful and caring as she looks up at me. \u201cAre you speedy?\u201d</p><p>I smile wickedly and drag a finger along the inside of her arm. \u201cWhat do you think, little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re very speedy.\u201d She tugs free and runs her fingers over my hair as she looks into my eyes. My, probably, black eyes.</p><p>I bite her thumb gently and then lick it before I let it go. \u201cSo what are you going to do about it? Do you want me to lift the bed with you on it? Or do you want me to take you on it?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and rolls over, flinging a pillow in my direction. I shove it aside and I grab her by the ankle, pulling her back easily to me. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and fights to get free and I watch as she edges to the side of the bed, a peek of her pink pussy teasing me, driving me insane with want. I\u2019m crackling with energy. I think I can fly her out of here if she wants me to.</p><p>She drives me so crazy, my every muscle is clenched and poised for me to make her mine. My blood storms through my body like fire rushing through my veins. Right now I want nothing more than to take her to heaven. I feel all-powerful, all-feared. I am Remington Tate \u201cRiptide\u201d and this girl is Mine.</p><p>I reach over the bed and she squeals and tries to stay free, attempting to crawl off the bed. I laugh when I catch her ankle and drag her back to me. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019re mine. You get over here and let yourself be taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to pee!\u201d she cries, flinging the other pillow at me, then she hurries to the bathroom and closes the door.</p><p>\u201cGah. Come the fuck here,\u201d I growl, knocking on the door. She\u2019s started brushing her teeth, from the sounds of it. Finally, the water stops and I hear her unlock the door. I open it and find her toweling off her hands. I go to her, scoop her up, and she nuzzles my neck as I carry her to the bed.</p> <p>She sighs. Because she knows I want her. She\u2019s being playful, making me chase.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d she groans tenderly, her fingers linked on my nape. She\u2019s smiling up at me like I\u2019m some long-lost prince. And what she doesn\u2019t know is that this long-lost prince is going to fuck her into oblivion.</p><p>I fling her to the bed, and she squeals delightedly. I drop down on her and ram her legs apart.</p><p>I kiss one naked thigh first, then the other, then I kiss her pussy. \u201cThis is mine.\u201d I lick it.</p><p>Her head falls back and she moans as my thumb steals between the swollen sex lips and dips inside her. My mouth waters and I growl softly as I use my thumb to enter her while I rub my tongue across her clit.</p><p>She parts her thighs and releases a mew that drives the hunter in me wild with the need to conquer. She starts thrashing and I grab her and hold her still. \u201cGive me what I want, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>Tossing her head side to side in pleasure, she whimpers and bites her lips and pumps her hips up to my face. \u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I tenderly urge her thighs apart as I come to my knees. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Now open up. Let me in.\u201d She does, and I sink between her legs, grip her hips, and my body tightens as I enter. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say when she moans, tossing her head back. \u201cWho do you love?\u201d I drop my voice, undone by her, and then crush her mouth when she can\u2019t answer me. \u201cWho do you love?\u201d</p><p>She moans and buries her lips in my neck, biting me. She murmurs something into my skin, clawing my back.</p><p>I moan back and hiss out, \u201cSay my name, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington.\u201d She kisses my ear and tugs on my earlobe with her lips, breathing in my ear, excited. She\u2019s gasping my name in lust, but I pretend she\u2019s answering my question.</p><p>She\u2019s wet and hot, and she loves me, and she\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. Stronger than I imagined, more female than I ever imagined. Funny and nurturing, vulnerable and sassy.</p><p>I love her so much my chest hurts as I watch her arch her spine and take me inside. I groan and duck my head as she clutches me to her. I clutch her back and try to slow down, and she rubs my skin with her fingers. She knows I need it and she gives it up to me with no protest. When she\u2019s tired, asleep. When she\u2019s busy, when she\u2019s sweaty, when she\u2019s hungry. She gives it up to me whenever I want, whenever I ask for it, because I\u2019m speedy. Because I\u2019m me. Because I know, deep in my gut, where it sometimes hurts to look at her, Brooke Dumas loves me.</p><p>I\u2019VE BEEN AWAKE for eighteen hours and twenty-eight minutes. My heart is pounding thirty-nine beats a minute. Brooke has been in my arms for exactly nine hours and twenty-eight, now twenty-nine, minutes. I\u2019m jacked up and I can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>She\u2019s cuddled like a little kitten against me; I want to pet and lick from the top of her head to the soles of her little feet.</p><p>I\u2019ve cataloged the room in my head. I know where everything is. I could run in it in the darkness without bumping into anything. I could carry her in my arms without danger. Everything\u2019s in my head\u2014perfectly visualized.</p><p>But nothing as perfectly as her face.</p><p>Her lips are parted and they shudder on each breath. Shaped like a heart, the bottom one just as juicy as the top. Her cheekbones are high and her eyelashes rest over them, soft-tipped crescents.</p><p>I just want to lie here in this bed in this darkened hotel room and drink her in all over again until I\u2019m drunk and high on her.</p><p>I am a fucking pendulum.</p><p>Any disturbance to my balance, and I swing.</p><p>The doctors taught me this.</p><p>Once I swing high, nothing on earth will stop me from crashing back down. I fall by gravity. Natural urge of the body to restore balance.</p><p>But that\u2019s the thing. A pendulum always seeks its balance.</p><p>She\u2019s my balance. I need her more than air.</p><p>Ducking my head to her neck, I breathe her in and growl.</p><p>AND IT\u2019S A fucking crappy week.</p><p>I don\u2019t like the way Brooke looks at Pete and Riley with a smile and talks to them. We\u2019re flying to New York and I can\u2019t help thinking how much I don\u2019t fucking like that Coach treats me like I\u2019m a goddamn pussy and need to fucking rest, and that Diane is giving me the same fucking food, over and over. But Brooke. I\u2019m onto Pete and Riley, by god, I am. If they so much as give one look at her\u2014they are done with.</p><p>I glare at them from the bench. They tried to help her with her suitcase; the dickwads think I don\u2019t know they\u2019re crushing on her?</p><p>I pull her closer to me and set a kiss on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWho are all these people here for?\u201d she asks. A huge crowd is at the FBO where my jet parks when we arrive at New York, and security has cords holding them back. She\u2019s so puzzled, it\u2019s adorable.</p><p>\u201cFor me, who else,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Pete laughs. \u201cGet off it, Remy.\u201d</p><p>I swear they are all staring at her. I pull her to me. \u201cCome here, baby. I want these good folks to know you\u2019re with me.\u201d I squeeze her ass to mark my property.</p><p>\u201cRemington!\u201d</p><p>I usher her into the limo before the rest come in, then I grab her to me and kiss her. I\u2019m so fucking starved for her, I need to feel her heat, her warmth, her tongue.</p><p>My hunger is wild and unleashed, completely crazy. \u201cI want to take you somewhere tonight,\u201d I rasp into her mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a fight in three days!\u201d She laughs delightedly, and I want to take her to Paris, I don\u2019t care about the rest, but she whispers, \u201cLet\u2019s go anywhere with a bed.\u201d</p><p>I immediately fuck her in my mind on a bed, and then I imagine\u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s do it on a swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it in an elevator,\u201d I propose. I am fucking her in an elevator, standing, my tongue hot and hard and pushing into her while I plunge my cock inside her, over and over.</p><p>Laughing, she shakes her finger at me, and I grin. \u201cI\u2019m never, ever, doing it in an elevator so you\u2019re going to have to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you. In an elevator.\u201d Standing in that elevator, my tongue in her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you. In a bed. Like normal people.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dip to her cleavage, then down her body, to her pussy tightly hugged in the most delicious pants I have ever seen. I want to write a fucking letter to the makers and praise them for a job well done. Thanks to their jeans I have a good view of my woman all the time. \u201cI want you in those pants you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>She nods and grins, then twines her fingers through mine and lifts my hand to kiss my knuckles.</p><p>I\u2019m curious to see what she\u2019s doing because I don\u2019t remember her kissing my knuckles like this. She crawls closer and cups my jaw, sets a kiss on my cheek, and runs her hands through my hair, and my entire body homes in on her touch and the tenderness in her eyes as she looks at me.</p><p>Car doors open.</p><p>Coach rides up front with the driver, and everyone else slides onto the bench across from us. Brooke tries wiggling free but I tighten her fingers in mine and make her stay put. I don\u2019t want her to stop touching me, all my body craves it. My mind is not thinking any shit anymore. Who cares what Coach does, Riley . . . I just look at her. And feel . . . good. Calm. Calmer. I want to rest my head on her and I slide down\u2014fuck me for being so large\u2014then I pull her closer and set my head on her chest. I can hear her heart pounding under my ear. She went very still, and I want her to relax. I pull her closer and shift so she\u2019s comfortable, and I feel her melt with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I close my eyes and my mind feels quiet. It is quiet. I like it. I\u2019m not thinking of anything except the pounding of her heart under my ear. Then I feel her fingernail along my earlobe and I tighten my hold to keep her locked to me. Tenderness oozes out of her like a blanket. I shouldn\u2019t want it this much, but I do. Nobody can take this from me.</p><p>\u201cYou guys want a time-out when we get to the hotel?\u201d Pete asks us in a voice that I can barely recognize as Pete\u2019s.</p><p>She\u2019s moving her fingers in my hair, and when she doesn\u2019t speak, I move my head yes, not lifting it so that she won\u2019t take her hands away. I crave her hands. It\u2019s not the contact as much as the tenderness in her touch. The way her fingers respect my muscles, push just enough, support and help them let go. It happens inside me. I don\u2019t believe in words, but I believe in this.</p><p>She strokes me all over with both hands, softly, and I hear her chatting with Diane about a recipe for me while we ride to the hotel, and her heart is steady and strong under my ear, and she\u2019s small and fragile and smells like she does, and I am never letting her go.</p> <p>I will. Kill myself. Before letting her go.</p><p>When we get to the suite, I\u2019m anxious again. She\u2019s getting her cosmetics out of her suitcase, and I watch her hands move on her bag and pull out her toothbrush, and then she brushes her teeth. And I do nothing but crave crave crave. Inside me in the very pit of my being.</p><p>I want to break that fucking toothbrush and anything that takes her from me.</p><p>She rinses and towels her hands as I approach. She looks at me questioningly and I can\u2019t explain what I need, but I am in a tangle and roiling and I need her like my next breath, and if I had to choose, I would choose her over oxygen.</p><p>I lift her in my arms and carry her to the bed, and she cuddles into my neck and breathes me as I lower her.</p> <p>I pull off her small shoes and toss them aside, then take off mine and speak gruffly. \u201cI want your hands on my head.\u201d</p><p>She edges back on the bed. \u201cDoes it calm your racing thoughts?\u201d</p><p>I take her hand and spread it over my chest. \u201cIt calms me here.\u201d</p><p>Just feeling her fingers spread over me, I can breathe better, I stop thinking. I stare back into her eyes and slide next to her, then I drop my head to her chest and smell her neck. I\u2019m so fucking in love with her I don\u2019t think anybody could ever hurt me like this girl could. Not Scorpion, not my parents. Because I don\u2019t care about them. Now all I care about is her.</p><p>I feel her softly kiss the top of my head as she runs her fingertips through my scalp.</p><p>This is the way I want to die one day.</p> <p>With her at my side, our bodies touching. I won\u2019t need to say anything, and she won\u2019t need to hear it, because she gets me. She gets that words are sometimes bullshit and people don\u2019t mean what they say and through it all it\u2019s only actions that matter. And all I care is that she gets me. We are yin and yang or whatever that shit is called; she is my female and I need her. I knew it from the instant I saw her, and she knew it too, and that\u2019s why she ran. She wanted me to chase and I did. I will chase her every time she wants to see if I want her and need her enough.</p><p>Quietly, she caresses me. I lie completely still and soak up her caresses, taking what she gives me, because she makes me realize I am so starved for it that I would kill for this, and for her.</p><p>And my brain goes quiet and my heart is calm and my life is at a standstill, and the pendulum that I am, all the swinging to and fro, finally stops and I feel like I finally found my center.</p><p>I THINK I fall asleep. I dream of elevators, pink pants, swings, and Paris. I dream of her laughing in a Hummer limo and cupping my jaw and touching my hair and looking at me like I am the only man alive and like she loves me.</p><p>I wake up and she\u2019s holding me in her arms and I don\u2019t know what time it is, but I see she\u2019s still in those pants. She tells me to take them off her, and I do, and I make love to her, and to my disbelief I fall asleep again.</p><p>My stomach wakes me. It is empty and grumbling. There\u2019s warmth all around me, and Brooke\u2019s hair. And I absorb it. I\u2019d stay here all day if my stomach weren\u2019t so vicious and my muscles so demanding.</p><p>I grumble at her, \u201cHungry,\u201d and grab some sweatpants and stalk out to the kitchen. I grab some celery and peanut butter and start wolfing down to calm the hunger, a bit, then immediately start thinking about what else I can shove down my throat.</p><p>She appears and starts exploring what food is in the hot drawer. When I see her, I\u2019m scooping up peanut butter on a celery stick and munching and almost swallow my tongue.</p> <p>My eyes widen, and I drop the celery and cross my arms, staring while I feel a whole lot of good things rise up in my chest.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d I growl.</p><p>Clad in my RIPTIDE robe, she brings over some plates and I am delighted that her scent will get all over my robe and then on me when I wear it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll return it when we get back to bed,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>I shake my head and pat my lap. \u201cIf it\u2019s mine, it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>She sets down the food and I cup her hips and set her down on my lap as I stare down at the plates with a watering mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking starved.\u201d I grab a red potato and chomp on it.</p><p>\u201cYou would love my mom\u2019s red potatoes. She adds cayenne pepper and gives them just a little kick,\u201d Brooke tells me as she forks one up and munches.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss home?\u201d</p><p>I chomp on another potato while Brooke looks at me for a moment. She has an expression and sets down her fork and fully faces me, then strokes the scruff of my jaw with her fingertips. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not with you, I do miss home. But when I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t miss anything.\u201d</p><p>I smile because I\u2019m relieved. She brushes a dimple with her lips, and I growl and rub my nose against her little one. \u201cI\u2019ll tuck you close so you don\u2019t miss it,\u201d I promise her.</p><p>\u201cPlease do. In fact I\u2019m sure there\u2019s enough space right here.\u201d She wiggles on me and I nip her little earlobe and squish her easily, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><p>We laugh, and I take her fork and grab a potato and feed it to her. She takes the fork back and feeds me too. I eat, but I like feeding her more. All my instincts home in on her mouth\u2019s opening for me and on her eyes watching me as I come feed her.</p><p>The way her eyes shine on me make me feel like I am a god.</p><p>I slide my hand under her arm and caress her while I fork up a bite for myself, then I cut some for her.</p><p>She watches me as I cut, and I watch her as she bites and savors it and gets all my blood pumping so fucking hot, I\u2019m burning all the way down into my soul.</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d I ask her, stroking my fingers up and down the divots of her spine. But suddenly food isn\u2019t what I want. I set down the fork and slide my hand through the parted fabric of my RIPTIDE robe, curving it around her waist. I set a kiss on her ear, rasping, \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely yours.\u201d My heart tangles at her admission as she maneuvers so she\u2019s straddling me, and she buries her nose in my neck and slides her arms around my waist. \u201cI\u2019m getting so nervous about the big fight. Are you?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle and peer down at her. \u201cWhy would I be?\u201d I tip her head back, and she looks worried, frowning. \u201cBrooke, I\u2019m going to break him.\u201d</p><p>I want her to know there is no doubt in my mind I am going to break that motherfucker. I don\u2019t hate him, I don\u2019t give a shit about him, but he\u2019s not taking what\u2019s mine. I\u2019ve worked all. Fucking years. For this. My whole life. I fight to live, and I live to win.</p><p>\u201cRemy, I love the way you fight,\u201d Brooke whispers, searching my face, \u201cbut you have no idea how nerve-racking it is for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause. You\u2019re . . . important to me. I wish nothing touched you, and every few nights, you\u2019re just . . . out there. Even knowing that you will win, it does a number on me.\u201d</p><p>My chest tangles again at the thought of her leaving me, getting sick of me. \u201cBut you\u2019re happy, Brooke? With me?\u201d</p><p>I wait for her to answer. I don\u2019t know if she understands that I don\u2019t ask a lot of things I want to, I am not used to asking. I am asking her if she loves me. If she wants to be with me. If she will stay with me. If I make her as happy as she makes me.</p><p>She looks at me and I see the concern and tenderness in her gaze, and the knot inside me starts loosening before she even speaks, for I know the answer.</p><p>\u201cDeliriously.\u201d She slips her arm around my neck and presses close like I like her, whispering, \u201cYou make me happy. You make me deliriously happy and delirious, period. I don\u2019t want to be without you for a second. I don\u2019t even want all those women to look at you and shout at you the things they do.\u201d</p><p>Her possessiveness gets to me. It speaks to me so deeply that I instantly feel possessive of her\u2014I want to physically show her she has all my devotion, so my voice comes out rough. \u201cI\u2019m yours. You\u2019re the one I bring home with me.\u201d</p><p>I go to her neck and drag her soft scent into my lungs until I\u2019m relaxed and satisfied, then I buzz the back of her ear and tell her, \u201cYou\u2019re my mate, and I\u2019ve claimed you.\u201d</p><p>I can tell by her soft smile that she likes it. That she likes that I\u2019ve claimed her. I start feeding her again, and it gets all my instincts up and running in the satisfaction of being able to provide and feed her, protect and love her.</p><p>We fall into an easy rhythm and she starts telling me about Melanie, Riley, and how those two have become friends, and I tell her, \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister, Nora, used to fall in love with anything. She used to make fun of me and tell me I didn\u2019t like men.\u201d</p><p>I scrape my hand down her spine, smiling. \u201cDid you tell her you were waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and pokes a finger into one of my dimples. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly tell her that now.\u201d She smiles and pokes both my dimples now. We keep eating, and I feel immense satisfaction that she\u2019s never given her heart away. It is mine. She is mine.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything nice about your parents?\u201d she asks when we get back into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cMy mother used to cross me every night.\u201d I lock the door, and briefly I remember my mother. \u201cShe crossed me on my forehead, over my mouth, and over my heart.\u201d I don\u2019t mention that she also mumbled and prayed words all day that had nothing to do with the rest of the things she did to me.</p><p>\u201cShe was religious?\u201d</p><p>It comes easily to block out the memory as I pull out my iPod and my headphones and shrug, bring my stuff to the nightstand. I won\u2019t be sleeping for shit tonight. My head is already starting to buzz with things to do, punching bags to hit.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss your family?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>I get into bed with her and I tell her the truth. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss anything you\u2019ve never had.\u201d I grew up with my music, and that will always be with me. I would miss that like crazy and couldn\u2019t live without it. Frustrated with my robe, I pull it off her and ease the satin off her shoulders. She knows I need her naked and pulls her arms loose for me, then cuddles her small, lean body against my bare chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She feels so good, I feel her breasts rising with her breaths, my nose in her neck, her scent calming my thoughts. I might be okay for a while, but I know it won\u2019t last and I\u2019ll be needing to do something in a moment.</p><p>I think she notices my feet are restless. Fucking feet fucking feet fucking fuck it fuck!</p><p>\u201cIf I told you something,\u201d she whispers with a twinkle in her eye as she slides one leg between my thighs, our bodies tangled and close, \u201cwould you remember tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I pull the covers over us. \u201cI hope I do.\u201d Fuck me, I hate myself sometimes.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to calm down the buzzing inside me when she strokes my head, and my leg stops. I bite back a growl and close my eyes and suck in her touch, then she reaches over me to the nightstand. I see she grabs my iPod and headphones.</p><p>\u201cPut these on,\u201d she says. She looks so excited, I grin. I fucking love my music, and a song becomes doubly important when she shares it with me. I straighten up against the headboard, drag her with me, put on my headphones, and drag her to my lap, where she crawls on and selects a song.</p><p>It starts, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard it, but I have tons of shit in there.</p><p>Then I start hearing a woman singing and she sounds upbeat and hopeful. The way Brooke looks at me, smiling, watching me with brilliant gold eyes, makes my gut clench, and I hear the words and what she\u2019s telling me and my body tightens as I hear the chorus come: You\u2019re so beautiful, but that\u2019s not why I love you. . . .</p><p>I scan her face because a part of me just won\u2019t take this as the truth. I look at her eyes, her nose, her cheekbones. She\u2019s killing me, and I need to know she\u2019s not messing with me, but she isn\u2019t. She almost wears the expression of being the one who is softly singing it to me.</p> <p>My body seizes and tightens in excitement. I feel made love to mentally, in my head.</p><p>\u201cPlay it again,\u201d I tell her roughly. She bites her lower lip and clicks the button to replay it, and I can\u2019t take listening to it one more time or my chest will explode into a million pieces\u2014I will be all in fractions from now on.</p><p>I roll her over and set her on her back and place my headphones on her little head, brushing her hair behind her ears so it doesn\u2019t get caught. Her eyes widen as the lyrics start playing to her, and I can see the way her irises flare and her lips part in surprise. Then she closes her eyes so tight, I see the crinkles at the corners, and I watch her listen.</p><p>I kiss her, slowly parting her lips with mine, so that it\u2019s not the lyrics that tell her I love her, not a voice, not a word, but me.</p><p>PRESENT</p><p>SEATTLE</p> <p>Will you still love me if I marry you in a dress Racer just baptized with a little bit of sweet baby vomit?</p><p>I stare down at Brooke\u2019s text, and quickly type back, Yes.</p><p>I wait for her to reply, but getting nothing for a moment, I write, I fucking love you. Don\u2019t let me stand here like some moron today.</p><p>Never! Not even if I had to walk naked up to you.</p><p>Don\u2019t fucking do that.</p><p>I\u2019d kill someone for sure.</p><p>All right. Plus you know our son pukes roses so . . . it\u2019s okay!</p><p>Right.</p> <p>I chuckle as I tuck away my phone and watch the church fill up with people. Including Melanie\u2019s new boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d Pete tells Riley. \u201cMelanie showed me a picture on her phone the other day.\u201d</p><p>Riley is speechless for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Nothing else to say?\u201d Pete baits. \u201cHe\u2019s almost as good-looking as Remington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s got a choad for a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . he\u2019s also got manners. He\u2019s waiting for her by the door,\u201d Pete baits.</p><p>\u201cWell, I could do that, but we\u2019re kind of busy up here with Rem,\u201d Riley grumbles.</p><p>\u201cWill you both excuse me for a second? I believe that, over there, is mine,\u201d Pete says, pointing at Brooke\u2019s sister.</p><p>PAST</p><p>NEW YORK</p><p>We\u2019re at the hotel dining room, the entire team sitting down at two separate tables, one for the ladies, one for the men, when I get an e-mail from an unknown source, with the heading Thought you might like to see this.</p><p>I open the attachment, and I see Scorpion, and a woman in familiar clothes, and familiar hair . . .</p><p>Brooke.</p><p>My.</p><p>Brooke.</p><p>On tiptoes. Mouth puckered. Kissing Scorpion. My blood drains, then shoots back through me with desperate anger. I don\u2019t know what happened. Why I\u2019m looking at this. But I shoot to my feet and send the table crashing to the ground. Coach ends up on the floor as I throw my cell phone and it crashes into the wall. Then I start for her.</p><p>\u201cNo, Pete, no!\u201d she bursts out, panicked from her seat.</p><p>My blood boils as she calls out to her precious Pete, my body suddenly trembling as betrayal and hurt flood me. God, I want to shake her. I want to do more than shake her. I stop before her, breathing and trying to calm myself, squeezing my fists together with the urge to pound them on something. Brooke\u2019s eyes are bright with worry, and the truth in them makes my gut sink.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk to me, Remington?\u201d she asks me, in deceptive calm.</p><p>My god, the gall of this woman. I\u2019m shaking so bad my arms tremble beside me. My throat feels so raw, I can barely talk. I can barely even breathe. I\u2019ve never given myself to anyone, and yet I\u2019ve fallen like some fucking imbecile for her. I have never shared my music with anyone. I have never, ever, believed anyone could love me until I looked into her eyes and I thought I was her god. . . .</p><p>But I\u2019m nobody\u2019s god.</p><p>I\u2019m just a fucking sick fool.</p><p>The pain is excruciating. I want to do some damage, but I just don\u2019t want to damage her. My voice is grim with rage, and it\u2019s a miracle I can even speak as I fight to stay in place, to keep my hands down, to try to control myself. \u201cI want to do more than talk to you,\u201d I rigidly tell her.</p><p>My nostrils flare, and I don\u2019t want her to look at me in fear, but all I can see is her mouth.</p><p>Her beautiful mouth.</p><p>On that motherfucker\u2019s face!</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s talk. Excuse me, Diane.\u201d She surprises me by saying it almost as calmly as if I\u2019ve just proposed a fucking picnic to her! She pushes her chair back and makes a whole circus about folding back her napkin.</p><p>The anger builds inside me and I keep seeing, in my mind\u2019s eye, her mouth puckered and kissing the very man whose fault it is I\u2019m no longer a boxer. I want to grab her. I want to crush her to me and shake her. I flex my hands at my sides to keep them from doing that and more, and I can\u2019t breathe right, I can\u2019t think right. I want to kill Scorpion and carve his motherfucking skin off!</p><p>I want to throw something. I want to yell. I want to take her clothes off and fuck her and show her She. IS. MINE! Mine to touch, to hold, to protect.</p><p>\u201cI just went to see my sister,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>My gut coils in rage that she would not trust me to get her sister back to her like I\u2019d promised.</p><p>I reach out, and my hand trembles as I touch her mouth, then I duck and angrily bite it. She gasps at the feel of my teeth, and it gives me pleasure, perverse pleasure, that she is reminded that that mouth is for me.</p><p>\u201cYou go negotiate with scum like him? Without me knowing?\u201d I scrape my thumb across. I want to drag her up to my room and wash her mouth with soap. I want to lick it clean and then make her tell me that picture does not really exist!</p><p>\u201cI went to see my sister, Remy. I couldn\u2019t care less about the scum,\u201d she softly tells me.</p><p>I touch her hair, trying to be slow while my insides roil and pull and twist, and I keep rubbing her lips. These are lips I love, lips that move me, that kiss me, the only lips I have ever thought loved me. \u201cYet you kiss that fucking asshole with the same mouth you kiss me?\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cPlease just count to ten.\u201d She touches my sleeve, and the anger rises in me even more. She thinks that I can count to a fucking million and forget this?</p><p>\u201cOne-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten,\u201d I angrily rush out, then I grab her collar and pull her to me, leaning over her with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou kiss that motherfucker with the same mouth I would kill for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lips hardly touched the tattoo,\u201d she whispers pleadingly. \u201cI did just what you do when you let them get a hit and give them false confidence so I could see my sis.\u201d</p><p>I slam my chest. \u201cYou\u2019re my fucking girl! You don\u2019t get to give anyone false confidence!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, we need you to leave the premises now.\u201d</p><p>I swing around to watch some idiot coming over. Pete and Riley stop him and start telling him I\u2019m going to pay for all the shit I do, and, hell, the man has no idea I have done nothing yet. He can stay and watch me break everything in this stinking place, and then I\u2019ll gladly invite him to come over and watch me crack Scorpion\u2019s skull in two.</p><p>Shooting him a warning glare, I turn back to Brooke and slide a finger down her pretty jaw, watching the way her breasts rise and fall with her panting breaths. \u201cI\u2019m going to go break that fucker\u2019s face,\u201d I whisper to her, then I lean over and push my tongue into her cruel, delicious little mouth, \u201cand then I\u2019m going to break you into submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy, calm down,\u201d Riley begs me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Riley, I don\u2019t break that easy, and he\u2019s sure welcome to try,\u201d Brooke snaps, scowling at me.</p><p>Scowling back, I fist her hair in my hand and crush her mouth with mine, giving her a hard, angry kiss meant to punish her. \u201cWhen I get you in bed, I\u2019m going to scrub you raw with my fucking tongue until there\u2019s nothing anywhere on you from him. Only me. Only me.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to like my punishing kiss\u2014goddamn her\u2014now I\u2019m so fucking hard I want to take her right here, right now.</p><p>Her pupils are dilated, and her body seems to lean on mine as she breathes, \u201cAll right, take me there.\u201d</p><p>I want to. Fuck, I almost do. Fuck everything else but me and her.</p><p>Jerking back, I look at her narrowly. \u201cI don\u2019t have fucking time to take care of you,\u201d I snap before I head to the door.</p><p>\u201cRemy, come back. Don\u2019t get in trouble!\u201d she calls out.</p><p>I stop, then I drag a bunch of air into my burning lungs, but it\u2019s impossible to calm down, the anger and the possessiveness, the fucking jealousy in me is so great, greater than me.</p><p>I whirl around, then I jab the air with one finger so she fucking understands the situation and where we fucking stand. \u201cProtecting you is my privilege. I will protect you and anything that you value as if it were mine.\u201d</p><p>She stares breathlessly at me, and I don\u2019t think she gets it. She loves her sister, but she needs to know that I am her man and she is untouchable by anyone but me. Anyone. But me.</p><p>\u201cThat sick asshole has just begged me to end his miserable life, and I\u2019m happy to oblige,\u201d I angrily inform her, running my eyes meaningfully over her body, every inch of which belongs to me as completely as mine belongs to her. \u201cHe\u2019s just taken something sacred from me and pissed on it!\u201d I storm back at her and push a finger between her breasts. \u201cUnderstand me. You. Are. Mine!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemington, she\u2019s my sister,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Scorpion will never let go of her. He keeps his women drugged and dependent, their minds in pieces so tiny they can\u2019t even think. He\u2019ll never give her up unless he wants something even more than her. Is it you? Does he want you, Brooke? He could have drugged you. Stripped you. Fucked you\u2014goddamn my life, he could have fucked you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he touch you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t! They\u2019re doing this to provoke you, don\u2019t let them! Save it for the ring tomorrow. Please. I want to be with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with her the whole time, buddy, nothing happened,\u201d Riley suddenly intercedes, calmly patting my arm.</p><p>When I realize what he\u2019s telling me, I swing around to grab his shirt in my fist, the fury skyrocketing inside me. \u201cYou let my girl get in that scumbag\u2019s face, you little shit?\u201d I lift him off the ground.</p><p>\u201cRemy, no!\u201d Brooke comes to my side and futilely tugs on my arm.</p><p>I shake Riley. \u201cYou let her kiss that filthy scum\u2019s ink?\u201d</p> <p>Pete taps my shoulder. \u201cAll right, buddy, let\u2019s put Destroyer to bed now, huh?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a prick on my neck, and my adrenaline kicks in with a vengeance. Motherfucking shit, I can\u2019t fucking black out now. I drop Riley and yank out the syringe and toss it aside. I go grab Brooke and stare at her. I want to tell her never to doubt me again, never to go behind my back again, and never\u2014ever\u2014believe I won\u2019t protect her and what is hers, but I open my mouth and she looks so scared and so beautiful, panting and worried, that instead I make a low, gruff sound and crush her mouth, punishing myself with her taste, the sweet, wet taste of her, so pure and good, and how I hate that she put her beautiful mouth on that motherfucker because of her love for her sister. I tear free and release her before charging off.</p><p>My heart kicks wildly in my chest, fighting the sedative. All I can think of is introducing my knuckles into Scorpion\u2019s face. I\u2019m going to make him eat my fist, and then I\u2019m going to make him go pick up his teeth from where they fall.</p><p>I know where he\u2019s staying. We all know where each other is staying, if only to avoid each other. There are usually several hotels close to the designated Underground location, and Pete always finds out where Scorpion is so the only place we meet is in the ring.</p><p>He\u2019s four blocks away, in a cheap five-story building littered with groupies at the lobby. When they see me, I hear a collective gasp, and all I have to do is growl, \u201cScorpion,\u201d and two of them begin moaning excitedly and rubbing up against my sides, sandwiching me as we take the elevator. When we reach Scorpion\u2019s floor, I get them to lead me to his door before I halt their roaming hands and squeeze their wrists so they stand still.</p><p>\u201cGet them to open up,\u201d I growl.</p> <p>One of them rubs my chest while the other knocks. \u201cWillie! Hey, Willie, it\u2019s Trish,\u201d she calls out.</p><p>The door opens and I immediately swing out my arm, my fist connecting with Willie\u2019s face. He falls splat on the floor. Two other assholes sit on a flowery sofa watching TV, and they leap to their feet.</p><p>I go straight for the nearest one and grab him by the shirt. \u201cHello, motherfucker,\u201d I tell him as I swing my fist. Bones crack. Blood sputters as I toss him down and grab the next, smashing my knuckles so his nose cracks just as hard. When I let him drop to his knees, I see him\u2014Scorpion\u2014at the door to a bedroom, his eyes slightly wide and as yellow as dog piss.</p><p>Clamping my jaw, I angrily stalk over as he lifts his palms up to ward me off. \u201cNow, now, Riptide, you don\u2019t want to do this here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d I grab his shirt and pound my fist three consecutive times into his face.</p><p>He tries to hit me back but I\u2019m pounding him too fast. I shove him down to the ground and spot a girl there, crying, watching us from a chair by the bed. She looks nothing like Brooke. Her stare is empty, her hair is atrocious, and then I see a pencil at the nightstand as Scorpion tries standing. I grab it, and before he can stand, I ram it into the black tattoo he made Brooke kiss, tearing it downward. Blood spurts, and he releases a low, bloodcurdling scream as he tries to pull the pencil out.</p><p>As he winces and yanks it off, bloodied and broken, I pull him up by the T-shirt and force him to look at me.</p><p>\u201cSTAY. AWAY. FROM MY GIRL,\u201d I spit into his face. \u201cYou MOTHERFUCKER. Stay away from my property. I\u2019ll KILL you next time.\u201d</p> <p>I swing out, and the girl cries, \u201cNo!\u201d and when I turn, his fist slams into my face.</p><p>I stumble back, then scowl, roar, and lunge at him. As we swing hard and fast, the only sounds in the room are the weeping of that girl and our hard, fast punches.</p><p>The thing about Scorpion is he\u2019s not me. He\u2019s not as fast, he\u2019s not as strong\u2014he will never win, unless he provokes the shit out of me and I fuck up like I did with my boxing career.</p><p>Like I\u2019m doing now.</p><p>And I don\u2019t care. Right now nothing will feel as good as breaking every one of his bones. Roaring, I deliver a killer right hook that drops him to his knees, and he raises his arms to stop me.</p><p>\u201cHalt! I say, halt, Riptide!\u201d My swing halfway there, I halt and glower down at him as he signals at her. \u201cDo you want her?\u201d</p><p>Blood dripping down my eyebrow, I wipe it off and look at her, as Scorpion grits out, \u201cI\u2019ll give her to you. I\u2019ll let you take her if you let me win tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kill you now,\u201d I growl, hauling him up by the shirt and forcing him to his feet with an angry shake of my fist. \u201cAnd I take her.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and pulls his shirt free. \u201cKill me and my three boys will tear her apart while you do.\u201d</p><p>The soft weeping continues from the corner, and she\u2019s whispering, \u201cPlease stop, stop.\u201d</p><p>I scan the minions approaching her. I can take them all, but I don\u2019t fucking want to do it in front of her. Clamping my teeth, I shove Scorpion away and approach her. I\u2019m no fucking murderer even if the desire to kill is swimming in my veins, making me tremble. \u201cYou\u2019re Brooke\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I take her by the arm and lift her to her feet. \u201cYou come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, Riptide,\u201d Scorpion calls. \u201cYou want her, then one of your guys and mine stay with her in lockdown until you deliver the championship tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>My laugh is dripping in sarcasm. \u201cAhh, asshole, when are you going to realize? I can give the championship away tomorrow, that won\u2019t mean I won\u2019t take it back. And when I do, everyone\u2019s going to watch me break you.\u201d I grab my phone and call Pete.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you\u2014\u201d he starts as soon as he answers.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass over here. I need you to do something for me.\u201d I tell him where I\u2019m at and hang up.</p><p>Five minutes later, when Pete arrives, he sees my eyebrow is bleeding into my eye, that my fists are cracked and my knuckles bruised. He stares at Scorpion, his mouth hanging open. \u201cRem, what have you done,\u201d he gasps.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s talking,\u201d I stress out to placate him, and when he keeps gaping, I snap my fingers before his eyes. \u201cHey, hey, man, focus! You\u2019re to secure Brooke\u2019s sister until I tell you and they release her to me. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He blinks. \u201cDude, you need stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some fucking stitches,\u201d I growl. \u201cJust take her away from that asshole.\u201d</p><p>I turn to look at Scorpion. Holy god, I still want to kill him. He\u2019s slumped and bruised, and bleeding, but he has a gleam of victory in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to break you up on that ring,\u201d he tells me as I walk out.</p><p>And it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cAND NOWWWW, LADIES and gentlemen, the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for. Our reigning champion, the defender, the one and only, Remington RIPTIDE Tate!\u201d</p><p>I am zoned off from the crowd and even of the way my body is primed and pumped to fight. I trot out to the ring and all I can see is Brooke draped in this same fabric around her skin. It brushes against me. I feel calm. I am reminded that she\u2019s the reason why tonight I\u2019m going to be hitting the canvas.</p><p>I can feel her gaze on me as I hop into the ring and let Riley pull off my robe.</p><p>This is the moment I always look at her.</p><p>My stomach is burning with determination. If I look at her, she\u2019ll be wearing that worried look on her face. She\u2019ll weaken me. She\u2019ll make me want to fight. Fuck.</p><p>The crowd yells my name in a chant, and I hate that she\u2019s going to have to watch this. But she wants her sister back. I won\u2019t let her be with Scorpion.</p><p>The announcer then calls, \u201cAnd nooow, ladies and gentlemen, the nightmare you\u2019ve all been dreading to come alive is here. Watch out for Benny the Blaaaaaack Scorpion!\u201d</p><p>And here he comes, the motherfucker. Walking slow as poe to test my fucking patience, with both his middle fingers stretched out to me and the public.</p><p>He feels badass tonight \u2019cause he knows I won\u2019t be having any game tonight.</p><p>I wait for him to get up here, reliving the way I stuck a pencil into his fucking tattoo. I think of Brooke kissing him and my blood boils again.</p><p>He hops onto the ring and his black cape is removed, and I\u2019m glad to see the motherfucker looks like shit. He\u2019s been stitched up where I carved the tattoo off his fucking skin, and his yellow eyes land on me, and I can see the joy he feels that he\u2019ll get to publicly kick the crap out of me.</p><p>Ting ting.</p><p>For a blind second, instinctively, I feel my body start to bounce into place: guard up, feet apart, going toe to toe with him, but I catch myself before I swing and let him have it. He punches me in the ribs, then my jaw, double. I shake myself to recover, then go back toe to toe.</p><p>I\u2019m so wired up, it even feels good.</p><p>Scorpion hits me right in the gut, then goes for an uppercut, and I straighten my head. I\u2019m not going to be knocked down by those sissy swings. If I land on the canvas, I fucking land on it because I can\u2019t stand.</p><p>I take three punches in the body again, chest, and rib cage, and my body, my muscle memory, is at war with my brain. I\u2019m going against every single instinct inside me. But I tell myself I might not have the championship, but I will have her.</p><p>I can see myself and the way she will look at me when I bring her sister. She will have that young girl back and she will know, once and for all, that I will fucking do anything for her.</p><p>Scorpion goes for my jaw, then goes straight and knocks me to my knees. The public doesn\u2019t like it. I stand up, a little dizzy.</p><p>\u201cBoooo! Booo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill the bastard, Riptide! KILL HIM!\u201d</p><p>We keep going. Punch after punch, I concentrate on not protecting, on not punching back.</p><p>We\u2019re going round after round, and I\u2019m just taking it. I feel my systems shutting down somehow. My muscles throbbing, my skin bruised, my bones tender. My brain slowing, my lungs straining to oxygenate every bruised part of me. I don\u2019t even know where it hurts, my body is producing tons of numbing shit, and I am grateful for it.</p><p>I wipe my forehead and keep breathing, my arm ends stained in blood from my eyebrows, my lips, my temple. I slam onto the ground again, and I hate that this motherfucker can\u2019t knock me down unconscious even when I want him to. I jump back up and spit at him, angering the motherfucker so he will give it to me good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemy, fight him!\u201d I hear Brooke\u2019s unmistakable voice, and it freezes me. \u201cREMY, FIGHT HIM! FOR ME! FOR ME!\u201d</p><p>I hear it. Holy god, she has never screamed for me like this. It breaks me, and for the briefest second, I want to knock Scorpion with whatever force I have left. I am the strongest, the fastest, so she knows I don\u2019t go down. I am her mate and I want her to be proud of me. The jabs come, and all I can hear is her begging me to fight. For her. And for the first time in my life, I feel completely humiliated. Can\u2019t she see I\u2019m allowing this?</p><p>This one\u2019s for you, little firecracker\u2014ooof.</p><p>My breath goes, my body contracts to hold the pain. My thoughts scatter and my head spins.</p> <p>He goes for my head now, and my brain spins in my cranium like jelly. I can hear his fist connecting with my jaw until my head swings on the last crack!</p><p>Keeping balance is impossible.</p><p>I slam to the floor.</p><p>I feel it under me. I almost like it. The only solid thing as my world spins. Something about knowing I can fall and the motherfucking floor is there for me is comforting.</p><p>A wet puddle of blood is beneath me. My eyes are nearly shut and swollen. And my ribs feel like they\u2019ve been punched into my lungs. I plant a hand on the canvas, and then the other, and I hear counting. I try pushing up, and for a moment there I don\u2019t know if I can.</p> <p>I hate him. I hate him with a passion. All I can think about is me standing here, seeing those yellow eyes and that face, and busting it open the next time I face him.</p><p>I push up and spit blood, and as soon as I am up, I catch a left hook on my side that swings me around.</p><p>I stumble and almost fall again, need to shake my head. The room is spinning. And all I can think of are Brooke\u2019s arms, and how good they will feel when she holds me tonight. I\u2019m going to cuddle her to me and let her put ice on me and work her magic, and she\u2019s going to love me for giving her back her sister because I thought I wanted the championship, but not now.</p><p>Now all I want is the woman I love. To love me. Like nobody in my life has loved me before. And I\u2019ll fight harder for her than for anyone.</p><p>I hear Riley and Coach yelling at me over and over, \u201cYour fucking guard! What the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>People yell all over the arena. They\u2019re getting thirstier and thirstier for blood, but today I can only give them mine.</p> <p>\u201cKILL HIM, RIPTIDE! KILL HIM!\u201d</p><p>The next hit sends blood splattering across the canvas, and the people shout even louder. \u201cREM-ING-TON! REM-ING-TON!\u201d</p><p>My heart has never pumped so hard. No part of my body understands why I\u2019m not using it. My fight tonight is with myself, with every fucking instinct inside me, my muscles, which want to work, my nerves, which jump reflexively to protect. But I can\u2019t move my right arm anymore. It hangs limp at my side, and it doesn\u2019t even hurt.</p><p>\u201cRemy, Remy, REMY!\u201d people continue yelling.</p><p>Scorpion growls in rage. I know for a fact there has never been a moment in his life when anyone rooted for him.</p><p>I spit in his face. \u201cNext time I see you, you\u2019re going to eat my fist,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He swings his arm back with a roar and I wait for the slam. It comes and I\u2019m down. My vision tunnels and goes black.</p><p>I HEAR MUSIC in the dark. I hear the songs Brooke has played me, songs I have played her. My body aches and I try to move but can\u2019t pull out of the dark. I feel hands on my jaw, and I hear sounds close to my ear. Sobbing little sounds. I feel her kisses on my temple, her fingers on top of my hair. I hear the music and lose it . . . lose her . . . No, I\u2019m never going to lose her. I\u2019d do everything for her. She has to know I\u2019d do everything for her.</p> <p>Light burns into my retinas. My body is leaden and numb. My chest hurts. I peel open my eyes wider and assess my surroundings.</p><p>Hospital. Riley.</p><p>And Brooke?</p><p>Panic seizes me. I try to talk and something is stuck in my throat, so I groan.</p><p>Riley\u2019s head shoots up from where he sits in the chair. \u201cYou\u2019re up, thank god!\u201d He comes to me. \u201cHoly god, Remington, I\u2019m fucking glad you made it so I can kill you myself. You had us all\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grab his arm and squeeze so tight, he halts, and a noise emerges from my throat, through the stupid breathing tube I\u2019ve got jammed in there.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know where Brooke is?\u201d Riley asks when he looks into my eyes.</p><p>I nod and groan again. The panic claws through me. She saw the debacle in the ring, and I need to see that she\u2019s all right.</p><p>When Riley goes to get her, I count the seconds with my heartbeat.</p><p>She comes in and stops when we see each other. I\u2019ve never before felt what I feel now. Every cell in my body leaps, but at the same time I\u2019m immobilized in this bed, trembling with the sight of her. She\u2019s there, looking at me, in clothes that are wrinkled and her hair a mess, her face pale, and she has never looked so good to me. My body tenses with the urges burning through me. I want to tell her, I love you, Little Firecracker. I fucking love you so bad. . . .</p><p>I want her to bring me my iPod so I can play a song to her. \u201cI Love You\u201d again. Or another one. Shit, nothing can capture the feeling of loving her.</p><p>She starts trembling on her feet, and my eyes start burning when I hear the sobs that start wracking her. They tear from somewhere so deep, her voice sounds completely unfamiliar, and it makes me hurt in places I didn\u2019t even know I had.</p><p>\u201cHow d-dare you make m-me watch t-that . . . how could you stand there and make me watch h-him destroy you! Your bones! Your face! Y-you . . . were . . . mine! Mine . . . to . . . to . . . hold. . . . How d-dare you break you! How dare you break me!\u201d</p><p>My eyes are on fucking fire and I can\u2019t fucking move, all I can do is lie here as her pain and mine tear through me.</p><p>\u201cA-all I wanted was to help my sister and not g-g-get you in trouble. I also wanted to protect you, to take care of you, to be with you. I wanted to ss-stay with you until you were sick of me and didn\u2019t need me. I wanted you to love me because I . . . I . . . Oh, god, but you . . . I . . . can\u2019t. I can\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s hard to watch you fight, but to watch you murder yourself is . . . I won\u2019t do it, Remington!\u201d</p><p>I make noise and try to move even when an arm is in a cast, hating how heavy my body feels. My fast, trained body fails me, and it is as broken as I suddenly feel.</p><p>Tears trickle down her cheeks, and suddenly she comes to me and she touches my free hand and bends to my chest as she kisses my knuckles, her tears falling on my scars.</p><p>I want to touch her so bad I force my cast to move so I can place my hand on the back of her head, stroking her hair.</p><p>She wipes her cheeks and looks through tear-filled eyes at me, and I silently will her to understand that I can take this, that I can take a beating.</p><p>But suddenly she stands to go.</p><p>I grab her hand and clutch it as tight as I can without breaking her little bones. She pulls it free and grabs my face and sets a kiss on my forehead. I feel all her pain explode inside me, and she\u2019s fucking killing me. A sound tears from my throat as I grab the tube and try pulling it out, and the machine goes crazy and so does Brooke.</p><p>\u201cRemy, don\u2019t, don\u2019t!\u201d she pleads, but I won\u2019t fucking have it, I need to take this fucking shit off. I\u2019ve never been a man of words, but I won\u2019t have shit in my throat when I have something to say to her, but Brooke panics and yells for a nurse. \u201cNurse! Please!\u201d</p><p>A nurse rushes into the room, and something shoots through the IV to my veins, and I am instantly as heavy as a bull and my head is closing in on me. Brooke looks at me with a face I will never forget. I think I broke her. She\u2019s strong, she\u2019s my mate, and she is naturally strong enough to take me\u2014no.</p><p>Nobody can take me.</p><p>I see the look in her eyes, the same look I imagine everyone gets when they realize I\u2019m hopeless. I\u2019m a fucking mess. But then she smiles at me, and it\u2019s a smile that brands itself in my head. I cling to it as I start sinking, trying to think of what song I will play her when I wake. . . .</p><p>Dear Remington,</p><p>The very first moment I laid eyes on you, I think you had me. And I think you knew. How could you possibly not know? That the floor was shaking under my feet. It was. You made it move. You colored my life again. And when you came after me and kissed me, I just knew somewhere deep inside me, my life would forever be touched and changed by you. It has been. I have had the most amazing, incredible, beautiful moments of my life with you. You and your team became my new family, and never for one second did I really plan to leave. Not them, but most of all, not you. Every day I spent with you only makes me crave more of you. All I wanted for days was to be closer. It hurts to be close and not to touch you, and I wanted to spend every waking moment with you and every sleeping moment in your arms. So many times now, I wanted to tell you all the ways you make me feel, but I wanted to hear you say it first. My pride is gone now. I have no room for it, and I don\u2019t want to regret not telling you: I love you, Remy. With all my heart. You are the most beautifully complicated, gentle fighter I\u2019ve ever known. You have made me deliriously happy. You challenge and delight me and make me feel like a kid inside, with all the amazing things to look forward to, just because I was looking at the future and thinking of sharing it all with you. I\u2019ve never felt so safe as when I am with you, and I want you to know I am completely in love with every part of you, even the one that just broke my heart.</p><p>But I can\u2019t stay anymore, Remy. I can\u2019t watch you hurt yourself, because when you do, you\u2019re hurting me in ways I never thought anybody ever could, and I\u2019m afraid of breaking and never being right again. Please never, ever, let anyone hurt you like this. You are the fighter everyone wants to be, and this is why everyone in the world loves you. Even when you screw up, you get back up fighting again. Thank you, Remy, for opening your world to me. For sharing yourself with me. For my job. And for every time you smiled at me. I want to tell you to get well soon, but I know that you will. I know you will be blue-eyed and cocky and fighting again, and I\u2019ll be in your past, like all the things you\u2019ve overcome before me. Just please know that I will never hear \u201cIris\u201d again without thinking of you.</p><p>Yours always,</p><p>Brooke</p><p>I\u2019ve read this letter over and over today. I\u2019ve read it in disbelief, in anger, in self-loathing, in loneliness, in desperation, but never in detachment. And now, I read it another time, and it\u2019s finally sinking in that she\u2014my girl\u2014has left me. My body implodes and I groan and drop my head with the sort of intense pain they don\u2019t make painkillers for. My eyes blurring, I scrape my thumbs over the I love you, Remy over and over while I hear Pete out in the living room, talking as if it\u2019s a normal day.</p><p>Another fucking day of the life of Riptide.</p><p>Before he ever met . . . her.</p><p>\u201cFifteen hundred shares of that one. Sell. . . . Yes.\u201d There\u2019s a silence that makes me figure out he hung up, and I watch the doorknob turn as he peers into the bedroom. The curtains are open, and he starts when he sees me. \u201cYour eyes are blue.\u201d</p><p>I rub my face and try to piece the past weeks together in my head, but all I can think of is bits of this letter. I love you, Remy. . . . You have made me deliriously happy. . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pete steps into the room and strides over. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out for almost three weeks. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Silent, I just look at him, holding the letter in my hand.</p><p>\u201cRemington, do you realize what you did? You lost the fucking championship. You threw. The fight! You gave up everything you\u2019ve worked for. Every last penny of your liquid cash is gone. Years of endorsements and work. The championship . . . gone.\u201d His voice breaks, and he looks at me. \u201cDo you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I did, Pete. Nothing I gave up is something I can\u2019t get back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, you moron. You could have fucking died! Remington, who fucking does that? You willingly let him beat you unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Twisting around, I sit on the side of the bed and rub my neck with one hand as I stare down at the letter and impulsively smell it. Fuck, it smells like her. Even the sight of her handwriting gets me.</p><p>Riley comes in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s blue,\u201d Pete instantly informs him.</p><p>\u201cHell, that\u2019s fucking great! Hey, Rem.\u201d</p> <p>I look at them, and they\u2019re my brothers. My brothers I care about. \u201cYou\u2019re disappointed,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not disappointed, dude, we worry about you. No woman is worth that,\u201d Pete says.</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d But I\u2019m so fucking pissed at her for leaving me, I crumple the letter in my fist and stand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the fight. I\u2019ll make it up to the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sorry for us,\u201d Pete repeats.</p><p>I stretch one biceps, then the other, testing my body while I ask, \u201cScorpion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere in the Bahamas or some shit. Having fun spending your money,\u201d Pete says, still sounding glum.</p> <p>\u201cPut the Austin home up for sale,\u201d I mumble. \u201cThat should get us through this season.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got some endorsement interest. You\u2019ve been doing great\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? Is she all right?\u201d</p><p>They blink.</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, why are you asking?\u201d Pete looks at me in alarm, then at Riley, then at me. \u201cYou\u2019re getting over her, Rem. You\u2019ve had like dozens of ladies over! They\u2019re wild for some Riptide, just like old times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Rem, the kinds of ass you get,\u201d Riley says. \u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>An image flashes in my head of gold eyes, brimming with tears, in a hospital room. I stare down at the letter and uncrumple it from my fist, aware of Pete and Riley watching me, and then watching each other.</p> <p>\u201cDude, hand that over, I can put that away from you.\u201d Pete comes over for the letter.</p><p>I instantly fist my hand around it. \u201cYou touch it, you die.\u201d</p><p>He drops his arm and sighs, and I look at both of them. \u201cWhere\u2019s her sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot out of rehab yet. Another week.\u201d</p><p>I keep testing my body. Coach must be using the TENS machine on me to maintain muscle mass. I fold my muscles, they\u2019re hard as ever. All electronically manipulated to make them believe I trained\u2014when I did not.</p><p>\u201cCoach has been shocking every inch,\u201d Riley says, confirming my thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re filled up with glutamine and all kinds of supplements.\u201d</p><p>I drop to the floor and do a push-up. Nice. It flows. My back isn\u2019t fucked from lying in bed. I jump up and twist my neck, then I open my suitcase and spot my boxing robe. And I know, with every inch of me, if I grab it, it\u2019s going to smell like her. In that moment the urge to expend all my rapidly building energy becomes acute. \u201cCall Coach, let\u2019s hit it hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously going to train? You\u2019ve been in the hospital for over two weeks and getting shocks in the head! That\u2019s the only way we could pull you out of your depression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m good now.\u201d I take her letter and my training gear into the bathroom, then I open the letter and read it again: I love you, Remy.</p><p>I close my eyes and throw it away.</p><p>Then I go get it, read it, and trace her letters. Damn you, Brooke. You should\u2019ve told me to stay away. That you hated me. That you can\u2019t live with someone like me. Instead you tell me my team is your family. That you\u2019re happy. That you think about me when you hear my songs. You tell me that you fucking love me. Now, Brooke, I\u2019m coming after you.</p><p>EVERYONE, EXCEPT DIANE, rides in the Escalade. We\u2019re only blocks away from the building and there\u2019s a war zone in my chest. I drum my fingers on my thighs while the knot in my gut tightens as we get nearer. Brooke needs to be set fucking straight, and I\u2019m sure when she sees the little package we\u2019ve brought, there won\u2019t be much explaining to do.</p><p>I rub the back of my neck and then ram my hand into my jeans and grab the letter. The letter burns me. I\u2019ve read it until my eyes cross and they burn from my rage. She held me like I was golden. She said she\u2019d never leave and every inch of me believed her. I want to know what I said. I want to know what I fucking did. I want to know if she meant what she said in her fucking letter or if it\u2019s all a load of fucking bullshit.</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s Brooke, and Melanie,\u201d Pete says from the back.</p><p>My head snaps toward the two figures trotting down the sidewalk as the car heads farther down the block to stop before her apartment. Holy god, it\u2019s her.</p><p>My heart starts pumping, the arteries in my heart widening to feed my muscles. I curl my fingers and yank open the door, but Pete and Riley descend from the car first. I step out on the sidewalk after them, and I see her. And she sees me. And we stare, neither of us moving. My eyes have been so starved, they hurt when I take her in\u2014ponytail, running shoes, exercise gear, the oval face I dream of and those marshmallow lips of my fantasies and those gold eyes shining as they look back at me.</p><p>God, I love you.</p><p>With every bit of my fucking being, and every inch is buzzing at the sight of her. She wears tight running gear and sweat glistens on her forehead and throat, her hair held back in a cute ponytail, and she\u2019s frozen on the spot as she looks at me. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s going to launch herself at me when she starts to move; all I know is, if she does, I\u2019m so fucking ready to catch her. I\u2019m going to catch her and never set her down on the ground.</p><p>Jesus, she looks so right and so glad to see me, I get all knotted up as they start heading for the three of us.</p><p>\u201cMiss Dumas?\u201d Pete asks her as she and her friend keep heading over. \u201cWe believe this belongs to you?\u201d</p><p>He signals past me, and from our Escalade Nora emerges.</p><p>Brooke looks at me first, then blinks. \u201cNora?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNora?\u201d her friend Melanie repeats.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to make sure she got home safe,\u201d Pete says.</p><p>\u201cNora?\u201d Brooke can\u2019t take her eyes off her sister, and my chest swells at the joyous disbelief on my little firecracker\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d Her sister runs over for a hug, and I\u2019ve never been jealous of a woman before, but I want Brooke\u2019s arms around me, her scent in my nostrils, in my lungs, caressing my soul. \u201cIt\u2019s me, big sis! I\u2019m back! I\u2019ve done work in rehab. Pete helped me. And I got the tattoo off.\u201d She points to the place where Scorpion\u2019s fucking ink used to mark her face. \u201cI felt so little when you looked at me that day, Brooke. I felt so little and so . . . dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, never!\u201d Brooke hugs her again, and my gut clenches in jealousy and my arms feel leaden with the want to go around her.</p><p>\u201cNora! Nora Camora Lalora Crazyora!\u201d Brooke\u2019s crazy, funny friend dives for Nora and swings her around, and Brooke turns to stare at the group of us, my heart kicking in anticipation.</p><p>But she looks at Pete, only making the knot in me tighten even more. \u201cPete, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d He signals happily at her sister. \u201cShe\u2019s done great. She\u2019s such a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>Then he nods in my direction, and Brooke\u2019s gold eyes return to me, but I can\u2019t take standing here, like she\u2019s not mine, and I\u2019m not hers. I ram my hands into my jeans pocket and can\u2019t stop checking her out, the way her curves fill out, her sweat clings to her pretty skin.</p><p>\u201cThe night Remy went to fight with Scorpion, Scorpion offered your sister to him instead of the championship. And Remy agreed,\u201d Pete explains.</p><p>I watch her, and her eyes meet mine in utter confusion, and I wait for her to say something.</p><p>\u201cYou mean he agreed to . . . lose?\u201d</p><p>My body tightens at the disbelief there, at the pain. She thought I did it because I\u2019m a fucking BP, and I know it.</p><p>She starts shaking her head, clinging to my eyes with hers. I see her pulse pounding, her face changing in color, her eyes darkening in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou did this for . . . Nora?\u201d she breathlessly asks me.</p><p>She\u2019s so exquisite, she\u2019s my girl, my little firecracker, and when her eyes flood with tears, I want them to fall only so I can lick them away.</p><p>Pete grabs a green duffel bag from the back of the Escalade and heads inside with Nora. \u201cLet me take this in for you, Nora.\u201d</p><p>Riley stands by me, and the girls are looking back at us. No. Melanie is looking at Riley. But Brooke can\u2019t take her eyes off me. I push my hands deeper into my pockets. I could grab her to me. Crush her to me. Give her a punishing kiss for leaving me, and then a loving kiss because I\u2019m fucking insane about her.</p><p>She wraps her arms around herself and drops her head. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? That you threw the fight for . . . her?\u201d</p><p>She looks forlorn, and, god, I wanted her to feel protected by me. Not ashamed of what I will do for her. \u201cYou mean for you,\u201d I softly tell her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know either, Brooke,\u201d Riley says. \u201cOr Coach. Only Pete knew. He\u2019s the one who found him that night, and he helped secure your sister while Remington delivered the win.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes briefly meet Riley\u2019s, then they come back to roam all over me. I can feel her touch. Her want. It\u2019s in her eyes, trembling in her voice. I want to reach it, touch it, see it, feel it closer.</p><p>\u201cHow are you? Are you all right?\u201d she asks me, and her sweet concern makes it impossible to think straight. I only nod. I\u2019m not all right, little firecracker, not even near all right.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this loss mean for you now?\u201d she asks. She wants to talk, but I don\u2019t want to talk about the Underground. I lost something far more important that day and I want it back.</p><p>\u201cOther than we\u2019re poor?\u201d Riley answers for me. He chuckles too hard. \u201cHe has a couple million to get him through the year. We\u2019re making a comeback when the new season starts. Remy\u2019s fans demand retribution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have loyal fans, don\u2019t you?\u201d Brooke asks, those gold eyes softly massacring me.</p><p>I want to tell her that for a month I have not been aware of everything I have, only what I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWell, time to go.\u201d Riley slaps my back. \u201cActually, Brooke, we\u2019re also here because we\u2019re looking for a sports rehab specialist for the upcoming new season. Good to get a head start on training.\u201d Riley gives her the card with the details. \u201cIn case you\u2019re interested, Mr. Tate\u2019s number, if you consider, is on the back. There\u2019s the hotel where we\u2019re staying too. We leave in three days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley climbs into the car, and so does Pete, but I wait for her reaction.</p><p>She looks at me, and I stare directly back at her.</p><p>My pulse is wild as I want to say a thousand things, play her a thousand songs, and nothing comes out. Out of the mess inside me, the roil and tangle of emotions, I can\u2019t say a single word. Not even Why? Why did you leave me. Why did you say you loved me and leave me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good, Remy,\u201d Melanie says happily.</p> <p>I smile briefly because I like the way she makes Brooke laugh. I like that Melanie gave me the phone number that started all of this.</p><p>She skips away and Brooke remains watching me, and I don\u2019t even know where to begin. In my life, nobody has ever told me what she told me in that letter. I\u2019m used to being dropped. I\u2019m conditioned to expect it. But when she said she\u2019d never tire of me, I believed her. When she played me a song about loving me, I fucking believed her. And I need her to come back to me on the same two long, sleek legs she used to leave me.</p><p>\u201cYou know where to find me,\u201d I murmur, then I get in the car with the guys and we ride off.</p><p>I grab her letter and squeeze it, and for a moment I\u2019m angry again. At myself. At her. At my fucked-up body. I could go back and carry her up to her own fucking apartment, fuck her brains off, and remind her who she cries for, who her man is, perfect or not.</p><p>But my pride is so battered, I feel like that stupid boy left at a mental institute, who kept waiting for somebody to come and get him out.</p> <p>I RUN AND run until I am dripping, and even then, every inch of me is tense and waiting. Tomorrow we\u2019re scheduled to leave. And I know I can\u2019t leave without her. I know me, and I\u2019m going to come back and take her if she doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>Still, I want for once in my life for someone to come to me because they feel I\u2019m worth it. No, not someone. Her. I want the woman I love to come to me because at last someone in this world understands me. How the fuck am I supposed to leave, to live, without her?</p><p>I go back to the suite and slam the door\u2014</p><p>And like a vision, I see her, sitting in the living room with Pete and Riley.</p><p>She leaps to her feet and an awareness of every stitch of clothing she wears and every detail of her seizes me. I feel the calm I feel for a fraction of a second before a fight, and then the fight is inside me. A thousand emotions racing one after the other. The air buzzes with tension. I can feel arcs of lust leap between us, pulling at my gut. My chest heaves, and I am stunned, and still angry, and then I\u2019m just desperate to bury all of this turmoil I feel inside her and remind her that she\u2019s fucking mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you, Remington, if you have a moment,\u201d she thickly whispers.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Brooke, I want to talk to you too.\u201d</p><p>I start walking and let her follow, hating how her voice gets me. The scent of her reaches me, and as I lead her into the master and close the door, my instincts betray me, and I curl a hot hand around her neck and bend to drag a deep inhale of her into my lungs.</p><p>She grabs my T-shirt in her fists and buries her face in me. \u201cDon\u2019t let me go please,\u201d she begs. Renewed anger makes me wrench free, and I hate my weakness.</p><p>\u201cIf you want me so much, then why\u2019d you leave?\u201d I demand. She sits at the foot of the bed, on a bench, and I am so vividly pained I cross my arms, blocking myself. \u201cDid I say anything when I was manic?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with emotion and her voice carries it. \u201cYou wanted to take me to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd make love to me in an elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd to have me in my pink pants,\u201d she admits, and blushes all the way up her throat to her cheeks.</p><p>I keep waiting for her to tell me the rest, and when she doesn\u2019t, I remind her. Because it\u2019s something I have played in my head this past month\u2014every part of that moment.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot the part where we played each other a song,\u201d I murmur, and I can\u2019t keep looking at her when every ounce in me demands I make a connection.</p><p>I take her hand and hear her breath catch softly as I lift her fingers to my lips. My pulse starts getting faster as I turn her hand, spot the flatness of her palm, and drag my tongue over it.</p><p>\u201cThat picture made me very angry, Brooke,\u201d I tell her into her skin as I drag my tongue all over, tasting her. \u201cWhen you belong to someone . . . you don\u2019t kiss anyone else. You don\u2019t kiss his enemy. You don\u2019t lie to him. Betray him.\u201d</p><p>I add my teeth, and it affects her, and her voice trembles through her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted to protect you, like you protect me. I won\u2019t ever go behind your back again, Remy. I didn\u2019t leave because you were manic, I just didn\u2019t want you to get manic or low because of me.\u201d</p><p>I nod in agreement, my eyes running over her in confusion. \u201cThere\u2019s something I might have missed then. Because I still can\u2019t understand why, the fuck, you would leave me when I fucking needed you!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glisten. \u201cRemy, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d she cries.</p><p>I groan in pain and go get the letter from the pocket of my jeans on the chair. I have read it until my eyes can barely stay open. I have held it at night, in my fist, when I was black and depressed and kept telling myself that I was worth something to her. \u201cDid you mean what you wrote to me?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>I yank the letter open and point at the words I have clung to, like a sick man, words nobody has ever said to me before. Words I want to hear from her, feel from her:</p><p>I love you, Remy.</p><p>I want so much to hear it, it infuriates me, makes me crumple the paper again and look at her, burning with need, anger, and despair. Did she mean it? She stares at me and suddenly she begins to nod, and my body tightens with want to hear it. My senses scream. My heart hurts.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the reason you left after the fight?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes well with tears, and they tear at me, but I can\u2019t stop pushing, I need to know with every part of me, I\u2019m so fucking hurt.</p><p>\u201cIs it, Brooke? Why you left? Or because you\u2019re ready to quit on me? I thought you had more mettle, Little Firecracker, I really did.\u201d</p><p>I scan her features, one by one, and suddenly feel her little finger connecting with a scar on my eyebrow, arrowing pure heat and emotion to my core.</p><p>She bursts out saying, \u201cI love you. I love you.\u201d My breath seizes as she painfully rushes the words out. \u201cMore than I\u2019ve ever thought it possible to love any other human being. I left because you broke my heart, again and again that night, with every one of your bones. I left because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes. I love you making my breath rattle, leaving me shaken, tormented.</p><p>She drops her hand and sounds pained and afflicted. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever let anyone hurt you deliberately again. Ever. Not even for me, Remy. Never. You are worth. Too. Much! Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I grab her face between my open palms, and I feel the shudder that runs through her body as she absorbs my touch. I look into her eyes and I am not ashamed. I am proud. I am letting her know, quietly, before I tell her in words, what she means to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it a thousand times for you.\u201d I scent her, and I want to growl when I hear her scenting me. \u201cA thousand. A million. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m humiliated. I don\u2019t care about anything. All I knew was you were willing to kiss that motherfucker\u2019s ink for your sister, and I had to give her back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Remy, you didn\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And I will. And I\u2019d do it all over again. I\u2019m only sorry that only Pete could know. He stayed in a hotel room with her and one of Benny\u2019s thugs, then helped transfer her when I delivered the championship. I just couldn\u2019t let you stop me, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t even look at me. . . .\u201d She squeezes her pretty eyes shut. \u201cThat was as painful as the rest of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d looked at you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go through with it.\u201d</p><p>She covers her face, and I can see her suffering. I can feel it inside me.</p><p>I release her, a painful sound wrenching out of me.</p><p>I stand and pace, simmering with frustration and helplessness. \u201cI knew this would happen.\u201d My scowl bites into my face and my fucking helplessness eats at me. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to touch you. I knew I\u2019d go crazy if I touched you, and now, it tears me open to ask you to be with me when I know I\u2019m just going to do something to fucking hurt you again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes, you probably are, you idiot! And it\u2019s going to be a damned skydive for me, and I\u2019m going to hang on tight and just jump with you because that\u2019s what you do to me. I\u2019m crazy about you. My life now sucks without you. I\u2019m not here for the job. Although I love it, but it\u2019s you I want. It\u2019s you I came for that first night. It\u2019s always been about you. I want to be with you, but I won\u2019t do it only on my side. I want you to love me back, Remy. You\u2019ve never told me how you feel about me!\u201d</p><p>I look at her questioningly, surprised at first, and then dead serious. \u201cBrooke, you honestly don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>She stares, and I kneel before her and hold her face between my hands.</p><p>\u201cJesus, when I saw you that first night in Seattle, I felt like I\u2019d just gotten plugged into a socket. I got high just with the way you smiled at me, Brooke. The way you looked at me with an expression of pain and awe drove me crazy. You turned away to leave, and you wore these really nice pants. Your butt was just up there as you walked away, all perky and round. And I just wanted to finish the damn fight so I could go after you. The former fight I swear I just fought for you to watch me. So you\u2019d see me. See that I\u2019m strong and could fight for you, protect you. I daydreamed of kissing you, of making love to you. I was planning it in my head even when I jumped out of that ring and went after you. When your friend gave me your number, I got to the hotel to find a roomful of girls, the kind Pete always has for me, and I couldn\u2019t look at any of them. I wanted to look into your eyes and make you smile at me.\u201d</p><p>I tell her how I googled her. How I immediately told Pete to send her these tickets. How I saw those videos on YouTube. How I decided to hire her.</p><p>She looks flabbergasted for a moment, her face going pale, her eyes going even wider.</p><p>\u201cI tried taking it easy with you. I wanted to know you, and for you to know me, and every day I wanted you more, Brooke. So much. I couldn\u2019t touch you and risk messing it up until you knew about me. I wanted you to care for me. I wanted to see if you could understand me. . . . I tortured myself every night, thinking of you in your room, while I was in mine.</p><p>\u201cThe night we went to the club, and you danced with me, I just couldn\u2019t stop myself. I\u2019d been so wound up. And when you knocked down two guys for me, I went crazy protective. I wanted to tuck you into bed and go back and do some serious damage to all four of them. But you stayed with me, and I forgot about fighting, and all I wanted was to have my mouth all over you. I tried to control myself, but on the plane, you killed me with those songs about making love to me. I just had to have you. The thought of having you had me so damned high, I was already drugged with it, and by the end of that fight, I was manic and high on you before I could even get you into my bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd then you woke with me, and I saw that you\u2019d cuddled with me, Brooke. Soft and sweet. The next time I was lying alone in bed, I wanted to cut open my fucking veins wanting you next to me, so I went back for you. That was all that got me through the day, those days. Thinking of getting you in my bed and kissing you breathless. I kept looking through my playlist just trying to find one song that could tell you how you made me feel. Inside. I\u2019m not good at saying this, but I wanted you to know you were special to me, you\u2019re unlike any other woman in my life.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to make love to you and you don\u2019t know how many times I almost broke down. When I showered you, I swear to god, I was breaking inside. But I couldn\u2019t do it, not without telling you there\u2019s something deeply wrong with me, and I\u2019m such a coward, Brooke. I couldn\u2019t even find the courage to say the word \u2018bipolar\u2019 to you. So, I prolonged my time with you. Because I\u2019m selfish, and I wanted you to care before you knew. Thinking it would make a difference and you\u2019d stay. Not even my own folks could do me long term. But something about you made me think you\u2019d know me, understand me on a level no one else does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cI was right, Brooke,\u201d I add, looking firmly into her eyes. \u201cWhen I told you about me, you still wanted me. And I\u2019ve been in love with you for I don\u2019t know how long. Ever since you tried to knock me down in the ring, and I ended up putting your little feet against my stomach to warm them. Jesus, when I saw that photograph of you and Scorpion, I wanted to kill him. I wanted to give you whatever it was that had made you go to that fucking asshole and kiss his fucking face! I wanted to give that to you, so you would kiss mine instead.\u201d</p> <p>I explain to her what went down in the hotel room with Scorpion, her eyes going soft and teary as she listens to me tell her everything, and that it\u2019s the first time I did something right when I was black.</p><p>I edge closer and nuzzle her temple, and she shudders against me when I whisper near her ear, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you, but it had to happen like this. When I told you I wouldn\u2019t let you leave me the night I made love to you, I meant it. I want you, Brooke, for me. I can hurt you, I can do stupid shit, but I . . .\u201d I draw back to look at her. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking in love with you I don\u2019t even know what to do with myself anymore.\u201d</p><p>She nods and wipes her tears, and I can see the way she\u2019s struggling with her feelings like I am.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to leave me again,\u201d I whisper, cupping her jaw. \u201cYou can\u2019t, Brooke, you can\u2019t leave so easy.\u201d</p><p>I stroke another hand down her hair, and she curls into it, like a kitten seeking my petting.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve claimed me, Little Firecracker. You kicked a pair of two-hundred-pound men\u2019s asses. I will never get over that. You kicked my whores out. Pete told me. You staked your claim on me, even before you realized I\u2019d staked mine already.\u201d I grab her hair in one fist and pull her close. \u201cI\u2019m yours now, and you can\u2019t ditch me like you just did. Even if I screw this up, I\u2019ll still be your screwup.\u201d</p><p>She presses her body to mine and hooks her slim arms around my neck, her shirt getting soaked with my sweat. \u201cNot my screwup. My Real.\u201d</p><p>I groan and lick her cheek, and she sinks into my arms as I take my mouth lower. I lick her jaw, her chin, and then her lips. Holy god, I think I won\u2019t ever lift my head from these soft, pink, edible lips. I feel her shudder against my diaphragm, and I slip my arms around her back and draw her closer. I lick my way into her mouth, probing her entry, until she opens and gasps and lets me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking leave me ever again,\u201d I murmur, my tongue tracing her lips, top and bottom, then delving deep inside as I open my hands on her ass and give it a squeeze.</p><p>She makes me high, rubbing her nipples on my chest, making me throb in every part of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got about a thousand songs in a new playlist that says \u2018Brooke\u2019\u2014all about me missing you, loving you, hating and adoring you,\u201d I rasp as I reach under her dress to pull at her panties.</p> <p>I love that she wore a dress, that she looks sexy, female. Mine.</p><p>I want to peel it off with my fucking teeth and try not to get rough as I pull her panties off her legs as she confesses, \u201cI\u2019ve got some too, I want to spend all day playing them to you.\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019ve got her naked, I haul her back on my lap, and she\u2019s got me in tangles, my cock pulsing against her through my shorts.</p><p>She straddles me and rubs my hard-on, and she\u2019s trembling with need. \u201cI love you,\u201d she breathes, and I take it from there.</p><p>HOURS LATER, SHE\u2019S spent in my bed.</p><p>Brooke Sexy-as-Fuck Dumas.</p><p>I could lie here with her all night.</p><p>Her shiny mahogany hair is spread all over my chest and falling down my right shoulder.</p> <p>Her warm breath coasts over my pecs while her long, slim, little fingers are sweetly delineating the squares of my abs.</p><p>My hands run up and down her back.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to touch, where to lick, bite, suck, I just want to do it all at once.</p><p>I take a loose strand of hair to rub it between two fingers, then I bend my head and inhale. My head buzzes as her scent fills my lungs. I can never get over the way that feminine scent gets into my gut, tangles me like a knot. It\u2019s a sweet fragrance unique to her, and the first time I caught a whiff, I knew she was mine.</p><p>All mine.</p><p>I\u2019m not letting anyone take her.</p><p>I\u2019m not letting her go.</p><p>I\u2019m her Real.</p><p>She\u2019s Mine.</p><p>I can barely fit inside my skin. I feel like a fucking king who\u2019s just inherited a kingdom named Brooke Little Firecracker Dumas.</p><p>I open a hand to cup the back of her head and place a kiss on her forehead. She moans softly and turns her head to kiss my chest. I peer down at her pretty face and trace my thumb along her lower lip. I\u2019m wild about this mouth. The things it says to me. The things it does to me. The way it feels, the way it tastes, the way it looks.</p><p>I drag my lips along her forehead, the shell of her ear, inhaling her and feeling every inch of her small, lean body against mine. She\u2019s sweaty and sticky with me and she\u2019s warm as a little sun. I nuzzle her earlobe and then I lick her, pushing my tongue gently into the crevice.</p><p>I feel her shudder as I pet my other hand down her head and then down her smooth back while I have my way with her ear, slowly letting my tongue make love to it, and I can\u2019t get enough.</p><p>I pull her over me and swipe her hair to the side, then I bury my face in her neck so her nose is tucked into my throat and I\u2019m tucked in hers. \u201cBrooke Dumas,\u201d I murmur huskily into her ear. \u201cI love you, my little firecracker.\u201d</p><p>She sighs into my neck and slides her hands into my hair and sifts her fingers through my scalp. \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d she says. She eases back and looks at me, her eyes shining in the darkness.</p><p>She meets my gaze with a smile, and I know I\u2019m smiling back at her, and she\u2019s naked like I like her and suddenly my eyes rake her up and down. I\u2019ve been starved for the sight of her, and now I\u2019m going to look my fill until my eyes burst. Her breasts, her abs, her toned little arms, her slim throat, her lovely chin, her high cheekbones, her smart, proud little forehead.</p><p>\u201cRemy . . .\u201d she whispers.</p><p>She reaches out with one hand, and she starts caressing my jaw so tenderly it\u2019s like she can\u2019t believe she\u2019s in my arms.</p><p>I cup her little face in my big hand and stroke my thumb across her lips because I can\u2019t believe it too.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d I sit up and cup the back of her head and pull her to me. I bury her face in my neck and squeeze her closer. She straddles me and wraps her arms around my neck. She kisses my neck and I rub my hands all over her body.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me again,\u201d I growl softly into her hair, and she kisses the tendons of my neck, then grasps my jaw in her small hands and kisses my nose, my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019m going to say it until you\u2019re so sick and tired of hearing it, you\u2019ll kiss me to shut me up,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen.\u201d I clutch her tight and pull her face back. \u201cI\u2019ll kiss you anyway.\u201d</p><p>I buzz her lips and she licks me softly, like I lick her, and I growl and suckle her tongue. I love her so much. She\u2019s given me love in ways no one in my life ever has. I had never known someone could love me until she loved me. So alien it is to me, I wasn\u2019t even sure why she spent nights stroking my head and I\u2019d wake up to find her sleepy but still running her little hands all over me. I know how she defends me when I can\u2019t. I know how strong she is. As strong as I need her to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rain kisses all over you,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I growl softly and nod. When she speaks, I listen because her words are my sweetest music. When she tells me her stories, about her friends. Her words have always done stuff to me\u2014and her touch . . .</p><p>The knots inside me tighten as she drags her teeth up my jaw, up to my temple, and I squeeze my eyes shut and inhale heavily through my nostrils while my body responds fiercely to her caresses.</p><p>My muscles tense; my heart picks up, and I want to sink inside her and feel her warmth and her love, her understanding and her acceptance. Making love to her makes me feel whole and perfect, like I was made to provide and protect and mate with this woman. My woman.</p><p>She just came back to me.</p><p>I\u2019ve been hurting like a motherfucker for over a month, wanting nothing but my Brooke.</p><p>I want her to know that she\u2019s mine. That I\u2019m going to protect her and that I\u2019m going to be there for her. That I love her. That it doesn\u2019t matter to me anything except she\u2019s here and she\u2019s not leaving me again because I won\u2019t allow it. Not a single part of me will allow it.</p><p>No. I\u2019m the one who wants to feel that she\u2019s mine.</p><p>That she\u2019ll never leave me.</p><p>That she will love me and touch my face and my hair in the way she touches me and everything inside me goes still and focuses on that single tender touch, the point of contact of my body with hers.</p><p>I rub my thumb over her tears and lick them one by one as they keep coming, my brain shooting a thousand words in my head. Female. Beautiful. Mine. I want to say it all but instead I don\u2019t say anything and roll her over and cover her. I tug on her earlobe, and her sobs have turned to whimpers as I ease inside her. She slides her arms up my chest and curls her fingers on my shoulders, and I grab her breasts and squeeze them gently like she likes, then I kiss each tip with only my lips.</p><p>She arches her spine and mews when I add my teeth on the tips, and a shudder rocks her body when I swipe the little, hard points with my tongue.</p><p>She twists her neck aside when I twirl my tongue up her skin, and she opens her throat to me. I bite close to her pulse point, and she gasps and grabs my hair to lock me in place. She moves her body under mine, keeping my face to her neck. My every muscle is coiled for release. My body is used to pain, I\u2019ve trained it to embrace it, but this is soul deep and I hurt with it.</p><p>I lick the spot on her neck where I just bit, and she claws her nails along the bunched up muscles on my back. \u201cRemington . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A desperate plea is in her voice.

A bubbling sound leaves her and she tightens her hold on my head. I smooth my tongue out to caress the spot in case it stings, and then I take it up again, sucking so it leaves a mark, so that she will feel it, feel me on her skin tomorrow. She shudders. I delve my hand to rub her beautiful little clit as I mark her.</p><p>I\u2019m going to mark her in every way I can.

Not for a moment had I stopped squirming. I was bleeding from the binds they\u2019d used to strap me in various places. I don\u2019t remember that directly. But I do remember waking up from a hypnosis session to be told exactly what I described, and what I said. Did it matter? No. Do I wonder about it? No. It\u2019s as inconsequential as a dream.</p> <p>Her family is here. Her friends.</p><p>A cross.

He grabs it and sticks it in his mouth. And my heart starts whacking when I see the closed doors behind them.</p><p>After all we\u2019ve been through, my wife is finally here to marry me.</p><p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m going to get sentimental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut it,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>Murmurs surround us as the choir sets up.

She\u2019d frowned as we stepped out of the shower and used her towel to dry her hair first, \u201cNow that I think about it, it\u2019s the only time in our lives we\u2019ll hear that song. I\u2019m only ever marrying you.\u201d</p><p>I dragged my towel over my chest, then I hooked it around her waist, using it to pull her against me. \u201cWhat do you want? Tell me what you want so I can give it to you?\u201d</p><p>She flattened her breasts to my diaphragm as I spread the towel to engulf us both. \u201cI want a tiny little church where it\u2019s almost just us,\u201d she whispered, kissing my Adam\u2019s apple and then reaching up to caress my dimples. \u201cAnd I want the march, the white dress, white roses, and you. Every second after our vows, I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>I seized her chin and tipped her head back farther, my lips curling. \u201cThen your wish,\u201d I whispered, kissing her lips, \u201cis mine to grant.\u201d</p><p>PAST</p><p>PHOENIX</p><p>We\u2019re hopping from location to location for the new season, and while Pete and I check us into our Phoenix hotel, something makes my hackles rise. I turn around to spot Brooke across the lobby, heatedly arguing with Riley, who\u2019s heatedly arguing back.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I reach them in five steps and immediately grab Riley by the collar. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d I demand.</p><p>Scowling, he pulls free and signals at Brooke, who\u2019s scowling back at him. \u201cI was trying to explain to Brooke, here, that things weren\u2019t as happy when she was away.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what Riley\u2019s arguing about, but I do know this: I don\u2019t like the look on Brooke\u2019s face. I don\u2019t like the way her lips look downturned at the corners, and I let the asshole know it. \u201cIt\u2019s done with. You got that?\u201d I angrily push my finger into his sternum until he stumbles back. \u201cYou got that?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that,\u201d he grumbles.</p><p>Good. I curl my fingers around the back of Brooke\u2019s neck and I guide her into the elevator and then into our suite.</p><p>We head inside and she goes straight to the window, and I survey her round little ass. That ass is mine. \u201cYou like the room, little firecracker?\u201d I wrap her in my arms I press into her body. \u201cWant to hit the running trail when it gets dark?\u201d</p><p>I play with her neck with my lips, when she turns around.</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck other women?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me with a new somber gleam in her eyes, and I stare back like a fucking idiot, not understanding what the fuck is going on.</p><p>\u201cI realize I have no right to ask you.\u201d She surveys me, and I survey her. \u201cWe broke up, right? It was the end of it. But . . . did you?\u201d</p><p>It dawns on me that she\u2019s jealous.</p><p>My little firecracker. Jealous.</p><p>Of me.</p><p>\u201cIt matters to you?\u201d I ask her, smirking as my chest crams with all the shit only she makes me feel. \u201cIf I slept with anyone?\u201d</p><p>She grabs a couch pillow and hurtles it into my chest, eyes flashing. \u201cWhat do you think, you fucking jerk?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the pillow, I toss it aside, smiling in amusement. \u201cTell me how much it matters,\u201d I croon, dodging another pillow and loving her cheeks this pink and pretty.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d she screams.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I demand. She\u2019s backing away, but I\u2019m coming right after her. \u201cYou left me, little firecracker. You left me with a sweet letter telling me, very nicely, to go fuck myself and to have a nice life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I left you with a letter that told you I loved you! Something you hadn\u2019t told me until I came back to you and begged you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking cute like this. Come here.\u201d I pull her into my arms but she struggles to pull free.</p><p>\u201cRemington. You\u2019re laughing at me!\u201d she cries wretchedly.</p><p>\u201cI said come here,\u201d I say, gathering her closer, and I\u2019m fucking dying to kiss her senseless.</p><p>\u201cRemy, tell me! Please tell me, what did you do?\u201d she jealously begs, squirming to get free as she looks up at me. I swear I could look into her eyes all day, look into her face all day.</p><p>Using my body to flatten her against the wall, I place my forehead against hers and look into her eyes. \u201cI like that you\u2019re jealous. Is it because you love me? Do you feel proprietary of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d she angrily breathes, squirming between me and the wall.</p><p>God, she\u2019s so lovely. I cup her cheek and softly tell her, \u201cI do. I feel completely proprietary of you. You\u2019re mine. I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said no to me,\u201d she angrily grits out, her eyes burning with fury. \u201cFor months and months. I was dying for you. I was going crazy. I . . . came . . . like a fucking idiot! On your fucking leg! You withheld yourself from me until I was . . . dying a little inside with wanting you. You\u2019ve got more willpower than Zeus! But the first women they bring to your door . . . the moment I\u2019m gone, the first whores they happened to bring you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done if you were here? Stopped it?\u201d My dare comes out as a whisper, and I\u2019m struggling not to remember how I felt when I realized she fucking LEFT ME!</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cBut where were you?\u201d I demand, my blood starting to simmer.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you, Brooke?\u201d I demand. I curl my hand around her throat and caress the pulse point with my thumb, searching her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was broken,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYou broke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You. Your letter. Broke me.\u201d Watching her, I trail my thumb along her throat and jaw, and then I watch as I trace her pink mouth, the only mouth I want. \u201cWhat does it matter if I had to kiss a thousand lips to forget these?\u201d</p><p>We hear a knock. I don\u2019t move.</p><p>My body is tight and ready to claim hers. She\u2019s my mate, and I want her to fucking tell me she\u2019s jealous because I\u2019m hers, and she\u2019s mine, and that\u2019s the end of it.</p><p>Then I want her to take me inside, I want to pound her hard and fill her with me.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t speak. My stubborn little minx doesn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Letting her cool down, I open the door, tip the bellman, and pull in the suitcases on my own as fast as I can, one of my arms shooting out to stop her when she walks past me. \u201cCome here, settle down now,\u201d I command.</p><p>But she pushes my hand away, then steps out and says to the bellman, \u201cThank you. Would you send this duffel with that other suitcase to the other room?\u201d she says, pointing at her suitcase.</p><p>Nodding, the guy pushes the cart back toward the elevators.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She turns around and looks at me, breathing slowly, looking at me with wide, pained eyes. \u201cI want to sleep with Diane tonight. I don\u2019t feel so well and I\u2019d rather we talk about it when I . . . when I . . . am settled down.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>My laughter dies when she boards the elevator.</p><p>I stand there. My heart pounding for me to chase. But I\u2019m too disbelieving to move.</p><p>The elevator closes.</p><p>And yes.</p><p>My woman. Just fucking boarded. That shit elevator. And left me here!</p><p>I grab my suitcase and toss it across the room with a yell, then I slam the door behind me and go kick the shit out of it.</p><p>\u201cFUUCK!\u201d Then I kick the pillow that is still on the floor, clamp my jaw and call Pete so he can give me Diane\u2019s fucking room number.</p><p>When he answers, and I speak, I sound murderous. \u201cDiane\u2019s fucking room number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-whaaat? Shit, Rem, Riley told me about the argument . . . please just count to fucking a hundred before you do anything,\u201d Pete says.</p><p>\u201cThe room. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo\u2013four\u2013three\u2013eight.\u201d</p><p>I slam the phone down and silently does as he says and count to a hundred.</p><p>I\u2019ve got the phone in my hand by number 98, and by 99, I got my fucking finger on the numbers. I finally pound the keys, and when Diane\u2019s voice answers I very softly, and very angrily growl, \u201cI\u2019m going down there for Brooke, so you can either open the door for me, or I can break it down. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>I slam the phone and stop at the door, telling myself to breathe.</p><p>But I can barely pull the air into my lungs I\u2019m so agitated at the thought of not sleeping with her. I\u2019m agitated remembering she left me. She could leave me. Any. Fucking. Day. Again. Until I win this championship and make her marry me.</p><p>I\u2019m so ready to make her my wife, my body preps me as if for a physical fight, and I\u2019m ready to hunt and capture her. I squeeze my knuckles and focus on my breath as I head two floors down, and the instant I reach the door, Diane opens it.</p><p>Shit, but I think I wanted to break that fucking door!</p><p>\u201cDiane,\u201d I greet her, then I head straight for Brooke. She\u2019s curled in a fucking ball, crying on that bed, and all my anger and frustration arrows to stiffen my cock up instantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because more than jealous, more than possessive, she\u2019s hurt.</p><p>And my body seems to think the way to make it better is to turn those sobs into moans.</p><p>God, I need to fuck her and get fucking close to her. I need to kiss her and pet her.</p><p>I need her. In. My. Room. My Bed. And my body in her.</p> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d I quietly tell her, opening my hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d She wipes a tear.</p><p>Breathing through my nose, I try to stay calm, telling her, \u201cYou\u2019re mine and you need me, and I want you to please come the fuck upstairs with me.\u201d</p><p>She sniffles.</p><p>\u201cAll right, come here.\u201d Grabbing her by the hips, I swing her up in my arms. \u201cGood night, Diane.\u201d</p> <p>She kicks and struggles, but I clench my hold on her to still her, bending to whisper to her, \u201cKick and claw all you like. Scream. Hit me. Curse the fuck out of me. You won\u2019t sleep anywhere but with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silently angry as I head to our room, but I\u2019m fucking angrier that she had the fucking balls to try and leave me if only for half a moment. I don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re fighting about this. I was amused by her jealousy, but I\u2019m not amused anymore. I need to be inside her, and I need it now. One touch and she\u2019ll fucking know she\u2019s every woman to me.</p><p>Inside our room, I toss her on the bed and jerk off my T-shirt, then I reach out to get rid of her clothes. She flails and kicks at me, her face still streaked with tears as she edges back. \u201cYou asshole, don\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, listen to me.\u201d I trap her in my arms and hold her gaze with mine, my heart pounding as my hunter instincts kick in full gear in preparation to make her mine again. \u201cI am insane about you. I\u2019ve been in hell without you. In hell. Stop being ridiculous,\u201d I tell her, meaningfully squeezing her face. \u201cI love you. I love you. Come here.\u201d</p><p>I haul her onto my lap, and she quietly starts crying. Every soft sob rips me in two. I remember it all. I may not remember what I did when she was gone, but I remember the emptiness of her like a curse on me. Maybe I fucked up, but all I probably did was try to fill the void she left in me which nobody can ever fucking fill but her.</p><p>\u201cHow well did you think I\u2019d cope when you left?\u201d I ask her, hurting like a son of a bitch at the reminder. \u201cDid you think it would be easy on me? That I wouldn\u2019t feel alone? Betrayed? Fucking lied to? Used? Discarded? Worthless? Dead? Did you think there wouldn\u2019t be days where I loathed you more than I loved you for tearing me apart? Did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve left everything for you.\u201d She looks straight at me, hurt as if I did her bodily harm. \u201cSince I met you, all I wanted was to be yours. You said you were mine. That you were my . . . my . . . Real.\u201d</p><p>A pained groan leaves me as I squish her to me, quietly rasping, \u201cI\u2019m the realest fucking thing you\u2019re ever going to have.\u201d</p><p>She still looks up, and those hurt, tear-filled eyes of hers claw me like talons. \u201cIt should\u2019ve been me all those times,\u201d she says tearfully. \u201cIt should\u2019ve been just me, only me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t fucking tell me you love me and leave me. Don\u2019t fucking beg me to make you mine and then run the first chance I\u2019m not fucking looking. I couldn\u2019t even come catch you. Is that fair to me? Is it? I couldn\u2019t even get up on my own fucking legs and come stop you.\u201d</p><p>She sobs harder, and my chest fucking hurts for the both of us.</p><p>\u201cI woke up to read your letter instead of getting to see you. You were all I wanted to see. All. I wanted. To see,\u201d I quietly tell her.</p><p>Fuck. Maybe I wish I hadn\u2019t said that, but she hurts me and she doesn\u2019t know it. I\u2019m strong physically but she guts me. What she does guts me, and her pain\u2014caused by me\u2014guts me most of all.</p><p>As she cries herself to sleep, her sobs softening gradually until all that\u2019s left is a hiccup in her soft breaths, I breathe her hair and hold her tighter than ever. I never ever want her to leave. Not even for a night to sleep in Diane\u2019s suite. I don\u2019t remember what I did when she left me, I was so out of it. But it doesn\u2019t matter, nothing mattered but that she wasn\u2019t with me.</p> <p>When she\u2019s sound asleep, I start stripping her clothes, leaving her panties for last, pulling them down her leg and tossing everything aside. I stand up to strip myself too, then I get back in bed, naked.</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking hard my balls hurt, but Brooke shivers in her sleep and searches for my body heat, innocently rolling in her sleep to press closer to me. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m right here,\u201d I say and wrap my arms around her. I drag my nose along her nape, petting her during the night, scenting and licking her. \u201cI only love you. You\u2019re mine, and I\u2019m yours. Nobody will ever have me but you.\u201d</p><p>SHE\u2019S TANGLED IN bed with me two mornings later.</p><p>Yesterday morning, she was quiet and angry at me, but this morning I\u2019ve finally appeased her, and she\u2019s relaxed and in my arms. Her dark hair is spread behind her pillow and she\u2019s resting on her stomach, her face buried in my chest while I at last pull in a good breath.</p><p>Hell, I felt like such an unwanted piece of shit yesterday, every breath felt like I was pulling in water. I got punched last night at the fight so she would stop ignoring me and touch me.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t touch me and I couldn\u2019t fucking stand it.</p><p>She had no choice but to touch me after the fight.</p><p>She was worried about me, tending to my cut lip up to the point she realized I took the hits on purpose. Then she was all fire and anger, ordering me into the shower so she could rub me with her oils after. I like to let her think she can order me around. But not this time. I carried her into the shower with me and told her she would fucking love me if it killed us both. Jesus, I\u2019m so fucking greedy when it comes to her.</p><p>\u201cYou coming to the gym?\u201d I quietly ask, massaging her butt with the palm of my hand.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t stir. Pressing against her back and scenting the back of her ear, I nip her playfully, then tongue her ear, and my cock hardens instantly, and a quick glance at the clock tells me there\u2019s time for that. \u201cYou\u2019re the most fuckable thing I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of seeing, touching, and sucking the hell out of,\u201d I rasp, nuzzling her.</p><p>She sighs softly. I force myself to get up and brush my teeth, then I grab my clothes from the closet and ram my legs into my sweatpants. She\u2019s still asleep, and I\u2019m still hard, so I set my T-shirt aside, and go back to bed to wake her.</p><p>I pull the sheet down so the cold air makes her skin pebble and I can lick all those little cold bumps on her ass. I bite one cheek, then the other, sliding my hands between her legs to cup her pussy, growling softly when my cock starts pulsing, but when she doesn\u2019t squeal or so much as move, I frown and ease back to look at her.</p><p>Last night she was tired, and yet she still let me have her. She was languid as I fucked her, letting me turn her, suck her, finger and tongue her. She kept coming fast and hard for me every time, her eyes dewy and sleepy, watching me as I told her how good she felt, how good she smelled . . .</p><p>You\u2019re so hard for me, I love having you in me, she breathed, half-asleep.</p><p>I want to fucking live in you, I said, again and again, as I\u2019ve said before.</p><p>She sighed and came, and after our fight, I still couldn\u2019t have enough, so after relaxing for an hour or two, I woke her up, scented her, and fucked her, loving how wet she was.</p><p>She\u2019s sleeping so soundly now I can\u2019t wake her again. Running my eyes down her curves, I make love to every inch with my eyes, then I pull the sheets and cover her back up, leaning over as I brush her dark hair behind one ear.</p><p>I press my lips to her ear, \u201cDream of us.\u201d Then I pat her butt again and stand. I bounce in place a few seconds to bring the blood from my cock back to my limbs and brain, then I head out to the kitchen to find Diane already on breakfast.</p><p>Pete is already in the living room, dressed and with the car keys.</p><p>I grab a green bar and a protein shake, tell Diane to feed my girl, and then we\u2019re off.</p><p>We\u2019re not a block away when Pete\u2019s phone beeps. He answers, \u201cYeah,\u201d and starts listening, his smile vanishing and his face paling by the second. My instincts shift into overdrive. My heart starts kicking harder and deeper.</p><p>BROOKE.</p><p>BROOKE.</p><p>BROOKE.</p><p>Pete swerves the car around and tosses me the phone as he speeds back into the hotel driveway. Diane\u2019s voice screeches out of the receiver before I even place it on my ear, \u201cGet back here! Get back here please!\u201d she begs.</p><p>I see red.</p><p>Before the car screeches to a halt, I yank open the door and charge out and into the elevator, my reflexes lightning fast. Pete slides in behind me, and neither of us says a word as I press the floor button over and over as we head up.</p><p>\u201cREMINGTON!\u201d Diane screams from the door when I charge out the elevator with Pete running after me. I charge past Diane and slam the door wide open only to see Brooke motionless on the floor, a puddle of water surrounding her, and soft crying sounds trembling out of her.</p><p>And there are . . . scorpions! All over her! Lightning fast, I charge over, grabbing and crushing them in my hands one by one. Stingers sink into my palms, but there\u2019s no pain. All my senses are honed in on Brooke. The way she\u2019s crying, the way she\u2019s trembling, everything I see making me half mad. I toss the last scorpion aside and pull her like a man clinging to life into my arms, and she\u2019s shaking and whimpering while I struggle to breathe through my nose, my body trembling with the need to fight and protect her, my system overloaded with adrenaline as a rage unlike any other starts bubbling in my veins.</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d I passionately hiss as I wipe her tears, squeezing her to me. \u201cI got you. I got you.\u201d</p><p>If I lose her, it\u2019s over for me. I\u2019m done.</p><p>\u201cA woman just came and knocked! She said Remy had ordered the box for her!\u201d Diane cries out between sobs.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear the rest of what they\u2019re saying. I squeeze Brooke closer to my body and bend to her little ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d I angrily promise her. \u201cI swear to god, I\u2019m going to kill him so slowly.\u201d</p><p>Pete is whacking the scorpions with a frying pan, telling me something which runs in through one of my ears, and out the other.</p><p>I\u2019m too busy rubbing my hands up Brooke\u2019s arms and run my eyes up and down her body, inspecting her skin for marks. \u201cWhere did they bite you? Tell me exactly where, and I\u2019ll suck all the poison out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . e-everywhere . . .\u201d she says, looking helplessly up at me. God, I love her, I love her I love her and I\u2019m sucking every drop of poison out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t suck on these\u2014let me have a look at her,\u201d Pete says as he comes over.</p><p>She\u2019s trembling so hard, I fucking can\u2019t let go, so I shake my head and tighten my arms around her and rock her. \u201cI got you, little firecracker, I got you right here in my arms,\u201d I whisper fiercely. Brooke trustingly clings to me, and it guts me that I just left her, safe and warm in my bed.</p><p>Rage and impotence flood me.</p><p>\u201cRem, let me see her,\u201d Pete insists. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moans, clutching me. \u201cDon\u2019t let go, don\u2019t let go,\u201d she continues to moan.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I promise in her ear, my heart crashing fiercely into my ribs.

Tended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awright,\u201d she says as she blinks dazedly at me, \u201cI\u2019m awright, Wemy. . . .\u201d</p><p>My body temperature plummets. I look at her, and she\u2019s not only talking in a way that makes me want to kill something, but she\u2019s staring at my fucking ear like it\u2019s one of my eyes! \u201cFUUUUUCK ME!\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors roll open, and Riley steps off. \u201cAll right, what\u2019s going on? Coach is waiting at the gym, Rem. . . .\u201d He sees Brooke in my arms, and his eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cLive scorpions,\u201d Pete informs. \u201cVenomous, but fortunately not deadly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t bweathe,\u201d Brooke says, looking at my ear again, as if waiting for my ear to explain this shit to her.</p><p>I can\u2019t fucking see anymore, my vision is blurred from my rage and impotence and I want to kill. Kill. KILL.</p><p>\u201cThe poison spreads through the nervous system, but it doesn\u2019t enter the bloodstream. Try to stay calm, Brooke. These bark scorpions are nasty suckers. Can you feel your legs?\u201d Pete asks.</p><p>She shakes her head as she wheezes out air, and Pete leans over to inspect the damage. \u201cLet me see that. . . .\u201d I extend out her arm so that he looks at the stings, and I look directly into Pete\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d I tell Pete.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, B,\u201d Pete tells her, watching me warily and staring into my eyes with growing alarm as he adds, \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience once. Awful, but you really don\u2019t die from a North American scorpion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a note! I turned the box over and there\u2019s a note!\u201d Diane cries.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Pete walks back to the suite\u2019s open door, grabs the note, and automatically reads. \u201c \u2018You\u2019ve kissed me. Now you\u2019ve been kissed back by the Scorpion. How does it feel to have my venom in you?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>My testosterone spikes. My heart jerks. My body tightens. Adrenaline shoots through my body and my mind snaps. My control, my fucking sanity. Snap! I\u2019m going to kill Scorpion, and I want to dismember him before I do. Spreading his teeth across the floor. Pulling his brain out of his fucking head.</p> <p>I\u2019m fully engaged.</p><p>I\u2019m going to dismember and get rid of the fucking threat. NOW!</p><p>Brooke moans softly, and I look down at her, pale, scared, and trembling, and my murderous determination grows tenfold at the thought of anyone, anyone, messing with my girl!</p><p>\u201cPete, I saw his goons downstairs in the lobby. I think he\u2019s here at the hotel,\u201d Riley says.</p><p>\u201cThe motherfucker is probably downstairs waiting for Remington,\u201d Pete murmurs, rubbing a hand across his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, he has it coming!\u201d I thunder. \u201cHe\u2019s already dead!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to make it slow. And painful. And I\u2019m going to shove a burning firecracker up his fucking ass AND WATCH HIM EXPLODE!</p><p>Brooke. She\u2019s trembling. She\u2019s holding onto me, expecting me to protect her. He got to her in my fucking hotel suite! I will never fail to protect her again. Nothing will ever hurt her again. I am Remington Tate\u2014Riptide\u2014and I am HER MAN, HER PROTECTOR, and I am going to take care of this RIGHT. NOW.</p><p>Blood boiling, I\u2019m touching the back of her head, and I look at her face, her glazed eyes and the tears on her skin, and I\u2019ve never been more ready to commit murder, but I manage to speak softly when I tell her, \u201cI need to do something right now. I love you. I fucking love you to pieces, and I\u2019m going to come back and put you back together again, all right?\u201d</p><p>She nods and trembles, and my gut is being cut on the inside, because I don\u2019t want to leave her either, goddammit.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she shaking like this, goddammit?\u201d I ask Pete as I carry her back to the room.</p><p>He looks at me apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s the nervous system being affected. She sustained several stings, so it\u2019ll be painful. While the EMT is on his way, let\u2019s give her some Tylenol.\u201d</p><p>Tylenol, yes. Tylenol and murder. My body is so wired and I\u2019m single-minded. I feel like a robot who\u2019s just been programmed to kill, and the fact that he hurt my little firecracker was the trigger button.</p><p>Heart pounding, muscles tightening, system overworking, I carry her back to the room and set her on the sofa, inhaling the top of her head. Every minute that motherfucker enjoys life while Brooke has trouble breathing is penance. Every fucking bite I see on her skin screams at me to go hurt whoever hurt her.</p><p>That\u2019s right. I\u2019m Death. I am fucking Death and I\u2019m coming for him now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go crush him now,\u201d I tell her. With all the love I feel for her, I\u2019m doing it.</p><p>I\u2019m charging off to the elevator and hear Pete yell after me. \u201cDamn it, he\u2019s full speed ahead, Ri, go after him before he sees Scorpion or any of his goons\u2014 Diane! Get some cold compresses and wait for the EMT. We need to go get that man!\u201d</p><p>Ha. They\u2019re not fucking stopping me. I head for the stairs so they won\u2019t find me in the elevator and run down several flights.</p><p>When I shove open the exit door into the lobby, I see them immediately. He\u2019s right there. Scorpion. Two goons. He\u2019s looking at me. I look at him and curl my fists. \u201cYou\u2019re dead, asshole.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cYour crowd is waiting,\u201d he says.</p><p>The elevators to my right ping.</p><p>Riley steps off, and he sees me.</p><p>\u201cRem,\u201d he says cautiously, holding the elevator door open as he spots Scorpion and his crew. \u201cRem, I can\u2019t let you do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me break you, brother,\u201d I warn him, and that\u2019s when I feel a prick behind me.</p><p>The darkness pulls me, but I\u2019m not going down. I\u2019m not going to go down until Scorpion bleeds to death and Brooke is safe in my arms.</p><p>\u201cDude, you weigh a fucking ton!\u201d Riley adjusts me as he and Pete start trying to get me up the stairs. \u201cGood job, Pete, those assholes didn\u2019t even see you behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I growl.</p><p>God, fuck me. Fuck Pete. Fuck Riley. Fuck Scorpion I\u2019m going to kill that motherfucker on the ring! I hope it\u2019s a submission fight and he\u2019s so fucking proud he won\u2019t submit and I\u2019ll just BREAK. HIS. FINGERS. THEN HIS ELBOWS. HIS FIBULA. TIBIA. HIS SKULL. THEN HIS NECK.</p><p>The guys are panting, floor by floor, and they both keep telling me to hang on while I keep telling them to take me to Brooke.</p><p>\u201cHang on, buddy,\u201d Pete says breathlessly as he helps Riley bring me back to the room.</p><p>\u201cNeed to see Brooke,\u201d I insist.</p><p>They get me on the bed and I hear Pete telling Riley to \u201cGet the other side\u201d and ask me what the hell he\u2019s going to do with me.</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d I angrily tell them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming, dude!\u201d Pete says, laughing at my stubbornness.</p><p>They prop a pillow up behind me and I see her. Diane is helping her to bed, and I look worriedly at her.</p><p>My girl. God my girl hurt because of me.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I rasp out.</p><p>She smiles softly at me as she eases into bed and pulls the cover over us both, sliding her fingers into my hair.</p><p>\u201cMore than okay,\u201d she says, her eyes bright with love and understanding. All the tension in my body leaves me when she speaks to me. I was fighting not to succumb to the sedative, but her voice makes me unwind, and I succumb to her.</p><p>BROOKE HASN\u2019T RECOVERED from the stings, and I\u2019m still black as fucking midnight.</p><p>She\u2019s been sleeping too much, and she spent the flight to Las Vegas sequestered in the toilet. The word pregnant has been popping out of Diane\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Pregnant.</p><p>Eight letters, one word that makes my chest swell, my cock hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pregnant!\u201d Brooke\u2019s been telling me.</p><p>She keeps denying it, but I swear to god I can almost smell it on her. I smell it on her and it makes me even harder.</p><p>While she takes a home pregnancy test, I\u2019ve run around a worn path on the hotel carpet, but the urge to fuck is still acute. Now I\u2019m shadow boxing between the bed and the seating area, trying to get rid of all this extra energy and pull the blood out of my cock. Pump, swing, pump. Holy shit, she could be pregnant. My balls draw tight at the thought and my cock jerks again. God, I hope she\u2019s pregnant. Now. I fucking pray she\u2019s pregnant. Sensing her all of a sudden, I turn around, and she\u2019s watching me with a lost, thoughtful look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou check yet?\u201d I ask impatiently.</p><p>She jerks at my voice and looks at me, looking thoughtful and delectable. Once again, my cock goes up.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d</p><p>She gnaws on the inside of her cheek and frowns, her expression uncertain.</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not pee on a stick, baby?\u201d I prod.</p><p>\u201cI did! I told you I did!\u201d She goes back into the bathroom and comes out with a white stick. She looks at it, and I\u2019m so restless, and so primed to mate, I continue pumping the air.</p><p>I swear if she\u2019s not pregnant, we\u2019ll remedy that soon. I\u2019ll keep fucking and taking and claiming her until she is. I want to be the father of her children. I want her to be mine. Every breath, every sigh, every moan of hers, mine mine mine. Her body mine, to have my children, to have me inside her. Mine to protect, to pet, to kiss, every inch mine to run my tongue over.</p><p>Feeling hot and hungry for her, I watch as she studies the test result, and I want it so bad, I\u2019m running out of patience. \u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cIt says . . .\u201d She stares down at the stick, then she sets it aside, and starts walking over to me, and she looks fucking adorable, and womanly, and vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cRemington, don\u2019t forget this,\u201d she whispers, framing my face in her hands and looking into my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re black right now, and I don\u2019t want you to forget what I\u2019m going to tell you. I need all of you here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I frame back her face in mine, looking deeply into her eyes. \u201cI got you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, please do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.

If you are . . .\u201d</p><p>She runs over to get the test, then she returns and extends it out. \u201cTwo lines means, supposedly, that I am.\u201d</p><p>My eyes remain on hers for a moment. Does she want to be? Fuck, she better want to be. She better be.</p> <p>I stare at the screen at the end of the stick and immediately see the double lines.</p><p>I frown because I need to be sure, but already, my insides are buzzing with pride.</p><p>I still see two lines.</p><p>More buzzing in my body, buzzing in my skin. I think I just grew ten sizes wide and high.</p><p>I lift my gaze to her, and she looks uncertain, as if she doesn\u2019t know whether to be worried or happy. \u201cCome here.\u201d Unable to hold back my smile, I pick her up and lift her into the air, smacking a kiss on her abs, then I toss her down on the bed. She squeals and bursts out laughing as I fall on her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy man! You\u2019re the only man I know who throws his pregnant girlfriend onto a bed!\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only man,\u201d I correct her, \u201cas far as I know. There\u2019s only one man in your world, and it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but don\u2019t tell my dad I agreed so easily . . .\u201d she whispers, rubbing my shoulders, gold eyes shining on me. I want this baby to have those eyes. That perfect smile.</p><p>\u201cBrooke Dumas pregnant with my baby,\u201d I tell her. In case she didn\u2019t see the fucking test, now she fucking knows she\u2019s pregnant by me.</p><p>She grins happily, and that pure little grin feels like a kiss all along my pulsing cock. \u201cMy head is reeling. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>I drop my head and trail my tongue in to mate with hers, then I drag the back of one finger across her cheek. \u201cMake it look like you,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who gave this to me,\u201d she counters.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re giving this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019re both such giving souls.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, and I laugh with her and roll to my side, gathering her in my arms so I can kiss her all over. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now, from the top of your pretty dark head to the soles of your little feet.\u201d I caress her face and kiss her eyelids, and I\u2019m so fucking delighted, I swear things are actually moving in my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about leaving me again or I\u2019ll come after you and so help me god, I\u2019m going to tie you to where I am, and where I sleep, and where I eat. Do you hear me, Brooke Dumas?\u201d</p><p>She nods breathlessly. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single part of me that doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>She seizes my hand and spreads it over the curve of her breast, right over her heart.</p><p>I clench her breast possessively so she remembers its mine, and I bend my head and kiss her. \u201cI\u2019m so crazy about you,\u201d I rasp, and I drag my hand down her lovely curves and pet her.</p><p>PRESENT</p> <p>SEATTLE</p><p>Gah!\u201d</p><p>The only sound in the silent church comes from one of the front rows, and it is followed by soft laughter nearby.</p><p>\u201cRem, that boy is priceless. He already feels like he\u2019s the shit and he\u2019s not even one,\u201d Pete murmurs behind me.</p><p>I glance at my son and he\u2019s slapping Josephine now, saying, \u201cGah!\u201d every time he hits her. Brooke says he\u2019ll be just like me, but I hope he\u2019ll be better than me.</p><p>The doors of the church swing open, and I straighten and stand in place, like I\u2019m supposed to, the anticipation slowly gnawing at me. I rub my thumb along my ring when a figure in white steps forward\u2014and my lungs empty in a whoosh. Fuck me, look at her. Only Brooke does this to me. The noise inside me stills and I feel whole and content, at peace, the instant my eyes lock on hers. And she\u2019s so fucking beautiful in that dress my collar suddenly chokes me.</p><p>Music starts playing. My bride\u2019s music.</p><p>When she starts walking toward me, I feel like every step makes me grow inside my suit the way only she can make me, and I\u2019m about ten sizes too large now and burning beneath the fabric. She didn\u2019t hide her face behind a veil. Every step, I see her smile. Her huge, wide, I-fucking-love-you-Remington-Tate smile.</p><p>This is my woman pledging her life to me.</p><p>This is me, pledging my life to her.</p><p>My eyes run over her face, and it\u2019s the same face I look for every morning in my bed, and every moment I\u2019m in the ring, and every second in between. She\u2019s that girl, with the marshmallow mouth that looks soft and inviting, and those eyes, gold as a lioness\u2019s, and yet she tells me she\u2019s no longer a girl. She\u2019s a woman now. A mother. A wife. My wife.</p><p>The dress covers her completely, tight around her top and spreading wide at the skirt. She looks so fucking beautiful I want to mate her, take her, right now, slammed by thoughts of grabbing her into my arms, ripping off the dress\u2019s buttons and her panties, then spreading her open so I can claim my wife, every sigh of hers, every inch of skin.</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking ready for this, I step off the platform to receive her a couple of steps earlier and I lock gazes with her father when I approach. He\u2019s unsmiling, his eyes wet, but there\u2019s no antagonism in his stare. \u201cShe\u2019s all yours,\u201d he tells me thickly.</p><p>I\u2019ve already slipped my hand to her small one when I nod and murmur, \u201cThank you,\u201d then I bring her up with me to the altar. She stands trembling in excitement at my side, and I duck my head and lean over, brushing my nose against hers so she tips her head back to look at me. Our stares hold.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I ask when we hear the priest begin the ceremony.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony . . .\u201d</p><p>PAST</p><p>BAD NEWS</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s me.</p><p>If there\u2019s something about me that repels the good. And the pure. Or if I\u2019m just not meant to have a family.</p><p>Brooke is having trouble keeping our baby, and now we\u2019re flying in silence to Seattle.</p><p>I carried her to the plane; no Pete, no Riley, no Coach, no Diane flying with us. I want her all for me. All for fucking me.</p><p>I can\u2019t even talk.</p><p>I can\u2019t even fucking think.</p><p>My girl. Our baby.</p><p>Breathing slowly, I sit on the bench on the back of the plane and stare up at the ceiling, breathing in and out as I stroke my fingers down her soft hair, her head propped on my lap as she lies down the length of the bench. She\u2019s so sad and quiet I can barely take it.</p><p>The doctors don\u2019t want her traveling with me.</p><p>Brooke thought it so ludicrous, she laughed when the last one left our hotel suite, then she looked at me, not laughing anymore. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously be thinking of sending me back? Right? Remington, I\u2019ll lie down. I won\u2019t fucking move. This is your son. He\u2019s going to hang in there! He will. I don\u2019t see how being sent away will stress me any less. I don\u2019t want to go home. I\u2019ll stay in bed all day, just don\u2019t take me back!\u201d</p><p>My god, I felt like someone was whacking my chest with an axe, especially when I slowly spoke to Pete, who was quietly standing nearby, and I watched her face crumple when I told him, \u201cGet the plane ready.\u201d</p><p>She cried all night, and all I could do was hold her. \u201cYou can\u2019t protect me from everything,\u201d she whispered, sniffing.</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d</p><p>Now we\u2019re flying in silence, heading for Seattle.</p><p>Where I won\u2019t touch her, smell her, or see her.</p><p>Bending down to my lap, I kiss the top of her ear, her earlobe, the center of her ear, and there, I whisper that I\u2019m going to miss her, that I\u2019m going to need her to be good, to take care of herself, that I fucking need her.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t want to talk. She\u2019s sad and I don\u2019t even know how to make it better. She\u2019s my woman and how do I make her smile again? How do I protect her from the child I gave her?</p><p>Quietly, I pull out the extension of my credit card I just got her. \u201cUse it,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>She stares at it in stubborn silence, but she doesn\u2019t take it.</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d I warn, placing the card into her palm. \u201cI want to see charges. Daily.\u201d</p><p>She looks unimpressed by the fact that I want her to spend whatever she fucking wants, and put it on me. I smile down at her, while Brooke looks somberly up at me, not smiling.</p><p>Reaching up, she drags her fingers along my jaw. \u201cWhen I came back, I promised myself I\u2019d never leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised myself I\u2019d never let you go. What else do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>I brush her dark hair behind her face, surveying her for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right, little firecracker,\u201d I tell her. I glance at her flat little stomach and spread my hand out, trying to encompass as much as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this.\u201d I rub her gently and look deep into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we do,\u201d she says, but she studies me as if she\u2019s not certain. \u201cIt\u2019s just two months, right?\u201d</p><p>I tweak her nose. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like we can\u2019t communicate in other ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly right.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and starts massaging my shoulder. \u201cLet your body rest. Ice yourself after your workouts. Warm up properly.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Her warmth. The sound of her voice. I dip my nose into her neck and inhale, listening to her breathe me in. I pull her closer and lick her neck, then whisper, so she understands, \u201cI can\u2019t let anything happen to you, Brooke. I can\u2019t. I had to bring you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Remy, I know.\u201d She runs her fingers through my hair and looks at me, as tormented as I feel. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right, all three of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point of all this,\u201d I whisper, reminding myself as well as her.</p><p>\u201cAnd like you say, we\u2019ve got this. We really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be back before we even have time to feel sad or miss each other too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll be training and you\u2019ll be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>When we fall silent, we stay close, and she whispers, \u201cI left some arnica oils in your suitcase. If you have any muscle soreness or any pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still seeing blood?\u201d I ask, and when she nods, my concern and frustration feel like a spiked ball in the middle of my chest.</p><p>\u201cEvery time a cramp starts, I feel like it\u2019s going to come out of me,\u201d she admits.</p><p>Soothing a hand down her back, I press a kiss to her forehead. \u201cI know it\u2019ll kill you not to run. Stay off your feet for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as it would kill me to lose our baby,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>We ride in silence toward her apartment, and I scoop her out of the car and carry her into the building. She clings to my neck as we walk into the building, up the elevator, and into her apartment, and she feels so right in my arms, I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019ll let go of her. \u201cStay. Remington, stay. Be my male prisoner. I promise to take care of you all day, every day,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I laugh softly, and I look into her laughing, pleading gold eyes, and I don\u2019t even know what to do with her, I want to sink in her and live in her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gives me a tour of her place, and then we go into her room.</p><p>I take in our surroundings as I set Brooke by the foot of the bed. Her room has earth-toned walls. Framed photographs of biceps, triceps, and abs. A nutritional chart, and a framed quote that says:</p><p>A CHAMPION IS SOMEONE WHO GETS UP WHEN HE CAN\u2019T\u2014JACK DEMPSEY</p><p>There\u2019s a big wall with pinned photographs. And there she is, sprinting past the finish line with a number 06 in her chest.</p> <p>I reach out to run the pad of my thumb down the length of her running figure. \u201cLook at you,\u201d I say, turning. She\u2019s right behind me. Standing, like she shouldn\u2019t be. I scoop her up and set her on the center of the bed, brushing some escaped tendrils of hair behind her shoulder. \u201cStay off your feet for me,\u201d I chide.</p><p>\u201cI will. I forgot. It\u2019s habit.\u201d She scoot backs on the mattress to make room for me and then she pulls me over her, whispering in my ear, \u201cYou should go or I won\u2019t let you leave me.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I cuddle her to me, my arms wrapped around her waist as I scent her, slow and deep, then I lick her slowly, then kiss her and murmur, \u201cWhen you tell me you\u2019re in bed, this is what I\u2019ll picture. This is what you see.\u201d Her eyes glisten with tears as she quietly nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d I assure her, curling my palm around her cheek as one lone tear slides down her cheek. I try to smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She wipes her cheek, turns her head, and kisses the inside of my palm, then she forces my finger closed around her kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit, come here.\u201d I crush her in my arms, and she trembles and starts crying for real.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I whisper, rubbing her back, but she sobs harder. I whisper it\u2019s all right, but the way she cries guts me. It\u2019s not anything close to right. She needs me. She fucking needs me and she will be here, without me, struggling to keep our baby. Our baby that might just end up being like me, and instead of making the woman I love happy, our baby will hurt her, just like I do. It pains me. Maybe the child I put in her isn\u2019t right. Maybe it\u2019s not strong. Maybe it\u2019s just like me, and everything I don\u2019t want her to have to struggle with.</p><p>But I\u2019m so fucking selfish, I still want it.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to lose it.</p><p>I want her, I want everything with her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go,\u201d she whispers, suddenly pushing me away.</p> <p>Fuck, I haven\u2019t even left and it already hurts as I breathe her in one last time and set my forehead against hers. I take her face in my hand and wipe her tears with my thumbs, rasping, \u201cYou okay, baby firecracker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. More than okay,\u201d she assures.</p><p>Her phone vibrates, and she checks the message, her eyelashes wet with her tears. \u201cMelanie is five minutes away.\u201d Her voice cracks in the end as she turns her attention back to me. \u201cPlease go before I cry,\u201d she begs.</p><p>I curl my fingers around the back of her neck and shut my eyes closed as I lean my head on her. \u201cThink of me like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I will.\u201d</p><p>I lean closer. \u201cNow give me a kiss.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips to mine, and I spread out my hand on the small of her back, memorizing her, drinking her up because I\u2019m going to be thirsty and there won\u2019t be water for me until she\u2019s home. With me. I feel a tear against my jaw and I lick it up from her cheek when we hear Melanie outside.</p><p>\u201cBrookey!! Where\u2019s the hot dad and the upcoming momma?\u201d</p> <p>I curse and take another hard, fast kiss before I go, sucking on her tongue, taking everything I can, then I ease back and survey her pink swollen mouth and beautiful wide eyes, with the dilated pupils, just for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re everything I never knew I wanted,\u201d I huskily whisper, tucking her hair behind her. \u201cAnd all mine, remember that tidbit,\u201d I add, forcing myself to stand. \u201cCompletely mine . . . Brooke Dumas.\u201d</p><p>She watches me back up to the door, her chest heaving, her heart in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant with your baby, if there was any doubt about whose I was,\u201d she says, with a shaky smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both mine.\u201d I point right at her. \u201cEspecially you.\u201d</p><p>When I turn, she calls me.</p><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re mine, too.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I pull out my iPod and toss it straight at her. \u201cDon\u2019t miss me too much.\u201d</p><p>She catches it like she just caught my soul, holding it tightly. \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d she cries, and I memorize every inch of the smile on her face. Brand it inside your fucking skull, Tate.</p><p>And I do.</p><p>It\u2019s still in my head when I meet her friend out in the hall. \u201cHey, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>She gives me the same doting look all my fans give me. \u201cHey, Remy.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows furrow. \u201cI want to be the first to know anything. If she\u2019s sick, if she\u2019s lonely, if she needs me.\u201d</p><p>She keeps nodding with that ridiculous smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will call you or make sure she does,\u201d she assures, patting my chest with sparkling green eyes. \u201cNow go.\u201d She pats my chest again, this time flattening her palms and pushing, to no avail. \u201cGo! You sex god! I\u2019ll take care of your girl.\u201d</p><p>I grab her wrists, lower them, then force myself to head to the elevator. In the car, I\u2019m drumming my fingers on my knees. In the plane, I\u2019m flying with my headphones at my side, but no music. She has my music now. She\u2019s ALL. MY MUSIC.</p><p>When we land and I power up my phone, I get a message from her.</p><p>Call me tonight if you want to?</p><p>Hell, of course I fucking want to.</p><p>I\u2019m still sweaty in the gym as I try to work out, but I grab my phone and call her, dropping down onto a bench while I suck up my Gatorade. No answer.</p><p>I call again.</p><p>No answer. After several tries, it vibrates with a text message.</p><p>My friends are still here. Maybe we should talk tomorrow?</p><p>I set my Gatorade aside to text. Same time?</p><p>Yes, any time</p><p>My thumbs are too blunt and big and I struggle to pound out Ok</p><p>Good night Remy</p><p>More struggling to write down You too.</p><p>Then I stare at the screen, but there\u2019s no more.</p><p>I can\u2019t sleep that night. I do sit-ups, push-ups, jump rope. I want her to marry a fucking champion, so I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll be training like one. Hours later, I stop working out, sit up on the carpet, prop my arms over my knees and hang my head between them as I think of the smile I\u2019m carrying around, branded in my head.</p><p>I take a shower and play on my iPad, beating the hell out of some guy at chess at five a.m., trying not to think how much I\u2019m craving her. The smell of her, the feel of her, the look of her. I move my pawns and in my head I\u2019m thrusting her and making her moan. In the morning, I\u2019m calling the florist closest to her apartment, but it\u2019s too early and they haven\u2019t opened.</p><p>During breakfast, Pete and Riley study my face. \u201cWho are you calling and calling? Let Brooke rest,\u201d Riley says.</p><p>I sigh and put the phone down.</p><p>\u201cHey, look at me for a sec, Rem,\u201d Pete says, alarm in his voice.</p><p>I lift my head, and I meet his gaze so he knows I\u2019m not fucking black. This time my sadness doesn\u2019t come from a chemical imbalance in my body. My sadness comes from my heart.</p><p>\u201cRemy, here we go,\u201d Diane says as she comes up with my breakfast, and she\u2019s smart, that one is. She seems to sense I\u2019m not hungry and will give her shit about the food, and she\u2019s blended all kinds of things with egg whites in three huge glasses. I down them one by one. \u201cWhy do you keep redialing?\u201d Pete asks, watching me. \u201cI can do it for you, what do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Brooke to miss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>I drag my hands down my face and growl, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m breathing under fucking water without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, she\u2019s a fighter, like you. They\u2019ll be all right. Both of them,\u201d he stresses.</p><p>He heads over to grab my iPad to check the store number. He pats my back before he calls the florist.</p><p>\u201cI want hundreds of roses, Pete!\u201d I yell as he walks around the living room, talking into the receiver. \u201cI want them all over her apartment,\u201d I continue instructing. \u201cAll of them red. And I want every dozen to have a song so she\u2019ll think of me. I need her to think of me.\u201d</p><p>She does, think of me.</p><p>She calls and texts me, and I call and text her.</p><p>Every day I hear a report on what she did, how she is. The guys tell me it will get easier, but it doesn\u2019t. It gets worse.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t get any better until that fantastic day I finally get to go pick her up and bring her back on the circuit with me.</p><p>THE FINAL, FINALLY. My little firecracker and I made an agreement when she came back, and she better fucking stick with it. The thing is, Scorpion has blackmailed her sister back to his side too. Motherfucker.</p><p>Pete and I have planted a snitch, and we now know Scorpion had something on her, which must\u2019ve been why she went back to that asshole. But I\u2019m not letting Brooke step in this time. Tonight I take care of it all.</p><p>This season hasn\u2019t been easy, but then nothing worthwhile ever is.</p><p>We\u2019re headed down the hotel elevator, on our way to the Underground, and I\u2019ve barely been able to shake myself out of the deepest hole in the history of my lows.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to pump myself up for the fight with some mashups as we ride down the elevator, but though my body feels ready, my mind is with my girl. As we shuffle out of the elevator and into the hotel lobby, I grab Brooke by the hips and pull her back to me, murmuring, \u201cIn my peripherals.\u201d</p><p>Her worried gold eyes meet mine, and I yank down my headphones.</p><p>\u201cIn your seat at all times, Brooke,\u201d I say, while winding my fingers into her hair, then I crush her sweet, hot, delicious fucking mouth under mine. She looks dazed when I pull her back an inch, and I set my forehead on hers while I keep my eyes on her. \u201cI adore you with every breath I take\u2014in every ounce of me, I adore you.\u201d Another fast, hard kiss later, I slap my favorite ass and whisper, \u201cWatch me break him.\u201d</p><p>I play my music while we ride to the Underground. I need to concentrate, but I\u2019m eyeing the back of her neck, the way her breasts rise and fall, and for a moment, I forward into the future, to the way she\u2019ll look at me when I ask her. The guys tell me everything is ready, and I just hope that she is. Ready for me. For all of me.</p><p>I\u2019m winning tonight. Even if I have to kill for it. I\u2019m taking it all. Everything I\u2019ve never had, by force if I have to.</p><p>My championship, my woman, I\u2019m winning, and when the crowd is screaming my name, I\u2019m taking the yes out of her mouth that I want.</p><p>When we reach the Underground, I keep my headphones on my head as I watch Brooke head to her seat. She ducks her head and spreads her hand over the mound of her little round stomach as she follows Pete, avoiding looking at me. God, she stirs up all my protective instincts and then some.</p><p>She\u2019s nervous.</p><p>I don\u2019t want her to be.</p><p>The last time she saw me in a final, Scorpion broke me. This time I want her to watch me break him. I want her to be proud. I want her to be proud of being with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wait in the locker room\u2014no other fighters here tonight. Just Coach, Riley, and me. They\u2019re arguing about something. I can see the tendons popping out of their necks while Coach tapes up my hands. I know it\u2019s hard for them to trust me when I\u2019m pulling out of a swing. Maybe they think I\u2019ll do what I did last season.</p><p>No shit I\u2019m getting Brooke\u2019s sister back again. But this time I\u2019m the one who fucks Scorpion in every damn hole of his body. I get the girl, the championship, rescue the sister, and break the blackmailing motherfucker. All of which he can watch from his prime spot inside the ring\u2014with me.</p><p>I turn up my music and tune into the rhythm of my heartbeat, the hard, steady pump of my blood reaching every inch of my muscles. I do a mental check, head to toe. Nothing hurts. I study my taped hands and squeeze my fists, popping out my knuckles. Every part of me is ready to fight.</p><p>I\u2019ve been a sad, depressed fuck for weeks. Wondering if I\u2019m good enough for Brooke, for our baby.</p> <p>Tonight, I\u2019ll prove to myself that I am worthy.</p><p>Despite what every other person in my life has thought about me.</p><p>I stop my iPod when I see Riley lift two fingers in the air. Pulling off my headphones, I set them aside and stand to jump in place when I hear the voice out in the arena.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, hello! Well, here we are this evening with you all! Are you people ready? Are you all READY for a fight unlike any other? Unlike ANY OTHER, people! Ringmaster?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p> <p>Breathing as I warm up, I twist my neck to each side, then forward and back.</p><p>\u201cSir, we won\u2019t need your services tonight,\u201d the announcer says.</p><p>The crowd lets loose a roar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d the announcer joins them as he keeps on yelling. \u201cTonight, there are NO rules, NO ringmaster. Anything goes. ANYTHING GOES, PEOPLE! No knockouts\u2014this is a fight of submission. Submit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr die!!\u201d the crowd screams.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen! Yes! It\u2019s a submission fight here tonight in the Underground! Now, let\u2019s call your worst nightmare into the ring! The man your daughters cry about. The man you want to run from. The man you certainly don\u2019t want to be up in the ring with. Our defending champion, Benny, the Blaaaack, Scorpionnnnnn!\u201d</p> <p>I keep jumping in place and pumping out my arms, keeping my shoulders loose and my core tight.</p><p>\u201cBooooo!\u201d the crowd yells outside. \u201cBOOOOO!!\u201d</p><p>A few feet away, Riley stretches out my RIPTIDE robe, and I step up and ram my arms into the sleeves, tying it loosely around me.</p><p>\u201cAnd challenging our champion tonight, we all know his name! We are all waiting to see if he\u2019s gonna bring it to this ring tonight. So . . . is he? Get rrrready to welcome the one and only Remingtooooooon Tate, yourrr Riiiiiptide!!\u201d</p><p>I charge out the walkway to the instant chant of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cRem-ing-ton! Rem-ing-ton!\u201d</p><p>The color red streaks across the arena as the fans stand to greet me. \u201cRemyyyyy, kill him, Remyyyy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Rrrrrriptide!\u201d</p> <p>I leap into the ring and take off my robe, then I look around with a smile, sucking it all in, my fans\u2019 faces full of expectation, the way the arena looks in this season\u2019s final.</p><p>I will not fail.</p><p>I stretch my arms out and do my turn so that they can keep on screaming like they like to, feeding me, and the noise heightens as I start slowly turning around.</p><p>That\u2019s right, I\u2019m going to break him tonight, and it\u2019s all for . . .</p><p>My eyes spot her, and I smile.</p><p>Brooke Dumas.</p><p>I have fought my life to control my mood swings. I have fought for my health, for the hell of it, and to vent. I have fought in anger, and tired, depressed, hungry, excited. I have fought to prove myself to my parents when they didn\u2019t care. I have fought to prove to myself I\u2019m strong. But now I fight to prove myself to her. And I\u2019m taking this one home.</p><p>The bell rings, and I lock eyes on Scorpion and leap into action. Going to center ring, I watch Scorpion jump around for a moment, then I hit him\u2014fast and hard\u2014one punch, two, three. He stumbles back.</p><p>\u201cRemy!!\u201d</p><p>Brooke is screaming at me, her voice loud, clear, thrilled. It charges me like a bolt of lightning. I drive my fist into Scorpion\u2019s jaw and knock him back a step, then I slam him again and knock him back yet another one.</p><p>\u201cGo, REMY!!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him, Remy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemington, I fucking love you! Ohmigod, I love you!\u201d Brooke screams.</p><p>Holy god, I\u2019m so fucking wired to show her I\u2019m the man, I\u2019m the only fucking man for her, I drive my knuckles into Scorpion even harder, alternating between guarding, then hitting, guarding, then hitting.</p><p>The crowd loves it.</p><p>\u201cKill him, RIP! Kill him, RIP!\u201d they chant.</p><p>The fight continues through the night, pausing only during small resting periods where we drop down on our stools and our coaches drill us with instructions.</p><p>I listen to what Coach says, pretending to listen, nodding. But it goes in one ear, and out the other. I know what I\u2019m doing. Scorpion and I don\u2019t take our eyes away from the other as we head back to center again. I can see it, in his eyes, when he plans to move. We hit again, both of us landing hard punches. He clinches me, but I pull free and slam out my right hook. He covers and pounds my ribs.</p><p>My breath goes, but I quickly recover, going at him with my fastest punches, so fast he barely sees them coming. Wham wham wham. Soon blood starts pouring out both his nostrils, and his balance is rocking with my hits.</p><p>I know I have him, but the gleam in his fucking eye tells me otherwise. He doesn\u2019t plan to submit. Swinging out, he hooks an arm around my neck and pulls me down as he rams his knee into my gut.</p><p>He looks excited about that. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let him land any more. Shoving him back, I drive my fists fast and hard into his body, slamming him like I do my hard bags until he\u2019s covering, ducking, trying to escape my payback.</p><p>I don\u2019t let him. I follow and pound him into the ropes.</p><p>He falls to his knees and spits on the ground, then he gets up and comes at me.</p><p>He hits my jaw, ribs, temple, slamming me into the ropes.</p><p>Fuck! I straighten and stalk him as he backs away, my eyes trained on his as blood trickles down my face.</p><p>I hit. He hits back. Wham-pow-wham.</p><p>In my peripherals, I see Brooke\u2019s sister by her side. Her sister who she loves.</p><p>Her sister who this motherfucker screws around with, which means he indirectly screws around with Brooke.</p><p>I start battering Scorpion until he\u2019s stumbling on each step\u2014but he still won\u2019t fall.</p><p>He will.</p><p>He\u2019ll be falling at my feet and it\u2019s only a matter of three . . . two . . . one . . . Clenching my teeth when he doesn\u2019t, I grab him by the neck with one arm and spin him around to look at the girls.</p><p>\u201cYou think I wouldn\u2019t kill you in front of them? You think I wouldn\u2019t enjoy having them watch me break you?\u201d I growl.</p><p>He laughs and I promptly break his elbow. He moans as I let go of his arm, and it drops at his side, dangling and useless.</p><p>He backs away now, and I corner him, slamming his head to the side, over and over. He rams his knee into my gut, but I recover and punch, left-right, left-right, until I drop him to his knees.</p><p>I won\u2019t be merciful. I grab Scorpion and pull him to his feet, forcing him to look at Brooke. Her sister is crying, her head down, and Brooke\u2019s cheeks are stark white, and the helpless fear in her gaze only makes my protectiveness rise tenfold.</p><p>\u201cLook at her very well,\u201d I whisper with my lowest voice in his ear, \u201cbecause what you see belongs to me. It\u2019s because of her that I\u2019m going to break every inch of your body, beat you to within an inch of your life, then I\u2019m going to prolong your agony until the pain alone is what kills you. You think I won\u2019t kill you because she\u2019s watching? You\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s because she\u2019s watching that I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>He spits black blood to the mat.</p><p>I shove him away, pull up my fists and pop out my knuckles, ready to go at it again.</p><p>We don\u2019t lose time. We fight. I punch him, over and over, slamming hard and fast, all my power running up and coming from my gut, straight into my hit. I jab, jab, hook, until the sound of my knuckles meeting his flesh is replaced by the sound of his body crashing to the mat.</p><p>The chant rises up. \u201cREM-ING-TON! REM-ING-TON!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRip! Seal the deal, Rip!!!!!!!!\u201d</p><p>I head over to his prone form, working some air into my lungs. Sweat drips down my chest and arms. I watch him crawl on the ground in an effort to avoid me. I keep approaching, my eyes on Brooke now, because that\u2019s where I\u2019ll see the victory, and not anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cGo, Remy!!!!!\u201d she says.</p><p>At my feet, Scorpion tries to move, and I swing my arm and slam him down.</p><p>The crowd roars. Bending over, I grab his unbroken arm and break all his fingers, then I move to his wrist, and I lift it up for the crowd to see, then I break that easily too.</p><p>A low sound rumbles up his throat, and he squirms on the mat. I slide my hands up to his elbow and I start twisting, wanting to make it painful, and slow. Oh, yes, fucker. It\u2019ll be slow.</p><p>He thrashes and sputters, and the bone is about to snap when I hear his coach yell out, and a black towel falls into the ring.</p><p>I see the towel and grit my teeth in frustration when I do.</p><p>\u201cBooo!\u201d the public shouts. \u201cBooo!!\u201d</p><p>Fuck me, I\u2019m so wired, I don\u2019t think I can back off. I want his blood. I want to break his elbow, his shoulder, and then his goddamned face. I want him to pay for the little box of goodies he sent Brooke, and I want him to pay for what he did to her sister, and I want him to pay for what he did way back when that meant I\u2019d never be able to box professionally again. It would be so easy to pretend I didn\u2019t see the towel, and just like that, I can twist his neck and he\u2019s dead.</p><p>. . . And I\u2019d prove to Brooke that I\u2019m a killer.</p><p>Only seconds before asking her to marry me . . .</p><p>Which isn\u2019t right.</p><p>With an inhuman effort, I let go and step away. Scorpion spits out blood and raises his head to look at me. I start walking away when I hear him, \u201cPussy, come and finish me!\u201d</p><p>I do. I turn and slam my fist down, hard enough to knock him unconscious.</p><p>\u201cRIPTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE!\u201d the announcer\u2019s yell reverberates across the arena.</p><p>The crowd stands with a roar, and I immediately search the stands for Brooke. I\u2019m fucking hungry for her. For the acceptance I see in her eyes, the joy. I want to see that she\u2019s proud of me, and I want her to know I would kill him. For her. I would maim, destroy, do anything, for her. But I also won\u2019t. For her.</p><p>Her lips are curled into the sweet little smile I like, but her forehead is puckered, and she\u2019s crying softly in her seat, the only person in the arena that\u2019s not standing.</p><p>I\u2019m barely aware of my arm being raised as a kernel of fear settles deep in my gut.</p><p>\u201cThe winner of this season\u2019s Underground Championship, I give you, REMINGTON TATE, RIIIPTIDE!!! Riiiiiiiiptide!! Riptide . . . where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Something\u2019s the fuck wrong. Something\u2019s the fuck wrong and the instant it hits me, I leap off the ring and charge for her, kneeling at her feet, wrapping my sweaty, bloodied arms around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrooke, oh, baby, she\u2019s coming, isn\u2019t she?\u201d She nods, and my heart has never pounded so hard as I wipe away her tears, murmuring, \u201cI got you, all right? You got me, baby, now I got you. Come here.\u201d I scoop her up in my arms, and she cuddles into me, so vulnerable and sweet as she cries into my neck.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not . . . supposed . . . to come yet. . . . It\u2019s too soon. . . . What if he won\u2019t make it . . . ? \u201d</p><p>The crowd has flocked around us, but I tuck her head under my neck and use my shoulders to bulldoze past the fans, determined to get us out of here as fast as I can as hands reach out to rub me. \u201cRIPTIDE, YOU ROCK! RRIIIIPPPPTIIIDE!\u201d they scream.</p><p>White roses start raining over us from the stands when the announcer speaks.</p><p>Fuck this is all wrong. I\u2019m supposed to be on my knees.

Brooke\u2019s confusion seems to grow, and the chorus that asks what I\u2019ve wanted to ask her from the moment I held her in my arms, kissed her for the first time, and introduced myself to her, plays out loud.</p><p>She was mine then.</p><p>She. Is. Mine.</p><p>She will be mine.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d she asks me in confusion.</p><p>Pushing out through the exit, I tell Pete, \u201cPull the car around,\u201d and I keep walking until Pete screeches to a halt before us. Brooke\u2019s sister climbs up front.</p><p>I tuck Brooke into the back, and she keeps looking at me expectantly, watching me close the door as Pete drives us out of there. I hold her face between my hands, and my heart is still galloping.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>This is what I want most in the world.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve been waiting since before I was born to ask her. It\u2019s like asking her to jump off a cliff, with me. It goes against my instinct to protect her, but my instinct to claim her overrules anything else. She\u2019s mine, my girl.</p><p>Her eyes hold me, hot and pained but shining expectantly, and I hear the need in my voice when I speak, \u201cThe song was supposed to ask you to marry me, but you\u2019ll have to settle on me doing the asking . . .\u201d She stares at me, her lips apart, and she\u2019s trembling so hard, she doesn\u2019t know my hands are trembling too as I squeeze her face between my hands. \u201cMind. Body. Soul. All of you for me. All of you mine . . . Marry me, Brooke Dumas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she exclaims, sobbing and grabbing my jaw and pressing her lips to mine, no hesitation in her answer, no worry, no concern. \u201cYes yes yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck baby, thank you,\u201d I murmur, my throat tight as I pull her to me and she buries herself against me. She can\u2019t see my face, and I exhale a breath against her hair and hold her, my adrenaline starting to crash almost instantly. She moans in pain and I quietly rock her, whispering in her ear, \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold me,\u201d she says, groaning softly, then breathing fast, \u201cStay with me, don\u2019t go black, stay with me.\u201d</p><p>I nod and hold her, but I start to worry when she keeps moaning in pain.</p><p>Don\u2019t fucking go black, asshole!</p><p>When we check her in, I\u2019m trying to calm down, but she\u2019s moaning and grimacing and I can\u2019t stop thinking I\u2019m the bastard who knocked her up.</p> <p>I try to think of the look of happiness on her face when I proposed. I try to hang onto it and remember what she\u2019s told me before. We want this. We want a family. We deserve it like anyone else. I try to think of that look of happiness when she\u2019s on the delivery table, pushing.</p><p>Holy god, I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m in one piece.</p><p>I hold her hand as her cries tear through my ears and split me open.</p><p>I brush her hair behind her face and watch her chew on her lip as she pushes, while I quietly beg myself to please just hang tight and not let my daughter first meet me when I\u2019m black.</p><p>It feels like forever by the time Brooke lets go a sigh and drops back on the table, suddenly relaxed, when I see the doctor holding a squirming, wet, pink figure. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d he says, and a soft cry follows.</p><p>\u201cA boy,\u201d she gasps, delighted.</p><p>\u201cA boy,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cBreathing on his own. No complications. He\u2019s preterm\u2014we still need to incubate,\u201d the doctor murmurs.</p><p>\u201cWe want to see . . .\u201d Brooke cries.</p><p>She lifts her arms and they tremble as she waits for them to clean the baby, and it howls in protest, and then, the nurse brings it over.</p><p>I\u2019m staring in disbelief as Brooke holds it . . . not it . . . him. Our son.</p><p>Our son who stopped screaming when they placed him in her arms.</p><p>She ducks her head, her hair tangled, a sheen of sweat across her neck and face, our son wrapped in a small blanket and in her arms, and my body loosens as I bend my head to her, and to him, as a whole truckload of protectiveness, and love, and pure raw happiness slam into me.</p><p>\u201cI love him, Remy,\u201d she whispers, tilting her head to me, and I feel so fucking grateful for her giving me this, I just need to kiss her, feel her whisper against my mouth, \u201cI love you so much. Thank you for this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d I rasp, protectively wrapping my arms around both of them. My throat is raw, and my eyes are killing me, and I\u2019ve never had something so perfect, pure, and precious in my life than my little firecracker and a little part of her, with a little part of me.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s like me, we will support him,\u201d I whisper to her. \u201cIf he\u2019s like me . . . we\u2019ll be there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Remy,\u201d she agrees, looking at our son, and at me, her expression so loving I feel renewed by it. \u201cWe will teach him music. And exercise. And how to take care of this little body. It will be strong and astound him and maybe frustrate him sometimes too. We will teach him to love it. And himself. We will teach him love.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the moisture from my eye and tell her yeah, that yeah, we will, but I won tonight, and I still wish I felt worthier and I were different. I wish I were perfect for them. I wish I were perfect in every way so they\u2019d never shed a tear for me, worry, or stress because of me. But I love them more than anything perfect ever could. I love them more than anything perfect ever will. Nothing perfect would kill for them like I would, or die for them like I would.</p><p>Tears are streaming down her cheeks as she stretches out her arm, and I realize I stepped back like some pussy afraid to be rejected by them.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she whispers, and I come and bow my head to hers, and I\u2019m not sure if the wetness on my jaw is mine or hers, but it\u2019s taking all my effort to hold myself under control. \u201cI am so in love with you,\u201d she whispers as she nuzzles me, caressing me in a way that makes my eyes burn even harder. \u201cYou deserve this and more. While you fight out there, I will fight for you to come home to this.\u201d</p><p>I growl, angry that I\u2019m crying, and then wipe my tears and kiss her lips, rasping, \u201cI fucking love you to pieces. To pieces. Thank you for this baby. Thank you for loving me. I can\u2019t wait to make you my wife.\u201d</p><p>PRESENT</p><p>SEATTLE</p><p>The way my wife looks today.</p><p>The way my wife smiles today.</p><p>The way my wife nuzzles our smiling son as she says, \u201cGoodbye, Racer, be good with Grandma and Grandpa. . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d</p><p>I pat the top of Racer\u2019s round little head and kiss his chubby cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right, devil, you heard her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him to us,\u201d Brooke\u2019s mother tells us outside the church, while the team looks on from a couple feet away. Brooke\u2019s sister, Nora, is clutching the bouquet she just caught to her chest, and Pete looks ready to puke at her side because of his feelings for her. Coach is grinning like he never does, while Diane is standing with her arm linked to his, and Riley can\u2019t stop glaring at Melanie\u2019s new boyfriend, who clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Me . . . I\u2019ve had it with the suit, with being kept away from my bride in our own home, with kissing her meekly by the altar and without using my tongue and my teeth or putting my hands on her ass. As Brooke waves to Melanie and yells, \u201cRacer, Mommy loves you!\u201d I pull her into the back of the limousine and reach around her to slam the door, and I finally have her all for me.</p><p>She turns, panting, to look into my eyes, her cheeks blushed pink, her eyes sparkling in excitement, and no, I will never forget today.</p><p>I reach for her while she simultaneously tries climbing on my lap and I grab her waist to help her, but she squeaks as she tries flattening the billowing skirt of her dress and we fail to get her comfortably on top of me. \u201cI loved this dress until this moment when it won\u2019t let me get close to you,\u201d she complains.</p><p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m so hard for you, come here.\u201d Sliding my hand under the fall of her hair, I grab her by the neck and dive hungrily for her lips, kissing her, my tongue anxious to be touching hers. I want more. And she instantly gives me more, thirsty for me, moaning softly.</p><p>Keeping our mouths attached, I gather her closer as she strokes my hair. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d she breathes. \u201cFor you to tear this dress off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send those fucking buttons flying.\u201d My mouth waters as I drag my thumbs down her cheeks. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to feast on you like a fucking banquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, please.\u201d She sets her nose on mine and sighs, her fingers playing in my hair. \u201cWe\u2019ve never left Racer for more than two hours before. I feel like a bad mother.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, nuzzling her as I do. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to leave him and go on a honeymoon yet, you at least have to let me steal you for an evening.\u201d I kiss her jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re the most tender, playful mother I know, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cOh, and how many do you know?\u201d she teases, reaching up to poke both my dimples. \u201cTo compare me to?\u201d</p><p>Really? I know none. But the mother of my son.</p><p>God, they\u2019re so fucking perfect, and they\u2019re both mine.</p><p>I sometimes watch them from across the room, and my chest swells as they play around with each other. Brooke has a canny sixth sense that always knows when I stare. She always looks up, her eyes warm and sparkling with happiness at me, and I come over and pull them close to me, kissing and nuzzling them both.</p><p>\u201cI know my mother wasn\u2019t like you,\u201d I whisper to her now, kissing the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, there\u2019s no father like you.\u201d She caresses the bow at my neck. \u201cI love you so much, Remington.\u201d She presses her face into my neck and tries getting closer to my side, dragging in a deep inhale, her voice thick, \u201cYou look so hot in that tuxedo, I\u2019m dying to have you all to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get you all for me too.\u201d I tighten my arm around her waist as I buzz my lips over her hair.</p><p>Maybe taking a honeymoon currently is impossible, especially when neither of us wants to leave Racer, but I need my wife tonight.</p><p>Quietly I kiss her forehead and her nose. Running my eyes over her features, I tip her head and scrape my thumb across her lips. \u201cI need this,\u201d I rasp, and set my mouth on hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rubs my tongue to hers and sighs as I slip my fingers into her hair and loosen the crystal clips scattered throughout. Pulling each raindrop-shaped crystal from her hair, I tuck them into my jacket pocket while I slowly savor her mouth and kiss her all the way to the hotel, until neither of us is breathing right by the time we arrive.</p><p>The moment we walk into the lobby, a dozen curious stares land on us, and they\u2019re soon followed by claps and cheers as I take her by the hand and lead her to the elevators.</p><p>\u201cMany years, man!\u201d someone shouts.</p><p>\u201cCheers to the bride and groom!\u201d</p> <p>Brooke laughs, and I\u2019m chuckling too as I pull her into the elevator with me and then bury my face in her neck, smelling her as we head to the top floor.</p><p>\u201cI want to eat you,\u201d I growl, sliding my fingers under her hair again. Her eyes darken as she reaches for my free hand and spreads it over her heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss me here?\u201d She forces my fingers to curve around the round flesh of one perky little tit.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Then she lifts that same hand to her mouth and sets a kiss on my palm. \u201cAnd here?\u201d</p> <p>I nod again.</p><p>Her smile matches mine in mischief as she slides my hand down her abdomen and to the bell of her skirt, then she laughs and pushes up on her toes. \u201cWhat about . . . there?\u201d</p><p>I tip her head back. \u201cYour pussy is getting kissed tonight for sure.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curve in pure delight and I have to take them and kiss her, stopping only when we hear the Ting.</p><p>When the doors roll open, I scoop her in my arms and she squeaks in surprise as I head to the double doors down the hall. \u201cRemy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what husbands do the first night. No?\u201d</p> <p>She links her fingers at the back of my collar and nods.</p><p>I duck my head low to whisper in her ear as we reach our door. \u201cAs your husband, I do whatever the hell I want,\u201d I say, sliding the key into the slot while I add, \u201cAnd right now, I\u2019m going to do you.\u201d I push open the door, take us inside, and kick it shut behind me, then I set her to her feet, facing the room.</p><p>I click on the lights, and Brooke lets out a soft, surprised gasp.</p><p>Rose petals of every color are littered across the carpet. A hundred vases are scattered throughout, bursting with red bouquets, white bouquets. I wanted a fucking rose garden for my wife, and this is what the guys could help me do.</p><p>As Brooke stares quietly around, every inch in the room is either green, yellow, white, red, pink, some roses in buds, some blooming, some with stems, some scattered on the furniture without them, I quietly come up from behind her and set my headphones on her head, and click Play on my iPod.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u201d by Lifehouse begins. A hand flies to her chest when she starts listening, her pink mouth opening slightly and her eyes instantly tearing.</p><p>My chest swells and my throat feels itchy, my eyes stinging like the day Racer was born, and in that one instant, only hours after Brooke accepted to marry me\u2014they became my family and the center of my world. Now my wife stands in this room I filled with roses for her, and I have. NO. WORDS. No fucking words to tell her. The way I need her. The way I want her. The way I love her. How every day I wake up a happy man, and go to sleep a happy man, sure that I can\u2019t love her any more than I already do. But every day, the impossible happens, and I love her more. Her smiles, her strength, her dedication to our son, to me, everything about her is perfect for me.</p><p>She starts sobbing softly as she keeps listening to the song, clutching her stomach as if it hurts to hear the lyrics.</p> <p>You\u2019re all I want, you\u2019re all I need, you\u2019re everything . . . everything . . .</p><p>My eyes burn as she cries softly, and I\u2019m flooded with tenderness as I step before her. I lift my palm to catch the tears of one cheek, and press my lips to the other, kissing her tears dry. \u201cNo crying,\u201d I murmur into her skin, and she squeezes her eyes shut as more tears fall, her arms trembling as she wraps them around me.</p><p>\u201cNo crying. I want to make you happy,\u201d I murmur, pulling off the headphones and tossing them aside as I repeat it in her ear. I want to make you happy. She shudders quietly, sniffing, and I frame her face in my hands so my thumbs can dry the rest of her tears as I look into her eyes. The only eyes that really see me. The tender, hungry, and passionate gold eyes of the woman I love. I caress my thumbs on her cheeks. \u201cNot just happy. I want to make you the happiest woman alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she says, sniffling, wearing her heart in her eyes as she looks at me. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>With a soft groan, I pull her to me and go kiss her ear. \u201cEvery day you make me the luckiest man alive,\u201d I whisper, sliding my fingers up her back and tracing the buttons of her wedding dress, impatiently popping them open, one by one. She nuzzles my neck and kisses my throat when suddenly, she pulls away from me and starts backing across the suite, a new playfulness in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou want me?\u201d</p><p>One of my eyebrows shoots up. \u201cYou doubt it?\u201d</p><p>I start following, my hunter kicking into gear, all my instincts rearing up and priming my body to chase and catch her. I\u2019m not about to let her get very far. \u201cCome here,\u201d I growl, reaching out and pulling her close. She lets out a squeak a second before I kiss her, hard and deep as I run my hand down the buttons on her back, grab the fabric, and rip it. Buttons fly, landing over the rose petals on the floor. She moans when I slide my hand through the tear and touch soft, bare skin. \u201cHmmm.\u201d I lick up her neck as I pull her arms out of the sleeves of her dress and yank the top down to her waist.</p><p>She pulls off my bow tie and slides my jacket over my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m so ready for you, you can consider all day foreplay,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I laugh, then I pin her hands at her sides and lace my fingers through hers, keeping her fingers from going anywhere as I kiss her mouth, slow and languorously. \u201cLet\u2019s start stripping you.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her by the hips, I prop her on the back of a couch and push her skirt up so I can reach one silver glittery shoe. I unbuckle all the little line of crystal buckles, then I toss one shoe aside and work on the next. Once it falls next to the first, I run my hand up her stockings and find the perfect spot to rip.</p><p>She gasps in delight as I rip and pull it off her leg, baring her skin from the tip of her feet, up higher. I lick her toe, then trail my tongue up the arch of her foot while my hands slide up her lean, long legs to tug the rest of her stocking free. I hear her start to pant, and when I\u2019ve bared all her legs under her dress, I have a perfect view of the damp spot on her panties as I suck one pink-painted toe. My eyes blur from the force of my need, and I part her thighs and hear her catch her breath as I release her foot and bury deeper under her skirt to lick her over her panties.</p><p>\u201cRemy,\u201d she groans, as I lick the damp spot on the lace. She\u2019s never worn lace before and I can see her pussy lips, pink and snug under the material. Groaning low and deep, I urge her legs wider apart and give her one thorough lap of my tongue, then I emerge from under her skirt, and rise to my feet, so fucking hot I\u2019m about to turn to cinder.</p><p>Brooke\u2019s chest is heaving and she\u2019s leaning weakly backward, looking dazed and in love and beautiful with the top of her dress pulled down to her waist. Her body is twisted at an awkward angle as she braced herself, her dark hair falling behind her, and she\u2019s catching her breath from the licking I gave her. Her round, pretty tits are as juicy as they\u2019ve ever been, her nipples jutting out and almost screaming for my mouth. \u201cRemington,\u201d she says, almost pleadingly.</p><p>My body tight with desire, I scoop my arms beneath her. \u201cYou get a bed tonight, Mrs. Tate,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dumas-Tate,\u201d she says as she opens the top buttons of my shirt and drags her lips along the stubble of my jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She agrees with a sound against my throat, and a lick of her tongue. My blood is bubbling with need as I set her down on the bed, then I get busy stripping off my shirt. While I get rid of the cuff links and jerk it off my shoulders, my eyes run over those full breasts, fuller than ever, her nipples larger for my son to suck. And me.</p><p>I\u2019m burning down to the pit of my stomach.</p><p>Beneath my zipper my cock is fully hard, and all I have to do is jerk open my pants button and it explodes through the zipper. Brooke is trying to squirm out of her big dress and I decide I need her naked before I do anything else.</p><p>I reach out and pull the skirt and she squeaks and laughs when the fabric tears again and now easily slides down her body. \u201cOh, I knew this dress wouldn\u2019t survive you, I knew it!\u201d she cries happily.</p><p>We laugh together, and as soon as she\u2019s in nothing but panties, scooting back on the bed, I finish stripping and then stand there, at the foot of the bed, naked and so fucking hard I can barely see straight, and I look at her with my heart pumping in my chest and my skin buzzing from her nearness.</p><p>I look, and look and look. At my bride. My woman.</p><p>She grows impatient and crawls over to me in those wet lace panties. She kisses the length of my cock, the tattoo behind it, up the squares of my abs, up to my neck, and works her way to my lips. \u201cI\u2019m so hot, I\u2019m shaking for you.\u201d She caresses my cock.</p><p>I fist her hair in my hand and draw her back an inch, slowly dragging my tongue along her lips. \u201cThen give me.\u201d She smiles against my mouth and then moans and opens up so our tongues meet, and I lay her back on the bed littered with rose petals. Grabbing a handful of rose petals on the bed beside us, I flatten her on her back and raise my fist above her to sprinkle the rose petals over her.</p><p>She catches her breath as they fall on her body, her hair splayed dark behind her as she runs her fingers up my biceps, my shoulder, caressing me as I caress those rose petals and drag them up and down her body.</p><p>A mew leaves her lips and her eyes drift shut, and I keep dragging all the petals under my hand up to cup one tit, rubbing the petals over her nipples. The room is fragrant of rose petals but Brooke smells best of all. I know when she\u2019s completely wet and ready for me, and she\u2019s ready now.</p><p>\u201cRemy . . .\u201d</p><p>Pulsing to bury myself in her, I stretch my body out next to hers and take her in my arms, and whisper against her mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s our official wedding night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She rubs her hands up my chest and looks at me with half-closed eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to make it last.\u201d I press my lips to her several times, without tongue, kissing the corner of her lips, the top, the bottom . . . then the center. \u201cI want to freeze you right here,\u201d I huskily murmur, \u201cin my arms, where nothing can touch you but me.\u201d As I drag my hand down her side, she shudders, letting me pet and kiss her, and she kisses me back with slow, wanton thrusts of her tongue. \u201cNothing, just you,\u201d she agrees.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I rasp.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so wet,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I like it,\u201d I murmur, petting her pussy with my hand before I ease her on top of my body so that she\u2019s splayed above me and I can kiss her and grab her ass, and feel her pussy close to my cock while I have that juicy ass clenched in my hands and our mouths won\u2019t leave the other alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grows restless as we kiss and starts rocking her body, and I roll her to the side so I can ease a hand between our bodies and pet her pussy over her panties. I kiss her shoulder, then go downward, up the rise of one breast, to a puckered pink nipple. I drag my tongue out to lick it, then I head down to her navel and taste every inch of skin I can, feeling how her abdomen rises and falls as she pants but lets me do whatever I want with her.</p><p>She buries her face in my hair as I nuzzle and lick her belly button, and she grabs a rose petal and drags it over my shoulder, silken smooth as she trails it over the muscles of my back. Rising, I grab another fistful of petals and drag both hands over her body, so she feels all of them against her. \u201cI love you,\u201d she says, looking into my eyes, watching me cup her face. \u201cI know,\u201d I rasp. \u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>Our bodies are so hot, we\u2019re perspiring and damp as we keep petting. She knows each of my muscles, but it always feels like she\u2019s memorizing me. I know every inch of her body, but I want to live in every inch, kiss, lick, eat, bite, every inch.</p><p>I do, and then she\u2019s writhing and fisting her hands in my hair, mewing, \u201cI\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you are,\u201d I murmur, and I seize her by the waist and I drag her down to my erection, watching the little pulse flutter at the base of her throat as she takes me. Groaning, I duck to dip my tongue into the crevice at the bottom of her throat as the head of my cock goes in.</p><p>The breath ripples out of her lips, and she grips my biceps and mews softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d I rasp.</p><p>\u201cI like everything you do to me.\u201d</p><p>I lower my head and bite her near her shoulder, the sweet, smooth curves of her bottom in the cup of my hand as she slides lower and lower. She tries to go down the last inch, and I stop and lift her so I can lick her nipple.</p><p>I give it a good, long lick, then I blow air over the puckered tip. Her eyes pop open in surprise, and she shivers and starts rocking against me. \u201cRemington,\u201d she pleads, tilting her hips to my erection.</p><p>I roll her over to her back. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Cheeks flushed with arousal, her eyes are brilliant gold. \u201cI want my husband,\u201d she says, sliding her fingers up my pecs. \u201cRight now. All of him.\u201d</p><p>I take her legs and part them open as I bend over, the damp spot between her legs driving me wild. But first I move my mouth down her thigh to kiss the scar on her knee, then I work my mouth back up. \u201cYou want his cock but what about his tongue.\u201d My mouth hovers above her pussy and I lick the damp spot.</p><p>She gasps my name and grips the back of my head, cupping me. \u201cYes,\u201d she breathes, moaning.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want it,\u201d I murmur, and I slide a finger into her panties and then into her sex while I roll her clit with the tip of my tongue, nothing but that thin, wet fabric between us. Her folds are slick and swollen. I insert one finger, then two, as I push my tongue over her clit. She comes and drenches my fingers, and I pull them out and make her suck them.</p><p>With a hungry noise, she pushes me onto my back. I fall willingly and pull her on top of me. Her thighs straddle mine and she moans at the contact of our skin. She rubs her sex against my dick through the underwear and caresses her fingers up my chest. I groan and sit up to squeeze her breasts in my hand, a primal nature to conquer and roll her around and fuck her coursing through me, winning over. I roll her over, then reach between us to play with her pussy as I lick one nipple. She tastes as good as she fucking smells, and I bury my head in her neck and inhale as her thighs spread wide beneath my weight, and I hold her lingerie open so I can tease her folds with the head of my cock.</p><p>She moans again and rocks her hips. \u201cOh yes.\u201d Her legs spread wider open beneath me, hot and inviting. She tilts her hips and sinks her nails into the flesh of my back. \u201cRemy,\u201d she tells me in my ear, reverently, as if I\u2019m her god and this, us, here, is our real church.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re mating all night,\u201d I tell her, looking into her face and rubbing the head of my cock along the fleshy part of her lips.</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d she agrees.</p><p>Gripping the lace between her legs, I rip open her panties. \u201cI\u2019m coming inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I pull her arms up and shove up inside. \u201cInside my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she pants against my ear, thrashing as I fill her. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Pinning her down by the hips, I groan and start moving in her, our bodies hot, slicked with sweat. She moans, I groan and pulse inside her, our bodies moving together, fast and hungry for more, slapping as she tilts her hips upward and I push downward, wanting as close as I can get.</p><p>I tongue her ear, her neck, then her nipples, one at a time, my hands rasping up her sides, her fingers gripping me closer, her lips in my ear as we lose it, out of control.</p><p>I love you, she gasps</p><p>No, fuck, no, I love you.</p><p>She thrashes and shudders beneath me, coming fast and hard, and as her pussy clenches my cock, I start ejaculating inside her, clenching my arms around her shaking body and letting her take me with her. I growl softly in her neck, biting the curve of her neck as I go off inside her for a third time, and she moans in pleasure until we\u2019re both panting and sated, my tongue rubbing out the spot I just bit.</p><p>I shift to spare her my weight when she whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t pull out. Please. I need you in me.\u201d</p><p>I roll to my back and bring her with me, and she sighs and cuddles, catching her breath while I slide my hands down her body and to her ass. I nudge her head back with my nose, murmuring, \u201cI still want you,\u201d and when she looks up, I take her mouth and start kissing her, using my hands on her ass to start rocking her over my cock.</p><p>With a guttural sound in her throat, she grabs my hair and pushes her tongue hungrily against mine, starting to ride me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby,\u201d I croon, grabbing her hips and moving her on me, sucking her tongue, nipping at her bottom lip. \u201cThat\u2019s right, take me, ride me, show me how much you need me.\u201d</p><p>She sits back and rides me harder, and I rise up to feast on her tits and clench her ass cheeks as she moves recklessly on me. \u201cRemy,\u201d she gasps, and I know she\u2019s close. She\u2019s hot and wet and tight as fuck around me, and I groan as my body tightens and the pleasure gathers at the base of my spine.</p><p>I stick my tongue into her mouth with a heavy groan, and we kiss and caress each other until we come. When she sags against me, she keeps me inside her and tucks her face into my neck, and I bury my nose into her hair and smell her. We don\u2019t speak for some time, but we don\u2019t need to. I know her, and she knows me. I\u2019m inside her, and she\u2019s wrapped around me. Our bodies say it loud and clear.</p><p>We lay in bed for a while, quiet. Brooke alternates between kissing my throat and teasing a fingertip round and around my nipple, while I smell her hair and neck, and quietly pet my little firecracker.</p><p>PRESENT</p><p>SEATTLE</p><p>Brooke</p><p>I wake up snuggled into his hard body the next morning, and he smells like he does, and he makes me feel like he does, and I realize I still haven\u2019t shown him his wedding present. My tummy grips with nerves and excitement when I remember I haven\u2019t showed him my wedding present. Butterflies.</p><p>He always gives them to me.</p><p>I feel like a virgin every, single, time, he touches me, and kisses me, and makes love to me.</p><p>Quietly and with a chest overflowing with happiness, I look up to find him with his eyes closed, but a smile on his lips. I smile because I know he\u2019s awake . . . as relaxed as I am. \u201cMr. Remington Tate, you got yourself married yesterday,\u201d I whisper as I run my fingers up the hard muscles of his tan chest, up the thick tendons of his throat, his scruffy jaw, those beautiful dimples, teasing past the closed eyes, and to the standing-up ends of his spiky black hair, caressing him quietly while inwardly I\u2019m swooning.</p><p>Watching him waiting for me at the altar yesterday, as I walked slowly\u2014painfully slowly\u2014up to him in my father\u2019s arms when all I wanted was to run; he took my breath away.</p><p>Remington in a black tuxedo, his hair as dark and spiky as ever, his broad shoulders filling his jacket, fitted to his narrow waist and hips, and the way those dancing blue eyes watched me as I walked up to him . . .</p><p>Nothing existed as I stared into his eyes. Nothing ever exists for me when I stare into those eyes. It\u2019s not the color, or the hue, it\u2019s what I see in them. Every marvelous, complex thing that makes up Remy.</p><p>\u201cOur baby will be six months soon, and you still give me butterflies,\u201d I whisper quietly.</p><p>He\u2019s a man. He might not know about butterflies, but I know enough for the both of us. And I\u2019ve got a zoo full of them right now as he opens his eyes and looks at me. With those same blue eyes I want to stare at all day.</p><p>He angles his head to mine and feathers a kiss across my lips, and warmth surges through my being as his rough, delicious voice ripples through me, \u201cYou\u2019re mine. My obsession. My dreams. My hope. My heart,\u201d he whispers, his rough hands running up the sides of my body like they did all night.</p><p>\u201cTell me I\u2019m your Real again, Remington,\u201d I plead, trailing my fingers up his jaw as he looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my Real, little firecracker. You\u2019re my everything.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tightens when I remember the song he played me. The suite still smells of roses. I\u2019ve heard the guys banter with him, telling him to get me something other than roses, something less old-fashioned. He won\u2019t budge. He doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks about it, only what he believes they mean, and he uses them to talk to me. To tell me he loves me.</p><p>Remington is big on actions, even if he might not know it. He\u2019s always proving, in so many ways, who he is, and what he feels. And I\u2019ve done something . . . that I hope talks to him. Just like his roses and his songs talk to me.</p><p>Tummy clenching in anticipation, I turn to the nightstand and get one of my hair bands, which I tie around my wrist when I don\u2019t use it to pull my hair in a ponytail. \u201cWill you help me put this on?\u201d I ask, passing it back as an excuse.</p><p>He sits up and lifts my hair, and I love how he lifts my hair with one hand while apparently trying to figure out how to use it with the other.</p><p>Then the movements stop, and a complete silence falls.</p><p>I hold my breath as he sets my hair band down on the mattress, and then he brushes my hair aside to reveal the back of my neck with both hands. Ever so slowly, slowly seducing my body, my mind, and my heart, like only he can, he traces the curve of my nape with the rough pad of one of his fingers.</p><p>Delicious tingles run through my body as he lowers his dark head to my neck, the deep male pleasure in his voice unmistakable. \u201cWhat\u2019s this,\u201d he murmurs, licking it softly.</p><p>I feel his tongue rasp over my skin, and my heart flutters for him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it\u2019s on, it means it\u2019s yours,\u201d I breathe. He buries his head in the side of my throat and smells me, murmuring, \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d then he turns me around by the chin so he can take my mouth and kiss me, long and hard. Remington Tate. My love, my husband, my baby\u2019s beautiful father, kissing me gently as his fingers trace the tattoo on the back of my neck that says simply </p> </body></html>"]
